      <P>asked the Taoiseach the steps, if any, his Department has taken to establish the task force promised under An Action Programme for the Millennium to investigate the introduction of a basic income scheme.  [22736/97]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on the issue of basic income within two years.  The social partners are also committed in Partnership 2000 to carrying out an independent appraisal of the concept and the full implications of introducing a basic income payment for all citizens, taking into account the work of the ESRI, CORI and the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare.</P>
      <P>In line with these commitments a working group on basic income has been established under the auspices of my Department to examine how the issue should be dealt with.  The working group, having reviewed the material available on basic income, has developed terms of reference for a study whose findings will assist the group in progressing its work.  The study, to be undertaken by independent consultants, will commence shortly and it is envisaged it will be completed by the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáilte romhat ar ais tar éis na Nollag. The commitment in the programme for Government to examine the concept of a guaranteed basic income is welcome.  I stress the urgency of consideration of that matter.  How many times has the task force met?  Will the report which the Taoiseach said will be published in the autumn deal with the labour force implications as well as the fiscal implications of a basic income, two aspects of the remit of the task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force has met five times and has held a seminar and a number of open days.  The intention is that by the autumn the working group will have evaluated economic and social developments and considered the labour force issues, the displacement factors involved and what should be done regarding the tax and welfare system.  It will examine in detail <Col N="3" /> the CORI report which suggested fixed amounts of over £70 for adults and £21 for children.  It is not a question of the group evaluating matters from a green field.  A considerable amount of assessment has taken place and it will continue from there.  An independent evaluation of the impact of such a system needs to be carried out at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the concept of a basic income is diametrically opposed to the tax policy of the Government in that a basic income would involve an increase in the basic rate of tax to fund direct cash payments to the people?  Does he agree, therefore, there is a philosophic contradiction in the Government commissioning a report on something which is directly contrary to its declared tax policies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may believe we should not bother examining these matters but we believe there is merit in doing so.  We also believe it is worth examining the tax credits issue. We must determine if it is fairer than the present system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the issues that need to be implemented to make it fairer.  There is a lot of merit in examining the question of tax credits and a basic income.  Only loose studies have been carried out on those issues and the bodies who carried them out would appreciate if the matter were followed through.  The commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium and Partnership 2000 will be followed through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a particular definition of basic income being put forward for the working group examining the terms of reference?  Will a study be carried out on the likely change in attitudes that would result from the introduction of a basic income?  We know from experience that once payments are made attitudes to work and income tend to shift.  Will such a study be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Work will be undertaken in two phases.  During the first phase the cost and distribution of a basic income will be examined and during the second phase the dynamic effects of such a system from a broad economic and social perspective will be examined.  In terms of definition, the working group has been examining CORI's suggestion which has been researched in recent years.  The study will assess and explore the short and long-term budgetary implications of introducing a basic income, the taxation provisions necessary to finance it, its effect on labour markets, industrial policy, poverty and economic growth and the gender dimension involved.  There will be a broad examination of the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the people carrying out the study have specific regard for the impact of such a system on the free movement of residents and workers within the Single Market of the European Union?  Will that element of the study be included in the terms of reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is, but I will make sure that is the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is crucial that study will be genuine and not simply an exercise to buy time?  Does he accept that the Clark and Healy study and the Nevin study on basic income conclude that if it were introduced the top 30 per cent of earners would lose and the remainder would gain?  This would be the direct inverse of the effect of the Government's budget in that under the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats budget the top 30 per cent of income earners gained most while those at the lower end of the income distribution gained least.  The adoption of a basic income would involve a complete and welcome reversal of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats tax policy.  Is the Taoiseach saying he can pursue two contradictory tax policies at once?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that, because I disagree with the Deputy's analysis of the last budget.  The tables produced show that people on low incomes will receive increases of up to 11 per cent in some cases when the family income supplement is taken into account, and 5.5 per cent to 7 per cent in many other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>They gained less than others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>How much did the Taoiseach gain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's analysis is entirely incorrect.  Despite Deputy Bruton not wishing me to carry out this study, I believe it will be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will require a new Government to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Only Democratic Left was in favour of it in the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that the basic income scheme would assist the lower paid and that is in its favour.  The perception that it is to be paid for by a hike in income tax is shortsighted and wrong.  Will the report include the element of tax reform needed to move the burden of tax from labour to <Col N="5" /> resources, as per the advice of the EU Commission and bodies such as the ESRI, so that the issue is not killed off by those who are against viewing the world of work and the evolving economy in a new way?  Will the Taoiseach consider the two phases he spoke of being conducted in parallel so that when the first phase is produced it is not subject to the vitriol of those who would speculate on the second phase, without having the information to which the second phase might give rise?  The two phases merit being dealt with in parallel to give as complete a picture as possible of the impact and merits of basic income when the report is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's points.  The working group comprises all the social partners and the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The papers mentioned will be taken into account by the working group &mdash; the CORI and ESRI evaluations and the evaluation on tax credits.  I am not sure how it will take its work forward but I will raise the Deputy's suggestion. The working group will also take into account the valuable work done over a number of years by the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare.  All of the ingredients enabling a comprehensive examination of this issue are on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware the study prepared by Fr. Seán Healy and Professor Clark for CORI advocating a basic income concludes that there has to be a tax rate on all income, except the basic income, of between 44 per cent and 50 per cent to pay for it?  How does the Taoiseach reconcile that with his tax policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are endeavouring to honour commitments to comprehensively examine issues which the social partners and many organisations believe are worth evaluating to see if a fairer system of tax distribution can be devised without making the tax system more complex and cumbersome to the point where it fails to deliver the distribution targets set out in the document.  I have met and discussed the matter with Fr. Healy and his colleagues on a number of occasions over the years and as Leader of the Opposition I also took part in studies with them on the subject.</P>
      <P>All those who have looked at this issue, whether it be the ESRI, CORI or the working group on tax and social welfare, are aware there is no easy resolution to major changes in the tax system.  When Deputy Bruton as Taoiseach was involved in negotiating Partnership 2000 he gave a commitment that we would examine all of these issues to see what conclusions and policies for implementation could be agreed.  That is what I am doing.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the opportunity to address the board of the National Centre for Partnership on 4 December and will arrange circulation of the press release issued on that date. The main points I discussed with the board were: the role of the centre in supporting partnership in the private and public sectors; the importance of partnership at the level of the workplace in helping to secure competitiveness, viability and prosperity in enterprise and also in helping to realise expectations that the partnership approach has benefits for all involved; the public service change programme and its implementation in helping to secure sustainable growth by modernising and redefining the relationship between Government, market and citizens; and the overall and immediate work programme for the centre which includes identifying and disseminating &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;, monitoring developments and facilitating training and development.</P>
      <P>I assured the board of the Government's continued support for its work and I wished it well for the future.  At my meeting with ICTU on Monday, 26 January it was agreed special priority would be given to the work of the National Centre for Partnership over the coming months in view of the contribution of social partnership to the development of the Irish economy over the past ten years.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider the approach taken by management in the Ryanair dispute is consistent with the partnership approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that relevant to the question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try again.  Does the Taoiseach believe the approach taken by management of Ryanair, which is represented by IBEC on the partnership body to which he referred, is consistent with the partnership approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. However, we believe the involvement of the industrial mechanisms of the State to try to assist in the resolution of that dispute is the best way forward and is one we support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe it is consistent with partnership to refuse to recognise <Col N="7" /> a union representing a group of workers who wish to be represented by a union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The best approach is the partnership approach where union, management and workers are together.  On some issues there are major conflicts where some staff opt to recognise unions while others do not.  Those issues have to be resolved.  The Government is endeavouring to come to an agreement with IBEC and the Council of Trade Unions to work out a formula where the recognition issue in all employments will be dealt with and the dispute mechanism would deal with it.  It is entirely unhelpful and regrettable when these issues get to the stage of industrial disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach is not suggesting it is the approach taken by the staff in Ryanair that is resulting in this recognition dispute? Is it not the position taken by management? The question has to do with partnership in the workplace and the Taoiseach's Department is promoting a centre for partnership in the workplace. This is one area where this matter is at issue.  The question is relevant and one on which I would expect the Taoiseach to be briefed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows I am well briefed on these issues and is aware also of their sensitivity.  It is not entirely helpful from the point of view of the workers or the management that the matter be turned into a political football on the floor of the House.  In respect of all the issues dealing with building partnership it is far better that the industrial mechanisms of the State are used.  In cases of difficulty in companies such as those mentioned by the Deputy, we are endeavouring to find a way of resolving these disputes with the social partners.  I have always strongly advocated that the wishes of the social partners and workers should be accommodated by management whenever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if on 4 December he expressed a general view, in the course of meeting the various social partners and the board of the National Centre for Partnership, on trade union membership and the recognition of trade unions in areas where workers had elected to have trade unions represent them in a professional way?  Did he address that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did and reiterated my view that we have to try to get a national framework for dealing with these issues.  In the past decade there have been a number of serious disputes in sectors of the economy where the recognition issue has been the only area of disagreement.  At that meeting, at some subsequent discussions and at a launch of a presentation last week with the MSF union I again stated it is an area where we need to get an understanding.  The Deputy will <Col N="8" /> acknowledge that in getting an understanding we need to carry both sides of industry with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is highly desirable that the Government exercise leadership in this area and call on employers' representatives to encourage all employers, in the spirit of partnership, to recognise trade unions where a group of workers employed by them voluntarily ask to have a trade union represent them to maximise their position and to represent them professionally? Will he agree that the responsibility of leadership rests first and foremost with the Taoiseach, in whose Department the board of the National Centre for Partnership is located, and employer organisations who cannot have a two-way bet where they get a free ride on the discipline of the trade union movement within the social partnership on the one hand and at the same time refuse in individual companies to recognise the basic right of workers to be professionally represented in negotiating terms of conditions and pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has put forward its proposals in the working group.  A draft document was produced before Christmas and it received much support.  Because of recent difficulties it has not been possible to finalise it. Within areas of the private sector people are expressing strong views.  In recent weeks the Tánaiste and I have spelled out our views about the dispute mentioned which is ongoing but it is not the only one.  The Deputy is correct, all companies have reaped the benefits of a decade of social partnership, regardless of whether they have signed up to collective agreements.  Many companies negotiate with their staff.  On most occasions they negotiate far more lucrative arrangements and conditions.  This is acknowledged by the trade union movement, although it may not like it.  The difficulty is that there are companies where conditions are not in line with the national norm or practice.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Did the Taoiseach express the view to the board that workers have a fundamental right to join a trade union and that the management side should be compelled by law to negotiate?  Will he consider introducing legislation in that regard?  Will he also take the opportunity to increase the pressure on management in Ryanair by blowing them out of the water, politically, for adopting disgraceful and intimidatory tactics against young workers in the baggage handling area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Government is endeavouring to do &mdash; this is not confined to trade union recognition in the partnership company &mdash; is ensure staff have freedom to join a trade union if they wish to do so.  We are not in the business of legislating for it; as I am sure the Deputy is aware, it is not included on the Government's legislative programme or likely to be. Where there are disputes there has to be intervention. There are labour laws and mechanisms in place.  That is how these issues should be dealt with, complex though they are.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The NESC report No. 102 on population distribution and economic development was published on 19 December last.  Its analysis of population distribution patterns in Ireland, and the assessment of consequent policy implications, are matters which deserve thorough consideration.  The report is set within the framework of how public policy can effectively achieve and sustain a high level of national economic and social development, while at the same time bringing about an equitable geographical distribution of the benefits. It concludes that competitive advantage has been achieved in certain areas, principally the eastern region, but that advantage has not been mirrored to the same extent elsewhere.  In particular, it finds that counties Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim and Cavan remain on the margins of the urbanisation process, thereby enduring relative disadvantage in economic development.  Consequently, the NESC recommends special area-based measures for these counties, which would take due account of local conditions and resources in policy development and implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> As a first step, the report has been referred to relevant Ministers and Government Departments for their deliberation.  Having regard to the wide range of policy areas covered by the NESC analyses and recommendations, it is likely to be some time before the implications can be fully assessed. This is a matter which will receive the closest attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Higgins's Question No. 6, the report was submitted to my Department in December and considered by the Government on 19 December, the earliest date possible.  It was published by the NESC on the same day.  I understand the council was anxious to publish the report before the end of 1997.</P>
    <P>Regarding the NESC study of private sector investment in Ireland, this has now been completed and will be published in early February.</P>

      <P>In regard to the report on population distribution, will the Taoiseach agree that it contains startling information about the way in which our society is concentrating in certain major cities while other parts of the country, notably the north-west and west, are being denuded of population and that this is having very serious effects in terms of social life, connection with families, traffic, crime and a whole range of problems? Will the Taoiseach agree that while the report is extremely good on analysis, the recommendations it makes are vague?  Will he agree also that it would be a good idea, in addition to referring the matter to Ministers and so forth, which I commend, to refer the report back to the NESC and ask it to make specific and radical detailed practical recommendations on what should be done rather than the jargon-laden and obscure findings at the end of the report under the heading &ldquo;Policy Implications&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report which gives a good analysis of what has been happening over the past 46 or 47 years from a geographic and demographic point of view.  It shows the ebbs and flows of population in various counties and regions over that time.  It requires in-depth analysis and perhaps the Deputy is right when he says it might require further analysis leading to recommendations. Primarily I want the Departments to examine the report quickly to see how we should implement policy into the future.  A number of initiatives are already under way.  The Western Development Commission is already ahead on many of these issues.  It has pre-empted much of the analysis and that is useful.  The INTERREG, rural resettlement and local development programmes are doing that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important issue highlighted in the report is that Mayo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Cavan have peculiar difficulties which must be separately addressed.  It indicates also that the population in 19 counties increased in recent times.  It also contains the surprising statistic that the eastern region only stabilised its population in 1981 and <Col N="11" /> it has increased by about 1 per cent in the past 15 years.  That is not in line with the commonly held view or, indeed, my view.  We must now examine a range of initiatives to move this matter forward. The Government has already decided, based on the recent increased inward investment, to do everything possible to move much of that investment and offer incentives in a way that will shift the balance towards regional areas.  The Government has also commenced the preparation of a White Paper on rural development which will be used in the context of the next round of CAP discussions taking into account not just agriculture but rural development in the broadest sense including education, industry and infrastructure. That will be useful in the discussions.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the map in this report clearly shows that the majority of people south-east of a line from Dublin to Limerick have experienced a major increase in income and the majority of people north and west of that line have experienced the reverse? Will the Taoiseach consider my suggestion and refer this report back to the NESC, which has all the relevant social partners as its members, and tell it that it has produced a good analysis but we would like more specific recommendations?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already stated to the Deputy, I am not ruling out discussing that matter with the NESC but its analysis has been useful in terms of moving forward departmental policy and the implementation of that policy.  That is the only point I am making.  We will continue to work on this.  I am not against what the Deputy suggested. If there were clearer recommendations they might be included in the rural development programme.  In the next round of Structural Funds and Common Agricultural Policy renegotiations, whatever the downside of some of those negotiations may be, it is clear that there is an opportunity in economic and social policy to try to improve the lot of some of these regions in the way we implement our policies.  I am not ruling out asking NESC to do that, but there is much we can do based on the information we have been given.</P>

      <P>In relation to the four counties mentioned in the NESC report and a recent report to the Border regional authority, two of the six Border counties which are named in the NESC report have experienced the least decline in unemployment coupled with a frightening decrease in population.  Will the Taoiseach consider setting up a task force to immediately spearhead industrial development in that region?  More importantly, what approach will the Government adopt to ensure that region retains objective one status for the next tranche of Structural Funds?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's first question, the Government referred the report and, in particular, <Col N="12" /> its reference to the counties I mentioned previously, including Cavan, to all the Government agencies for a comprehensive examination. All issues in the report will be examined on that basis.  Discussions have commenced on the best strategy to follow.  The island has had objective one status and as we move forward we will make whatever decisions are to the best advantage.  We have prepared figures on an island and on a regional basis and we will consider the best way to proceed in those negotiations.  The Border regions are of particular concern and we will make sure that under Structural and Cohesion Funds and any other funds, whether under INTERREG, Leader or other projects, we will continue to gain the maximum moneys possible for those regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Will the Taoiseach agree that this document confirms once again, on top of the mountain of research and documentation on this, that effectively those regions and, in particular, those counties are dying?  Apart from the unequal distribution of income manifest in the document, there has been a wholesale wiping out of townlands.  In the region of 1,500 townlands have been completely wiped out.  A startling statistic is that in the past 45 years the population of Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Mayo has declined by 20 per cent.  The document acknowledges that whatever about the Celtic tiger and the general upsurge in national incomes and welfare largesse, these regions have not benefited to any significant extent.</P>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach spoke about deliberation and I appreciate that time will be afforded to study the contents of the document.  However, what is happening about the £100 million investment package agreed in principle by the previous Government?  What is happening about the designation of Knock Airport approved by the previous Government and brought into force under the Finance Bill?  What is happening about major road and rail projects omitted from the national plan?  I speak of the Dublin-Westport line, the Dublin-Ballina line and the Claremorris-Knock bypass.  What village in Ireland other than Knock can boast an influx of approximately 1.5 million tourists annually?  Yet provision of a much needed bypass was omitted from the national plan.  What is happening about tax incentive schemes for smaller towns?  Is the Government prepared to accept that smaller areas could be clustered into units to work in a cohesive way and obtain the type of tax incentives that have benefited Temple Bar and other regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's questions cover almost every ministry.  I thank the Deputy for giving credit to the wise decisions of my predecessors on Knock Airport and on designating areas and seeking to extend that scheme.  The infrastructural programmes should continue to develop.  As the Deputy is aware &mdash; he will have an opportunity soon to support measures in the <Col N="13" /> Finance Bill &mdash; the budget contained increased tax incentives for the Shannon region and Border and western counties for tourism and leisure facilities.  The resources which will be provided from European funds are substantial.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware also from demographics that some towns in his county are becoming wealthy.  However, unfortunately, he is correct that villages and townlands have been wiped out in the 47 years covered by the report. We must continue to address rural and regional imbalances.  Much work has been done in that regard in the past ten years.  Regional airports have been established and areas have been designated under various schemes by different Governments.  Educational institutions have been developed and more industries have been located in less populated areas.  All these decisions are useful, but more must be done.</P>
      <P>As I stated, the eastern region has not expanded as much as has been suggested.  It is not in the country's interest that it expand.  It is better in terms of balance that more people live in rural areas than large towns.  The Government will continue to develop these policy initiatives and will pursue them in the White Paper on rural development later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This and other reports show that if policies developed between the 1950s and 1970s, when matters stabilised, continued to be implemented, a position would be reached in 20 or 30 years where there would be a relatively small number of centres in this small country.  That is not a good policy to follow. We should endeavour for environmental, agricultural, social and economic reasons to do our utmost to ensure balance in the development of the country.  There are many good arguments why this should happen for the benefit of people in cities and rural areas.  I am committed to this and my policy initiatives are the way to deal with it.</P>

      <P>The main thrust of the study was to define settlement patterns for the weakening west.  The Taoiseach dismissed the role of western development and renewal.  Does the Taoiseach accept that it is time to review this matter?  A new appointment should be made in his Department to carry on the good work done by the NESC study.  Proposals must be brought forward.  The Taoiseach did not reply positively when Deputy Bruton asked for further studies.  Will the Taoiseach reconsider his decision?</P>

Regarding western development and the Western Development Commission, I was very supportive of all their initiatives when Minister for Finance and have continued to be since taking office.  Deputy Bruton did not ask me to seek additional reports.  He asked me to send this report back for recommendations.  I did not rule out his suggestion that more and clearer recommendations are required.</P>
      <P>Not every county highlighted in the report is a western county.  Clare, Galway and parts of other counties fare extremely well in the report.  It is a useful study, and I commend Deputy Carey's initiative when in power.  The report mentions 19 counties and gives the lie to much recent exaggeration. It helps us to focus on areas with which we must deal and I will be doing my part in that regard.</P>

      <P>Is the NESC to be put on a statutory basis?  If so, when?  This was mentioned before Christmas.  Deputy De Rossa alluded to the fact that the planning tribunal arose out of intense pressure for rezoning in the eastern part of the country.  In redressing that imbalance, does the Taoiseach take into account the need to support rural resettlement?  This arises in the context of implications and proposals that should be copperfastened. Rural resettlement agencies have operated tirelessly, and often voluntarily, to facilitate the re-population of many townlands and villages seeking to retain small schools and post offices.

However, there is a population cutoff of 6,000 people for towns qualifying for those schemes, and counties such as Leitrim, Roscommon and Cavan, that do not have any towns of that size, have missed out.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say more on this issue than I have already said many times.  The Informal ECOFIN last September agreed there will be a pre-announcement of bilateral exchange rates of the currencies of the participating member states at the same time as the participants in EMU are decided and announced, in the first weekend of May 1998.</P>
      <P>As regards the Irish pound, I said many times that the Government's intention is that Ireland joins EMU at an exchange rate that meets the needs of the economy and that between now and decision day we will keep the issue under active review.  Obviously the final decision will take account of all the elements, including inflation and overall competitiveness, which contribute to the balanced development of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that our exchange rate is now the only one where there is a significant divergence between the spot rate at which it is trading and the central ERM rate, and that all the currencies of the other ten member states who intend joining in EMU are hugging their central rate?  Does he realise that he is now seriously out of line and that in the past two weeks his Italian colleague and his Finnish colleague, who were trading away from the central rate, expressed a preference for a rate at which their currencies should lock in and the markets moved down to that preferred rate?  The Minister's position is downright silly and out of line with the practice among all his colleagues in Europe.  Why does he continue to insist on saying nothing until the second week in May and allow speculators to decide the value of the Irish pound when ten of his colleagues across Europe have already indicated domestically to their money markets the rate at which they are going to lock in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that the Irish pound has been an out-lier regarding its central rate for a long time.  However, he is incorrect in his assumption that central rates will necessarily be used for the bilateral exchange rates to be announced on the first weekend in May.  No decision has been made about that.  At the informal ECOFIN Council last September it was decided that when the rates at which member states will be joining EMU are decided upon on the first weekend in May, the bilateral exchange rates between the participating members and their method of announcement will also be announced.  There has been speculation as to the method, but no agreement has been reached.  Furthermore, the bilateral exchange rates must be decided unanimously by the member states.  One cannot just decide on a rate and go in at that rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course no decision has been made because the <i>de jure</i> decision will be made on the second weekend in May.  Is the Minister aware that the <i>de facto</i> position is that his ten <Col N="18" /> other colleagues have taken up positions on the lock-in rate of their currencies and, as late as two weeks ago, his Finnish and Italian colleagues publicly expressed a preference rate and the markets moved to that rate?  It is as clear as crystal that we are the only people who do not know at what rate we are going in.  The Minister is abrogating his responsibility because, in the final analysis, he is responsible for the rate at which we lock in.  By not giving an indication of that rate he is causing speculation in the market and he is being unfair to people who are involved in export and import activities where the rate at which we lock in is becoming increasingly relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be signalling a rate at which he would like to lock in. It would be totally irresponsible to signal my intentions in any way and, as I said previously, the matter of bilateral exchange rates is one that must be unanimously decided by the member states.  It is not just a matter of waking up one morning and deciding to go in at a rate one likes.  There are unique circumstances relating to the exchange rate of the Irish pound.  For example, in May 1995 sterling traded at a rate to the Deutschmark of 2.17. Today it is trading at a rate of 2.94-2.95DM. On occasion it has reached a rate of 3DM and more.  The value of the Irish pound during this period has been dragged up by sterling and this has put us far outside our central rate.</P>
      <P>To put it another way, there has been so much volatility in the exchange rate markets for a long time that if decisions had been made when some people wanted them made we would be in a peculiar position today.  To repeat what I said, I will make a decision taking the overall interests of the economy fully into account.  This means taking into account many of the legitimate points raised by the Deputy both inside and outside the House. However, it would be totally irresponsible for a Minister for Finance to say what rate he preferred at any particular time.  As I said on many occasions, all factors will be taken into account in making this decision, including the need for unanimity between all member states and the decision by the ECOFIN Council last September as to when this will take place.</P>

      <P>The Minister's Hamlet-like procrastination will not impress the markets.  May I ask him again why he will not indicate his preferred rate?  May is not very far away and all his colleagues in Europe have indicated their rate.  If he leaves it any longer to make a decision it will be the speculators who will decide the value of the Irish pound, not the Government advised by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister is shirking his responsibility.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's point.  The first weekend in May is a little over three months away.  Various commentators wanted me to announce the rate as far back as <Col N="19" /> last July but I did not do so.  The policy I have adopted of not giving the market an indication of the rate is the correct one, and history will prove this to be so.  The mechanism has been in place for some time and it is the one I will follow.</P>
      <P>There was always going to be volatility in the currency exchange markets.  When Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance I debated with him on many occasions the inevitable volatility in the markets in the run up to EMU on 1 January l999 which would require them to take a position one way or the other.  That is the job of the financial markets and it is not the job of the Minister for Finance to encourage them in a certain direction. They must make their decisions as best they can. It is their job to make money but it is not my job to assist them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My budget day forecast for inflation was 2 per <Col N="20" /> cent for l998 and l999.  This forecast was based on the standard assumptions of unchanged exchange and interest rates.  In projecting inflation for l998 and l999, account was taken of macro-economic factors such as current low international inflation and increased competition in the economy.  There are no forecasts in respect of individual projects. The next forecast, which will take account of all relevant circumstances, will, as usual, be published by my Department at mid-year in the Economic Review and Outlook publication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister predicted an inflation rate of 2 per cent for each of the next three years.  However, he will be aware that independent commentators have predicted much higher rates of up to 4.5 or 5 per cent for l998 and l999.  Will he agree there would be a distinct danger to Partnership 2000 if the inflationary predictions on which it was predicated were exceeded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Partnership 2000 was predicated on an average inflation rate of 2.1 per cent over the period of the agreement.  The out-turn for inflation for l997 is 1.5 per cent, the lowest in the European Union.  Using the harmonised index, which is known as the HICP and which will be used in the future after we have fully joined EMU, the rate is 1.2 per cent, which again is the lowest in the European Union.  The out-turn for l997, the first year of the agreement, is 0.6 per cent, which is lower than the average for the period.</P>
      <P>The outlandish predictions by some business people of increases in inflation this year do not accord with the facts.  It is obvious that some business people want to use the excuse of volatility in the exchange rate markets to jack up prices.  This matter has been elucidated in recent reasoned comment.  Many people do not take into account the effect of the problems in Asia on inflation in this part of the world.  I see no reason at this stage to change the forecasts for inflation announced in the budget.  At that stage the Central Bank estimated that the inflation rate for the year would be 2.25 per cent, while the Economic and Social Research Institute gave an estimate of 2.3 per cent and the European Union gave an estimate for Europe as a whole of 2.2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister's points about the harmonised rate but he knows well that this specifically excludes mortgage repayments and house prices, which are increasing at a rate of approximately 20 per cent. No doubt they will increase further as a result of some of the actions taken by the Minister in the budget, specifically the reduction in the rate of CGT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister saying that, notwithstanding our extraordinary growth rates, the level of consumer spending and emerging labour shortages in some sections of the economy, he does not expect an <Col N="21" /> increase in the inflation rate over and above the 2 per cent predicted in his Budget Statement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The forecast may have to be revised mid-year but I see no reason at this stage to revise any of the forecasts in my Budget Statement. Some economists think I do not pay much attention to them &mdash; and maybe I do not in some of my utterances &mdash; but I wish to refer to interesting comments on inflation and the components of the CPI made by Mr. McLoughlin of ABN AMRO which did not receive wide coverage. These comments may be of interest to Members and those who are trying to hype up the level of inflation.  In his market document of 16 January he said:</P>
      <P>Looking at the inflation side, one point to remember is that over 40 per cent of the consumer price index is composed of items whose price is determined by Irish wages and not the exchange rate.  This includes housing, insurance, repairs etc. , services, for example, hairdressing, postage, telephones, transport, shoes and light.  Food and drink account for another 35 per cent and well over half of this will be home grown.  So the direct component of the consumer price index most exposed to the weak punt-sterling rate is durables, clothing and footwear and other goods with a total weight of 16 per cent.</P>
      <P>That is the make up of the consumer price index. While the value of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling has a weighting in the composition of the CPI, it is not as great as some commentators might lead us to believe.  I have never met Dr. McLoughlin nor has he ever communicated with me.  Neither am I given to quoting economists very often; some of them believe I do not listen to them.  However, it is important he elaborated on the composition of the CPI.  It was of interest to me, but I did not see much coverage of it in the national press at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for what the Minister said about the consumer price index, but it is still true that exchange rates have a significant impact on inflation.  The Minister informed the House that his Department estimated at budget time that the rate of inflation for 1998 would be 2 per cent.  When that was compiled, what exchange rate between the Irish pound and sterling was factored in for the second half of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The methodology used by the Department of Finance or other institutions of the State in making economic forecasts is more or less the same.  It is based on the exchange rate at the time of compiling the forecast and the best estimate of what it will be for the rest of the year. <Col N="22" /> The methodology used by the Department of Finance would be based on the rate at the time.</P>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Noonan said.  I am not so naive as to think exchange rates do not have an effect on prices, because they do.  However, there are a number of complexities in this argument. For example, although the Irish pound-sterling exchange rate is weaker than previously, 16 per cent of imports come from Asia.  Due to the weak Asian currencies, it is certain that the lower price of their imports will have a deflationary effect on prices.  A number of balancing factors exist.  Some of the comments made a few weeks ago focused totally on the exchange rate between the Irish pound and sterling.  It is not correct to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget was announced on 3 December 1997.  At that time the Irish pound was trading at DM 2.62 to DM 2.63 and 93p to 94p sterling.  It is now down to 82.5p sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Department of Finance use the exchange rate of 3 December and project it through 1998?  If so, the Minister's 2 per cent inflation estimate has no solid basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Department did not use that rate and decided to use the average for the year in a fluctuating exchange rate market, it must have taken a view when it formed its 2 per cent estimate of what rate the pound would enter EMU in the second weekend in May.  The Minister has two choices.  He can tell us the Department of Finance officials have an entry rate in their heads of which the Irish public is not being informed or, alternatively, he can tell us the Department's 2 per cent inflation estimate does not have great credibility, because it is based on a currency prediction already wildly out of line with what is happening in the markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to 3 December when the budget was announced and before which the forecast was compiled.  On that date, the volatility in exchange rates in the Asian markets was not contemplated by either the Department of Finance or anyone else.  Those factors must be taken into account.  The methodology used by the Department and other institutions takes into account the exchange rate fluctuations up to the date of the compilation of the forecast and also assumes an exchange rate from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the consumer price index is more heavily influenced by the trade weighted index, which is a basket of currencies.  A study of that over the years will give a better insight into inflation than the exchange rate between the Irish pound and sterling because we also trade with many other countries.  However, even the trade weighted index as a measure of what was forecast <Col N="23" /> for Irish inflation in the past four years was incorrect. The index increased one year and fell the next, yet inflation did not follow.  The recent performance of the Irish economy with regard to inflation has confounded all analysts outside Government institutions and within the Department of Finance, the ESRI and other bodies.  The inflation rates the Central Bank predicted for 1996 and 1997 were way above the mark.  We were all wrong.  Something has been happening recently in the Irish economy which does not lend itself to the normal historical and traditional analysis which has been applied.  I wish to point that out because no one has been able to explain some aspects of the Irish economy in recent years, and inflation is definitely one of them.  It has not lent itself to normal analysis.  In conclusion, the effective exchange rate is possibly the better way of examining this matter because it takes into account more than just the exchange rate between the Irish pound and sterling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recommend the Minister to have a quick read of his speech on the budget in January of last year where he spoke of people hyping up inflation.  He made some salient and interesting points in that speech.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Minister said. There is no doubt commentators expected inflation to increase earlier than it has.  However, none of us believe there is a limitless capacity for growth in the economy, and it certainly does not exist for inflation-free growth.  What is the Minister's estimate of the capacity of the economy for growth?  This year it is expected to be 7 per cent gross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy poses an interesting economic question which could be put another way.  Is the Irish economy being utilised to its full capacity?  I do not know, because with the growth rates we have experienced over recent years, traditional economic models would say it should have reached full capacity.  That has not occurred; the Irish economy has grown at an enormous rate.  Using the traditional methodology I was taught when I was at UCD and that Deputy Noonan was also taught at third level, this should have led to some inflation.  It has not, but I suggest that is as a result of much spare capacity which was not thought about or predicted at the time.  The honest answer to Deputy McDowell's question is that I do not know, because some factors in the Irish economy in recent years have confounded all the experts.  The traditional method of measuring the economy was being used.  I accept the points he made about my reply as Opposition spokesperson to the budget speech in early 1997 and previous to that as I also would have been using the traditional economic models.  The Irish economy has not lent itself to the traditional analysis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, as I said before the budget of 1997 in trying to dampen down expectations, there is not a limitless capacity to keep stoking up the fire.  It is better to be cautious, but other factors must also be taken into account.  Much of the success of the Irish economy has been as a result of the trade off between low wage increases and taxation reductions.  Those balances must also be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that things have changed dramatically since budget day and that he will not go to the wall on the 2 per cent prediction issued then because the rate of inflation could be significantly higher due to circumstances having changed dramatically according to him.</P>
      <P>Stoking up, as the Minister describes it, has already begun in terms of asset inflation.  Has he any figures for asset inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this issue as Opposition spokesperson on Finance.  The consumer price index does not measure actual inflation. One must wait until higher mortgages feed into the index.  The expectation is that falling interest rates will have a downward effect on inflation. One country tried and failed to introduce an index in this regard.</P>
      <P>The escalation in house prices has been a worrying feature of recent years.  The danger is that people take out large mortgages and any blip in interest rates places them in difficulty.  This might feed into wage inflation.  Moderate, nominal wage increases have been behind the recent success of the economy.  I cannot say how this can be solved overnight.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has commissioned a study into house prices.  If they continue to rise, inevitably they will lead to wage inflation and we will be back on the merry-go-round which we had managed to get off.  We are continuing to review the situation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of a letter I received yesterday from Commissioner Flynn on behalf of the Commission?  In the letter, the Commissioner reiterates, in the most categorical terms, the position of the Commission and the Council of Ministers that there will be no departure from the decision taken in 1991 when the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, agreed to the abolition of duty free sales.  The Commissioner is taking an extremely tough position.  He is speaking for his own Commissionership and for the Commission as a corporate unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the letter. However, I am not surprised by it.  The Deputy inquired whether I would be influenced by the by-elections.  The terms of reference for the KPMG report were set by my predecessor, Deputy Quinn.  The consultants were appointed by me when I came into office.  It had been expected the report would be concluded by 31 December 1997.  It is now expected that I will receive it within the next month or so.  The delay was because the main union involved wished to make a detailed submission to the consultants. Some other matters had also to be attended to.  I am disposed to publishing the report when I receive it, subject to any issues of financial confidentiality concerning the organisations involved. It is important that we have the correct figures to back up our case.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised by the line the Commission is taking, individually or as a body.  In recent interviews, Commissioner Monti stated that the Commission would bring forward proposals for change over his dead body.  The Commission has steadfastly refused to undertake a study of duty free sales.  Perhaps it is afraid of what such a study might reveal.  The Commission must bring proposals before ECOFIN.  That is the dilemma faced by the Irish and other Governments.  I have pointed this out on previous occasions.  I am not surprised by what Commissioner Flynn has said. He is stating the Commission's position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the estimated cost of the consultants report?  In view of the statement made by Commissioner Flynn on behalf of the Commission and ECOFIN, of which the Minister is a member, is it not an expensive fig leaf if the position is already set in concrete?  The Minister and his colleagues have decided there will be no change.  Effectively, that is what Commissioner Flynn is saying.  He states that the Commission shares the view of the Council.  The Minister is a member of the Council.  It is a case of &lsquo;no surrender&rsquo;, &lsquo;not an inch&rsquo;, no change will be made &mdash; duty free is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report will cost, approximately, £40,000.  Any proposal to change the abolition <Col N="26" /> of duty free sales will have to be made by the Commission.  That is within it's legal remit. Deputy Quinn raised this matter at the ECOFIN Council in December 1996 but there was no support for the Irish position.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, recently raised this matter at Council meetings.  A considerable amount of lobbying is taking place.  The Taoiseach also raised the matter at the Amsterdam Heads of State special summit on employment.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department had meetings with their UK counterparts in the lead up to Britain's EU Presidency with a view to placing the matter high on the UK agenda.  The UK does not regard this a priority matter.  As far as the Commission is concerned, this matter was decided in 1991. Duty free sales will finish on 30 June 1999 and the Commission does not wish to hear any more about it.  The Irish Government has been trying to have this decision reversed by raising it at a number of European fora.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan kindly reminded me of by-elections and elections.  Amazingly, the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, announced the consultants study on 14 May 1997.  Perhaps the Deputy and others could tell me if there was any significance in that date?  Somehow I think an election might have been called that day or the day after.</P>

We have not accepted that 30 June 1999 is a <i>fait accompli.</i>  I have clearly outlined the facts regarding this issue in the House on a number of occasions and the difficulties in having the decision changed.  The leader of the Labour Party experienced similar difficulties as Minister for Finance when he tried to raise this matter.  It is encouraging that across Europe there is a greater appreciation by other member states of the difficulties which the abolition of duty free sales will cause.  This is not a uniquely Irish problem, but not every member state has the same worries about the abolition of duty free facilities because the issue does not concern them to the same extent.  This is a difficulty for Ireland in promoting <Col N="27" /> its case.  Changing the decision would require unanimity.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to put these facts on the record. My predecessor announced the study just before the last election and I appointed the consultants in order to provide documentary evidence with which to present our case.  While previous studies were trade based, this study will be an independent assessment of the issue.</P>

      <P>Do the terms of reference given to the consultants include the issue of job losses? Will the Minister indicate the ultimate extent of job losses at Dublin airport and in the Limerick and Clare region arising directly from the decision of Deputy Bertie Ahern when Minister for Finance to agree to the abolition of duty free sales?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference drawn up by my predecessor to assess the effect of the abolition refer to the impact on Government revenue, on points of entry and carriers, and on the cost of travel.  The study being undertaken by KPMG will address the question of job losses. Everybody knows, including Deputy Rabbitte, that changing the decision will be a mammoth task.  The concession in 1991 which allowed the extension of duty free for a further seven and a half years was meant to provide the last period of operation of the duty free system.  The proof of the Commission's reluctance to make any move on the issue is its refusal to appoint consultants to examine the overall problem.  Presumably it does not want to hear the conclusions of a consultant's report on the issues raised by us. However, when we have the results of our study we will be in a position to provide the Irish assessment.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the Minister said his officials contacted the officials of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  I distinctly remember the Chancellor of the Exchequer stating prior to the British presidency that this issue would not be considered during its presidency.  Obviously, therefore, the lobbying was not very successful.</P>
      <P>The abolition of duty free sales at all airports, especially regional airports such as Farranfore, is a matter of concern to me.  It will put new pressure on the future viability of these airports.  Has consideration been given to any form of compensation or the encouragement of alternative activities? The Minister is indicating that the decision is a <i>fait accompli</i>, something which will come as very depressing news for the management of these airports which are surviving on a shoestring.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell spoke about the decision as being a <i>fait accompli.</i>  I have never spoken about the issue in such terms.  Every effort is being made by the Taoiseach, myself and the Minister for Public Enterprise to have this decision reversed.  We are awaiting the KPMG <Col N="28" /> study which should be of assistance to us in pressing our case.  It will provide an independent assessment of the matters raised by the Deputies. I am sure the study will also address the abolition of duty free as it might affect regional airports such as Farranfore.  I am conscious of the importance of airports to the development of the regions.  We will be able to move forward once we receive the report and outline the Irish position to the EU Commission.</P>

The Minister's reasoning seems to point in different directions from the conclusions he has reached.</P>
      <P>The agreement of the British presidency is necessary if there is any chance of having this matter placed on the agenda.  This is why I am surprised the Minister did not raise this issue directly with the presidency when he had the opportunity to do so last week.  Is the Minister saying he is saving his political capital with the presidency for other issues?</P>

Since coming into power on 26 June we have been making efforts to have this matter revisited.  It was raised by the Taoiseach in his speech at the special heads of Government employment summit. The effort to overturn the decision will be a difficult battle.  Unanimity is necessary and the proposal must come from the Commission. However, there are some encouraging signs in that other member states are more aware of the difficulties posed by the initial decision.  Hopefully, this will allow the matter to return to the agenda of the ECOFIN council.</P>

However, over recent months a number of Ministers with responsibility for transport in other countries, whom Deputy O'Rourke has met at Council meetings, have expressed concern in this regard.  I am hopeful that one of the major member states will have a change of heart <Col N="29" /> on this issue.  This would help in having the issue returned to the agenda.</P>

At that time the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cowen, decided to overfly the airport.

Will he assure me that the KPMG report will deal specifically with the issues concerning Shannon and not just with the global issue on a national basis?</P>

      <P>Let us await the study commissioned by the Deputy's Administration.  It will shortly be available and will allow us place all the facts on the table.  We will be well armed with the independent assessment of the abolition from an Irish perspective and can move forward from there. There is no disagreement in the House regarding this matter.  This Administration, like the last Administration, is anxious to have the decision reversed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>In its Agenda 2000 proposals, the European Commission has proposed that transitional arrangements be put in place for regions which no longer meet the eligibility threshold for Objective 1 funding.  The Government is aiming to negotiate a transition package which will ensure continued access to the Objective 1 funding envelope, albeit on a diminishing scale, during the next financing round for the whole country.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every appropriate opportunity will be used to advance Ireland's case in the negotiations ahead.  These negotiations will be structured around many meetings of Councils, both General Affairs and ECOFIN, and will include many technical working groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that some parts of Ireland did not benefit to the same extent as others under this round of structural funds.  This has led to loss of population and competitiveness in those areas.  Although structural funds have assisted many parts of the country, they have discriminated against others, <Col N="30" /> particularly those counties mentioned in the NESC report.  Surely the argument could be made that those regions which are still well under the average income per head of population in Europe should have a different status to those areas which are well ahead of the average income per head of population in Europe.  Will the Minister clarify whether any argument is being made along those lines in view of the regional disparities which exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations in this area are at a very early stage and it is unlikely that they will be concluded before the middle of 1999.  The Government's position is to try to get the best possible deal for Ireland.  When President Santer met the Taoiseach in December, he indicated to him that it was his view that transitional arrangements would encompass the next full period from 1999 to 2005.  As of now, the position of the Irish Government is to get the best possible deal for the country.</P>
      <P>In July 1997, the Commission put forward its proposals regarding transitional arrangements and that is the document on which negotiations will be based.  However, we are still a considerable time away from the finalisation of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the proposed transitional arrangements equate with Objective 1 status or be close to it?  Will any consideration be given to regional disparities in the negotiations leading up to the next round?  Will the Minister comment on the report, for which a member of his own party, Gerry Collins, MEP was a rapporteur, which recommended some form of regionalisation within the country for the next round of structural funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Until now, the traditional position of the Irish Government has been to treat Ireland as a single region and that remains its position.  The proposals put forward by the Commission, which include the transitional period, also treat Ireland as a single region.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.  I am also aware of the disparities which exist in the country where some regions did much better than others in previous rounds.  Those matters must be taken into consideration in negotiating a final package.  However, as of now we have not got down to that type of detailed negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister expect cohesion funds to continue into the next decade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Deenihan's question on regional disparities, my understanding is that the Department of Agriculture and Food commissioned a report from the CSO last year which suggested that the per capita income of various regions was not actually quite as disparate as most people had assumed.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the report or if he intends to commission any further report from the CSO or <Col N="31" /> otherwise to indicate whether regional disparities would, given the current criteria for Objective 1 status, allow some regions to continue to enjoy this status while others would not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated previously, we are at an early stage of negotiations with the Commission on these matters.  I am sure everyone in this House wishes to secure the best possible deal for Ireland as a whole.  I do not want to limit the Irish negotiating position as we move along.  I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.  I met a west of Ireland Deputy and experts from the region some months ago and they ensured I was familiar with the findings of the report.  At this stage, the Government's intention is to negotiate for Ireland as a single region.  It will probably be sometime in 1999 before these negotiations can be concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach regularly brings that matter to my attention.  Problems are not confined to particular regions.  There are big conurbations throughout the country in which problems exist and we will bear that in mind.  I do not want to give away our negotiating position on this matter.  However, I would point out that under the current rules it would be extremely difficult to pick out little pockets here and there which are below the threshold.  That is one reason the Government wishes to treat Ireland as a single region for funding purposes.  To say that one area meets a criteria and another does not would present considerable difficulties.</P>

      <P>Is le fíor-bhrón a chuala mé mar gheall ar bhás Shéamuis Mhic Giobúin, Gaeilgeoir, feirmeoir, polaiteoir, agus fear léinn, roimh an Nollaig.  It was with deep regret we learned before Christmas of the death of Mr. Jim Gibbons, a former distinguished Member of this House and of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Although it was always understated, Jim was a man of powerful <Col N="34" /> intellect and he possessed tremendous personal commitment to his role as a representative of the people in his native Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>As a member of Kilkenny County Council from 1954 to 1967, Jim learned at first hand the concerns and aspirations of his constituents.  His stint as a member of Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture, which he chaired from 1955 to 1965, and his membership of the National Farmers' Association, now the Irish Farmers' Association, served as a good apprenticeship for his two periods as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>From the time of his election to Dáil Éireann in 1957, Jim rose steadily through the ranks as a member of committees of this House, as parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Finance and then as Minister for Defence, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Opposition spokesman on agriculture and again as Minister for Agriculture from 1977 to 1979.  Interleaved with his distinguished career in this House was his career in Europe, as a member of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, an excellent MEP from 1973 to 1977 and a high profile member of that Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Committee on Public Health and Environment.  In all the high offices he held, Jim demonstrated great administrative ability and superb negotiating skills.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Agriculture in the early 1970s, Jim played a key role in the agricultural side of EEC membership negotiations and also in the commencement of the process of amalgamation of the State's creameries.  During his second period as Minister for Agriculture he successfully solved the difficult problem of access of Irish lamb to the French market within months of taking office.  That was a substantial achievement which formed the basis for the subsequent massive development of the sheep industry and of which he was immensely proud.</P>
      <P>One could not but admire the deep personal courage he showed in facing political adversity during his career &mdash; he experienced many difficult times &mdash; and more recently his calm fortitude in coping with his failing health over a long period. The sad loss of his son Michael three years ago was a heavy cross indeed on Jim and his family. To Jim's widow, Margaret, his four surviving sons, especially our colleague, Senator Jim, chairman of the Progressive Democrats Party, and former Deputy Martin, and their six daughters, I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to extend on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party our deepest condolences on their sad loss.  Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh anam dílis Jim Gibbons agus i measc na n-aingeal go raibh sé.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in paying personal tribute to the late Jim Gibbons.  I had the experience of being spokesman on agriculture in Opposition when Jim Gibbons was Minister for Agriculture and I have rarely experienced the degree of courtesy in public life that I experienced from Jim Gibbons, not only across the <Col N="35" /> House where he answered questions meticulously and carefully but also outside the House where he afforded me unprecedented opportunities to be briefed on what was happening.  When I was his political opponent, so to speak, he invited me to social functions at which he was host, which I have not witnessed before or since in public life from any administration, including those in which I was involved.  His courtesy was legendary and I will never forget it.</P>
      <P>Jim Gibbons respected the role an Opposition plays in public life.  He did not agree frequently with statements from the Opposition benches and because he was an honest person he did not pretend to agree with them.  He had no patience with humbug.  He did his work while showing extreme courtesy towards a political opponent, which speaks volumes about the character of the man.</P>
      <P>Jim Gibbons was a very interesting person.  He was an accomplished cartoonist who was able to portray, by the work of his hand, foibles of character of his friends as well as his foes.  He was a man of deep culture.  I have heard many stories about his travels around Europe while in Government and otherwise during which he visited various battlefields.  He had an experience and understanding of history, of battles long past and of wars going back over many hundreds of years. I have no doubt the officials who accompanied him on those visits returned fortified with a greater knowledge of history and of Ireland's place in Europe than they would have obtained if they had confined their activities to attending Council of Ministers meetings.  I am sure they remember and appreciate their guided tours of Europe by Jim Gibbons.</P>
      <P>He was very devoted to his Taoiseach, Jack Lynch.  I understand on one of his many visits abroad he discovered the wine <i>Chateau Lynch Bages,</i> called after the former Taoiseach's family and he had great pleasure in presenting a number of bottles to Jack Lynch.  That says a great deal about Jim Gibbons's capacity to make connections across Europe and that is why he was so highly regarded in Europe.  He was regarded as a true Irishman and a true European.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking about Jim Gibbons it would be incomplete not to refer to the very difficult period he went through in 1970 when his word was challenged in court and he had to endure a serious challenge to his integrity for the rest of his life. We should not revisit those events on an occasion such as this, but we should recall the deep hurt that must have caused him, a man of quintessential honesty to whom such an accusation and contradiction of his evidence must have represented the most profound affront possible.  I think he and his family came to terms with that and his family can look back on his career with great pride.  I understand one of the most eloquent tributes of its kind was paid to him at his funeral by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.  I have no doubt his family will also draw some solace from the words of tribute paid here.  He was a man of <Col N="36" /> great courage, who had a great ministerial record and who worked hard for farmers, Irish agriculture and for his country.  He was, in the truest sense of the term, a patriotic politician.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I express my condolences to the widow and family of Jim Gibbons and to the Fianna Fáil Party, of which he was a long-serving member.  I would like to be associated with the observations and comments made by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  I did not know Jim Gibbons in the way the Taoiseach or Deputy Bruton knew him.  It is timely for us to be reminded of the substantial contribution he made, over a long period in public life, to the development and modernisation of our society.  It is sad that one controversy in which he was involved will always be associated with his memory.  I believe history will be kind to him in that respect and, on behalf of my party, I express condolences to all concerned.</P>

      <P>I did not know Jim Gibbons personally.  It is clear from what we have heard about him today and from what I know about him from other sources that he gave considerable public service as an elected politician, the kind of service which seems to be taken for granted from many people elected to both Houses, particularly nowadays when there appears to be an almost prurient interest in peripheral rather than key issues that relate to the wellbeing of society.  Jim Gibbons was a man of enormous integrity.  At the time of the arms trial I was riveted by the reports on the stance he took then and subsequently.  He essentially challenged elements of his political family which would largely have been unheard of at that time.  It is a mark of respect to him that he was not prepared to brook any implication or downgrading of what he believed to be the truth.</P>
      <P>Although I would have disagreed fundamentally with him on many issues about which he was very conservative, I acknowledge without reservation that he stood on what he believed to be the truth and on that basis we owe him a debt of gratitude.  I also convey my condolences to his widow and family.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have reached the questions today but we did not.  The questions will be taken next Tuesday and Wednesday and the volume of questions will fill both days.  There is nothing particularly urgent other than to continue what we have being doing outside the House.  I restate our total and absolute condemnation of the nine brutal murders which took place in the last four weeks.  The focus of the Governments, the parties in the talks and, hopefully, people outside the talks will be to try to build around the propositions document and the various documents that the parties have put to the talks.  There were useful discussions yesterday and today on strands two and three.  Next week we will move back to strand one and the talks will come to Dublin Castle the following week.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the fears of the community leaders from Northern Ireland who are present today.  I had the opportunity to meet them, to convey the Government's anxiety about what has happened and to discuss the issues they raised.  I know that the other party leaders have met them or will meet them today.  I assure them and all the people of Northern Ireland that we want to see an end to the killing; we want to see political progress through dialogue and compromise and we in this House will do all we can to assist that process.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Whips might discuss the matter.  There are arguments about the best time to have statements.  The Taoiseach will be answering questions on Tuesday and when we have heard from the Taoiseach a debate on the issues might be better prepared.  There are other views on the matter and perhaps it would be best if the Whips discussed the arrangements. A debate on this matter needs to be well prepared; we need time to deliberate on what we intend to say so that what we say is meaningful and not simply a routine recitation of often repeated clichés.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of Fine Gael to give every support to moving the negotiations forward to deal with the detailed issues which need to be settled.  No one should underestimate the extent of the detailed work and negotiations necessary to get a settlement within the deadline.  The meat of the negotiations has not been approached yet and it needs to be approached as the Governments have set out in their document.</P>
      <P>I urge the Taoiseach to recognise the urgency of dealing with the issue of policing in Northern Ireland.  It cannot be postponed to be dealt with at the end of the negotiations.  People need protection by a duly constituted police force now. They do not need actions from informal and unauthorised groups attempting to impose their will by illegal means.  Will the Taoiseach prioritise the policing issue in his discussions with the British Government and the participants in the talks?</P>

It would be appropriate to provide an hour tomorrow morning to exchange views so that before the end of January the parties will have spoken in the House, rather than the leaders of the various parties offering their support through the media.  The Dáil must send a loud and clear message of its position on these issues. The Whips should meet to make an arrangement for tomorrow.  I understand that tomorrow's business will be the continuation of today's business. With respect to the participants in those debates, an hour or more could be found in the morning to facilitate Members in expressing their views and in offering support and encouragement to the democratic parties engaged in the talks.</P>

On another occasion he said that the Bill would include proposals for discussion on digitalisation. I note that it is now on the &ldquo;also ran&rdquo; list of legislation. The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill has had a similar fate, despite the fact that we are in breach of European law because a number of EU directives depend on the support of the Bill.  It was promised for not later than the 1 March 1998.  In addition, a small raft of Bills, including Bille na Gaeilge and legislation on architectural heritage, national parks and television coverage of major sporting events, is also joining the &ldquo;also ran&rdquo; list.</P>

In addition, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill was ready and it was suggested to me that the other legislation I mentioned could be prepared in the same length of time it takes to make a wet day's journey from County Clare.  However, none of them is promised this side of Easter.

      <P>The Deputy is correct to say I indicated that the Broadcasting Bill would be ready this spring.  However, that is no longer the case because much more detailed work is required on the Bill.  While I do not want to argue with the Deputy on how much work was done when he left Government, the advancements in technology with which he would have been familiar have meant that what was stated a year ago is different from what is being stated now.</P>
      <P>Recently, I have been briefed on this area. Given the extent of digitalisation and the pace of technological advancement, it is better that the Bill is drafted correctly for the 21st century rather than rushing it through.  The Minister and her officials are engaged in far more elaborate discussions to ensure that the legislation will be in order.  In view of this, it will not be introduced until later this year.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Noel Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, to allow for an increase in the membership of An Bord Pleanála.  The membership of An Bord Pleanála is restricted by the 1983 Act to a chairman and five ordinary members.  This Bill will allow the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to increase the size of the board where the Minister considers that the workload of the board warrants such an increase. The Bill does not specify the number of additional members that may be appointed but allows the Minister to do so by order.  Any order will be for a period not exceeding five years and will be subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues the present system of appointment of board members whereby ministerial appointments to the board are selected from nominees put forward by the members of organisations in four panels.  These panels represent construction and business organisations, planning and professional groups, environmental bodies and general interest groups.  In relation to the additional board members, the Bill provides that prescribed bodies for all panels will be asked to nominate candidates for appointment.</P>
    <P>The nomination process will obviously take some time as the 1994 planning regulations give the nominating bodies two months from the date of the request to put forward the names.  The Bill allows as an interim measure, to meet the current urgent need, for the appointment of officers of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to the board for a maximum period of nine months.  Since the publication of the Bill, I have received representations on behalf of the staff of An Bord Pleanála that interim board appointments be made from among the staff of An Bord Pleanála.  Having considered the case made, I believe there is merit in the Minister having that option and I have decided to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to permit interim appointments to be made from the board's own staff at an appropriate level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister would have that option.  An Bord Pleanála, its staff and board members play a crucial role in the planning system. I pay tribute to their hard work and in particular the great efforts they have made in coping with the huge increase in planning appeals in the past two years.  While many of us may disagree with individual decisions of the board, the board has won widespread respect for doing its job efficiently and impartially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through its work, An Bord Pleanála has played an essential role in ensuring that the best qualities of the Irish planning system are preserved and upheld.  For a small fee, people seeking planning permission, and third parties who consider that the principles of proper planning and development are not being upheld, have an <Col N="46" /> opportunity to appeal local authority planning decisions to a completely independent tribunal. This third parties right of appeal is almost unheard of in most other European countries.</P>
    <P>The procedures used by An Bord Pleanála are of a very high standard, above board and transparent. The quality of service which the board provides is demonstrated by the infrequency with which people attempt to challenge the board through the courts, and the rarity of the occasions on which judicial review of the board's decisions succeed.  For example, challenges against board decisions were made in only nine cases in 1996 and of those decided that year none was successful. To put this in context, the board received almost 3,500 cases in 1996.</P>
    <P>A core principle of the Government's strategic management initiative is to ensure quality public service.  The issue of providing a quality service extends throughout the public service and is crucial to the success of the planning system.  One essential element of a quality planning system is the timeliness of decision-making.  Delays in making decisions on planning applications or on planning appeals have a financial cost for the developer and the economy in general.  Some of the statements made recently regarding planning delays in the context of rising house prices are not well founded.  We must be aware also that the quality and efficiency of our planning service impacts on our ability to compete in an increasingly global marketplace.</P>
    <P>An Board Pleanála has a statutory objective to decide cases within four months.  Reflecting the growth in the economy generally, there has been a steady rise in the number of appeals coming before the board since mid-1995.  The number of appeals received by the board was just short of 4,000 in 1997; this compares with 3,424 in 1996 and 2,778 in 1995.  This represents an increase of 44 per cent over a two year period.  There is every indication that appeals will continue to rise in 1998 to around 4,500.  The Government and the board have been concerned to ensure that, despite the increased pressure on the board, it continues to achieve a satisfactory level of performance.</P>
    <P>In 1995, 98 per cent of all appeals were disposed of within the four month statutory period. However, by the end of 1997 this rate had declined to around 82 per cent.  The average time taken to deal with appeals has increased from 14 weeks in 1995 to 15 weeks in 1996 and is now running at 16 weeks.  The actual number of appeals disposed of per year has increased by over 1,000 between 1995 and 1997.</P>
    <P>The decline in the percentage of cases disposed of within four months has occurred despite the fact that an increase in staffing has been approved.  The board has an approved complement of 85 staff, an increase of 14 since January 1997.  It will be appreciated that there is a time lag before increased staffing is reflected in output. In an attempt to improve efficiency, the board has been upgrading its computer systems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> The statutory limit on membership of the board is six &mdash; a chairman and five ordinary members.  This limit is now proving a real bottleneck in terms of increasing the number of decisions and will adversely affect performance until additional members can be appointed.  If, as estimated, the number of appeals continues to rise sharply in 1998 and the House agrees to the increase in board membership, the board estimates that, with the appointment of the two additional board members during 1998, the percentage of cases determined within four months will be about 90 per cent by the last quarter of 1998 and will increase to 95 per cent in 1999 with the full year benefit of the extra board members and staff.</P>
    <P>By way of explanation of why the limit on the membership of the board can cause delays, I will explain briefly the workings of the board.  An Bord Pleanála is a full-time board and its procedures are such that no single person, be it a board member, inspector or other staff member, can ensure what the board's decision will be in a particular appeal.  While the quorum for the board meeting is three, all members usually attend a board meeting where a particularly complex or sensitive case is involved.  In considering an appeal, all submissions on the file are considered with the inspector's report and recommendation. The board gives due consideration to the report but, as Members will know, the decision may be and has been at variance with the recommendation of the inspector.  For instance, in 1996 the board accepted the general thrust of the inspector's recommendation in 89 per cent of cases.  Members will agree that these carefully balanced procedures place considerable obligations on all board members.</P>
    <P>In view of the urgency of the current situation and the risk that a further rise in the number of appeals will affect the board's ability to perform effectively, I have brought forward this short Bill specifically to allow for the appointment of the additional members.  I estimate that two extra board members are required to meet the board's current workload.</P>
    <P>Turning to the detail of the Bill, section 1(a) substitutes a new section 3 for section 3 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983 and provides that the membership of the board shall, as at present, consist of a chairman and five ordinary members.  However, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may, by order, appoint additional board members where he or she is of the opinion that the levels of the board's work would justify an increase.  Such an order would be subject to a confirming resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The new subsection (5) provides that an order providing for an increase in the membership of the board would specify the period for which the increase in membership would apply. This period cannot exceed five years.  I am not, therefore, providing for a permanent increase in <Col N="48" /> the number of board members.  I have chosen instead to provide a mechanism with the necessary flexibility to cope with changing workloads. I have referred to the procedures for interim appointments to meet urgent work demands before full appointments can be made.</P>
    <P>Section 1(b) inserts a new subsection (2A) in section 7 of the 1983 Act to provide that the additional members will be appointed from among those persons nominated by the various bodies prescribed under the Act.  Board members are chosen from among candidates nominated by various bodies which are divided into four specialised panels.  They are planning and professional organisations such as the Irish Planning Institute, environmental associations such as An Taisce, construction and business organisations such as IBEC, and social, economic and general interest bodies such as the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  One board member is appointed from the candidates on each of the four panels.  The fifth member must be a civil servant serving in the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  The Bill provides that nominations for appointment of additional members will be sought from the prescribed bodies on all four panels.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will appreciate the importance of the Bill to the continued efficient and effective operation of An Bord Pleanála and the planning system generally.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Minister's most distinguishing characteristics, in public at least, is his self-possession, even on occasions when he is being hassled by unruly journalists.  I was taken aback by his demeanour.  In his presentation of the Bill, I did not detect a single critical nuance of any kind.  He seemed to be complacent. Although this may be a short and limited Bill, it has been brought forward for a reason that is more urgent than it seems from the Minister's words.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out to provide for a temporary increase in the number of members of An Bord Pleanála when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government considers it necessary and in any case for a period not longer than five years. It is curious that we should have a Bill with such a limited objective at a time when the Minister, as he informed the members of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government this afternoon, is engaged in a fundamental review of planning legislation.  Has he decided that the part of the planning process affected by the Bill is not in need of further fundamental modification than what is provided for and will he come back to us with a Bill that does something else to An Bord Pleanála?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a point with which I agree. It is clear beyond doubt that there is a need for an independent final arbiter in relation to planning appeals.  The case for such an independent arbiter was well made in 1976 when the legislation providing <Col N="49" /> for the establishment of An Bord Pleanála was passed.  The only circumstance in which it is possible to look behind a decision of An Bord Pleanála is one in which a point of law arises.  In such cases further questioning is restricted to the point of law at issue.</P>
    <P>There is room for further reflection.  The increasing complexity of planning law in recent years, particularly with the addition of environmental impact assessments and statements, has increased the frequency with which the decisions of An Bord Pleanála are brought before the courts.  It would be wrong systematically to exclude recourse to the courts on points of law. On the other hand, further clarification and codification of the law and practice in relation to planning matters might reduce the number of instances in which interested parties have recourse to the courts.  We would gain from a reduction in the number of such cases.  I urge the Minister to give some attention to this in his review of planning legislation.  The annual reports of An Bord Pleanála are interesting in that they distinguish between the reasons appeals are taken against decisions made.  It may be the case that further clarification of the law, particularly in relation to environmental impact assessments and statements, might help to avoid some of the more difficult cases brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say there is a certain lack of understanding of the position of An Bord Pleanála among the public generally and even among people involved in the physical development process, whether they be developers or people objecting to proposed developments.  There can be few Members of this House who have not met an irate developer expressing fury at a decision by An Bord Pleanála on an appeal or at extra conditions imposed on a proposed development by An Bord Pleanála.  Many of us have met objectors who were baffled by a decision by An Bord Pleanála to allow a proposed development which they believe will have a serious adverse effect on the quality of their environment or on the quality of their life.  Those of us who explain to such people, whether developers or private citizens, that such decisions are entirely outside the political process and are therefore not amenable to political action of any kind are often met with stares of blank incomprehension.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the collective experience of its members and of its staff, and the fund of knowledge on which it can draw as a result of its operation since 1976, An Bord Pleanála is still capable of making decisions which are difficult to understand. Its decision on a landfill site at Arthurstown, Kill for the Dublin local authorities is a case in point.  Apart from the appropriateness of continued heavy reliance on landfill as a method of waste disposal, a subject to which no doubt we will return in another context, there are serious questions relating to the choice of a location which is at the highest point in the landscape for some distance around.  Residents of the area are fully aware that the plans for the site include the <Col N="50" /> provision of the most up to date sealing techniques. They are also fully aware that no system is perfect and that, in the event of a problem emerging, the higher up the site is located the greater the problem will be for the residents in the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>I mention this in the context of An Bord Pleanála because that was a decision in which An Bord Pleanála played a part.  There seems to be a mania for the use of elevated sites for landfill. Some time ago the Limerick local authority prospected a site on a hillside in County Clare and I understand on that occasion they got a rather dusty answer from Clare County Council.  It has now turned its attention elsewhere and it is seeking clearance from the Environmental Protection Agency to locate a landfill dump on a site 1,200 feet above sea level in Slievefelim.  Even the most uninterested layman can see the folly of such a course of action.  To see it sanctioned by An Bord Pleanála is absolutely incomprehensible.  With the greatest respect to the members of An Bord Pleanála, they do not suddenly become philosopher kings or queens on their appointment. They are prone to human errors of judgment and the rest of us bear the consequences.</P>
    <P>Another feature of decisions made by An Bord Pleanála which the public and many developers find difficult to understand is the frequency with which recommendations made by its inspectors are overturned or rejected by members of the board; the Minister informed us this afternoon that that is 11 per cent of the cases.  He said that in 89 per cent of cases the general thrust of the inspector's recommendation is followed.  It follows, therefore, that in 11 per cent of cases, one in nine, the thrust of the inspector's advice is not followed by the board.</P>
    <P>I would not suggest that we should always and in all circumstances accept expert technical advice simply because it is presented by expert technical people.  I am not one of those people, for example, who would hold that in drawing up county development plans or in considering proposals for material contraventions or in looking at rezoning proposals members of local authorities should always be led and said only by their technical experts, but decisions have been made by An Bord Pleanála which went against inspectors' recommendations for reasons which are utterly unfathomable to applicants for planning permission, many of whom have some expertise in the matters at issue.  Since An Bord Pleanála is, in planning matters, the final court of appeal it has a particular duty to explain fully the reasons for any decision it makes.  The level of discontent around the country as a result of decisions of An Bord Pleanála is an indication, at least in part, of a failure on the part of the board to explain its decisions adequately.</P>
    <P>There will be eternal arguments about the aesthetics of structures and of infrastructural provisions which will drag any planning system and any planning appeal system into controversy.  We do not have to look far to find them.  I cannot <Col N="51" /> understand how any planner or any person charged with determining planning appeals could have given approval to Liberty Hall, for example, although that predates this.  I cannot understand how anybody could have allowed the IFSC building that faces Busáras.  I cannot understand how any person in their sane mind could have given approval to any of the Dublin Corporation civic offices between Christ Church and the Liffey. They are just a few of Dublin's eyesores.  The rest of the country has more than its fair share of them in cities and towns.  Those are matters of aesthetic judgment and it is a fair guess that if planning officials and members of An Bord Pleanála were presented today with plans for the railway viaduct at Butt Bridge, for example, or if they were presented with the plans for one of the magnificent Roman aqueducts that are to be found in various parts of the European continent, they would give a flat refusal.  Who would give approval today, whether on first application or on appeal, for a structure resembling a Norman keep?  I will not be putting up plans for that when I decide to build a multi-million pound mansion, if ever.  Although they raise great passions, these aesthetic questions are not often among the most contentious questions in the planning process at the appeal level.</P>
    <P>I must say in passing that it is a pity that planning officials around the country seem to be absolutely fixated on neutral coloured roofs and walls for houses in rural areas.  If they really want houses in rural areas to merge in with the landscape, they should call in Army experts to advise on camouflage colour schemes.</P>
    <P>The next problem frequently encountered with An Bord Pleanála, and the Minister mentioned it, is delays in having appeals determined.  Section 2 of the 1992 Act provides that, in general, appeals shall be determined within a period of four months beginning on the date of receipt by the board of the appeal.  There are exceptions but as a general rule the intention is that appeals should be determined within four months.  The position in this regard has deteriorated.  Up to this afternoon the latest information available to me was that contained in the 1996 annual report of An Bord Pleanála which states that in 1994 98.7 per cent of all appeals were determined within four months.  In 1995 the percentage went down to 97.6 per cent.  In 1996 it went down even further to 92.7 per cent.  The Minister told us this afternoon that by the end of 1997 that figure had gone down to 82 per cent.  The figure went from 93 per cent in 1996 to 82 per cent in 1997.  That is extremely worrying and I know the Minister will say this Bill is a response to that.  I accept that is the case but we need to know a little more about the reason that has happened.</P>
    <P>The total number of cases in which appeals were determined in 1994 was 2,332.  In 1995 it was 2,631 and in 1996 the figure was 3,237.  In 1996, the last year for which we have full information, 236 cases were not determined within four <Col N="52" /> months.  One must read between the lines of the report to find out the reason for that.  The explanations given in the l996 report are far from satisfactory. We need explanations of those explanations. Oral hearings were held in 32 cases.  That is the explanation given.  It is not immediately obvious why or how that constitutes an adequate explanation in itself.  In 20 cases an environmental impact statement was submitted.  It is not obvious why that should be a cause for delay.  This relates to what I said earlier.  There may be a case for seeking clarification of the cases where that submission arises.  If we had made the position in that regard clearer in law and in practice, we could have avoided some of those 20 cases in l996 and we might avoid similar delays or even recourse to the courts in the future.</P>
    <P>In l996 102 cases were the subject of notices under sections 9, 10 or 13 of the l992 Act.  Those notices provide for submissions, observations or information to be furnished to the board within 14 to 28 days, 14 to 21 days and 14 to 28 days, respectively.  It is not obvious why the serving of such notices and the soliciting of such submissions within those deadlines should in itself be a cause for cases not being determined within the four month period.</P>
    <P>The l996 report states, &ldquo;43 cases were large cases or involved complex issues&rdquo;.  Is that not the reason the board is there, to deal with such cases? To say that some planning decisions are complex is not a reason that in any way explains why there are delays, especially in those 43 cases.  Most teasingly and mysteriously the report informs us, &ldquo;92 cases were attributed to the significant increase in the intake of appeals&rdquo;.  That explanation must surely be a masterpiece of opacity.</P>
    <P>In l996 615 more appeals were received than in l995.  The report tells us that 92 of them took longer than four months to determine because there were more appeals in l996 than in l995.  I must confess that explanation leaves me none the wiser than when I started.  There is a danger that the board has fallen a victim to the same virus that has affected planning authorities all over the country.  The Minister knows the one I mean.  The average applicant for planning permission and most Members could be forgiven for believing local authority officials have a standard system for dealing with planning permission applications not provided for in law.  It seems they note the date of receipt of an application, diary the application for a few days before the date on which the decision is due and file it.  When the diary date arrives, they pull out the file, give it a cursory examination and dash off a letter seeking further information.  The nature of the further information sought in many of these cases strikes many of the applicants as being a ploy for delaying the decision.  I hope that virus has not spread too far into the organism of An Bord Pleanála.  If that were to happen it would be a dreadful pity.  I am prepared to believe that is part of the concern underlying this Bill.  If the membership of An Bord Pleanála were increased there would be less <Col N="53" /> excuse for delays.  That opinion is widely held.  We do not need to wait for the Minister to form an opinion as provided for under section 1(2) to know that is required.  Will the Minister reconsider if there is a case for increasing the membership of An Bord Pleanála permanently, assuming he does not intend to make any other changes in the board's structure?</P>
    <P>We all hope the current conditions of rapid economic expansion will continue.  If they do they will inevitably result in a high level of construction activity.  Given the importance we attach to the ability to lodge third party appeals &mdash; the Minister mentioned that in his remarks and I agree with him &mdash; the high level of economic activity and construction activity will inevitably mean a continuing high level of demand for the services of An Bord Pleanála.  Even if the board were to find itself in a position to observe the spirit and intent of the l992 Act and give a decision on appeals within four months, for many people that would still represent a considerable delay.  I know of one case today where a worthwhile BES scheme in the energy sector is in danger of being closed out because the promoters cannot be sure they will be in a position to issue shares before 8 June next, the close off date for those schemes under the provisions of last month's budget.  The reason in that case is that there may be delays in securing planning permissions and, even if and when the necessary planning permissions are obtained, there may be appeals.</P>
    <P>The four month target included in the l992 Act is not something we should be prepared to accept indefinitely.  In many cases it can be rightly and justly demanded that decisions be made more quickly.  If a permanent increase in the membership of An Bord Pleanála allows that to happen that would be worthwhile in itself.  If on the other hand the pace of physical development were to slow down, what would be the harm in having decisions on appeals made in less than four months?  If that were to be the result of having a larger board, I believe a great many people would approve that.</P>
    <P>I approve of the provision in section 1(3) that any order made under subsection (2) would be subject to a confirming resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That has been a hobbyhorse of mine since I was elected to this House.  I am always delighted to find it in places where it is appropriate.  Given the structure of this Bill, it is an entirely appropriate provision here.  However, I cannot understand why in subsection (4) the Minister needs powers to appoint additional members to the board in the interim period before such an order is made and for a period not exceeding nine months.  That seems to suggest that if the Minister believes an emergency situation will last for nine months or less he can dispense with the procedure of bringing an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas, appoint the additional members for a period of nine months or less and no further discussion is required.  That <Col N="54" /> would not be desirable.  I cannot conceive of a situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assist the Deputy on that. Regarding the nine months provision, as I explained in my remarks, we intend to appoint two new members to the board and we will follow the procedures in place.  However, because of the strictures in the legislation which allow people two months to submit nominations which we then have to consider, giving the Minister power in the interim to appoint members immediately to deal with the problems that exist is considered necessary. The new members need not remain on the board for nine months.  If we follow the procedure and appoint the new members within three or four months that temporary membership will then lapse.  That provision is to assist in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will then be able to come back with an order and invite the Houses to reappoint the temporary members whose membership has lapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Minister said, but I am not sure the provision for nine months is appropriate.  I hope to discuss that on Committee Stage.  I do not believe there would ever be a situation where a Minister looking more than nine months ahead would find himself or herself unable to be sure the Houses would sit to consider any orders he or she might propose in any shorter a period than that.</P>
      <P>A point arises from comments made by the Minister.  He informed the House that he is considering keeping the option of making interim appointments from among members of the board's staff at the appropriate level.  I understand why the Minister may see merit in that position in the short-term.  It is not a criticism of the staff of the board, but this would be a self-defeating proposal if it is supposed to help deal with matters more rapidly.  If two members of staff at the appropriate level are appointed to the board, it only shifts them from one place to another.  There is no net gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is then a position, <i>pace</i> the Minister for Finance, where, having appointed two members of staff at the appropriate level to the board, it is found that two vacancies in the staff of An Bord Pleanála can be filled, it will not be at the same appropriate level.  There will be some consequential vacancies further down the line.  It is axiomatic that if two senior members of the staff of the board are appointed and it is necessary to compensate for that by bringing in two staff members at junior level, nothing has been gained in terms of the expertise of An Bord Pleanála. There are only two new people who must be trained.  I am not sure that is an entirely appropriate way to deal with the type of temporary problem the Minister has in mind.  Perhaps something could be said for it if the Minister considered the <Col N="55" /> appointments as a permanent accretion to the number of members of the board.  However, that will not be the case if it is temporary.</P>
    <P>Questions about this matter arise.  Within the framework of the law as it stands, the Bill is reasonable.  However, I am not satisfied, as we embark on a major review of planning legislation, that we should accept that the Bill is necessarily the final word on the structure of An Bord Pleanála. This side will not oppose the Bill for that reason, although amendments to it may be proposed. The House should note its intention of coming back to this matter when Members have had a chance to comb through the debate which will inevitably take place on overall improvements to the planning process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin my contribution where Deputy Dukes ended.  I am delighted a specific Oireachtas committee will deal with environment and local government matters because it was necessary in the past to queue for time at other committees.  However, when the establishment of that committee was being discussed it was obvious from the concerns expressed by Members on all sides that the issue of planning is causing much public concern and debate.  This involves developers who want to develop sites and provide infrastructure, people who are concerned with preserving the natural environment and the public which is concerned about basic matters, such as access to affordable housing and the shape of towns, cities and the countryside.</P>
      <P>It is a most important debate which the Minister indicated he will lead.  The Bill is small and simple in that context.  I acknowledge the need for the legislation and the Labour Party will not oppose it.  However, as Deputy Dukes said, it may be necessary to revisit the issue of the appeals mechanism in the fuller debate which will take place on all aspects of planning.  The Bill is a simple measure which deals with the workload of An Bord Pleanála, the independent appeals board that, by and large, has worked well.  It has removed the political charge from the planning process which existed in advance of the enactment by the Houses of the Oireachtas of legislation to establish a separate, independent board to act as the final arbiter in planning matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The model has served us well and has been used in other areas, for example, in considering the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies which have come on stream since then.  I acknowledge that the volume of appeals has put huge pressure on An Bord Pleanála in recent years.  When I was Minister for the Environment I increased the staffing component of the board.  This helped the process but because of the structure of the decision making system, where matters are decided ultimately by the full-time quasi judicial board, I accept the logic of the argument that there is an immediate <Col N="56" /> dilemma which can only be addressed by increasing the number of board members.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct to balance the figure he outlined.  The figure of 98 per cent achieved in 1995 fell to 82 per cent last year.  However, the volume of applications processed substantially increased.  Therefore, no matter how productive the board was and how many more applications were processed, it was not running fast enough to keep up with the volume of applications submitted. This indicates a number of points.  There is the boom in economic activity to which the Minister and Deputy Dukes referred, but there is also a growing sensitivity among people about planning matters.  Few planning issues or proposals for development are not debated or go unnoticed. This is good, but it is not uniformly good because I am greatly taken aback by the delays in advancing obviously good proposals.  A coterie of people like to object but it is important that there is a good ventilation of issues.  Proposals may initially appear good but when they are occasionally knocked down, better proposals emerge.</P>
    <P>We can be subjective in our views on what are good and bad developments.  I have a different view from Deputy Dukes about the civic offices. I think the final product is a lovely addition to the architecture of the capital city.  I am not a purist in the sense that the only building which should be erected in Dublin is Georgian pastiche.  This would be a disastrous approach.  The city of Paris has a magnificent architectural heritage but the Centre Pompidou was erected there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>One pays one's money and takes one's choice.  I am excited by those developments. The Georgian architecture of Dublin is magnificent, but we should not be trapped in a time warp.  Our generation should be willing to be bold on occasions.  The Sydney Opera House would not get past first base in Irish planning and I am not sure that is good.  We can be captured forever in Georgian pastiche and that appears to be what is accepted.</P>
      <P>Many local authorities, including mine, have produced worthy documents about building sensitively in rural landscapes.  The view appears to be that if we all build the same type of house, with the same size windows, height and dimensions, everything will be fine.  I do not agree with that view.  However, I also disagree that houses should be scattered all over the place.  I visited some counties when I was Minister and I occasionally arrived by helicopter.  It was possible to have a global view of areas and some appalling planning decisions have been made in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> A global overview of planning is required because it is linked to virtually everything else. For example, the traffic problems in Dublin and the industrial patterns of Ireland ultimately revolve round good planning.  We have a county planning process that was required to have no regard to its neighbours.  Even the more recent regional authorities have scant regard for their neighbours.  There is no national plan that shows the displacement pattern, the development pattern and the housing pattern we require.  I am anxious that we take some bold decisions on a national development strategy that deals with every area in a complementary way.  All individual pieces of the jigsaw then fit together rather than being carved out on a county by county basis without gelling together as a cohesive whole.  The Minister will not be able to do this major work alone.  It will need to be done on a cross-party basis and with public debate.  The sustainability of Dublin in particular depends on the right decisions being made now.</P>
    <P>I could not attend today's meeting, at which the Minister perhaps touched on some important issues.  I hope we have a significant debate and specific proposals dealing with real issues in the planning process.  The grand scheme I mentioned, a comprehensive national planning and development plan, is one matter.  A more mundane and immediate issue is today's planning and its enforcement.  Although we are acknowledging the pressures on An Bord Pleanála in today's legislation, similar pressures exist in every planning office.  In the last couple of hours I spoke to the chief planning officer in my county.  She does not have time to look at a particular development until next week because of the volume of applications that require a decision this week.  I do not believe there is much enforcement of planning decisions.  Once a decision is made, nobody checks if a person builds what was approved.  I know of no buildings which did not comply with their planning permissions and which were removed.  If there are such examples, they are few and far between.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes is right.  Everyone knows that local planning offices are under pressure.  An application is made and a decision must be made within two months.  If a decision is not made in the two months provided by law, the application is granted by default.  This grant by default should be examined and I have doubts about whether this mechanism should continue.  Deputy Dukes is right about the clause whereby the authority can ask for further information at the eleventh hour.  That is a matter of routine in many cases and it makes a nonsense of the statutory obligation to have a matter determined in two months.</P>
    <P>If we are looking for extra staffing or extra board members for An Bord Pleanála, we must look at the planning structure as it is initiated.  So much of the work of An Bord Pleanála could be removed if there was a facility at local level for skilled persons to debate planning matters before <Col N="58" /> submissions have to be made.  There is very little scope, time or staff for discussion of what is appropriate.  We must begin at the county level if we are to have an effective planning system.  This matter dovetails with other issues such as house prices and the strategic approach to planning mentioned by the Minister.  I hope he is encompassing the notion of a comprehensive national plan.</P>
    <P>Labour Senators brought a Bill relating to unfinished housing estates to the Seanad which was voted down by the Government parties.  This matter is becoming a scandal.  People are desperate to buy houses and are virtually buying houses from the drawings.  Builders are doing nicely in the current economic climate.  They move on to their next project, leaving a list of matters not completed.  These can be minor or the most basic amenities such as footpaths, roads and lighting. There seems to be no follow-through.  Developers can go on to the next estate and leave problems for local authorities in their wake.  I am disappointed the Government voted the Bill down. Perhaps it did not have enough time to consider the legislation.  I hope the Minister has this on his agenda when he introduces planning legislation.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Michael Smith was Minister for the Environment I debated the limitation on enforcement of planning permissions with him.  It was reduced to five years, which I feel is too short.  The previous situation meant enforcement could go back to the first planning legislation of 1963, and one had to ensure compliance went back to that date.  That was overly demanding and 12 years would have been more appropriate than five years.  The Minister should consider this.  The protection of interiors is also badly addressed, when it is addressed at all, in planning law.  One can have magnificent interiors which are more important in heritage terms than the exterior, yet those interiors may have no protection in law.</P>
    <P>Any Member could introduce a huge number of planning issues.  A review of planning legislation is timely and necessary.  However, we must balance the need for housing and infrastructure, which is real and must be met, with the need for a built environment we can be proud of.  We do not want eyesores about which we may say, &ldquo;How did we allow that to take place in our time?&rdquo;, notwithstanding differences in personal taste.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister retained the nominating procedures in relation to membership of An Bord Pleanála.  It is important that there are lists of approved bodies which have the right to nominate members.  The Minister makes decisions about appointments to An Bord Pleanála based on those nominations.  It is a quasi-judicial role which has very onerous responsibilities.  As with every judge's decision, there will be disagreement. The two sides in any court believe they are both right, but only one side will be vindicated. Planning is no different from any other judgment, although people feel less intimidated about criticising planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála <Col N="59" /> than they feel about the courts.  Politicians are not excluded; we seem to feel that An Bord Pleanála is fairer game than members of the High Court. However, although I would disagree with some of its decisions, by and large An Bord Pleanála gets it right.</P>
    <P>An issue which is important to the operation of An Bord Pleanála is transparency.  In my time I made the inspector's report a public document.  The advice from some quarters at the time &mdash; the Minister may read the files &mdash; was that the heavens would fall and that if I made the inspector's report a public document under access to information regulations no inspector would write an unbalanced report.  That is our reasoning and it is wrong.  The more transparency we allow and demand, the better the process and the less aggrieved people will be.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Dukes's view that because an inspector writes something it does not mean that is the end of the matter.  There is no point having an appeals board if the inspector is the final decision maker.  A disagreement rate of 11 per cent is modest.  I imagine the recommendations of the management to any local authority are overturned more frequently than in 11 per cent of cases, and rightly so.  The inspector is a technical expert who gives advice to a tribunal to make a decision.  The issue is not to be critical when the inspector's recommendations are not fully complied with but to have the greatest degree of transparency in relation to all documentation. That is a matter at which I invite the Minister to look again.  I do not know if there is anything more which can be made available in terms of documentation.  It will probably all be made available from 1 April under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I wish to raise is important and I invite the Minister to look at it between now and Committee Stage.  It is a request, which has been ongoing for a number of years, from the employees of An Bord Pleanála concerning indemnification for them in their work.  The Minister will be aware that under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, specific indemnity is allowed.  Under section 15 there is immunity for the agency, while under section 16 there is an indemnification of the director general, directors and other persons.  Section 16 states:</P>
    <P>Where the Agency is satisfied that the Director General or other director or authorised person appointed by the Agency, or any other employee of the Agency, has discharged his duties in relation to the enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions in a <i>bona fide</i> manner, it shall indemnify the Director General or other director or authorised person of the Agency or any other employee of the Agency, against all actions or claims howsoever arising in respect of the discharge by him of his duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> There is a concern, particularly in the light of complete openness, in relation to the operation of An Bord Pleanála that people would be sued in their personal capacity and would not have the protection of law.  It is a matter to which I invite the Minister to look between now and Committee Stage.  If he does not see fit to table an amendment, I will do so.</P>
    <P>I could say a lot on planning and the Minister has initiated a debate in which I will fully participate on behalf of my party.  It is time to take bold actions.  This humble step is not a bold action, it is a necessary interim measure to keep the system operating efficiently.  I will facilitate the Minister in having this measure enacted as a foretaste of the important work in and reform of planning which we all are charged to do in the immediate future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is a small but necessary step in making our planning system more efficient.  The Minister said the Government's strategic management initiative is to ensure quality in the public service, but as everyone knows the number of planning applications coming before local authorities and An Bord Pleanála has increased substantially in recent years.  It is increasingly obvious that the board and local authorities are groaning under the pressure of the number of applications.  This measure will help to keep the quality of decisions at a good level and I hope it will increase the quality of decisions made.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála's record has been reasonably good.  It is increasingly agreeing with local authorities in its decisions.  As others have said, decisions are made in their areas with which they may not agree but it is the nature of planning that we cannot all agree with every decision.  By and large, An Bord Pleanála has a good record and it should be congratulated on that.  It is important that it gets extra staff to ensure that continues.</P>
      <P>There is a greater awareness of planning and people are more interested in what happens in their neighbourhood, town and city and in the countryside and in the environment, which is a good thing.  There could be more transparency in An Bord Pleanála.  For example, people are happier if they attend an oral hearing and listen to what the inspector has to say.  On a number of occasions I have seen people who may object to a development leave an oral hearing a lot happier because they have heard the reasons that the inspector has made a decision and have listened to the questions he has asked.  Such transparency is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Howlin said, allowing the report to be made public is beneficial.  Many people believe that if these sensitive documents are made available to the public, the world will fall apart.  Legislation in other countries allowing for the opening of Government files and other supposedly sensitive material has not led to the world collapsing around them.  In fact, the number of people reading such material has dropped off.  I attended a <Col N="61" /> conference on this issue and was amazed by the lack of interest by the public.  It was surprising that not much information came out and that decisions made were fairly obvious.</P>
    <P>This is part of a much wider debate and I am delighted the previous and this Minister are interested in planning.  This afternoon the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government received a summary report on the convention on the planning system.  A presentation was made by an official from the Minister's Department and it was excellent to see that. Legislation will be initiated which I hope will protect what remains of our architectural heritage. Huge mistakes have been made and terrible damage has been done in the past.  We should enact legislation as quickly as possible to ensure no further damage is done.  We must protect everything of importance which we hold dear so that it remains for future generations.  That is an essential part of this issue.</P>
    <P>We must change section 27 because local authorities rarely go to court and if they do so, they often lose.  I have no doubt the same argument applies throughout the country.  People break a planning law and hope the matter will drag on for years without going to court and the local authority will lose interest.  That is wrong.  The local authority should be able to act promptly to stop somebody doing something for which they do not have planning permission.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities are refusing to meet residents' groups or individuals who want to put a case in respect of a planning application on the basis that it gives them an unfair advantage. However, developers often have preplanning meetings to discuss various aspects of what they are planning to do, and that gives them an advantage. I do not see why planners should be able to legally object to local authorities meeting objectors. It is not fair.  It is not good for local government, and it is not good for planning.  If people want to object to or support a development, it is important that they should be allowed to make their case.  It does not necessarily mean that the planner has to comment on it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which should be changed is where objectors are not allowed to mention the environmental aspects of a development in their submission to the local authority, even though the developer requires an EPA licence.  A case in my constituency was eventually turned down by the planning board.  However, had it not been turned down, serious questions would have been raised about the planning process because the reasons for the objections were environmental.  The objectors had access to the Environmental Protection Agency, but they felt strongly that they should have been allowed to mention the environmental reasons for objecting, as well as the planning reasons.  That is something that should be looked at when reviewing the planning regulations.</P>
    <P>In the area of sustainable development, the burden on An Bord Pleanála could be lightened <Col N="62" /> if the development plan stage was more open.  If people could see that certain green field sites would be developed in a sustainable way and had an idea of where a development was going, they would not be afraid of it.  When people see a huge development coming on stream they think it will lead to urban blight, but if they saw the overall plan for the area, if they were assured that the green belts would be kept, they might not be so anxious about it and would not have to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a simple one.  It allows extra people to take up the huge increase in the workload.  I welcome the start of this debate on planning.  We had a foretaste of if today at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government.  Many people will be interested in it. They want openness.  They want the environment protected, and they want to see how it will be developed into the future.  I have no doubt that Members of this House and the general public will have much to say on planning because it is a very important issue.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a relatively straightforward measure to increase the membership of An Bord Pleanála by two members.  The justification is that this is necessary because of a backlog of appeals.  I understand that and have no difficulty with that rationale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have to wonder why this measure has found itself at the top of the priorities of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. A number of pieces of legislation have been promised from his Department dealing, for example, with traveller accommodation, local government funding, electoral reform &mdash; a whole range of issues, all of which are important.  I am puzzled as to why this legislation has taken on the urgency it has.  I agree entirely that if the law states that planning appeals have to be decided within a four month period, they should be decided within a four month period and the necessary resources and measures put in place to do that.  However, there are many other situations where people dealing with Government Departments or with State agencies find themselves in a position which is analogous to that of a developer waiting for a planning appeal to be processed, for example, social welfare applicants waiting for an appeal on a social welfare case, people applying for medical cards, people applying for citizenship, many of whom have to wait for many years, workers who have been dismissed from their employment and whose appeals to the Employment Appeals Tribunal are mounting up, people in many circumstances in our society who find themselves in a queue waiting for attention from a State agency.  I think in particular of people who are ill and who are waiting, in many cases for 12 to 18 months, for essential surgery.  People who find themselves on those waiting lists must be envious indeed of the effect that the construction industry is having in managing not only to get its concerns put to the top of the agenda of the Minister <Col N="63" /> for the Environment and Local Government but apparently put very high on the Government's overall agenda in terms of the ordering of legislation.</P>
    <P>Not only is new legislation being introduced to facilitate the construction industry in getting appeals through An Bord Pleanála, the Minister, apparently, is not even content to wait until the process he proposes to put in place is completed. We are to have two new members appointed to An Bord Pleanála, but the Minister will not wait until they are appointed in the normal way but wants the power to appoint temporary members to the board while the process is being completed. Fair dues indeed to the construction industry who have managed to get action with such urgency from the Minister and from the Government.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are many applicants whose appeals are stacking up in An Bord Pleanála. The Minister informed us that the decision rate dropped from 98 per cent to 82 per cent at the end of last year.  I do not want in any way to justify that and it is right that action should be taken to address it.  Applicants who are waiting for decisions from An Bord Pleanála are straining at the leash to get their appeals dealt with so that they can get construction under way.  I am surprised the Minister did not indicate the representations he had received and from what quarter in relation to the urgency of the legislation.  In the interests of transparency, that information should be put on the record.  I am sure he will not have any difficulty in doing this.  Given that the Bill is essentially a response to an understandable frustration on the part of the construction industry to get development under way and that the House and Government are facilitating the construction industry in ensuring action on the processing of planning appeals, we should give some consideration to the context in which the Bill is put before us.</P>
    <P>No doubt the number of appeals being made to An Bord Pleanála is a reflection of a greater public awareness of planning matters.  However, it is also a reflection of the increased activity in the construction industry.  Not only are there more appeals but there are also more planning applications, many of which are for larger and more complex developments.  I am sure it will be argued, again with some justification, that the increase in construction activity is a reflection of the fabulous state of the economy and that the number of construction cranes one sees along the skyline in Dublin and other cities is to be applauded.  I have no difficulty in welcoming the increased level of construction activity which reflects the increased level of activity in the economy, but who is it benefiting and who will benefit from the speedier processing of planning appeals for which the legislation will provide?</P>
    <P>There are serious questions to be asked about who is benefiting from the level of construction. When one looks at the housing sector one sees it is not the house buyer who is benefiting.  The <Col N="64" /> reality is that first time house buyers are being priced out of the market.  Young couples cannot afford to pay £90,000 or £100,000, the minimum price being asked in Dublin for a standard three bedroom, semi-detached dwelling.  I come across an increasing number of cases where young working couples are overborrowing and committing themselves to mortgages and loans which they will not be able to repay if one of them loses their job.  In other cases people who have worked all their lives and are now living on a pension are giving their pension lump sum or savings to their son or daughter so that they can put a deposit on a house.  Even with this, people are experiencing increasing hardship in terms of their ability to buy a house.  This is driving more people on to local authority housing waiting lists which, in turn, is creating a further crisis at this level.  We are fast reaching the point where a house will be a luxury. This matter must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>The factors contributing to this problem must also be addressed.  Many of the developments which will be fast tracked through the planning appeals process and will be facilitated under the measure before us will be bought by people who will not live in them.  Auctioneers estimate that approximately 20 per cent of the houses which come on the market are bought for investment purposes.  We now have the obscene situation where young couples have to compete for houses with rich investors who buy them and let them for an exorbitant rent to the people they have priced out of the market.  This obscenity is crying out for urgent action.</P>
    <P>Another problem which is contributing to the tendency to buy houses for investment rather than residential purposes is the scandalous decision by the Government in the budget to reduce the level of capital gains tax.  People in the property market have already commented on the degree to which this decision is fuelling the level of speculation and the purchasing of residential property for investment purposes, thereby adding to the grief and problems experienced by people who want to buy houses.</P>
    <P>Given that the legislation will essentially facilitate the construction industry, the Government must address the problem of house prices which increased by 25 per cent last year.  The rate of inflation last year was between 1 and 2 per cent, while the increase in the building cost index was approximately the same.</P>

      <P>Where has the increased profit gone and where is it continuing to go?  It is clear that there is extensive profiteering in the building industry.  Those in the industry, its representatives and perhaps individual applicants who knocked down the Minister's door in an effort to get him to introduce this legislation and to appoint new members to An Bord Pleanála so that appeals could be speeded up will walk away with the huge <Col N="65" /> profits being made in the housing and property market generally.  This problem must be addressed.  If this legislation is being introduced to speed up the processing of planning appeals then, in fairness, the Government needs to introduce legislation which will control, by way of a planning mechanism, a price control mechanism or a fiscal mechanism, what is happening in the housing market and will ensure that the profiteering which is taking place is brought under control and that people will be able to buy a house.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the position of building workers.  Given that there is a boom in the building industry one would expect that among the people who would benefit from it are those who work in the construction industry. Unfortunately, this is not happening.  Working conditions in the construction industry are as bad now as they were 50 years ago and have worsened significantly as the building boom has increased. There are a number of aspects to the problem. In recent months a number of cases have clearly shown that the safety of workers on building sites is not being respected by some builders and construction companies.  We had the appalling situation where people were killed and seriously injured while working on building sites.</P>
      <P>There is also the scandal that a construction company will no longer employ people on the traditional P45 and PRSI system.  They no longer want employees.  They want everyone, from the tradesman to the general operative, to be engaged as a subcontractor using C45s.  That in turn means the ordinary building worker, be he a tradesman or a general operative, finds his working conditions have seriously deteriorated. What would have always been regarded as the standard basic conditions of a building worker &mdash; holiday pay and essential on-site conditions such as canteens and washing and eating facilities &mdash; have been done away with as the P45 system is replaced by the C45 system.  It is even worse because there is now evidence that it is not enough for some building contractors.  Not only is it the case that they will only employ people on the C45 system, in some cases a building worker looking for a start will be asked to take money under the table.  In other words, he will continue to sign on the dole while working for the construction company.  If he is not prepared to agree to that, he is told he is not wanted on the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scandalous situation exists on building sites. The boom in the building industry is evident in all the cranes to be seen around the city.  The time has come for some Department, be it the Minister's or the one dealing with workers' conditions and labour affairs, to investigate what is happening with working and employment conditions in the building industry.  I also believe the time has come for the Government to introduce legislation to ensure decent conditions for those workers putting brick upon brick to create this building boom.  We are told it is generating so much for the economy and so much profit for the <Col N="66" /> developers and building companies concerned.  If they are going to make a huge killing on the sale of houses, if they can increase the price of houses by 25 per cent in a year when inflation has only increased by 1 or 2 per cent, surely they are in a position to pay decent wages and to provide decent working conditions for their employees and building workers on the sites.  That is something the Government must attend to.  If, as a result of this legislation, developers will be facilitated by having their planning appeals heard quickly by An Bord Pleanála so they can start their contracts and get their machinery and people on site more quickly, the <i>quid pro quo</i> should be, first, the control on prices and the control of profiteering in the building industry so that ordinary people can again afford to buy a home of their own, and second, the provision of decent working conditions for people working on the sites.</P>
    <P>By and large, we have a good planning system in this country.  Some of the recent commentary on planning matters might unfortunately lead people to believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with it.  I believe we essentially have a good planning system.  It provides for notice of intent, a period when it is dealt with by the local authority and files are available to the public, a role for the elected members of local authorities and a three tiered appeals system consisting of an inspector, an individual member of the board and the board.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to increasing the membership of An Bord Pleanála, but why does the Minister not simply increase the membership from five to seven instead of having this complicated system of appointments on a temporary basis for five years?  I object to the appointment of temporary members to An Bord Pleanála.  It is not a good idea as it disturbs the balance between the different interests represented.  I will table amendments in that regard on Committee Stage. I have no objection to increasing the membership of the board from five to seven, but it should be done straightforwardly, and there should not be a provision for the appointment of temporary members to the board which would have the effect of disturbing its inherent balance of representation of different interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a response to a need of which public representatives at various levels will be aware.  The Minister and his Department are to be commended for responding quickly to a situation many of us believed was getting out of control.  Every applicant for planning permission, or every appellant if it is a third party, has the right to due process under the law.  An inevitable danger existed, given the four months' time constraint &mdash; a relatively new development &mdash; and the huge workload of the board, that applicants and others would believe it was not possible for their applications to be given the consideration they deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> The figures the Minister gave for the extent of the workload make interesting reading.  About 2,800 cases were heard in 1995 and about 3,500 in 1996. Some 4,500 are expected in 1998.  That is a huge increase.  On the one hand, it reflects the positive developments in the economy and the level of activity.  On the other, it shows up in some ways the various shortcomings in councils, Departments and elsewhere.  With that kind of increase in numbers, it is only natural that the response period has slowed down.  It is interesting that it was as high as 98 per cent and has since slipped to the low 80s.  That is a significant slowing down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore outlined the perceived benefits for builders and developers in having the process speeded up.  He is probably right to some extent, but they would not by any means be the only ones who would benefit.  It is only fair to take a more balanced approach.  Many of us are aware of projects in our constituencies which were delayed for various reasons and which in turn created concern that jobs in tourism projects or industry might be threatened.  Those implications were not recognised and neither was the problem of the escalating cost of new houses due to demand significantly outstripping supply.</P>
    <P>I made the point at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government that there seemed to be a certain number of third party objections which were entirely frivolous or vexatious or arose from some local development far removed from planning.  I made the point that it ought to be possible to find a mechanism for quickly assessing the merits of a case when it comes before the board.  I accept what I say has implications for the time of the board and of individual planners, but it seems the downside of a system which allows third party objections &mdash; something I support in principle &mdash; is that it encourages people on rare occasions to make frivolous or vexatious objections.  A speedy response in those cases is possible.  It ought to be the policy of the board to determine whether there is weight in planning terms to a case being made rather than letting it run for the four month period.  If there is not weight to it, it should be dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>In the past two years planning staff have experienced an enormous increase in their workload. A planner gets to know and get a feel for an area and, in conjunction with their technical training, this gives them the capacity to deal speedily with applications.</P>
    <P>The rate of applications has been increasing in most councils.  However, the staffing level has not increased.  In the first instance, the pressure has been for the development of a new county development plan.  A substantial number of councils who would normally have reviewed their plans every five years, are now running seven to ten year plans.  This is undesirable.</P>
    <P>There have been enormous changes in the manner in which the planning process operates. This is the first point at which the crisis in the <Col N="68" /> local government system arises.  The next point at which it arises is when the number of planners is not sufficient to deal with the volume of applications. Given the two month time constraint, it is inevitable that planning staff look for more information at a late stage.  This angers applicants and increases the workload for councils and Deputies who try to have matters addressed. They talk to the planners and waste even more time.  The most effective way to deal with planning is at local level.  However, the trained, permanent staff are needed to ensure the process runs more smoothly, that county development plans are back on the planning agenda and that the background technical work is undertaken.</P>
    <P>There has been an extraordinary change in the public's perception of the planning process and in the level of interest in particular planning developments. Developments which would not have excited any interest five or ten years ago are now the focus of attention for groups of concerned citizens.  I would not wish to denigrate their role. However, there has been a sea change in how third party citizens view their relationship to particular planning applications.  I have no difficulty understanding this when those raising objections live within the immediate area of the proposal but I have some qualms about those who live many miles away having an input.  I cannot rustle up enthusiasm for that kind of behaviour, particulary in the context of the huge social problems which exist.  I would prefer if these problems received proper attention.</P>
    <P>The increase in the pressure for policy on land use lies behind the Minister's proposal to increase the membership of the board.  County and town development plans have not been reviewed in recent times.  Land which was thought to be adequate has been found to be inadequate to meet the demand for development.  One result of this is that those fortunate to own land designated for housing or commercial development have seen the value of their property escalate.  This may be a factor in the huge cost of new houses faced by young couples.  Perhaps there is a need to examine the effects of land use policy on house prices generally.</P>
    <P>We must address the fact that huge numbers of young people find it impossible to buy houses.  It has been the tradition that a substantial number of people aspire to own their homes.  Many have succeeded but more and more people are now finding themselves unable to do so.  The burden of providing housing falls on the State.  It must provide a huge number of local authority houses. The Minister of State's allocation for this year includes a response to this requirement. However, health boards also incur huge costs in providing rent allowances to those in private rented accommodation.  There is an urgent need to address this problem at national level.  It has the capacity to be an enormous drain on the State's resources.</P>
    <P>In the context of builders making huge profits, there have been allegations that they are treating <Col N="69" /> their workers badly, that there is malpractice and that social welfare recipients are being hired and not paying taxes.  This must be addressed. Officials in Departments involved in this area must be vigilant.  Those who make allegations in public and who appear to be in possession of facts ought to bring this information to the attention of the relevant authorities.  There are officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who deal severely with such malpractice. The Health and Safety Authority also deals with other allegations.  It is not enough to say that these practices exist if we are not prepared to go a step further and bring them to the attention of those responsible for dealing with them.  This is a part of Irish life in which we have fallen down badly.  No matter who the culprits are, they ought to be made accountable.  These practices cannot be tolerated, whether in terms of safety or tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the large number of appeals referred to the board and the relatively small number challenged in the courts.  This may be due to the cost of challenging a decision in court.  However, the Minister is correct to state that another factor is that people tend to accept the board's decisions because of its independence and transparency.  I experienced one An Bord Pleanála public oral hearing and was not impressed by the procedure.  It concerned the proposal by the Commissioners of Irish Lights to erect a mast at Loop Head, County Clare.  The hearing did not seem to be run in a professional manner and the decision was subsequently challenged in court and found not to have been in accordance with correct procedures. One factor in this may have been the pressure on staff and the number of board members.  An oral hearing can take several days and involves a large amount of staff time.  On the other hand, the value of an oral hearing is that people feel it is an advantage to be able to put their case professionally and personally. This adds to the sense that the case has been dealt with fairly and openly.  This is entering into a different debate on the role of An Bord Pleanála but perhaps that is warranted.  Perhaps a debate on who the nominating bodies should be or on the balance between the representation of the various nominating bodies is warranted. I urge the Minister to return to this issue in the future.  The role of An Bord Pleanála has become much more important than was perceived in the past and the composition of the board ought to be examined in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the submission from the staff of An Bord Pleanála, referred to by the Minister, to the effect that they would like to be considered for interim positions on the board.  I do not know on what basis they made that proposal. They clearly feel they are much more <i>au fait</i> with cases, and planners who have dealt with a case and made a recommendation would undoubtedly feel their judgment was questioned if it was overturned by the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> In view of the time constraints placed on the Minister under existing legislation he is right to make interim appointments.  If he does not do that, more and more cases will be backlogged and it will be more difficult to return to the desirable situation of 100 per cent of cases being dealt with within the four month period.  We should aspire to reaching that position as quickly as possible.  I do not agree that the only beneficiaries of such a situation are developers.  Many genuine applicants who are dissatisfied with the decision of the local authority and who refer their cases to the board are entitled to have a timescale within which their cases are heard.  Third party objectors, some of whom may have a frivolous objection but the vast majority of whom have a genuine interest, are also entitled to have cases decided within the specified time and to due process, with a sufficient level of staff and board time available to deal with their cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Deirdre Clune.  I welcome the Bill.  I understand it is the Minister's first time to introduce legislation in the current Dáil.  The Bill is not the most mesmerising legislation the western world has ever seen.  It is archaic that a Minister has to come before the House to increase the numbers on a board.  If a problem exists, and there is an obvious problem in the case of An Bord Pleanála in terms of the number of applications and appeals coming before it, the Minister should be able to appoint people.  It seems wholly anachronistic for the House to spend two hours tonight, two hours tomorrow, an hour on Committee Stage and a further hour on Report Stage dealing with this legislation.  The Bill will not fundamentally change the powers of An Bord Pleanála &mdash; it simply increases the numbers on the board.  Perhaps as a new Member of the House I am naive.</P>
      <P>We have a good and democratic planning process which is open to the public.  In comparisons with other European countries our planning process comes out on top.  This is the way it should be and anything that can be done to make it more open, transparent and democratic should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an attitude in society which tends to criticise every proposal, every development and every idea for industrial development and additional housing.  There is a mentality, summed up in the phrase &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo;, which is unfortunately seeping through Irish society. While people are understandably and rightly concerned about what happens on their doorstep, we have to achieve a balance.  Frequently that balance determines whether we can have additional jobs in an area and whether the supply of houses can be increased in order to deal with the insatiable demand which Deputy Gilmore spoke about.  There must be a balance.  One of the ways of achieving that balance, which is central to this Bill, is by changing the process of negotiations <Col N="71" /> and discussions which take place between local authorities and communities.</P>
    <P>Far too often in the past local authorities have been seen as alien to the work of local communities. A year before a development plan is published local authority development departments should take upon themselves the task of speaking directly to the people in the communities concerned to find out in precise terms their ideas for the development of their area.  A classic and innovative example of this can be found in Dublin South-West, my own constituency, where the Saggart Community Council went to the South Dublin County Council, perhaps the only group in south County Dublin to do so, with an outline of what it wanted rezoned and how it wanted its area developed.  It outlined the needs for additional housing and small industrial units and presented its own thoughts on the matter.  This example has, unfortunately, not been replicated in other local authority areas.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about producing a development plan of which people feel a sense of ownership, local authorities, and central Government through guidelines, must do everything in their power to ensure the people are involved from the earliest possible stage.  If we ensured that more of this type of work was carried out there would be less need for appeals and applications through An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious need for additional board members, something this side of the House recognises. The Minister alluded to the fact that he intends introducing two additional people in 1998.  What happens if there is a need for more members?  I understand the situation is unwieldy. The five board members and the chairman have to read all the documentation which comes before the board.  This is a huge task considering the 4,000 applications which came before An Bord Pleanála in the past year.  The Minister should get on with the job of appointing additional people in the future if the need arises to ensure a reduction in the amount of time taken to deal with appeals.</P>
    <P>Appeals are becoming more and more complex. For the first time we have started to cop on to the idea of sustainability.  For the first time in recent years the question of environmental impact statements have been to the fore in many third party appeals.  In the context of the docklands in Dublin and the so-called brown field sites, it is no longer a question of one appeal but rather must be seen in the context of a variety of other developments.  Appeals are becoming increasingly complex because, for the first time, we are beginning to realise that developments have a wider context, particularly in relation to sustainability.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the appeals process to ensure applications are thoroughly gone through and that decisions are arrived at in a speedy fashion.  One of the most disappointing aspects over the past year or so, highlighted in the report <Col N="72" /> of An Bord Pleanála, is the increasing number of appeals and the frustration of the board that it cannot deal with the additional workload being placed upon it.</P>
    <P>It is very good to have an open and democratic planning process supported by everybody.  People feel at home with it in and have a sense of ownership of it.  However, Deputy Killeen raised the interesting point that if somebody from Malin Head has an objection to a development in my constituency or in the Dublin area, they have as much right to appeal against a decision of the local authority as anybody else.  We should think about this.  While it is a democratic principle, I wonder whether it is sensible or realistic.  Should we ask whether there are commercial interests driving the appeals decisions?  Are commercial applications being made to An Bord Pleanála opposing various decisions by local authorities in order to delay developments taking place?</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann</P>
      <P>recalling the serious public concern which arose from the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments) published on 25 August 1997, which established that irregular payments were made to, and benefits conferred on, certain persons who were Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas between 1 January, 1986 and 31 December, 1996,</P>
      <P>noting that the tribunal established that money was held on deposit in certain Irish banks by offshore banks in memorandum accounts (the Ansbacher accounts) for the benefit of Irish residents including Mr. Charles Haughey (the history of which deposits is set out in chapter 6 of the report of the tribunal),</P>
      <P>noting further that the Dunnes payments tribunal was unable by reason of its terms of reference to investigate the source of the Ansbacher accounts, other than in respect of sums paid by certain persons referred to in the said terms of reference,</P>
      <P>having regard to additional and serious public concern arising from the circumstances in which up to thirty-eight million pounds were held in the Ansbacher accounts outside the supervision of both the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>resolves that it is expedient that the tribunal of inquiry established by the Taoiseach pursuant to a resolution passed by the House <Col N="73" /> on 11 September, 1997, should inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of the Dáil and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following additional definite matter of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>the circumstances, considerations and motives relating to the creation, beneficial ownership and management of the Ansbacher accounts, for the purposes of investigating and reporting as to whether there has been any evasion of tax, contravention of exchange controls or other illegal activity associated with those accounts and making whatever recommendations it considers appropriate to prevent such a mechanism being used to avoid the payment of tax or to contravene exchange controls.</P>
    <P>and further resolves that the tribunal be requested to conduct these further inquiries in accordance with the procedures set out in the said resolution of 11 September 1997, and in particular examine in public hearings, if it so decides, any account holders or beneficial owners of Ansbacher accounts, where there is evidence that there may have been evasion of tax, contravention of exchange controls or other illegal activity associated with these accounts.</P>
    <P>I propose to share my time equally with Deputies Quinn, De Rossa and Sargent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael is moving this motion, with our colleagues in the Labour Party, Democratic Left and the Green Party because we want to see all irregularities in the operation and use of the Ansbacher accounts fully and publicly investigated.  We believe the best place to do this is through the Moriarty tribunal.  If this investigation demonstrates irregularities that may have been used by other banks, these should also be identified by the tribunal and thoroughly investigated by the appropriate authorities.</P>
      <P>The purpose of our motion is simple.  We want the Moriarty tribunal to investigate the Ansbacher accounts to discover any tax evasion by any users of these accounts and to conduct a public inquiry into the tax evasion by such identified individuals.  This motion is designed to require the tribunal to investigate all the accounts initially as part of its private examination and then to conduct a public inquiry into those accounts where <i>prima facie</i> evidence of tax evasion or exchange control breaches exists.  This motion is not confined to investigating procedures alone.  It also allows for investigation of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believes this approach is a fair one. Tax law abiding citizens should not have a public inquiry into their affairs just because other people <Col N="74" /> to whom they have no connection happened to use the same banking facility for an improper purpose.  Fine Gael believes that to do otherwise would be to run the risk of undermining Ireland's financial services industry.  This was the approach we took on various amendments which came before the Dáil last September and it is fully reflected in today's agreed motion.  Our balanced and reasonable approach will tackle malpractice in these areas while protecting the interests of people involved in entirely legitimate transactions who have complied fully with all aspects of the law.  The approach we propose may well result in all Ansbacher depositors being named, but only after due process has been completed.</P>
    <P>Many Irish companies have bank accounts abroad.  The vast majority of these accounts are quite legitimate.  Indeed, the website of one of our national newspapers carries an advertisement for offshore bank accounts today.</P>
    <P>As globalisation of world business grows, Ireland is in the lucky position of having several Irish companies who are now major players in world business.  A witch hunt against all Irish owned bank accounts abroad, without any <i>prima facie</i> evidence to suggest they might be set up to avoid the Central Bank or Revenue Commissioners, could do fatal damage to our economic progress as fairness and due process would go out the window and be replaced by prurient zealotry.</P>
    <P>In seeking to supplement the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal at this stage, Fine Gael has received legal advice that supports our view that this can indeed be done.  Section 1 of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 contains the following phrase:</P>
    <P>Where it has been resolved . it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter described in the Resolution as of urgent public importance, and in pursuance of the Resolution a tribunal is appointed . the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed or any instrument supplemental thereto may provide that this Act shall apply, and in such case the tribunal shall have all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the High Court.</P>
    <P>It is therefore our view that the legislature, by this reference in the 1921 Act as to how the terms of reference might be contained in a &ldquo;supplemental instrument&rdquo;, clearly envisaged that a tribunal remit could be supplemented.  The legislation clearly envisaged the possibility of the Oireachtas supplementing the terms of reference of a tribunal as we propose it should do in the case of the Moriarty tribunal.  Our case for the motion is further supported because the tribunal, although established and active, has not gone into any public hearings.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney has appointed an officer of her Department under section 19 of the Companies <Col N="75" /> Act, 1990 to investigate possible wrongdoing involving the Ansbacher deposits.  I am concerned that the Government, by its amendment to this motion, is giving the misleading impression that the Tánaiste's inquiry will have the same ultimate effect as the motion we have tabled.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>No matter what it contains, the Tánaiste, under section 19, will not be able to publish the results of the inquiry.  Even if it is discovered that the Ansbacher accounts were used by individuals or companies to evade tax, the Tánaiste, under section 19, will not be able to disclose detailed information as to the identity of those individuals or companies.  She will not be able to disclose the content of the report in any respect.  The Tánaiste, under section 19, will only be able to hand the report over in confidence to bodies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank or set up another inspection process under a different section which could, after a long period, possibly involve publication.  It would be very wrong for anyone to suggest that just because the Tánaiste's report might contain names, that somehow those names will get out and that will suffice.  If those names were to get out that would be a clear breach of section 19.  Section 19, under which the Tánaiste is currently acting, obliges absolute confidentiality.  The names of the people who have been involved in illegality, if discovered as a result of the Tánaiste's inquiry under section 19, cannot be released.  There can be no public accountability by those individuals on foot of the inquiry initiated under section 19 by the Tánaiste. In contrast, the motion in my name and the names of Deputies Quinn, De Rossa and Sargent will allow for public accountability by individuals involved in tax evasion if those individuals are individuals in respect of whom <i>prima facie</i> evidence of tax evasion exists.  If such evidence does not exist, their names will not be published.  That is a fair approach and it is a much better approach than the Tánaiste's which simply involves getting a confidential report which may not be published in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will agree the motion is the best and fairest way to proceed in addressing the serious public concern which arose following publication of the McCracken report and the more recent revelations over last weekend of the possible further use of offshore investment schemes by Irish companies or citizens to evade tax in an organised way.</P>
    <P>We are not proposing this motion in a confrontational, aggressive or finger pointing way.  We believe the motion is a measured and responsible approach to ensure the truth on matters of grave national concern is put before the people.  We have seen an erosion of public confidence in those who serve in public life.  The misguided opposition of the Government to our motion will unfortunately do nothing to diminish that lack of confidence.  I do not impugn the motives of the Government in its approach.  I am not suggesting <Col N="76" /> there is any improper motivation in the approach it is taking in this matter although I deeply regret it.  The Government would be well advised to heed what we are saying.  The Opposition motion is the best way to proceed.  It is the best way to protect the reputation of all involved in politics and ensure the Government is not subject to, probably, unfair criticism of its motivation.  It has been ill advised in the suggestion made by spokespersons that the terms of reference could not be altered.  It is manifest that the terms of reference can be altered &mdash; the Tribunals of Inquiry Act envisages an alteration in the terms of reference.  The terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal refer to the possibility of the tribunal seeking an alteration in its terms of reference.  If the tribunal can seek an alteration, the Dáil can grant it and, therefore, the Dáil can make such a change.</P>
    <P>The Government has been badly advised.  I suggest it should reconsider the matter in the next two days, in its own interest, in the national interest and in the interest of politics, and accept this reasonable motion from the Opposition parties, which we have discussed in a full and thorough way.  We have reached a compromise.  All the concerns in the Government's mind were also concerns in the minds of many of us on the Opposition benches.  We have put forward a balanced proposal and I hope the Government will accept it.</P>

      <P>Last September the Labour Party sought to have the Ansbacher accounts included in the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal. We did so because we believe there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the moneys held in those accounts are there for the purpose of evading tax.  Our society and social partnership in particular are held together on the basis that all pay their fair share.  When there is evidence to suggest some are not complying with that basic obligation, such information should be made available to the rest of the public as a matter of right.</P>
      <P>The Government has displayed scant regard for the spirit of social partnership.  Partnership, by definition, means everybody sharing an equal burden in society.  In the past six months we have seen more than sufficient evidence that the Government fails to understand this basic requirement of citizenship.  In September it voted down our attempts to have the accounts under discussion come within the terms of the Moriarty tribunal.  Recent newspaper reports have indicated that the Revenue Commissioners are in possession of information indicating that many of our wealthier citizens are paying little or no tax. In the past week information has come to light that one of the country's four major banks may have colluded with its customers to use offshore accounts to avoid tax liabilities.  Accusations have been made that a Member of this House played an active part in that process.  Those accusations have met with a deafening silence despite calls by Members that the issue be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Admittedly, these issues are not all of this Government's making, but it is answerable for the lack of action to deal with them.  Its decision not to allow the Moriarty tribunal to fully investigate the Ansbacher accounts has undermined confidence among the public in the Government's policing of tax evasion.  The Government has done nothing since September to help restore confidence.  Its policy seems to be one of absolute obfuscation.  Neither does it appear the Government is united on the issue.  Soon after voting down the inclusion of these accounts in the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal, the Tánaiste initiated her own investigation.  Newspaper reports seem to indicate that some progress is being made by the investigator appointed by her, but the question remains, if something is worth investigating now, why was that not the case in September?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's investigation and I hope it bears fruit, but we have no guarantee that the report of that investigation will be published. It is a poor second to the examination of these accounts by the tribunal.  Central to this whole issue is the restoration of public confidence in our policing procedures.  The limitation of the process initiated by the Tánaiste is that it lacks this key element.  As Deputy Bruton indicated, her findings can be made public only during court procedures initiated by the DPP.  If the DPP decides not to initiate a prosecution, for whatever legal reason, there is no accountability.</P>
    <P>The Government is, of course, seeking to hide behind legal advice to prevent a proper investigation of these accounts.  I dispute that the terms of reference of the tribunal cannot be amended, and I support Deputy Bruton's analysis in that regard.  I believe &mdash; I have taken legal advice on this &mdash; that the governing legislation, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, seems specifically to recognise the possibility of amending resolutions.  The terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal also provide for that possibility. The 1921 Act refers to &lsquo;the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed or any instrument supplemental thereto&rsquo;.  The only reason a supplemental instrument would be required would be to amend, by addition, variation or repeal, the terms of the original instrument.  The Minister is clearly wrongly advised, if the advice he has received is that the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal cannot be amended.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Government is adopting the present position.  By its action it gives the impression it has something to hide from a full and proper investigation of these accounts.  Perhaps that is the case, but the Government should clarify that point.  Its failure to accept this motion will add to that suspicion.</P>
    <P>The Government contends that the primary focus of the tribunal is to investigate &lsquo;allegations of irregular payments made to and benefits conferred on certain persons in public life&rsquo;.  That is the case, and by its actions the Government has sought to ensure it can go no further, but in so <Col N="78" /> doing it has created a situation which now forms the basis of the legal challenge to the tribunal's work.  I reject the challenge to the tribunal initiated by Mr. Charles Haughey.  This House has a right to investigate whether political benefits accrued to donors to the former Taoiseach and, if it so chooses, to do that in isolation.  It is a right in principle which must be defended vigorously by this House.  To suggest, as the Government seeks to do, that this is a reason other related illegal activity should not be investigated by the tribunal is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>In regard to that case, I would like to disassociate myself from the manner in which the Government has chosen to remove the Clerks of both Houses of the Oireachtas from the action. The claim is, apparently, to be made on their behalf by the Attorney General that resolutions of the Houses are immune from judicial review. This line of defence has been initiated without consultation with Members of either House.  The resolution is not the property of the Government but of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and any change in the position should, at least out of courtesy, have been made following consultation with representatives of the parties.  While I do not believe that the resolutions passed by the Houses in this instance are invalid, as a matter of principle, resolutions of the Houses must be capable of challenge.  Since Acts can be struck down, why does the same not apply to resolutions?  It is tantamount to claiming for Dáil Éireann the same pompous and archaic privileges enjoyed by the High Court of Parliament sitting in the Palace of Westminster.</P>
    <P>The choice before this House is a clear one. The Opposition parties have come together to indicate our total opposition to the course being inexplicably pursued by the Government.  No doubt the Government has approached the Independents who support it and have claimed it must win the vote on this motion.  It is a sad indictment of the Government that it is actively seeking to implicate others in this calumny.  I call on every Member of this House to exercise his or her independent judgment and to do what is right.  The Government will not fall because of a vote in support of this motion.</P>
    <P>Political commentators have rightly identified social partnership as central to our recent economic success.  Social partnership is rooted in two concepts.  One is the acceptance by workers of limited pay increases in return for reductions in tax paid by them.  The Government has already introduced a budget which flies in the face of the spirit of that agreement, a budget which is specifically designed to benefit the well off, but social partnership is also based on equity.  A key component is that all individuals pay their fair share of tax.  Tonight's motion gives each Member of the House the opportunity to publicly reaffirm his or her commitment to those values.  It will reflect no honour on the House if we fail to do so.</P>

      <P>Whatever the motivation, the decision to exclude from the remit of the Moriarty tribunal private individuals who were holders of the Ansbacher accounts was wrong.  Democratic Left sought, by way of an amendment, to extend the remit of the Moriarty tribunal, but unfortunately the Government chose to vote down a similar amendment from the Labour Party.  Effectively, the decision we made that evening conferred retrospective approval of tax evasion.  We do not know that all private holders of Ansbacher deposits were doing so for illegal purposes, but the preliminary private stage of the tribunal process would have established that, without risk to the standing of any individual whose sole purpose was sanctioned legitimate commercial transactions.  It was misleading to put forward the reasons offered by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government for not pursuing these private account holders and simply untrue to put abroad the canard that the Revenue Commissioners could use their powers to investigate the tax status of those account holders.  Without knowing the identity of the beneficial owners of those accounts, the Revenue Commissioners were precluded from conducting an effective investigation.  Whatever the motivation of the private account holders &mdash; it is difficult to put an innocent construction on it &mdash; they all went to extreme lengths to conceal their identities and that remains the position despite Government utterances to the contrary.</P>
      <P>I expect the use of the Tánaiste's powers under the Companies Act will be more productive, but she is precluded from making public the findings. I believe I was the last person in the House to use section 19 of the Companies Act in the case of the Clonmannon investigation.  I was precluded by law from publishing the report of the officer concerned.  I used it subsequently to seek a liquidation of Clonmannon in the courts.  I got the liquidation, but the information in the report was not made public.  I ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to state tonight if advice has been taken on whether the Tánaiste is free to make a copy of her official's report, when she receives it, available to the tribunal of inquiry.  If she is precluded from doing so, the value of tonight's motion is all the more evident.  Even if she is so permitted &mdash; I want the Minister to deal with that point &mdash; it is still inescapable that further inquiry into the implications of her findings will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will repeat a number of questions I raised previously. Was the late Mr. Traynor the only accountant offering his expertise to wealthy clients and was Guinness Mahon the only bank involved in facilitating such clients?  The latest offshore controversy involving National Irish Bank seems to give a clear answer.  I have recently got to know Deputy Cooper-Flynn and I acknowledge that my native county has acquired a formidable advocate.  In my little knowledge of her I do not believe anybody could accuse her of reticence.  I hope she will take the opportunity of <Col N="80" /> this debate to inform us of the motivation behind the mechanism being marketed by National Irish Bank.</P>
    <P>It appears the rich and wealthy are not satisfied with the various boltholes available to them to avoid tax and resort to these dodgy schemes to optimise their returns and evade tax.  Meanwhile hundreds of tax compliant citizens marched on the streets of our cities and towns protesting at the unfair share of the tax burden they have had to bear.  We now know the answers.</P>
    <P>The identities and tax status of the beneficial owners of the Ansbacher deposits are not the only issues that require examination if there is to be equality before the law.  We need to give the Moriarty tribunal every encouragement and support to establish the benefactors of Mr. Haughey, other than Mr. Dunne.  This is not for the purpose of assuaging some prurient curiosity to reveal who funded the conspicuous lifestyle of a person now retired from public life.  Rather it is to establish if the munificence of Mr. Haughey's benefactors was entirely disinterested, or if favours were granted in return.  This is an awesome undertaking because it is not, as some commentators seem to believe, simply a matter of raking over old contracts.  Rather it requires an examination of at least certain Government and legislative decisions that may have conferred significant advantages on persons who were also benefactors.</P>
    <P>The House should assist the tribunal where possible in focusing on areas that might be productive, given what we already know.  In this regard, has consideration been given to an examination of decisions surrounding the manner in which the bloodstock industry has evolved in the past 30 years?  Was the former Taoiseach a bloodstock producer?  What transactions transpired between him and two individuals in particular, Mr. Lawrence Goodman and Mr. John Magnier? Is there a record of those transactions?  Both men or their enterprises have benefited to the tune of millions of pounds from decisions made by Governments in which Mr. Haughey was a key, if not the key, player.  In the case of Mr. Goodman's enterprise, enormous benefits were conferred by the monopolisation of the export credit insurance scheme and access to section 84 loans.  Mr. Magnier was also enabled to establish a monopoly and benefit from hugely advantageous tax breaks.  On 10 September last I suggested that both gentlemen should be invited to make a statement setting out whether they could be of assistance to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Since I raised the bloodstock producer entanglements in the House on 11 September, I note an article published in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 25 January where it is claimed that Mr. Magnier &ldquo;has made regular financial contributions to Fianna Fail over the past 20 years&rdquo; and that his &ldquo;£100m fortune has been built on tax breaks introduced by Haughey as Finance Minister 28 years ago&rdquo;.  Mr. Magnier's dominant position is directly attributable to the extraordinarily generous <Col N="81" /> tax regime introduced by Mr. Haughey. The <i>Sunday Times</i> story records that &ldquo;there is no suggestion of impropriety on the part of Magnier&rdquo; and that must be the case until the nature of the connection is fully inquired into.</P>
    <P>It is no longer argued that there would be a flight of capital from this country if the scope of the tribunal had been broadened.  By way of illustration, I will quote from recent articles in the <i>Herald Tribune</i> and the <i>Financial Times.</i>  The <i>Herald Tribune</i> of 8 October 1997 states:</P>
    <P>A Dresdner Bank AG management board member, Hans-Guenther Adenauer, said Tuesday he would resign after prosecutors raided his home in a widening investigation into whether Germany's largest banks helped clients evade taxes by concealing assets abroad.</P>
    <P>There is no tiptoeing around the tulips in Germany or flight of international capital.  An article in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 4 November 1997 states:</P>
    <P>.president of Kredietbank SA Luxembourgeoise, was held in a Brussels jail after his detention in connection with an investigation into an alleged tax dodge involving billions of francs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, that argument does not stand up and I trust the Minister will not purvey it tonight.</P>
    <P>I also have had legal advice to the effect that it is possible to amend the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  The public demands to be reassured that it is not open to wealthy and powerful individuals to buy shares in the Government and dictate decisions, irrespective of the common good.  It demands to be reassured that there is not one law for the rich and another for the rest.  It demands to be reassured that our democracy cannot be purchased no matter how impetuously generous the supermarket owner or dominant the beef baron, how many Japanese trucks are imported, how many stallions are at stud or how many accounts are held in exotic offshore islands.  That is what is at issue tonight.  In setting up a tribunal constrained only to inquire into the affairs of two former office holders we may have fooled ourselves.  This motion is proof positive that we have not fooled the public.  We and the pro-Government Independent Deputies in particular have an opportunity to make amends tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party welcomes the co-sponsoring of this motion and it is grateful to Fine Gael for making its Private Members' time available for this important debate.  The Green Party is especially pleased that the spirit and content of this agreed motion is close to the amendments suggested by Deputy Gormley and me when the Dáil convened to debate this issue in special session last September.  Then, as now, the Government failed to grasp the degree of public concern about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not simply that a number of public representatives have been compromised by the <Col N="82" /> receipt of payments or that politics and the concept of public service has become badly tarnished as a result.  It is also that the public believes validly that there are those who see themselves as a privileged elite for whom the normal rules and regulations which govern our society are to be ignored or, at best, treated with scorn and indifference. &ldquo;Taxes are for the little people&rdquo; characterised the attitude of a famous American tax evader who was convicted and imprisoned. However, in Ireland those who feel and act in a similar way continue to go unidentified and their contempt is unrecorded.</P>
    <P>The focus of today's motion is to deal with the discovered accounts at Ansbacher Bank.  I was recently asked, half seriously, whether Ansbacher was the German word for back-hander.  If it were, it would give the most plausible explanation as to the purpose of these accounts, especially if the Government persists in its opposition to the collective views of the four parties tabling this motion.  Far from the prying eyes of the State this money was allowed to accumulate so that it could not be used by the Government to provide essential social services, which even in this era of the tiger economy are not what they should be.  I do not need to enumerate the long list of areas which need finance.</P>
    <P>This is a modest motion.  From what we know from the McCracken report the Ansbacher accounts represent but the tip of an ugly iceberg. The previous tribunal revealed the astounding information that about £8 billion is banked abroad and offshore by Irish citizens.  This is a figure which equates to about half the Government's annual budget.  Some of this banking is facilitated by our banking regulations.  We hope that National Irish Bank will clarify the motivation behind its operations which were reported last Sunday.</P>
    <P>Much is done to spite the State.  We learn daily how the practice of offshore banking is prevalent among many of our citizens and is facilitated by many Irish financial institutions.  On one level there is a need to examine the banking laws and to remove any loopholes.  However, we also need to deal with people who consider themselves above legal niceties.</P>
    <P>The recently established tribunal of inquiry should have the power to discover these facts. There is a fear that its ability to begin its deliberations fully is compromised by the terms of reference agreed to date by the House.  The Government's arguments about bringing about the necessary changes in the terms of reference of the tribunal are weak and deserve to be brushed aside.  Stating that terms of reference once agreed cannot be changed, as if it were a sacrosanct legal principle, is a nonsense.  We need only look at the way the office of the independent counsel in the US operates to see how terms of reference must be adaptable if the object is the full and rigorous pursuit of truth and justice.</P>
    <P>Weaker still is the Government's contention that the new tribunal has necessary powers implied in its current terms of reference.  If we <Col N="83" /> have learned anything from previous tribunals, such as the beef tribunal and the original payments to politicians tribunal, it is that unless terms of reference are explicitly stated those charged with reporting the outcome of such tribunals will not stray beyond their stated terms of reference, even if they come into the possession of damaging and important information.  It was this constraint that made Mr. Justice McCracken refer the issue of the Ansbacher accounts for consideration by another tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Government also points to the reports commissioned at the behest of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Green Party commends her for commissioning such reports but it should be pointed out that such reports will be compiled under legislative constraints and need not be published. Thanks to the &ldquo;skipgate&rdquo; saga we know some of the extent of the Progressive Democrats funding and the extent to which their decision making has been compromised while in Government.  This should be an incentive for the Tánaiste to ensure that the affairs of all political parties are similarly brought into the open.  However, I suspect her partners in Government may not be as willing to be as transparent in their dealings.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste needs to consider the extent to which the philosophy of her party, which has created an impression that tax is theft and that tax collection is at times somehow immoral, has contributed to the evasion culture, a culture which needs independent and thorough investigation to restore public confidence in our political and financial systems.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the Government is being less than open on this issue.  It might be that it would be embarrassed by the revelation of names or that it might anticipate political damage from such revelations or that donated moneys might have to be returned if such donations were subsequently proven to have been given by people shown to have been evading tax.  Whatever the Government's motives, there is a need for its constituent parties, particularly Fianna Fáil, to realise that the belief that their party interests coincide with the national interest is not now nor has it ever been a political truth.</P>
    <P>It may be that the House needs to further amend the terms of reference.  The secrets that have been uncovered need careful examination and if the onion unpeels to reveal new surprising layers, so to speak, the tribunal needs to be empowered fully to discover the significance of any new information.  The Government proposes a permanent commission to examine ethics in public life.  The Green Party believes that such a commission is needed and would be welcomed. We do not believe that it would reduce the need for this tribunal or any subsequent tribunal.  What is at stake is to try to unravel the all too close relationship between our political system and those who carry vested financial interests.  The damage done to the political system through <Col N="84" /> these allegations and controversies has meant that they cannot be resolved solely through the political system itself.  I appeal to the Government to allow Mr. Justice Moriarty to do his job to the most effective degree by allowing the tribunal to have stronger terms of reference as proposed in this motion.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Independent Members who have supported the Government to date to support this motion and respond in a way the people expect.  Let us provide a working example of how the House can work collectively, rejecting the Government versus Opposition model, at least this once, in the national interest, and begin the slow climb to a level of respectability in public life to which the people are entitled.</P>

    <P>The terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal were presumably discussed by the Fine Gael Front Bench and parliamentary party before Fine Gael decided to endorse them.

      <P>The motion before the House betrays an alarming ignorance of the law governing tribunals of inquiry.  The legislation governing such tribunals makes it clear that a tribunal of inquiry can be established when the Houses of the Oireachtas are satisfied that there are definite matters of urgent public importance which necessitate establishing a tribunal to investigate them and report back to both Houses.  The Moriarty tribunal was established to investigate the definite matters of urgent public importance specified in the resolution passed by both Houses. The terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal expressly provide that the tribunal may, by means of an interim report, draw to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil any matter it considers appropriate, including any matter relating to its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The motion seeks to revise those terms of reference without any such report or request from the tribunal.  We are now being asked to change the terms of reference in what would be a very ill advised attempt to influence the outcome of proceedings currently before the courts.  If this motion were passed, it would mean that what the Houses of the Oireachtas consider, or do not consider, to be definite matters of urgent public importance would be shown to be influenced, if not determined, by a litigant dissatisfied by a resolution of the Oireachtas.  Far from copperfastening the Moriarty tribunal, such a course would almost certainly expose the tribunal to further legal challenge and delay.  Furthermore, a decision to establish a tribunal of inquiry or to vary the terms of reference of an already established tribunal is not a decision to be taken lightly.</P>

It may <Col N="87" /> be that the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank, with the assistance of other State agencies, are or will be in a position to get to the bottom of such aspects of these accounts as are relevant in the context of the duties of those agencies.  If they are, then it is impossible to say that having those matters investigated by a tribunal of inquiry is a definite matter of urgent public importance.</P>

      <P>In short, and as is prescribed by law, tribunals of inquiry should be established to investigate definite matters of urgent public importance and I fail to see how Fine Gael can credibly argue that an exercise which Deputy Noonan said would comprise merely a &ldquo;prurient trawl&rdquo; can be so classified.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the Opposition is willing to debase the entire tribunal process in an attempt to gain short-term political advantage.  The Government is ensuring that the Ansbacher accounts are fully investigated by the appropriate authorities.  We will propose the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry in any circumstances that justify it.  However, we will not surrender the right of the Oireachtas to determine when it is appropriate to establish a tribunal of inquiry in a vain attempt to appease any litigant or to influence any court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons I will outline in detail I believe it is essential that the Moriarty tribunal, having commenced its work, should be left to complete its task as speedily as possible without any further interruption or delay.  The paragraph of the terms of reference for the tribunal, approved by Dáil Éireann on 11 September 1997, of relevance to the Ansbacher accounts are (a), (b) and (i). Whereas it is for the tribunal to interpret its terms of reference, it can be expected that these paragraphs will require the tribunal to determine the identity of the depositors in the Ansbacher accounts, whether any of the depositors arranged for payments to be made to the following three categories of persons: Mr. Charles Haughey, any persons who hold or have held ministerial office or any persons who hold or have held public <Col N="88" /> office and whether any such categories of persons conferred any benefit in return on such deposit holders.</P>
    <P>The identity of any deposit holder discovered by the tribunal to have made payments out of the Ansbacher accounts to any of the three categories of persons outlined above will become publicly known.  Consequently, under the terms of the tribunal of inquiry any deposit holders who made such payments will be publicly identified, the amount of any payment to any of the three categories of persons outlined above will also be known and evidence of any benefit conferred will be made public.</P>
    <P>To amend the terms of reference as suggested by the Members opposite runs the risk of compromising the operation of the tribunal and its effectiveness in getting to the bottom of the matters of grave concern it has been asked to investigate for the following reasons.  There is a strong legal view that once a tribunal has commenced its work on existing terms of reference those terms of reference cannot be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>They can be changed legally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the very least, any change would be imprudent.  Persons or institutions who have already co-operated with the tribunal on the basis of existing terms of reference may find their position prejudiced under any proposed new terms of reference.  The &ldquo;shifting of the goalpost&rdquo; by amending the terms of reference may result in individuals or institutions who have bona fide, on the basis of the existing terms of reference, provided information to the tribunal requesting that no use be made of that information.  It would also be open to Mr. Haughey in the existing proceedings to argue that the process of altering the terms of reference was flawed or illegal, thereby jeopardising the State's defence of these proceedings.</P>
      <P>If the terms of reference were to be amended by the inclusion of a requirement to investigate whether individual deposit holders were guilty of tax evasion in circumstances where the tribunal may wish to seek information from the Cayman Islands, the work of the tribunal could be seriously compromised for the following reasons.</P>
      <P>The McCracken tribunal was required to go to the Cayman Islands to acquire information as to the identity of the deposit holders in the Ansbacher accounts.  When the terms of reference were drafted it was believed the Moriarty tribunal would have to do likewise.  This may still be the case.  In view of the well recognised principle in international law, as adopted in our domestic courts, that the courts of one state will not enforce or aid in the enforcement of another state's revenue laws, any inquiry in the Cayman Islands with that stated purpose would have been refused, thus jeopardising the primary focus of this tribunal relating to propriety in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears the view is being taken by some that the reference to a &ldquo;supplemental instrument&rdquo; in <Col N="89" /> section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, permits the Oireachtas to vary a tribunal's remit.  The advice available to the Government is that the words concerned are to be interpreted as meaning an instrument which stipulates that certain provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts should apply but not as meaning an instrument i.e. the order which dictates the terms of reference under which the tribunal is appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The clear advice to the Government is that once a resolution has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas and an order is made appointing the tribunal under specific terms of reference, the power to amend an order does not exist in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Some importance is being attached to the fifth paragraph of (iv) of the terms of reference which permits the tribunal to report on an interim basis on, among other things:</P>
      <P>any other matters which the Tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that paragraph (iv) is merely a reporting mechanism to the Clerk of the Dáil.  The terms of reference do not permit the Dáil to amend the terms of reference.  The provision merely allows the tribunal to report to the Clerk of the Dáil on an interim basis any matters relating to the terms of reference, for example, terms of reference which may not be operable or which lack clarity.  Once these matters have been reported to the Dáil, there is no power for the Dáil necessarily to amend the terms of reference upon such report.</P>

      <P>The power to amend the terms of reference must emanate from primary legislation, that is, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979.  I am advised the power to amend an order is not contained in the provisions of these Acts.</P>
      <P>When speaking on the motion establishing the Moriarty tribunal in September, I said the pursuit of the tax affairs of individuals is a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister for Finance does not get involved in such cases for obvious reasons.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners cannot embark on a &ldquo;prurient trawl&rdquo; of a bank's accounts with a view to getting a name.  It is the job of the Revenue Commissioners alone to determine whether there is tax evasion.  That has always been the position as Deputy Bruton, at least, knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fundamentally misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I make clear my complete intolerance of those who engage in tax evasion and of those who assist or abet tax evaders.  The Revenue Commissioners have a wide range of powers to combat evasion.  They have powers to access bank accounts although only in certain specified circumstances where they have the names of the account holders.  Following the publication of the report of the McCracken tribunal, I asked the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to review the existing powers and to come back to me on this if they believed these should be augmented. If additional powers are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective legislative proposals will be brought forward.</P>
      <P>Under section 49(2) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, the Central Bank may disclose to the Garda where it has reasonable cause to believe a criminal offence has been committed, any information to enable further investigation of the alleged offence.  Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the bank is obliged to report to the Garda a suspicion that any entity it supervises has committed or is committing the offence of money laundering, or certain related offences; money laundering embraces tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers available to the Revenue Commissioners are not inconsiderable and were last <Col N="91" /> added to significantly in 1992.  These new powers included: provision of &ldquo;third party&rdquo; returns to the Revenue on an automatic basis, reporting by domestic institutions who act as intermediaries in the opening of foreign bank accounts by Irish residents&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously they are not doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;provision of information on dealings by related parties such as suppliers, extended inspection powers in relation to certain tax records and accounts and attachment of amounts owed by third parties to a defaulting taxpayer. These powers were added to in 1993 and in 1995 when reporting arrangements and other duties were imposed on certain company advisers.</P>
      <P>If we want further powers for Revenue, decisions on such issues are best taken in the light of all relevant available information.  This includes information and recommendations which the Moriarty tribunal may provide.  It would also mean taking account of what the authorised officers, appointed by the Tánaiste under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, may discover in their examination of the companies concerned. It would also include material or facts thrown up by more recent events.  I am aware of the proficiency, expertise, perseverance and balance shown by the Revenue Commissioners in pursuing their task.  I have complimented the them on how well they have improved their performance and delivery of services in the past ten years.  I have no doubt any extra powers will be used wisely but as a people we have to decide carefully how far we want to go in giving the State wide-ranging powers of surveillance.</P>
      <P>We have also to take account of reality.  In an increasingly globalised world with modern communications technology, there is an increasing ease with which operations and activities can be conducted offshore.  We cannot ignore this. Even Judge McCracken acknowledged this limitation on the effectiveness of measures in his report last August in relation to the proposed reporting to official agencies of unusual transactions involving politicians and public servants. In his recommendations he stated:</P>
      <P>On balance, the Tribunal does not consider it practical, or indeed that it would be particularly effective, to oblige bankers, accountants or other professional advisers to disclose any unusual or large financial transactions involving politicians or public servants.  The reality is that if there was such an obligation, it could only be imposed on advisers within the State, and such provisions could be easily avoided by the politician or public servant concerned simply acting through advisers and banks outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> This does not mean we should not seek to apply whatever requirements we can to local institutions and intermediaries.  It means these provisions cannot be expected to be fully effective in the absence of clear and binding commitments by international agreement with other countries to exchange information and to allow inquiries to be pursued. This ideal state of affairs is some way off.  Even within the European Union there have been difficulties in agreeing to taxation provisions, such as the taxation of savings, where this may give rise to exchange of information.  I do not condone this lack of solidarity.  I ask that it be recognised as a factor limiting what States can do.</P>
    <P>Where there are alleged breaches of the law, these will be thoroughly followed up by the relevant authorities.  As regards the issues which have arisen recently in the case of National Irish Bank Limited, the Revenue Commissioners are examining urgently all the tax issues.  All necessary action will be taken by them to deal with whatever tax consequences emerge.</P>
    <P>The focus of the tribunal is on allegations of corruption in public life.  Paragraph (p) of the terms of reference, under the heading &ldquo;Recommendations&rdquo;, requires the tribunal to make such recommendations as it considers necessary or expedient &ldquo;for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts, and to recommend whether any changes in the tax law should be made to achieve this end&rdquo;.</P>

Consequently, the extent to which offshore accounts, including the Ansbacher accounts, facilitate tax evasion will be investigated by the tribunal.  What will not be investigated is whether individual deposit holders in the Ansbacher accounts were guilty of tax evasion. Such an inquiry is an issue between the Revenue Commissioners and the individuals concerned.</P>

      <P>Following publication of the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments), the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment appointed, on 9 September l997, two authorised officers under section 19 of the Companies Act, l990 to investigate certain issues which came to light as a result of the work of that tribunal.  Following receipt of an interim report from one of those inspectors and on the basis of legal advice, the Tánaiste decided on 8 January to appoint Mr. Gerry Ryan to conduct an inquiry, also under section 19, into the affairs of Irish Intercontinental Bank and Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Limited. Both banks have agreed to pass over the required books and records to Mr. Ryan.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste or an authorised officer have wide-ranging powers under section 19 of the Companies Act, l990.  They may require the production of books and documents of a company or other body corporate carrying on business in the State, if the Tánaiste is of the opinion that there are circumstances suggesting that its affairs are being conducted with intent to defraud or that the body was formed for fraudulent or unlawful purposes.  An authorised officer has power under section 19(3) to require the production of books or documents from any person who has possession of them, for example, advisers or consultants. Furthermore, section 23 of the Act permits access in certain instances to documents relating to the banking affairs of a customer.</P>
      <P>Section 19 reports may only be published with the prior approval of the entities examined. However, in all cases where wrong-doing is determined, the Tánaiste is permitted to refer the papers to the relevant authorities, for example, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Minister for Finance, an officer authorised by the Minister for Finance such as the Revenue Commissioners or the Central Bank.</P>

    <P>A copy of the Central Bank's findings was subsequently provided to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 11 November 1997 to facilitate the authorised officers appointed by the Tánaiste and Minister for <Col N="96" /> Enterprise, Trade and Employment under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>I had also written to the Governor of the Central Bank on 31 October 1997 requesting clarification of a number of matters included in its report. Clarifications were received from the Central Bank on 16 January 1998.  This additional material has been forwarded for consideration to the DPP, the Revenue Commissioners, the Tribunal of Inquiry (Messrs.  Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry) and to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>I indicated to the House on 8 October 1997 that I would have no objection in principle to placing the report of the Central Bank on exchange control issues before the Houses of the Oireachtas if I was advised that such placement would not prejudice any case that might be taken by the DPP.  When referring the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 31 October 1997, the DPP was asked for his view as to whether communicating this report to the Houses of the Oireachtas might prejudice consideration and possible prosecution by the DPP.  In order to formulate a response, the director sought some further information which was forwarded to him on 9 December 1997 and I understand the director will be in a position to respond to me when he has considered this information together with the clarifications received from the Central Bank on 16 January 1998.</P>
    <P>With regard to supervisory issues generally, the House is aware that on 19 November 1997 I placed on the record of the Dáil a letter dated 11 November 1997 from the Governor of the Central Bank reporting to me separately about the supervisory issues arising from the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments).  For the benefit of the House I had intended to repeat precisely what the Governor said but as it is already on the record of the House there is no need to do so.</P>
    <P>The Governor of the Central Bank confirmed that the board is satisfied with its legal powers; it keeps under review the banks supervisory practices and its approach to supervision and endeavours to ensure that these are in line with international best practice and are subject to continuous modernisation and adaptation to meet the needs of a changing global environment.  He also confirmed the board is satisfied that the supervisory procedures and practices are being effectively implemented by the bank.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware, however, that the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal include a remit to make whatever broad recommendations it considers necessary or expedient for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally.  I await the tribunal's report on this matter and will give careful consideration to any recommendation it might make in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Ansbacher deposits, I ask the House to support the continuing actions of the Government in pursuing all avenues to investigate <Col N="97" /> these matters in order to protect the revenues of the State and to make the fullest information available to the public.  To amend the terms of reference, as suggested by the Members opposite, runs the risk of compromising the operation of the tribunal and its effectiveness in getting to the bottom of the matter.  As already mentioned, these terms of reference will, <i>inter alia</i>, allow the tribunal to contribute valuable advice under paragraph (p) of its remit in recommending any changes in tax law it considers should be made for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts.  It is most important at this stage, therefore, to allow the tribunal proceed without further hindrance to complete the tasks already set out in its terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the other speakers will not get a chance to contribute in the 15 minutes available tonight.</P>
      <P>I listened with some amazement to the contribution of the Minister for Finance because he sought to argue in two directions at the same time. He told us the intention of the Opposition to get behind the Ansbacher accounts will be achieved by a different route, and that it should not be taken because it was the job of the Revenue Commissioners to get behind any alleged tax evasion. The Minister cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>It is an unusual occurrence when a joint motion is sponsored by all the parties in Opposition and the Independents.  It only occurs when there is something of significant importance that animates the public and which is of genuine public concern. The issue that lies behind this motion is public confidence in the administration of taxation affairs.  Not to put too fine a point on it, people are cheesed off with the notion that there are individuals in this society who are immune from the tax law.  All the fine words in the world, and all the good intentions of the Government and the Tánaiste in her investigation, will not allay those fears unless the straightforward motion and requirement of the House to look behind the Ansbacher accounts, as identified in the McCracken report, are directly addressed.  Dancing around the issue, as the Minister for Finance did tonight, will not address that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the reason the Minister says this cannot be done.  First, he said the legal advice is that the tribunal, once commenced, cannot <Col N="98" /> have its terms of reference changed.  There is no legal advice available to anybody else which says that is a fact.  Let us see the legal advice.  Apparently, up to recent times it was the contention of Government that it was the legal advice of successive Attorneys General.  Now it is the legal advice of the current Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat the clear statutory provision in the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 which refers specifically to a supplemental Instrument. I do not understand the interpretation being put by the Minister on that clear statement in the primary legislation.  It is a nonsense to suggest that the terms of reference cannot be changed once the tribunal is established.  There is no legal basis for that, it is simply not sustainable.</P>
    <P>The second defence put forward by the Minister is that the Tánaiste's investigation under the Companies Act is under way.  That was not happening when the Minister last voted down this proposal which I put forward on behalf of the Labour Party on 11 September last.  Clearly an investigation under the Companies Act is a much weaker animal than a full investigation under the terms of reference of a tribunal.  The Tánaiste's actions are an attempt to give a fig leaf to the Government.  They are belated because it was not the intention of the Government to look behind the Ansbacher accounts when the Minister trenchantly argued against it in September of last year.  More recently, with the weight of public opinion and the frustration of compliant taxpayers, the Tánaiste has put in place a much weaker mechanism to get at the truth.  If it gets at the full truth there is certainly grave disquiet about whether those facts can be put into the public domain.</P>
    <P>If people are defrauding the State they are robbing health and social welfare services and those who require housing, of the potential to have a decent standard of life.  They should be identified. This is not a prurient trawl, to repeat that abused and much used phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>That was Deputy Noonan's phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used it with relish several times tonight.  It is a requirement of compliant taxpayers to know the truth and the basis on which this State and the services we provide and vote for in this House are sustained, and that people are paying in accordance with the Statutes enacted by these Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another Deputy referred to a taxpayer in the United States, Leona Helmsley, who had an attitude to taxation.  There are many who believe that principle holds true here, that taxation laws are not for all but only for those who do not have the wherewithal to evade and avoid tax.  The disclosure in the past week of an another offshore banking operation undermines further the confidence in the administration of fair taxation here. It is the responsibility of Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, who evaded it last <Col N="99" /> September and is about to evade it again, to restore confidence in taxation and its administration here.  Although in his comments the Minister relied heavily on the ability of the Revenue Commissioners to do their bit to ensure everybody is compliant, there are questions to be asked of the Revenue Commissioners.  Most people would be of the view that the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners should be made amenable to a committee of this House.  I hope the compellibility of witnesses motion in the name of the Labour Party on today's Order Paper can be quickly passed by this and the other House to allow for explanations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners and those responsible for taxation here because there are questions to be answered in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to use this debate to set the record of my party straight on this matter.  One can read, with some frustration, the contents of articles in newspapers.  In a Sunday newspaper one sentence of mine was extracted from the Official Report of 11 September and printed to the effect that the Labour Party was not fulsomely behind the full ventilation of the Ansbacher accounts in September. To suggest that is a distortion of the truth.  We tabled the amendment at the outset.  As reported at column 837 of the Official Report of 11 September 1997 I stated, &ldquo;I am strongly in agreement with the argument and the clear case put forward by Deputy Noonan&rdquo;.  The sentence which appeared in that newspaper was extracted from what I said, as if I was in favour of not going after the Ansbacher accounts.  However, I went on to state:</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of the focus on the Ansbacher accounts drew the most criticism in public debate.  While the focus has been on ethics and standards in politics, it is a matter of concern for every citizen, and particularly every taxpayer, that if wrongdoing is discovered by somebody who happens not to have been a former Minister or Mr. Haughey, then that is not within the scope or ambit of exposure by this tribunal, and that is wrong.</P>
    <P>I pushed to a vote the full disclosure of the Ansbacher accounts on that occasion, but unfortunately that proposal was defeated by 77 votes to 22.  That is the record of the House and my full contribution over many hours are recorded in the Official Report.  That is the record of the Labour Party which is consistent on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I record it for the benefit of those who did not recognise that in some of the debates between last September and now.  The issue is clear and simple.  I recognise the Minister's difficulty in trying to stand logic on its head by arguing both ways at once.  We either want the full ventilation of the issues identified by Mr. Justice McCracken or we do not.  If we want them ventilated, <Col N="100" /> we should not rely on any inadequate mechanism, whether the application of the Companies Act by the Tánaiste or a tautology of disclosure outlined by the Minister for Finance in his speech tonight on any discovery the inspector appointed by the Tánaiste might make that might in certain circumstances &mdash; if the wind is blowing right and it is a fair day &mdash; get into the public domain.  If we are serious about this matter we should go the most direct and obvious route.</P>
      <P>In my view and in that of much more learned lawyers we have the legal right to amend the terms of reference to get to the heart of this matter now.  If the Minister for Finance is not convinced of the righteousness of that course of action, it falls to the Independents, who sustain this minority Government, to take their courage in their hands now.  This motion can be carried. That would not be a mortal blow to the Government, but it would be an important signal from this House on taxation law and to those here who have the Leona Helmsley attitude to taxation.  I appeal to every Member when the vote is called tomorrow to decisively say that he or she wants a fair and compliant system of taxation that applies in equal measure to every citizen of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Ansbacher affair has arisen from the overweening arrogance of those who came to be known as the golden circle in this society, that elite who strode through business and politics for 20 years thinking they were untouchable.  Paying taxes and observing exchange controls was for the small people, but they were above that.  This developed and continued because they knew they had political patronage at the highest level in Irish politics.  It was not only one man but often the system as a whole that gave them that encouragement.  It was not one man who put through the Dáil two tax amnesties under which the super rich escaped with massive amounts of tax evasion while ordinary people had to pay their share.  To their shame that applied to the majority of Deputies on both occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support this motion and I welcome its tabling by the parties concerned, but those Members did not rise in their seats on 11 September last when I called for an investigation into whether the tax amnesties were related to Ansbacher.  That should have been cleared up at that time.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, blustered in his usual way and outlined various reasons for not accepting a full investigation, but the real reason is the Government is terrified to unmask the full list of names because it may contain some of the most prominent and wealthy individuals in our society and some of the main contributors to Fianna Fáil and perhaps to the Progressive Democrats.  By refusing to have a full investigation into this matter the Government continues to send signals to big business which continues with some of its evil ways.  How else could the following scenario develop?  In this town a few weeks before Christmas five bricklayers <Col N="101" /> were taken on at a building site.  The subcontractor who was contracted for the brick work told them they would be paid cash in hand and that they could continue to sign on.  They said no to that, that they were trade union members and wanted to pay PAYE, their dues and receive their entitlements in due course.  No agreement was reached and the following week they were told there was no more work there for them.  They were sacked.  There is two or three years' work on that site.  They resorted to the only effective method of defence, a picket.  I sat in the High Court while a judge ignored their testimony given under oath and gave an injunction to that company against them and did not say a word about that criminal act of the black economy.  That site is a £38 million development commissioned by Mr. Michael Smurfit.  The builders are one of the biggest building contractors here, Cramptons. They are responsible</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter this evening.  Reports in the media appear to have established a <i>prima facie</i> case that National Irish Bank was involved in the active promotion of tax evasion schemes by the use of offshore accounts.  I want the Minister to put on the record what he knows about this matter.  I also want to know if he has discussed the matter with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In 1993 and 1994, National Irish Bank had accounts of a peculiar nature in branches throughout the country.  Some were supposedly non-resident accounts, others were in bogus names and all appeared to contain money hidden from the Revenue Commissioners.  NIB had a system in place to highlight these accounts and readily identify the beneficiary.  If, for example, a depositor in one of the accounts applied for a loan, the centralised system highlighted the fact that he also had another hidden account and the true credit position was easily established. Nothing hinges on this other than the fact that the central management of the bank had a system in place which readily identified the account holders. When they wished to approach them to sell a particular financial product to them, it was a simple matter to identify their names and addresses and send the bank's sales staff to visit them.</P>
      <P>It is relevant that these accounts existed after the last tax amnesty and after the granting of strenuous powers to the Revenue Commissioners by the Houses of the Oireachtas which included, among other things, what is known as the whistle blowers' charter.  Approximately eight months after the closure date for declarations of money under the amnesty, somebody in National Irish Bank decided that the money in the accounts I described earlier was no longer safe from the Revenue Commissioners.  An ingenious scheme was organised and sales executives of the bank were dispatched to visit the deposit holders. These sales executives were extremely successful and encouraged approximately 188 depositors to invest a total of £30 million in the ingenious scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Depositors were asked to transfer their money into bank drafts drawn for the benefit of Clerical and Medical International, known as CMI, based in the Isle of Man.  I understand the money was immediately transferred back to the bank branches of origin and was deposited in the name of CMI, with a number to identify the identity of the original deposit holder.  Subsequently the deposits appear to have been centralised, but the essentials of the scheme remained the same. Depositor money was passed through CMI and redeposited in National Irish Bank in the name of CMI and appeared in that bank as offshore accounts.  Initially, it appeared, the depositors could transact business over the counter in the <Col N="103" /> usual fashion.  Some time later an arrangement was put in place which worked generally as follows. If a depositor wished to withdraw, for example, £20,000, CMI would be notified in writing by the depositor and it would immediately instruct NIB to pay out the money.</P>
    <P>There was no advantage in terms of security of the money or interest return to the depositor on the money from these arrangements.  Significant start up costs were charged by CMI and it appears a management fee was charged by both CMI and NIB.  Consequently, we must ask why depositors got involved in this costly arrangement. For example, I am reliably informed that NIB charged £20,000 to a depositor of £250,000 for making this arrangement.  If this is applied <i>pro rata</i> to £30 million on deposit, NIB gained in excess of £1 million from this arrangement.  CMI also received significant fees.</P>
    <P>It makes no sense for a depositor to pay such fees unless there is some advantage.  Since there is no advantage in terms of security, return on investment or access to deposits, the only explanation is that they were evading tax and that the bank was facilitating them in doing so.  It is a criminal offence to aid and abet persons evading tax.  The whistle blowers' charter makes it an offence for any person, including directors and employees of banks and other financial institutions, not to inform the Revenue Commissioners of incidents of tax evasion of which they are aware.  There is a case to answer not only by NIB but also the Minister for Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Ansbacher accounts have already passed into the general vocabulary of the people.  It appears now that the third biggest banking group in the country also operated offshore accounts with money deposited in Ireland with full access by the depositors and that this was done for the purpose of tax evasion.  Yesterday I received a telephone call from a person who identified herself. She told me that two years ago she approached a leading building society with a deposit of £30,000 and was offered a facility to place it in an Isle of Man account.  She declined the offer but the arrangement suggested appeared to be that the rate of return would be a quarter per cent less than available in Dublin, but there would be certain tax advantages.</P>
    <P>I do not know Ireland's balance of trade with the Isle of Man, but it is not significant.  Consequently, it is a matter of some surprise to me that practically all our clearing banks, building societies and investment banks have branches in the Isle of Man.  Some also have branches in Jersey. I wish to pose a number of questions to the Minister. Are certain financial institutions organising tax evasion schemes for customers in clear breach of the law?  If so, what does the Minister intend to do about the matter?  Does he intend to do it in a manner where the issue is exposed to public scrutiny?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated previously, the pursuit of the tax affairs of individual taxpayers is a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister for Finance does not get involved in such cases for clear reasons.  This is the position which has been accepted in the House since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issues which have arisen recently in the case of National Irish Bank, I confirm that the Revenue Commissioners are examining urgently all the tax issues involved.  All necessary action will be taken by the Revenue Commissioners to deal with whatever tax consequences emerge.  The Central Bank has also been pursuing the issues raised in relation to National Irish Bank since the matter came to its attention.  I wrote to the Governor on Monday, 26 January, requesting him to report to me on the implications of these issues.  The Central Bank is examining the possible exchange control implications of any transactions involving offshore accounts.  However, I point out that such controls expired on 31 December 1992.</P>
      <P>In addition, I understand that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, who has responsibility for the regulation of the insurance sector, wrote to National Irish Bank on 27 January raising a number of issues in relation to certain alleged transactions involving that company.  In particular, he sought clarification as to whether National Irish Bank is, in fact, selling certain products from an Isle of Man-based company, CMI, or from any other non-EU countries and, if so, to provide evidence that the company in question is authorised to conduct such business in the State.  On receipt of a reply a decision will, I understand, be made on whether further action is required.</P>
      <P>I have not had particular discussions with the Revenue Commissioners in this case.  The Deputy will be aware that the Revenue Commissioners have wide powers.  As I stated in relation to another matter, the last major change in the Revenue Commissioners' powers was given effect in the Finance Act, 1992, and included reporting arrangements for domestic institutions in relation to the opening of foreign bank accounts by Irish residents.  The Revenue Commissioners' powers were further extended in 1993 and penalties for tax evasion were significantly increased in conjunction with the introduction of the tax amnesty. Regarding access to bank accounts, the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to seek access through the courts or, in certain circumstances, through the AppeaI Commissioners, to the bank accounts of named individuals resident in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existence of these various powers is an important factor in underpinning voluntary compliance with the tax laws by the vast majority of taxpayers.  Where necessary, the powers are formally brought into play by the Revenue Commissioners in support of their investigations.  It is <Col N="105" /> important that the right balance is maintained so that adequate powers are available and their use is targeted mainly at those actually evading tax. However, if additional powers are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, then proposals to enhance the Revenue Commissioners' effectiveness in this area will be brought forward. The adequacy of the Revenue Commissioners' powers is being reviewed by the Revenue Commissioners and my Department following the report of the McCracken tribunal.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Central Bank, the House is already aware that I have asked the Governor to advise me if the board of the Central Bank is satisfied that the bank has the necessary legal powers for the effective execution of its regulatory role, that the procedures and practices necessary to effectively exercise these powers are in place and that these procedures and practices are being implemented effectively.  Deputies will recall that I placed the contents of the Governor's reply on the record of the House when responding to a parliamentary question from Deputy Rabbitte on 19 November 1997.  In that letter the Governor confirmed that the board is satisfied with its legal powers; that the board keeps under review the bank's supervisory practices and its approach to supervision; that the board endeavours to ensure that these are in line with international best practice and are subject to continuous modernisation and adaptation to meet the needs of a changing global environment.  He also confirmed that the board is satisfied that the supervisory procedures and practices are being effectively implemented by the bank.</P>
    <P>However, Deputies will be aware that the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal include a remit to make whatever broad recommendations the tribunal considers necessary or expedient for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally. I will give careful consideration to any recommendation it might make in this regard in due course.</P>
    <P>While the Central Bank is subject to a very strict confidentiality regime, provision is made for the disclosure of information as required by a court in connection with criminal proceedings.  In addition, the bank, under section 49(2) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, may disclose to the Garda, where it has reasonable cause to believe that a criminal offence has been committed, any information to enable further investigation of the alleged offence.  Further, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the bank is obliged to report to the Garda a suspicion that any entity it supervises has committed or is committing the offence of money laundering or certain related offences.  Money laundering in this context embraces tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat in the strongest possible terms my complete intolerance of those who engage in tax evasion and of those who assist or abet tax evaders.</P>

      <P>I call on the Minister for Health and Children to set up an urgent inquiry into the circumstances where a letter was sent to 100 parents and guardians of 100 residents of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, asking for permission to carry out medical experimentation on those 100 residents. Parents receiving this letter were very frightened by its contents and appalled at the lack of information in it.  The wording of the letter implied that the study was a <i>fait accompli</i> and that the parents' permission should be returned as soon as possible.  The first sentence of the letter states: &ldquo;We are conducting a study on bone metabolism.&rdquo; It does not say &ldquo;we intend&rdquo; or &ldquo;we might&rdquo;; it says &ldquo;we are&rdquo;.  The letter was written on Eastern Health Board notepaper with St. Ita's Hospital's address on it.  It referred to 50 of the residents receiving medication with vitamin D given by injection and calcium given orally.  It also indicated that blood testing would be done initially and again at three, six and nine monthly intervals.  No indication was given who would be involved in the study other than the doctor who signed the letter.  No indication was given that neither the hospital ethics committee nor St. Ita's Hospital Management Committee had not considered the proposal.  Having read the letter, if I was a parent of a mentally handicapped person who themselves could not give any informed consent, I would have been very angry at the lack of information, the suddenness with which the letter arrived without any prior consultation and the peremptory way the last sentence in the letter was worded.  It states &ldquo;please return permission as soon as possible.&rdquo; My reading of that sentence is that there is no indication to a vulnerable parent that they have a choice in the matter.</P>
      <P>I recognise that medical testing is a valuable tool in improving people's conditions and medical knowledge.  I understand that the particular doctor who sent this letter has given great care to the residents in St. Ita's.  However, the hurt and trauma caused by this letter is enormous and the Minister for Health and Children has the overall responsibility for running our hospitals and must take responsibility for this letter.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has issued statements regretting any anxiety which has been caused to clients with learning disabilities in St. Ita's Hospital but the board also tried to disown the trauma caused by implying that the Irish Council for People with Disabilities misrepresented or misunderstood the nature of the letter. This is a very unfair interpretation of the statement by the Irish Council for People with Disabilities and I ask the Eastern Health Board to apologise to the council for implying that it was their fault people have been upset by this letter. The health board has issued a statement indicating that these tests will not go ahead and I know this decision is welcomed by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear whether this is the first time a group of mentally handicapped people was to be <Col N="107" /> used for medical research.  I want to know if this kind of testing has been carried out in the past. What are the legal parameters about medical testing of human beings?  Is the Minister aware that many of the mentally handicapped people in St. Ita's Hospital do not have parents or guardians? Who was going to speak on their behalf and give permission?  One parent has indicated that it would have taken three people to hold down her son to have an injection administered.  Another parent has indicated that it would take eight people to hold down their mentally handicapped child.  What would have happened if a parent had given consent to have these tests carried out and the person on whom the tests were being carried out resisted very strongly?  How far would those carrying out this research have gone to administer medication?</P>
    <P>The Irish Council of People with Disabilities has requested the Minister for Health and Children to ascertain through a full investigation a number of matters.  Who initiated this study? Who authorised it?  What is its real purpose?  Are any other medical experiments proposed, contemplated or recently undertaken in respect of citizens with disabilities in the Eastern Health Board's care?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to have this investigation carried out as quickly as possible so that a similar situation will never arise again.  I ask him to take whatever action is necessary arising out of the investigation to clarify to the parents of these residents exactly what went wrong here.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to make resources available to upgrade the facilities in St. Ita's Hospital.  The care given to the residents in St. Ita's is exemplary, as is the staff, but the building is old and requires much renovation and improvement. I call on the Government, which can find money so easily for so many high profile projects, to increase the allocation to the Eastern Health Board so that money can be spent upgrading facilities in St. Ita's Hospital.  A Minister of State has visited the hospital and I hope that this is not just a public relations exercise because there is a by-election in Dublin North.  The needs of the people living in St. Ita's and the staff are many and varied.  Those needs must be met by using some of the benefits of the Celtic tiger to assist the more vulnerable in our society, such as those who are living residing in St. Ita's Hospital, many on a permanent basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Owen for raising this matter.  When this issue first came into the public domain the Minister, Deputy Cowen, immediately asked the Eastern Health Board to furnish a report on the matter.  That report is now to hand and I welcome the opportunity presented by this motion to outline the background to the letter issued to parents of people with a mental handicap in St. Ita's Hospital.  What was proposed in that letter was a <Col N="108" /> study using vitamin D and calcium supplements, which are available on supermarket shelves, to improve the treatment of people with a mental handicap at the hospital.  Clients in St. Ita's include some in the more severe category of mental handicap and many have complicating conditions, such as epilepsy or brittle bones.  There is an increased risk of people with brittle bones suffering fractures during epileptic fits.  This proposal was to improve the treatment of their brittle bone condition for this group of clients to reduce the risk of fracture.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that those involved in the study must have the full protection of the law.  The statutory procedures which govern studies such as these are set out in the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990.  The Acts set out the procedures to be followed in seeking approval for such trials and the granting of permission by proposed participants, including those circumstances where a person who may be incapable of comprehending the nature, significance or scope of a consent for this purpose.  These procedures were being followed by the general practitioner in question in St Ita's.  Medical research of this type is an essential part of the health services.</P>
      <P>The proposed study was, as I have already stated, in the area of brittle bone disease.  The study would have involved giving two substances which are available to the general public.  It would have involved calcium tablets given orally and two injections of vitamin D over a 12 month period. Blood samples would have been taken at selected intervals, but most of these samples would not have involved additional tests and would have been collected during normal routine blood testing for other medical reasons.</P>
      <P>In addition to family consent, three other requirements would have to be fulfilled before the proposed study could have commenced: approval from the hospital's ethics committee; approval from the hospital's management committee and clients whose families had given consent would in addition have to be screened for medical suitability for the study.</P>
      <P>In writing to the families, the general practitioner was endeavouring to establish if the families were willing to participate before the authorities at St. Ita's Hospital would formally consider the proposal.  There was never a question of clients who have no families being involved.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Council for People with Disabilities has concerns about this matter.  I accept and share their concerns in ensuring that the interests of this particularly vulnerable group of people are fully protected.  I would like to reiterate that, in this instance, the correct procedures were being followed and the motivation for undertaking the study was to further the best interests of the clients.  Perhaps if more information had been given initially to the parents, the misunderstanding about the study may not have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> In view of the anxiety expressed by families because of the misunderstanding about the nature of the study, the medical practitioner concerned has withdrawn her request for consent from families and has informed the hospital authorities that she will not be requesting the hospital management committee or the hospital ethics committee to consider her proposal for such a study.  She has also written to the families explaining in more detail what would have been involved in the study and cancelling the information meeting for parents which had been arranged for next week.  I regret that this incident took place and the anxiety to which it gave rise. I am satisfied that the matter has been clarified and the study will not now be proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Parts of Dublin in particular are becoming multi-racial communities and no preparation has been made for this sea change in the makeup of those communities.  This has given rise to some racial tensions which could boil over into ugly scenes and perhaps even violence.  That is not an exaggeration.  During the last general election campaign, the issue which was most raised with me and, indeed, other Deputies to whom I have spoken and who represent inner city Dublin constituencies, was immigration.  Not all comments were anti-immigrant and some who raised the question with me were concerned about the treatment of immigrants.</P>
      <P>I witnessed an immigrant woman being spat on in Rathmines, Dublin.  I do not know what gave rise to this altercation as I turned around when it occurred.  It may well have been retaliation for something which was done, but it was an ugly thing to see.  Some very ugly comments have been and are being made and some of them are being fuelled by irresponsible comments from public representatives.  Fear, uncertainty and the newness of this problem which has descended on communities have given rise to great concern.  In some cases the immigrants are responsible for the reaction they receive but that is because they have not been prepared for their responsibilities and often cannot communicate in English with neighbours who sometimes complain about their activities.  Much of the comment has nothing to do with people experiencing difficulties with immigrants but with the presence of immigrants. I am anxious that a Minister be appointed to co-ordinate the social welfare, housing, health, immigrant and community relations issues which arise from this new situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 800,000 people born in Ireland living in the United Kingdom.  Some 11.5 per cent of the population of Greater London was either born in <Col N="110" /> Ireland or are the children of people born here. The Irish are the largest immigrant group in Britain.  The same applies to Irish people in many other countries.  Not only must justice be done but it must be seen to be done if we are to expect Irish people travelling abroad to be treated properly. To do nothing is to be irresponsible.</P>
    <P>There will be ugly scenes if, even at this late stage, we do not have a co-ordinated plan to deal with this and that plan must be fair, balanced, sensitive and worthy.  There is no plan at present and I believe that is very dangerous.  Much work needs to be done to ensure that the host and the immigrant communities, especially those who are here legally, are intermeshed and that the foundations are laid to prevent some of the scenes we have seen elsewhere in Europe, particularly in areas adjacent to central Europe.</P>
    <P>I tabled this matter to the Taoiseach but it was passed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I did not want him to respond to it. I want the Taoiseach to appoint a Minister with overall responsibly for co-ordinating a response across Departments before it is too late and to do so in a fair, sensitive and balanced way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for raising this matter.  I am anxious to avoid retreading the ground covered by last month's debate on the motion on racism.  The Deputy will recall that there was all-party support in the House for that motion.</P>
      <P>There are several different types of visitor to our shores and it might be useful to identify some of the more important categories into which non-nationals entering the country fall.  First, there are those who come for recreational visits of shorter or longer duration.  Their needs are catered for usually by the tourist trade or by the family or friends they have come to visit.  If any of those people are unfortunate enough to become the victims of crime, they can avail of the tourist victim support service.  This is a unique national service, co-ordinated from Garda DMA Headquarters in offices provided by the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>A substantial number of people come to Ireland for study purposes.  Their primary need is the provision of the desired course of education, and that is catered for by the educational institution in question.  Where there is a special vocational element involved, as for instance doctors who come for postgraduate study and experience, the relevant professional bodies are also involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people come to learn English.  The Advisory Council for English Language Schools, on which my Department is represented, is the body charged with the setting and maintenance of standards in this important academic and economic sphere.  Then we have those who can properly be classed as economic migrants to the State.  These <Col N="111" /> fall into two categories.  First are nationals of European Union or European Economic Area states who are here working on the basis of their EC Treaty rights or other international agreements.</P>
    <P>There are also nationals of other states who come here for the purpose of employment, who have obtained a work permit in respect of that employment and who comply with our admission and residence laws as they apply to non-nationals generally.  Such persons are admitted to the State on the understanding that they will not become a burden on the State.  Historically, because of their relatively small numbers, there has not been a perceived need to cater specially for the needs of such migrants who can avail themselves as the need arises, and as their entitlements or resources permit, of the various services available both in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>I turn now to those who come to Ireland seeking to be recognised as refugees.  I suspect this is the category to which Deputy Mitchell's Adjournment request is devoted, so these will turn out to be genuinely in need of the protection of this State.  I reiterate what I said in the racism debate: those who are found to be in need of protection will get it.  I spoke at length then and on previous occasions of the imminent putting in place of a one-stop-shop to cater for the needs of asylum seekers in a co-ordinated way while their claims are being assessed.  At the end of the process, those who are found to be in need of protection in the State are of course permitted to remain here.</P>
    <P>At present, the Refugee Agency has the remit of providing a co-ordinated response to the requirements of those who have been given protection in Ireland under specific Government approved programmes.  All persons recognised as refugees in the State are, of course, entitled to work, engage in business, have access to education and training and receive health care and social services in the same way as Irish citizens. As will be apparent from what I have said, there are a number of different types of immigrant and their needs will differ.  I am not convinced it would be wise to attempt what the Deputy suggests&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;namely, to take away a range of responsibilities from Ministers who, together with their Departments, have competence in these areas and allocate them to a separate Minister.  My fear would be that such a change could have a negative impact on how the needs of the various categories of immigrant are met.  This is not to say there is no need for effective interdepartmental co-ordination in relation to immigration and asylum issues.  Of course there <Col N="112" /> is, and appropriate co-ordination is already taking place.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude, there is one particular point I would like to make.  One factor which would contribute towards the emergence of racial tension here is the confusion which currently exists on the subject of illegal immigration, in particular, confusion concerning the distinction between an illegal immigrant and a refugee.  The distinction has wide recognition internationally.  An illegal immigrant is a person who enters the State in breach of the law, that is, without having satisfied the requirements of immigration law as to possession of passport, visa and the like or who, having been given permission to enter on certain conditions, for a certain purpose or duration of stay, breaches those conditions.  Such person is liable to be removed from the State.</P>
      <P>A proportion of those who enter or overstay illegally then seek asylum.  In fact 98 per cent of those who claimed asylum in the past two years did so having entered the State illegally.  After detailed examination of the claim of an asylum seeker, a decision is made as to whether that person is a refugee.  A refugee is defined in Irish law at section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996 &mdash; this is among the sections of that Act which I brought into effect at the end of August last year &mdash; as a person who has a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, and as a result of that fear cannot avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of origin.  Asylum seekers who are found to meet this definition are deserving of the protection of the State and will get it.  As regards those who claim to meet this definition but do not, and for whom there are no special reasons they should be allowed to remain in the State, we are justified in following the internationally accepted practice of requiring the parties concerned to leave.  If we failed to do so and simply allowed immigration to take place on an illegal and haphazard basis, it would serve neither the interests of immigrants nor our own society.</P>
      <P>Two final points are worth stressing.  First, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a supervisory role under the UN Convention on Refugees.  Second, contrary to speculation, all applicants for refugee status have access to an independent appeals system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I am raising on the Adjournment this evening is one with which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is familiar &mdash; he raised it himself on many occasions when he was Opposition spokesperson.  This is a matter of fundamental importance to the public interest in relation to the administration of justice and the protection of human life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1985, the body of John Corcoran of Riverview Estate, Ballyvolane, County Cork, was found dumped outside Cork city, the murder <Col N="113" /> apparently having taken place in County Kerry. It has been widely reported in recent times that he was murdered by the IRA on the instructions of the chief of staff and that the Garda Síochána were aware, from information received over some days previously, that Mr. Corcoran was going to be murdered.  A statement issued by the Department of Justice on 8 December 1997 stated that the Minister for Justice had sought a full report on all aspects of this matter a short time after he took up office in the middle of 1997.  What I would like to know this evening is whether the Minister has that report and if he is going to make it public.</P>
    <P>A number of very serious questions have been raised in the reporting of this matter in the public domain in recent months.  It seems that some concerned members of the Garda Síochána were to the fore in supplying the media with information in relation to the circumstances surrounding this murder.  I have questions I would like the Minister to address.  Did the Garda have prior knowledge of the IRA's plan to murder John Corcoran? If so, why was no action taken to prevent the murder and to arrest those who were torturing him?  Why have the Garda not interviewed Mr. Sean O'Callaghan who has publicly confessed to carrying out this murder on IRA instructions and why has he not been brought in for questioning by the Garda since he made his public confession? Can the Minister explain to the House the statement from the Garda in December 1996 to the effect that the Corcoran case had been fully investigated and that a file was on its way to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the contradiction of that statement from the Garda press office about one week later to the effect that the investigation had not been completed?  I would remind the Minister &mdash; I am probably reminding him of a concern which he shares &mdash; of the concern of the Corcoran family to get full and vital information in relation to this dreadful murder. Every effort should be made not only to establish the facts and to bring those involved in this murder before the courts but to establish the truth and the sequence of events which led to the callous murder of John Corcoran.  I appeal to the Minister to be forthcoming and to put all the information on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>When in Opposition I promised that, if nominated as Minister for Justice by the incoming Taoiseach, I would order an inquiry into this matter.  I have done that.  I thank Deputy Spring for raising the matter and, being mindful of the twin perils of ensuring that I do not interfere with the independence of the Director of <Col N="114" /> Public Prosecutions or with the course of an individual Garda investigation, I propose, nevertheless, to depart from precedent and to outline some evidence in this difficult and complex case because I regard it as exceptional.</P>
      <P>The facts are that a person was murdered in March 1985 and all the indications point to a Provisional IRA assassination.  A major investigation was carried out by the Garda Síochána into the murder but, as it turned out, sufficient evidence was not available to prefer charges against any persons at that time.</P>
      <P>In November 1998 three and a half years after the murder, a person surrendered to the police in England and made certain statements about his involvement in murder and other serious offences committed in Northern Ireland and in the State. This included the murder of the person concerned in Cork in 1985.  As a result of those statements a Garda investigation file was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to prosecuting the person involved in Northern Ireland under the provisions of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976.  However, this aspect was subsequently overtaken by events when the person was convicted on a charge of murder in Northern Ireland and received two life sentences there.</P>
      <P>The Garda investigation into the murder in 1985 is continuing.  I am satisfied from a report I recently received from the Garda that they are pursuing the investigations as far as they can.</P>

      <P>The objective of the Government's exchange rate and monetary policy is price stability within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.  Reliably low inflation is central to the Government's policy of securing the maximum sustainable economic and employment growth, <i>inter alia,</i> by ensuring moderate wage developments.  Our recent inflation performance has been excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the price stability objective, the objective is that the Irish pound should trade comfortably within the ERM.  Participation in the ERM has helped to underpin the policy framework within which strong economic growth has <Col N="117" /> remained consistent with low inflation over recent years.</P>
    <P>As regards the euro conversion rate of the Irish pound, I will only say what I have said before which is that the Government's intention is that Ireland joins EMU at an exchange rate that meets the needs of the economy in the fullest sense of the term, and that between now and decision day we will be keeping the issue under active review.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to my reply of 19 November 1997 in relation to consultations with the exposed sectors regarding EMU.  The consultants appointed by Forfás under the auspices of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign to examine the implications for Irish industry of the UK remaining outside of EMU are expected to report in February.  Their report will provide concrete, practical guidelines to firms in exposed sectors of the economy as to the steps they should undertake in preparation to compete successfully in EMU.  As I indicated last November, once the report is completed my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will initiate a consultative process involving the social partners into the issues raised by the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also be interested to learn the result of a meeting earlier this week between the <Col N="118" /> Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and myself with representatives of ICTU which considered, among other things, the implications of Ireland's entry into EMU.  It was decided, that the Government, congress and employers' organisations should meet shortly under Partnership 2000 to accelerate the preparation for the competitive impact of EMU on the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>It was recognised at the meeting that the competitive challenge posed by EMU for the economy will require an intensification of the flexibility and problem solving approach to economic policy which has characterised the relationship between Government and the social partners over the last decade.  I am confident that the Partnership approach which builds on the successes of the past, while retaining a clear focus on the need to secure Ireland's international competitiveness in the future in EMU, represents the best mechanism to address the competitive challenges which may lie ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's position on the future of the duty free sales is well known to the Commission and our partners in ECOFIN.  It has also been raised by Irish ministers and officials on many occasions, including by the Taoiseach at the special European summit last year.</P>
      <P>As has been explained before in this House, the decisions on this matter were taken some considerable time ago.  The Council of Ministers decided unanimously back in 1991 to abolish duty free sales for travellers within the EU, as part of the taxation and excise measures to make the Single Market a reality.  A seven and a half year transitional period &mdash; up to 30 June 1999 &mdash; was granted for duty free shop operators and suppliers. The Commission view is that this was sufficient, as duty free sales are an anomaly within the Single Market.</P>
      <P>There is no proposal from the EU Commission before ECOFIN at present to provide the basis for a discussion at ECOFIN.  Indeed, the Commission has on several occasions refused to come forward with any proposal to extend the period of application of duty free sales to travellers within the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the lead-in to the UK's Presidency my officials have discussed with the UK its priorities while it has the Chair of the ECOFIN Council of Ministers.  These will necessarily concentrate on issues where decisions are required and where proposals are before the Council.  During these discussions the importance to Ireland of the duty free issue was pointed out.  However, I have to <Col N="119" /> report from these discussions and judging from a reply in the UK Parliament in December, that the UK would not, at present, appear to see the future of duty free as a priority issue in their Presidency.</P>
    <P>When the special economic study of the impact of the ending of duty free that Ireland is undertaking is completed, I will consider further what efforts can be made in relation to this topic and I will continue to keep the issue of the future of duty free on the political agenda.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind this House that any decision to change the decision to end duty free facilities for intra-EU travel will require a proposal and the unanimous approval of all our partners. In this subject the Irish have made the running so far but there is little evidence of any wider support at ECOFIN.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 68, 69 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>Inflation in 1997 turned out to be 1.5 per cent on a consumer price index basis, compared with the original forecast of 2.2 per cent as published at the beginning of the year.  My forecast for inflation for 1998 is 2 per cent as published on 3 December in the Economic Background to the Budget.  This was based on the standard assumption of unchanged interest and exchange rates. Updated forecasts will as usual be published by my Department at mid-year in the Economic Review and Outlook publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I specifically referred in my Budget Statement to the necessity to contain inflationary pressures. The personal tax reductions which I announced will help to achieve that objective.  They are, together with the positive action in relation to <Col N="120" /> social inclusion, higher investment to tackle skills shortages and improve our infrastructural base, part of a package.  This is, combined with the continued improvement in the public finances, and the programme of social consensus between the Government, unions, farmers and employers, designed to secure the right conditions for sustainable economic growth.</P>
    <P>Both the Central Bank and the Government are agreed that the key objective of Ireland's fiscal policy is to promote sustainable growth without the risk of overheating, and I shall continue to pursue that objective in my next budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the United Kingdom has an opt-out from the provisions on EMU, under a Protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty.  Ireland chose not to have such an opt-out. Under the terms of the Protocol, the UK has notified the Council of Ministers that it does not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999.  Consequently, the United Kingdom is under no obligation to move to the third stage.  The UK may, however, reverse its notification at any time after the beginning of that stage.</P>
      <P>The policy of the United Kingdom on EMU is a matter for the British Government.  While a decision by the UK to enter EMU would have positive aspects for the Irish economy, it is a matter for the UK Government to exercise, as they wish, the discretion they are afforded by the treaty.  More generally, the processes of enhanced economic co-ordination in the third stage will provide an opportunity for discussions at ECOFIN on aspects of British policy questions impinging on the euro area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My priority remains ensuring that Ireland qualifies for EMU and will take part in the third stage from the beginning.  When the Maastricht Treaty received the endorsement of the Irish people, this was given without qualification or any provision for Ireland to opt out from the provisions for economic and monetary union.  Membership of EMU, irrespective of what the UK does, will on balance be of benefit for Ireland &mdash;<Col N="121" /> an assessment borne out in studies by both the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>As regards economic co-ordination, the Amsterdam European Council in June 1997 invited the ECOFIN Council of Ministers and the European Commission to examine and report on certain aspects of the implementation of Economic and Monetary Union, including how to improve the process of economic co-ordination in the third stage of EMU; organisation of the Council's dialogue with the European Central Bank; and implementation of Article 109 of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg European Council in December last received the report of ECOFIN and adopted a resolution incorporating the main elements of the report, setting out principles and arrangements for strengthened economic co-ordination among states sharing the single currency and between those states and other states not yet in a position to participate in the euro.  The ECOFIN Council is and will be at the centre of economic co-ordination.</P>
    <P>Ministers of the states participating in the euro area may meet informally among themselves to discuss issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency; the Commission, and the ECB when appropriate, will be invited to take part in the meetings.  Whenever matters of common interest are concerned, they will be discussed by Ministers of all member states.</P>
    <P>Decisions will in all cases be taken by ECOFIN, which includes all member states of the EU, in accordance with the procedures determined by the treaty.</P>
    <P>The draft report, including the question of meetings of Ministers of those member states participating in the euro area, was the subject of discussion and consideration by my colleagues and I in the ECOFIN Council, including Mr. Gordon Brown, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer.  It was subsequently discussed at the European Council, among the Heads of State or Government, including the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr. Tony Blair.</P>
    <P>The position of the UK is that of a non-participating member state.  However, the UK Government has also stated that, in principle, membership of a successful single currency would be beneficial for Britain and Europe.  In that context, the UK will be included with all the other member states in the co-ordination of economic policies &mdash; although they may not be involved in informal discussions of issues connected with the shared specific responsibilities of participating member states for the single currency.  Moreover, I am confident that the UK will play a positive role in relation to the third stage of EMU, including the arrangements for economic co-ordination, given their statement that it is in the UK national interest for the single currency to work.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged by all concerned that EMU will link the economies of the euro-area member <Col N="122" /> states more closely together.  To the extent that national economic policies will have an impact on inflation prospects and monetary conditions in the euro-area, the single currency will require closer co-ordination of economic policies among euro-area member states.  However, economic and monetary interdependence with member states which are not participating in the single currency will also be strong &mdash; they all participate in the single market.  The need to ensure further convergence and the smooth functioning of the single market therefore requires all member states to be included in the co-ordination of economic policies.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the European Council Resolution on this and the related issues of economic policy in the third stage of EMU strikes the right balance between, on the one hand, the special needs for co-ordination among the euro-area member states and, on the other, the common interests of all member states &mdash; without undermining the treaty in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>For a long period of time, I have held the view that the rate of tax applied to the realisation of a capital gain was too high.  Consequently, I announced on budget day that the standard rate of capital gains tax for all taxable gains, except development land gains, would be reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, with effect from that day.  The capital gains tax code already treats the disposal of development land less favourably than other disposals and such gains will remain taxable at 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>The higher rate of capital gains tax discouraged individuals from placing their capital at risk in new ventures.  The 40 per cent rate encouraged the long-term holding of assets, often until death, without regard for commercial considerations. This meant that capital gains tax was often avoided as assets transferred by way of death do not generally give rise to a capital gains tax charge.  Furthermore, the reduction in the rate of capital gains tax will redress the imbalance which existed between the taxation of risk-free deposits and productive risky investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that persons employed in the construction industry are classified for tax purposes as employees or as subcontractors.</P>
      <P>Where the person engaged is an employee PAYE/PRSI and levies must be deducted.  Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regularly conduct joint investigations under the Joint Investigation Programme to ensure those engaged as employees fully comply with the tax system and to ensure that employers are not facilitating &lsquo;working and signing&rsquo; arrangements.  Allegations of particular abuses are automatically investigated.  Facilities have been made available to worker representatives to enable them to bring in any cases where they consider abuses, such as those suggested by the Deputy are taking place, to official notice.  In addition, union representatives are entitled to sit on the Black Economy Monitoring Group, which operates under the aegis of Partnership 2000.  This group includes representatives from employers, from the unions, from Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>There is a special subcommittee of the Black Economy Monitoring Group which deals with the construction industry.  Union members of the group are free to call for a meeting of this group, at which any difficulties can be brought to the notice of the Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Sub-contracting is an integral part of the construction industry.  Payments to subcontractors come within the relevant contracts system &mdash; commonly referred to as the C2 or C45 system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an unregistered contractor, he or she is required to deduct Relevant Contracts Tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>Revenue has issued guidelines to the industry setting out the criteria under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a subcontractor.  Principal contractors and subcontractors creating self employment contractual arrangements must sign a declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them and they are both satisfied that the contract created is a contract of self-employment.</P>
    <P>As part of their ongoing audit programme in the industry and by way of a special project which is being undertaken at present Revenue monitor all aspects of compliance in the industry.  The special programme is focused on detecting failure by employers to operate PAYE/PRSI and levies from employees and to make the appropriate employers' contribution to PRSI.  Extra resources have been devoted to the campaign, which will be conducted nationwide.  Where necessary, it is intended that inspectors of taxes will be able to call on the assistance of the Revenue Mobile Service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Three new enterprise areas were designated under section 26 of the Finance Act, 1997.  The same section makes provision for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports, including Knock Airport, as enterprise areas.</P>
      <P>The designation order will be made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise and following receipt of a proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations.</P>
      <P>Qualifying trading operations are (a) manufacturing companies which qualify under the Finance Acts for 10 per cent Corporation Tax and (b) internationally traded service activities i.e. data processing, software development, technical and consulting, commercial laboratory, healthcare, research and development, media recording, training, publishing, financial and administrative headquarters.  Companies must also have been approved for financial assistance by the State industrial development agencies &mdash; Forbairt or IDA Ireland.  The tax reliefs for the enterprise areas are those set out in section 35 of the Finance Act, 1995 and include capital allowances of up to 100 per cent on expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of premises used by qualifying companies as well as a double rent allowance for ten years for the lessees of such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the EU Commission raised queries about the State aid aspects of enterprise areas.  I issued a statement on this matter last July.  Last month I issued a further statement announcing that the EU Commission had decided to approve the tax reliefs for enterprise areas in the context of State aids. <Col N="126" /> However, the Commission's decision does not cover the enterprise areas adjacent to regional airports.</P>
    <P>The designation of the regional airport areas depends on specific projects being proposed for each area.  When such projects come forward and are approved by the relevant authorities, the individual enterprise areas will be designated and submitted to the EU Commission for its approval. It should be noted that under the Commission's decision, the provisions for all of the enterprise areas covered by the 1997 Finance Act will have to terminate on 31 December 1999 instead of 30 June 2000.  To date, no specific proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations adjacent to Knock Airport has been submitted to me.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners monitor the use of various tax incentives on an ongoing basis, both as regards the cost of such incentives and the categories of persons, including high earners, who use them.  As might be expected, high earners tend to make fairly wide use of available incentives to reduce their tax bills.  In general, I have no difficulty with this &mdash; tax incentives are there to be used and to encourage investment which would not otherwise be made in areas such as films, urban renewal and high-risk business expansion. However, I do have a difficulty if tax incentives are used in a way that reduce effective tax rates on very high incomess to very low levels.  That would be unfair and would work completely against the progressivity of the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a recent review by the Revenue Commissioners of the use of incentives by high earners, it was evident that, while the vast majority of high earners do pay very substantial amounts of income tax, about one-fifth were able to reduce their effective tax rates (that is their final tax bill as a percentage of gross income) below 20 per cent.  It was clear from the review that the open-ended availability of capital allowances for passive investment in certain tax-favoured buildings, such as hotels and buildings located in tax designated areas, was a prime factor in contributing to the very low effective rates in these cases.  Accordingly, I moved in the <Col N="127" /> budget to close off these shelters for passive individual investors in the case of certain hotels and to cap them at £25,000 in the case of buildings entitled to capital allowances.  I also limited the amount which can be raised under the BES scheme in order to better target the relief at smaller companies.  As is normal, these changes are subject to transitional measures to cater for certain cases or projects in the pipeline which it is reasonable to allow proceed in all the circumstances. I am confident that these measures will contribute to greater equity and progressivity in the income tax system, and will help to ensure that all high earners pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to publish the results of the review carried out by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

In formulating this package of measures it was considered that the most appropriate way to meet the concerns of private householders providing their own private water supplies was to introduce a new grants scheme for the provision of new, or improved, water supplies to private houses.  Given this, I do not propose to introduce any new tax relief in this area.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the unemployment rate in Ireland has dropped dramatically in recent years, from 15½ per cent in 1993 to about 10 per cent today. The Government's policies are designed to ensure that we continue to make significant progress. The current level of about 10 per cent &mdash; while a substantial improvement &mdash; is still unacceptably high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is somewhat paradoxical that relatively high unemployment could co-exist with possible labour shortages at both the skilled and unskilled ends of the labour market.  The challenge for policy <Col N="128" /> is to ensure that the unemployed are encouraged to take up the increasing number of jobs becoming available as our economy continues to grow.</P>
    <P>As regards the supply of skilled labour specifically, the Deputy will be aware that the Government approved major new investment in education and training in November last, totalling £250 million over three years.  The investment is to provide for a substantial increase in the number of third level places to meet future skills needs in the computer software industry.  It will also be used to meet skills requirements in the hotel and tourism sector and to create training places for teleservices in the post leaving certificate area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the supply of unskilled labour, a number of initiatives are in place to assist particularly the long-term unemployed to return to work.  The most important of these are the community employment and back to work allowance schemes.  In addition, in the recent budget I introduced a further initiative of tax concessions focused specifically on the long-term unemployed. These concessions, which should have a significant effect, come into operation from April next.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern and that of the Central Bank about the danger of serious labour shortages emerging.  The measures I have outlined are designed to ensure that the labour market responds as fully as possible to the increased job opportunities now arising in the economy. The position will continue to be kept under review and any further action that is deemed necessary will be taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>When I announced the new 20 per cent CGT rate in my recent budget, I indicated that as a prudent accountant I had allowed for a net cost to the Exchequer of £5 million in the first year and £19 million in a full year.  On a purely static basis, the Revenue Commissioners have estimated that a reduction in the rate of CGT from 40 per cent to 20 per cent would cost the Exchequer £40 million in a full year.  However, it is only fair to assume that the new lower rate of CGT will encourage a larger number of annual transactions, especially from long-term capital holders.  Hence the cost to the Exchequer reflects the estimated dynamic effects.</P>
      <P>While I am aware of recent newspaper reports concerning the reduction in the CGT rate, I do not think it is appropriate for me to comment on individual taxpayers.  As I have said in reply to an earlier question, I believe that the rate of tax applied to the realisation of a capital gain was too high and the reduction in the rate of 20 per cent will redress the imbalance which existed between the taxation of risk-free deposits and other productive investments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 82 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The question of restructuring the State banking sector has been considered by successive administrations since the early 1990s.  This is a very complex issue given the major changes which have occurred in the banking marketplace over the past few years.  These developments have increasingly underlined the fact that the position of the ACC and ICC Banks cannot remain as it is.  In view of this, I met Ms Gary Joyce, chairman of ACC Bank, on Thursday, 17 July 1997 to invite her to put forward proposals to me regarding the future of ACC Bank.  My predecessor had already invited the chairman of ICC Bank to put forward proposals in relation to its future.  Subsequently, the Government authorised me to enter into consultations with the boards, management and staff of these banks, with a view to developing detailed proposals on the future structure and ownership of the banks, in a way which would recognise the interests of all stakeholders, including the taxpayer. To this end, I met with the management and staff of both ACC and ICC Banks on 8 December 1997.  In the course of these meetings, I impressed upon them that the status quo was not an option for the banks in the long term and that any process for restructuring the banks would have to be open, transparent and non-discriminatory. Other than this, the Government is open to all options regarding the future of the banks, including, in principle, disposal of up to 100 per cent of the State's interest in these banks. Following my initial meetings, I am currently awaiting formal submissions from the staff unions in both banks.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the positions on the executive board, since appointments to posts within the internal management structures of the European Central Bank will be matters for the ECB itself.</P>
      <P>Regarding appointments to the executive board of the ECB, the Maastricht Treaty lays down the procedure for the appointment of the board.  The relevant Articles of the treaty are 109a and 109l, together with Article 50 of Protocol (No. 3) on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.  When the executive board of the ECB is being established, the president, the vice-president and the other members shall be appointed by common accord of the governments of the member states at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council and after consulting the European Parliament and the Council of the European Monetary Institute.</P>
      <P>The number of members on the executive board is set at six, including the president and vice-president.  However, the number of members on the board may be reduced to a minimum of four, if there are member states which have derogations and are not proceeding to the third stage of EMU.  The composition of the board therefore cannot be considered formally by ECOFIN until the decision on who is to participate in the third stage has been taken around May of next year.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the importance of ensuring that appointments to the executive board are made in a way that ensures its overall competence for its tasks, and at the same time serves the interests of Ireland and the Union as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Government has also decided to set up an Interdepartmental Monitoring Committee to oversee the achievement of year 2000 compliance in the Civil Service.  This committee will be chaired by my Department, and will include members from the private sector.  It will submit quarterly reports to Government on the progress being made in achieving year 2000 compliance in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of Departments including in their strategy statements an action plan to deal with year 2000 compliance, I would expect that this work would be included in their business plans or in the work programmes arising from the strategy statements.</P>

      <Quest>the impact of the proposed new mechanism for the funding of local authorities on the projected gross non capital supply services and the capital services for 1999 originally published with his Budget Statement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I would point out at the outset that the figures for non-capital supply services published with the 1998 budget were net figures, not gross figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium includes a commitment to limit the growth in net current spending to 4 per cent and <Col N="133" /> capital spending growth to 5 per cent on average up to 1999.  Net current spending for this purpose is defined as net non-capital supply services and central fund services.</P>
    <P>The projections as published showed an increase in total net current spending in 1999 of 4.8 per cent and an annual average increase of 3.8 per cent in the period 1998 to 2000 on a &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; basis.  In the light of the actual 1997 outturn, the annual average increase in the period 1998-2000 is now 3.43 per cent.  The 1999 figure is now 4.6 per cent.  Capital spending in 1999 is projected to decrease by 1.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The new local authority financing arrangements which will come into effect in 1999 will result in an increase of £224 million in the published projection for net non-capital supply services and a reduction of £178 million in the projection for capital expenditure in that year.  The net increase in Exchequer spending will be £46 million which is small in the context of total projected Exchequer spending in 1999 of about £17,000 million.  Moreover, the net Exchequer impact of the new arrangements can be accommodated within the general contingency provision of £180 million included in the projections of the 1999 budgetary position published with my budget.</P>
    <P>The adjustments would mean that the increase in net current expenditure in 1999 would rise to 6.2 per cent and the annual average increase in such expenditure in the period 1998-2000 would rise to 3.95 per cent.  The projected reduction in Exchequer capital expenditure in 1999 would increase to 10.4 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, under VAT law, farmers are not obliged to register for VAT, regardless of their turnover levels.  As a group, unregistered farmers are compensated for the VAT paid by them on their farming inputs in accordance with a mechanism provided for in the EU Sixth VAT Directive. The scheme, which is essentially a simplification measure, provides for a set amount (known as the flat-rate refund or addition) which farmers add to their prices when selling to VAT registered businesses (co-ops, meat factories etc). The VAT registered business, in turn, deducts the addition as a normal business input in its periodic VAT return.  As indicated on budget night, the flat rate will increase from 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent from 1 March 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> In accordance with criteria set down in the directive, the level of the flat-rate refund is calculated each year on the basis of macro-economic data (i.e. agricultural inputs and production and the prevailing VAT rate structures) relating to such farmers for the preceding three years.  For 1998, the rate of 3.6 per cent was derived by averaging the updated calculated rates of 3.2015 per cent (1995), 3.8631 per cent (1996) and 3.6923 per cent (1997).</P>
    <P>As regards revenue foregone, the amount to be refunded to farmers through the flat rate scheme in 1998 is estimated at £93 million.  However, if the flat-rate scheme were to be abolished, the farmers could still register for VAT and reclaim the £93 million in this way.  Such farmers could be expected to be in a permanent repayment position as most of their outputs are zero rated i.e. food.  In addition, there would be a considerable additional administrative cost for both the Revenue Commissioners and the farmers if all such farmers had to go the route of registration to reclaim VAT on their inputs.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the VAT treatment of newspapers was reviewed in the context of the budget.</P>
      <P>The position is that newspapers and other general interest periodicals are taxed at the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.  I have no plans to reduce that rate.  While it would be legally possible under EU VAT law to apply a rate as low as 5 per cent to newspapers, the cost of such a concession would be about £15 million per annum.  Furthermore, it would involve the creation of a new lower reduced rate.  Inevitably, there would be calls from a number of other sectors which could potentially benefit under EU rules to be put at the lower rate.  The cost of a widely based concession would be very substantial.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the competition faced by Irish newspapers from UK publications.  I would agree that UK produced publications may have advantages of economies of scale and lower production costs.  However, I would point out that all newspapers sold here attract VAT at the 12.5 per cent rate.  Accordingly, I do not accept that there is any VAT based distortion of competition in the sector.  In any event, a VAT concession would have to apply to both Irish and UK published newspapers and therefore would not improve the competitive position of the Irish newspaper industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's preparations for the move to stage three of EMU are in accordance with the timetable set out in the Maastrict Treaty, which is as follows.  The Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, on the basis of a recommendation from the European Commission and convergence reports from the Commission and the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the forerunner of the European Central Bank.  ECOFIN will recommend its findings to the European Council, that is the Heads of State or Government of the EU member states, who will, after consulting the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions for adopting the euro.</P>
      <P>The EMI and Commission reports and the Commission recommendation will be published on 25 March 1998.  The European Parliament will be consulted following their publication.  ECOFIN will meet to make its assessment on 1 May 1998, with Parliament's formal opinion on 2 May, and the final decision by the European Council on the afternoon of 2 May.</P>
      <P>As regards national preparations for EMU, clearly the first requirement is that Ireland meet the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty for membeship of EMU, and the Deputies will be aware that Ireland does in fact meet them.</P>
      <P>On the legislative front, I recently published the Central Bank Bill, 1997, which is designed to provide for the compatibility of Ireland's Central Bank legislation with the requirements in the Maastricht Treaty for independence of national Central Banks and for national legislation, including Central Bank statutes, to be compatible with the treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks.  It is also intended to have enacted, by summer 1998, legislation to provide for other changes in national law made necessary by the introduction of the euro and work on that legislation is proceeding at present.</P>
      <P>As regards practical preparations, my Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the preparations of the Irish public administration and has a key role in helping the rest of the economy to prepare itself for the changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 January I published the second edition of EMU and the euro: Ireland's National Changeover <Col N="136" /> Plan.  The plan is based on the assumption that EMU will begin on time and that Ireland will be a member of it from the outset.  It also outlines the timetable for the changeover to the euro. Briefly, on 1 January 1999, EMU will begin and the euro will come into being as the currency of the participating member states.  It will be useable for cashless transactions (eg cheques and credit transfers) from that date.  However, euro notes and coins will not be available for a further three years, so Irish pound notes and coins will continue in use and all banking facilities currently available in Irish pounds will continue to be available: in other words, individuals will be able to operate in Irish pounds as they do at present.  On 1 January 2002, euro notes and coins will be put into circulation and by 1 July 2002 at the latest (probably a good deal earlier), Irish pound notes and coins will cease to be legal tender and the changeover to the euro will be complete.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out the changeover arrangements that will be made by the public sector (including, specifically, the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my own Department), the banks and building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange.  It also outlines the initiatives which have been put in place by my Department in connection with the changeover. Briefly, these are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash; in 1995 a Single Currency Officers Team (SCOT) was set up: this includes a representative from each Government Department and its remit is to co-ordinate preparations for the changeover to the euro in the public sector;</P>
    <P>&mdash; in 1996, the Euro Changeover Group was set up: this includes representatives from ICTU, IBEC and a wide range of private sector bodies and its remit is to help co-ordinate the changeover across the economy;</P>
    <P>&mdash; in 1997 the Euro Changeover Team in my Department was set up, to carry out my Department's tasks in relation to the changeover in the public administration and in the rest of the economy;</P>
    <P>&mdash; in 1996 the Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign was established, to provide businesses with the information they need to prepare themselves for the changeover.</P>
    <P>An appendix to the plan outlines the changeover work being done by various public and private sector bodies and lists contact points for further information.</P>
    <P>A copy of the plan was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas and further copies are available from my Department and from Forfás, including on the Internet.</P>
    <P>As regards further initiatives in 1998, the plan makes it clear that the focus of the information programme on the changeover will be broadened <Col N="137" /> to include information for the general public; and that, assuming that the European Council confirms in May that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro, a Currency Changeover Board will be established in order to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover, including the areas of public and consumer information.</P>
    <P>As regards the research referred to by Deputy De Rossa, I understand that what is in question is a survey undertaken in the period October to early December 1997 by a representative body in conjunction with a financial institution, the results of which were published in mid-January.  The survey indicated a low level of actual preparation for the changeover among the 356 companies surveyed, though clearly the vast majority were aware of the advent of the euro.  I should point out that since the survey was taken, the Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign, which had by that time already circulated some 25,000 copies of its information pack for businesses, has produced a leaflet specially for small and mediumsized enterprises and circulated over 50,000 copies of it, including to members of the representative body involved in the survey.  In addition, the Forfás campaign has also produced a summary leaflet which has been circulated in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners to all VAT-registered companies: in all, over 140,000 copies of the summary leaflet have been circulated.</P>

      <P>The mid-term review provided that progress on the National Conference Centre, the peat power station, the Biomass Blanchardstown, the National Gallery and Luas will be considered in the spring of 1998 by the CSF Monitoring Committee with a view to decommitting Structural Funds in whole or in part if it cannot be shown that sufficient progress has been achieved to secure their likely completion within the existing agreed time scale for the projects under the current round.  Similar provision was made for reviewing progress on training under the Local Urban and Rural Development OP.  In addition, the review provided for progress reports being prepared for the CSF and Operational Programme Monitoring Committees on measures in respect of which expenditure is expected to be more than 20 per cent below the year's provision in the latest approved financial plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> My Department has issued instructions to all the Lead Departments for the operational programmes, not just those mentioned by the Deputy, which lay down considerations which must be taken into account in implementing the provisions arising from the mid-term review.  The paramount concerns stressed are the need to avoid the possibility of any Structural Funds being lost to Ireland; ensure the earliest possible decommitment of any funds which will become available as a result of the failure of projects or measures to be progressed and finalised within the deadlines for committing and incurring expenditure; enable any funds released to be decommitted in sufficient time to be spent efficiently and effectively on alternative uses within the time scale of the current round which will maximise their contribution to the achievement of the CSF objectives as refined in the mid-term review; and ensure that reprogramming arising from the decommitments is Exchequer neutral.</P>
    <P>In relation to reporting progress on the specified major projects and measure underspends where lack of progress on projects is a factor, Departments were asked to state clearly the stage at which projects are: e.g. design and planning, public consultation, planning approval, environmental impact assessment, contract or construction etc. and to indicate both the minimum time and the estimated likely time to complete each of the outstanding stages of developing the projects. They were also asked to give a frank and realistic assessment of the likelihood of the projects being completed within the prescribed deadlines for the Operational Programmes.</P>
    <P>In putting forward projects or measures for the possible use of any funds which may be released Departments were asked to indicate the actual level of spending, the amount of any funding uncommitted and the anticipated level of demand in respect of the relevant measure at that point in time; indicate non-cofinanced eligible expenditure which has taken place during the programme period or is planned for the remainder of the period which could absorb any decommitted funds; give details of the proposed expenditure and the expected outcome; specify the time scale for completing the activity.  In the case of projects, the minimum time and the estimated likely time required to complete each stage of developing the project as outlined above for major projects; and show how the proposed expenditure will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of promoting growth and sustainable employment, the priorities outlined in the mid-term review or to bridging Ireland's development gap.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 116 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, Ireland qualified as an Objective 1 region in the present round of Structural Funding by virtue of the fact that, as a single region under the European System of Regional Classification, our per-capita GDP was below 75 per cent of the Community average. The recent growth we have enjoyed in per-capita income means that, as we prepare for the next round, this is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>In its Agenda 2000 proposals, the European Commission has proposed that transitional arrangements be put in place for regions which no longer meet the eligibility threshold for Objective 1 funding.  The Government is aiming to negotiate a transition package which will ensure continued access to the Objective 1 funding envelope, albeit on a diminishing scale, during the next financing round for the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also acutely conscious of the needs of the less-developed parts of the country and of their commitments to those areas in the Government's programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium.  In this context the Government will consider the position of those regions of Ireland which may still be below the 75 per cent criterion.  This consideration will have to take account of the fact that any change in the country's single region status would have to be approved by the Commission and of the overriding objective of maximising Structural Fund <Col N="141" /> transfers to Ireland as a whole under the next round.</P>

      <P>The restrictions introduced in the budget are designed to limit the extent to which capital allowances on investment in industrial and commercial buildings can be claimed against non-rental income by passive individual investors and partnerships.  The measure arises from the need to maintain a balance between the provision of tax incentives to promote investment and the use of such incentives by high income earners for the purposes of sheltering large amounts of income from taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the reliance generally placed upon capital allowances in framing investment plans, the restrictions were made subject to transitional provisions to cater for projects which at the time of the budget were at an advanced stage of planning or were already under way.  I have received several <Col N="143" /> representations since the budget on behalf of projects in the pipeline which may not come within these transitional provisions and I am considering in the context of the Finance Bill whether some relaxation of the transitional provisions is merited in the light of the commitments already entered into in respect of such projects and having regard to the level of new investment and employment arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>As regards section 24 of the 1991 Finance Act, now section 408 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, this was introduced as an anti-avoidance provision to counter the sharing of capital allowances on a building or structure among a large group of individual investors.  The purpose of this section is to contain the Exchequer cost of property investment schemes where a large number of investors come together to invest in a particular development.  The provisions of section 24 will therefore complement the budget restriction of £25,000 per annum on the amount of capital allowances on buildings other than hotels which a passive individual investor may offset against non-rental income.  While the provisions of section 24 will be kept under review, there are no plans to relax or modify them at this stage.</P>

In particular, I had asked the Governor to advise me if the Board of the Central Bank is satisfied that the bank has the necessary legal powers for the effective execution of its regulatory role, that the procedures and practices necessary to effectively exercise these powers are in place and that these procedures and practices are being implemented effectively.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that I placed the contents of the Governor's letter on the record of the House when responding to a parliamentary question from Deputy Rabbitte on 19 November 1997. In that letter, the Governor confirmed that the board is satisfied with its legal powers; that the board keeps under review the bank's supervisory practices and its approach to supervision; that the board endeavours to ensure that these are in line with international best practice and are subject to continuous modernisation and adaptation to meet the needs of a changing global environment.  He also confirmed that the board is satisfied that the supervisory procedures and practices are being effectively implemented by the bank.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal include a remit to make whatever broad recommendations the tribunal considers necessary or expedient for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally.

      <P>In April 1997 Ireland submitted its convergence programme for the period 1997-99.  As provided for in Article 103 of the Maastricht Treaty this is designed to facilitate the multilateral surveillance of economic policies in the run-up to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union.  From next year convergence programmes will be replaced by stability programmes which will outline how our medium-term budgetary objectives will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council invited the Commission at last June's ECOFIN meeting to monitor progress under the programme and agreed, in the context of the multilateral surveillance procedures, to review Ireland's progress against the targets outlined. An updated version of Ireland's convergence programme was submitted in December 1997 to the Commission.  This was included in the &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo; circulated to the House as part of the budget 1998 documentation.  It outlined the latest medium-term <Col N="145" /> budgetary projections taking account of the budget and the Department of Finance's latest economic projections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that the NESF Report No. 15, to which the Deputy is referring, accepted that there had been an increased emphasis in recent budgets on tax reform measures for those on low pay, before referring to the conclusion that those on higher pay have benefited most in absolute terms.</P>
      <P>Measuring budget gains in absolute terms for people at different income levels can be slightly misleading and is not entirely appropriate, on its own, for comparison purposes.  The general tax changes introduced in budgets, which normally include changes to the basic personal allowances, bands and rates, will of their nature provide higher nominal gains to taxpayers on higher incomes than to those on lower incomes, whose exposure to taxation is more limited.  However, when such gains are expressed as a proportion of net income or as a percentage of tax liability, people on lower incomes usually achieve the higher percentage changes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, when comparing gains from budgetary measures account should also be taken of tax measures, outside the basic tax packages, which can restrict tax reliefs used mainly by people on higher incomes.  Such measures in recent years include, especially the standard rating of mortgage interest and medical insurance reliefs, and the measures I introduced in the recent budget, for example, restrictions on the use of BES, capital allowances and dividend tax credits.  Such measures increase the tax burden of those availing of such reliefs, mainly people on higher incomes.  However, as they are not availed of by all taxpayers on such incomes they are not reflected in the usual comparative tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to assisting certain less well off groups, I announced additional measures in the recent budget which are specifically aimed at those on lower incomes and the unemployed.  To assist the long-term unemployed back to work I introduced a special tax allowance in the first year of employment of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each child for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job.  The allowance will be tapered down over a three year period.  I also <Col N="146" /> announced changes in the operation of the family income supplement &mdash; FIS &mdash; to a net income basis which will be of significant benefit to employees with families on low incomes.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that persons employed in the construction industry are classified for tax purposes as employees or as sub-contractors.  I am assuming that the abuse referred to by the Deputy relates to the practice of building workers being incorrectly categorised as self-employed (sub-contractors) when they are in fact employees.</P>
      <P>Sub-contracting is an integral part of the construction industry.  Payments to sub-contractors come within the relevant contracts system &mdash; commonly referred to as the C2 or C45 system. Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an unregistered contractor, he or she is required to deduct relevant contracts tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>Revenue has issued guidelines to the industry setting out the criteria under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a sub-contractor.  Principal contractors and sub-contractors creating self-employment contractual arrangements must sign a declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them and they are both satisfied that the contract created is a contract of self-employment.</P>
      <P>Revenue have advised me that they are currently engaged in a nationwide campaign to ensure that declarations made by principal contractors and sub-contractors represent the true situation.  Where an employment is considered to exist and PAYE/PRSI and levies are not being deducted, the principal is being advised to put matters on a proper footing.  Where this is not done, the principal will become liable for the PAYE/PRSI and levies.  Each principal classified by Revenue as an employer can have that decision reviewed internally in Revenue and has a statutory right of appeal to the appeal commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; PCW &mdash; provided for the negotiation of local bargaining increases in one of two ways, either a straight 3 per cent increase, known as the option B route, or what became known as &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; under option A. Restructuring was to operate within cost parameters which would allow settlements which added around 3 per cent to payroll during the period of the PCW &mdash; 1 January 1994 to 30 June 1997 in the public service &mdash; but it was also recognised that these settlements might, of their nature, involve some element of additional cost beyond the period of the PCW.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the local bargaining claims in the public service have been dealt with under option A and, at this stage, settlements have been reached with groups comprising over 85 per cent of the total public service workforce.  The groups concerned include Civil Service clerical, executive, <Col N="148" /> management and professional grades, prison officers, gardaí, members of the Defence Forces, teachers, manual workers, craftspersons, all of the major groups in the local authority service, nurses, non-consultant hospital doctors, paramedics, radiographers, medical laboratory technicians, ambulance personnel and clerical and administrative staff in the health service and a range of different groups in the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>The PCW local bargaining agreements have tended to be very complex and to differ widely in their structure.  Among the elements which were included in different agreements were salary increases, which in some cases varied depending on an individual's length of service and in some cases were confined to serving staff and did not apply to new recruits, selective up-gradings and promotions for a limited proportion of a grade and non-pay items such as enhanced early retirement provisions and the reckonability in future of certain payments for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>The PCW local bargaining terms also provided for concessions from staff which would take account of the need for flexibility and change and the contribution to be made by employees to such change.  Once again there were significant variations between the different agreements, reflecting the operational requirements of the various parts of the public service.  Among the elements which feartured in the agreements were various cost saving measures, co-operation with changes in structures, work practices or other conditions of service, enhanced flexibility in the performance of duties, commitments in relation to atypical working and procedures to deal with under performers.</P>
    <P>In view of the number and range of groups involved and the complexity of the individual settlements, it would not be practicable to provide the type of list requested by Deputy McDowell.  In general, however, it is fair to say that prior to the nurses' dispute, settlements had been reached with over 60 per cent of public servants within the terms and cost parameters of the PCW and that the increases secured last year by some groups in the health sector clearly went beyond the cost parameters of the PCW agreement. I should also add that the PCW local bargaining provisions have, in general, helped to reinforce the concept of linking organisational changes and improvements in efficiency and effectiveness with pay developments for public service employees.</P>
    <P>The PCW expired in the public service on 30 June 1997, and Partnership 2000 came into operation on 1 July 1997.  However, there are still some PCW local bargaining claims which remain to be settled.  I am not in a position to provide Deputy Deasy with a list of all the cases involved but I can say that while there are claims outstanding in all the different parts of the public service, most of them cover relatively small numbers of staff.  The current difficulties in relation to the pay of a number of key groups, including craft <Col N="149" /> workers and gardaí, also need to be resolved.  My main concern, as far as all these cases are concerned, is that they should be resolved within the PCW cost norm.</P>

However, the annual cost to the Exchequer of the stamp duty relief on new houses given the current yeild is estimated to be in the region of £90-£100 million.  The necessary data in relation to the purchase of new houses by owner occupiers are not available.</P>
      <P>The targeting of stamp duty reliefs in favour of new houses takes account, <i>inter alia</i>, of the fact that most new house sales are subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent, whereas sales of second hand houses generally are not.  These reliefs are also designed to encourage the building of new houses and thereby to support employment in the construction industry.</P>

    <P>I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank on 31 October 1997 requesting clarification of a number of matters included in its report.

    <P>As regards publication of the Central Bank report, the DPP was asked for his view on 31 October 1997 as to whether communicating this report to the Houses of the Oireachtas might prejudice consideration and possible prosecution by the DPP.  In order to formulate a response, the director sought some further information which was forwarded to him on 9 December 1997 and I understand that he will be in a position to respond to me when he has considered this information together with the clarifications received from the Central Bank on 16 January 1998.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the disparity between CSO and Revenue figures for personal income is more apparent than real.  The two sets of figures are not prepared on the same basis.</P>
      <P>In the first place, the figures mentioned are not directly comparable on the basis of time because the Revenue figure is for gross income arising in the tax year 1994-95 and the CSO figure relates to the calendar year 1995.  The CSO figure of £29,000 million for total personal income earned in 1994 is a more appropriate figure for comparison with the Revenue figure of £17,334 million.</P>
      <P>The CSO figure must then be adjusted for comparability to exclude amounts which are either tax exempt or represent income concepts which are not income for tax purposes.  The main exclusions are in respect of current transfer payments, which are either not taxable or fall below tax exemption limits, national debt interest paid to residents, mainly payable to institutions, imputed rental income accruing to houseowners, not income for tax purposes untaxed unemployment benefit and disability benefit, because of higher tax thresholds in individual cases, investment income of pension funds and life funds etc. excluding national debt interest, tax exempt, and employers PRSI, not income for tax purposes. These adjustments reduce the CSO figure to £21,000 million.</P>
      <P>The Revenue figure of £17,334 million represents 90 per cent of the self-employed and 98 per cent of the PAYE expected totals.  Adjusting for full coverage brings the estimated total to £18,100 million.  This figure must then be adjusted for comparability by the subtraction of amounts for capital allowances and losses which are already recognised in the CSO figure, and by the addition of quantifiable amounts which are not in the Revenue figure, such as employee contributions to pension funds tax deductible, employer contributions to pension funds, not income for tax purposes, interest income that does not need to be declared or is not recorded, but from which tax has been deducted, and unemployment benefit and disability benefit not recorded, but from which tax has been deducted.  Together they bring the comparable Revenue figure to £19,200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adjusted difference between the two sets of figures is £1,800 million.  This may be largely or entirely explained by factors such as the income of some 40,000 farmers and other self-employed who are not processed annually on tax records, because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds, by other tax exempt income not already taken into account above such as stallion fees, artists income and patents income, and also by income from contributory pensions which falls below individual income tax thresholds.  For example, contributory pension income included in the CSO figure comes to a total of £1,047 million but a significant portion of that amount is likely to be below individual tax <Col N="153" /> thresholds and not actively processed in the tax system.  Only some £430 million of social welfare pension income is included in the Revenue income figure.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the figures come much closer together when allowance is made for the necessary adjustments which I have outlined above, and that there are reasonable explanations for the remaining differences, I do not see the need to commission further special research on the basis of these figures.</P>
    <P>While the figures as presented are not, in their own right, indicative of tax evasion, Revenue have been tackling defaulters for some years by programmes to secure returns from those who do not file, the large scale targeted audit programme which resulted in some £133 million being collected in 1996, the random audit programme which exposes every taxpayer to the risk of audit, introduction of withholding tax and tax clearance procedures, significant use of the power to attach assets of tax defaulters, as well as other strong enforcement measures, new local collection and arrears compliance initiatives, measures to tackle black economy operators and putting in place a more active prosecution policy to address cases of serious tax evasion.</P>
    <P>These measures, which are to be intensified under Revenue's latest corporate plan, are underpinning the improved compliance in the tax system in recent years.  The measures needed are reviewed each year on the basis of Revenue's analysis of the returns and levels of compliance for that year.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic increase in the tax yield from the self-employed since the onset of self-assessment.  Net receipts grew from £255 million in 1991 to £527 million in 1996, a rate of growth significantly ahead of the growth of GNP at current prices.  As regards 1997, overall receipts from Schedule D taxpayers, including preliminary tax, have come in at about £90 million above target for the year.</P>
    <P>The success of self-assessment is also borne out by the impressive increase in the timely filing of returns since 1988-89.  A 74 per cent figure for 1994-95 compares with 63 per cent for 1988-89. There are substantial improvements for corporation tax and CGT also.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; projections for 1999 and 2000 published with my budget are different in concept from Government plans further to improve public services.  The &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; projections <Col N="154" /> are of the full year cost of maintaining the existing level of services, post-budget.  They do not provide for any new or expanded public services. But neither do they rule out such improvements, provided that total net current spending does not grow faster than the 4 per cent annual average limit set in the Government's programme.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech I said that the task of achieving the Government target of containing the growth in net current expenditure to an average annual increase of 4 per cent over its lifetime will be challenging.  I said that the projected average annual increase of 3.8 per cent on a &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; basis in the period 1998 to 2000 is within the Government target and the increase in 1999 is projected to be 4.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the light of the actual 1997 outturn, the increase in net current spending in 1998 is now estimated at 2.6 per cent.  The lower increase in 1998 also means that the average annual increase in the period 1998-2000 is reduced from the figure of 3.8 per cent indicated in the budget to 3.43 per cent.  The 1999 figure is now 4.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Government fully recognises that, with the projected average increase on a &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; basis running close to the 4 per cent programme limit, holding to that limit while at the same time implementing new policy commitments as set out in its Programme will not be easy.  It will require choices to be made in allocating resources so that the additional costs of any new or expanded services are met within the average annual limit of 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the implementation of commitments in the Government's programme for the provision of new or expanded services will be taken by the Government in the light of a full assessment of the costs involved and how those costs are to be met within the overall expenditure limit.  The comprehensive programme of expenditure reviews which are now being carried out as part of a three-year programme under the Strategic Management Initiative should assist in making decisions on priorities within and between spending programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing this question it is valuable at the outset to differentiate between various types of shocks which are likely to be experienced under EMU.  A clear distinction should be drawn between economic shocks which impact across the euro area as a whole &mdash; so called common <Col N="155" /> shocks and &mdash; those which may impact disproportionately on one area or region what are termed asymmetric shocks.</P>
      <P>In EMU, monetary and exchange rate shocks will be eliminated among participating member states by the adoption of a common monetary policy.  Monetary policy will be set by the European Central Bank for the euro zone as a whole in response to prevailing economic conditions in the euro area and reflecting the impact of common economic shocks experienced across the euro area &mdash; subject to the overriding objective of price stability.</P>
      <P>As far as asymmetric or regional shocks affecting Ireland alone are concerned, it is important to be aware that these type of disturbances are a good deal less likely to occur in EMU than in the past.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973 there has been a marked change in the structure, pattern of economic integration and adjustment of the Irish economy in line with the European economies. As Ireland's integration with the rest of the EU has deepened so too has the rate of convergence. Completion of the Single European Market, through the establishment of the euro zone, will accelerate the real convergence of Ireland with its euro partners, thereby increasing the correlation of economic shocks affecting Ireland with those to which the euro area as a whole are subject.</P>
      <P>As far as the availability of policy instruments to address economic shocks in EMU is concerned, strict adherence to the terms of the stability and growth pact will allow a member state participating in EMU to use budgetary policy when appropriate to attenuate the impact of the shock on the economy.  The pact sets out sound budgetary objectives which will ensure that fiscal flexibility is used in the most efficient and beneficial manner.  It has been adopted on the basis that sound public finances are a prerequisite to achieving conditions of macro-economic stability and for securing strong and sustainable growth in output and employment.</P>
      <P>However, budgetary policy, particularly in a small open economy is not the only means by which adjustments can be made to accommodate economic shocks.  It is vital that we achieve sufficient overall flexibility in the economy in order to facilitate the adjustment to economic shocks or disturbances which affect Ireland's international competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many determinants of competitiveness including factors under the direct or indirect control of Government and those which are the primary responsibility of firms, trade unions or industry groups.  In the first category are such factors as the overall levels of public expenditure and taxation and the cost and quality with which public services and the output of the State sector are delivered.  Competitiveness issues at enterprise level would include such factors as internal flexibility in terms of adopting new technology, employee training, continuous innovation, <Col N="156" /> productivity and flexible working methods.  The issue of pay cost competitiveness under the social partnership arrangements &mdash; a key determinant of Ireland's overall competitiveness &mdash; clearly takes in all groups in the economy. This emphasises the need for a continued strong focus on sustaining international competitiveness.</P>
    <P>In this context, I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply in relation to the planned meeting between Government, ICTU and employers organisations to discuss preparations for the competitive impact of EMU.</P>

      <P>A copy of the interim report on the hydrological/hydraulic study on the Cashen River was placed in the Oireachtas Library on 9 January 1998.  On the recommendation of the consultant who carried out the study, further research is necessary.  This has now been commissioned and is due for completion next October.  Until the study is finalised and until options are identified for maintenance of the scheme which would deal effectively with the siltation problems, no decision can be taken as to what special measures are to be adopted.  The Commissioners of Public Works will, however, continue to carry out annual maintenance works on the Feale/Cashen and funds have been made available for these.</P>

    <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is their policy to accept all information received concerning tax evasion, including anonymous information.  Revenue examines all such information in order to evaluate its relevance and quality and, where possible, takes steps to validate the information before any follow-up action is taken.  Where Revenue's examination of the information indicates that no follow-up action is necessary, the matter is not taken any further.  Where, however, Revenue's examination <Col N="157" /> indicates otherwise, the information is forwarded either to special inquiry branch, with a view to bringing the taxpayer into the tax system, or for investigation or audit, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently implementing a work plan to ensure that all of the Department's computer systems are Year 2000 compliant.  Most of the work will be completed by December 1998 with some remaining to be completed by the summer of 1999 at the latest.  The estimated cost so far of converting and testing computer software to ensure Year 2000 compliance in my Department is £20,000.  This is in addition to expenditure on the replacement of IT equipment which had been planned in the normal course of events and which will upgrade otherwise non-compliant systems.</P>
      <P>In relation to the euro, the Centre for Management and Organisation Development in the Department of the Finance is co-ordinating all necessary changes to common financial systems in Departments and accordingly the cost will be a joint cost among those Departments.</P>
      <P>The Department's core databases are developed through Lotus Notes and all recent developments in Lotus Notes makes use of four digit codes in its data formats.  Some older applications will be tested this year and any necessary changes will be completed by end of 1998-early 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with a Government decision, my Department has requested bodies under its aegis to address their Year 2000 and euro issues.  Work is ongoing in these offices, but the total extent of the changes required and the costs arising have not yet been fully determined.

    <P>While the questions do not refer directly to the Office of the Attorney General, I can report that costs of between £30,000-£50,000 have been identified for software upgrades in that office.</P>
    <P>With regard to lines of code, the software in use in my Department is mainly proprietary third party application software, e.g. word processors and spreadsheets.  Documenting the number of lines of code in each of these applications is not regarded as being necessary to deal with issues arising from the onset of the Year 2000.  The same holds true for other offices under the aegis of this Department, with the exception of the Central Statistics Office which has identified 391,112 lines of code which were not Year 2000 compliant. Work is on-going in that office to ensure full compliance by December 1998.</P>
    <P>My Department will be providing quarterly progress reports to the Government's Year 2000 Monitoring Committee which was established in September 1997 to oversee the achievement of Year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment in the Civil Service.  The committee which is chaired by the Department of Finance, will report quarterly to Government on progress on this matter.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE</P>
      <P>1.  The Statistics (Census of Industrial Production) Order, 1998, has just been signed by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Seamus Brennan, who has responsibility for the CSO.  It covers the manufacturing industry, mining, quarrying, turf production together with electricity, gas and water supply and comprises two separate but closely related annual inquiries, namely: the Census of Industrial Enterprises is required under EC Directives 64/475 and 72/221 and covers those enterprises which are wholly or primarily engaged in industrial production and have three or more persons engaged; and the Census of Industrial Local Units which covers all industrial local units with three or more persons engaged.  The census is a postal inquiry which relates in principle to the calendar year.  Following collection of the data, provisional overall results are released covering turnover, wages and salaries, labour costs, net output, gross output and persons engaged.  A detailed final report follows.</P>
      <P>2.  The Statistics (Industrial Commodities Production) Order, 1998, has been drafted and is being finalised at present.  It is required to give the CSO a legislative basis to partake in a PRODCOM Industrial Products Inquiry.  The current statutory instrument (S.  I. 67 of 1993) is valid until 8 March 1998, five years duration. The PRODCOM Inquiry is statutory for all industrial enterprises with three or more persons employed in production.  Only aggregate information is published and care is taken to ensure there are no direct or indirect disclosures or details of individual firms.</P>
      <P>3.  The Statistics (Transport of Passengers and Goods by Sea) Order, 1998, is required to meet the information requirements of the EU Maritime Directive &mdash;<i>Council Directive 95/64/EC of 8 December 1995 on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of goods and passengers by sea.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  The Statistics (Service Inquiries) Order, 1998, is required to meet the information requirements of the EU Regulation on Business statistics &mdash;<i>Council Regulation (EC, EURATOM) No. 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics.</i><Col N="162" /></P>

Copies of the commission's latest available annual report &mdash; for 1996 &mdash; were placed in the Oireachtas Library on publication in April 1997.</P>

    <P>Records of payments made in the years 1990-93 do not enable the separate identification of payments to charities.  Furthermore, payments made by my Department in the period 1990 to 1998 may have been to companies or organisations which have a charitable status designation from the Revenue Commissioners, such as local development and local community groups.  The identification of the individual companies or organisations is not possible as, in the majority of transactions, it was not necessary to seek this type of information from the companies or organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to an identical question on 18 November 1997, in which I dealt at length with the issues he raises.  I am circulating a copy of the reply, together with the report of the Dáil debate on that occasion with this reply.</P>
      <P>On 7 November 1997, I delivered the opening address to an IPA conference on governance and accountability in the public sector.  In the course of my speech I mentioned a number of measures which I would like to see being advanced, including a package of measures on regulatory reform to remove the barriers for important economic sectors such as small and medium enterprises and to provide clarity and accessibility to ordinary citizens.  The SMI working group on regulatory reform has made recommendations in this area which are under consideration at present.  A package of measures, drawing on these recommendations, is now being developed for implementation in 1998.  The next step is consultation with Government Departments and offices.  The timing of the introduction of these measures will be an important factor because of a number of other initiatives which are in train in Departments and offices under the SMI/Partnership 2000 modernisation programme, including preparation of statements of strategy, compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and development of a performance management system.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Dáil on 18 November 1997, the regulatory reform measures being considered include the possibility of introducing a statement of impact assessment for each new regulation which would help to measure the cost of compliance, particularly where economic competitiveness may be affected.  Similarly, the question of a quality regulation checklist is being considered which would help to ensure that new regulations being imposed meet certain minimum requirements in terms of clarity of purpose and understandable language.  Another of the measures is aimed at ensuring that there is adequate consultation with the public and-or specific interest groups prior to implementation of new regulations.  Some of these issues are already being tackled by Departments and offices through the quality customer service initiative, for example, ensuring that information is accessible, providing clear guides to services and schemes and maintaining ongoing dialogue with customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of quality customer service, the Deputy also inquires as to the main features of the customer services action plan for the Department of the Taoiseach which I was pleased to launch on Wednesday 12 November.  The plan has a number of key features as follows: it sets out clear details of the services which are provided and the structures to deliver those services; it specifies the standards which have been set and <Col N="166" /> which will be achieved over the next two years for the delivery of these services; it details the arrangements for getting in touch with my Department by telephone, letter and personal visit; it explains the arrangements for consulting with customers on the services being provided; and it outlines the arrangements for monitoring and review on a regular basis and for reporting on the achievement of targets.</P>
    <P>This action plan was developed in consultation with the staff of the Department of the Taoiseach. Everyone working in the Department recognises and is committed to their role in achieving the commitments contained in the plan. Where necessary changes to systems and structures, including allocation of resources, will be made in support of the delivery of a quality service. There are no proposals to appoint additional staff to oversee the implementation of the plan.</P>

            <entry>Council of Europe</entry>
            <entry>20 April 1989, Strasbourg</entry>
            <entry>Designed to co-ordinate endeavours among the member states of the Council of Europe to tackle the problem of insider trading. Part V of the Companies Act, 1990 introduced statutory provisions to tackle these problems in Ireland and in so doing implemented the EU Directive of 13 November 1989 co-ordinating regulations on insider dealing. No decision to sign or ratify the convention has been taken.</entry>

            <entry>Designed to provide common rules for the treatment to be accorded to companies and other bodies of each ratifying State in the territories of the other ratifying States. While the introduction of a unified code for the treatment to be accorded to companies proposed in the covnention might have certain advntages, a substantial revision of Irish Company Law would clearly be involved. The EU programme of harmonising company law governing the formation and operation of limited liability companies addresses many of the areas covered by the convention. Ireland has concentrated its resources on negotiating and implementing the relevant EU Directives and Regulations. At this point in time, it is not proposed to pursue the question of signing and ratifying this Convention.</entry>

    <P>With regard to the convention on insider trading, it should be noted that in July 1989 a protocol to the Council of Europe Convention was adopted which provides that, in their mutual relations, members of the EU shall apply Community rules except in so far as there are no Community rules governing the particular subject concerned.  There are no outstanding international multilateral agreements which have been signed but are awaiting ratification in the area which comes under the remit of this Department, the European Social Charter.  Ireland signed the European Social Charter which was opened for signature on 18 October 1961 at Turin.  On 14 May last, Ireland signed, without reservation as to ratification, the protocol amending the European Social Charter, which was opened for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe signatories to the charter, in Turin on 21 October 1991. <Col N="175" /> Ireland has not signed or ratified the 1988 Additional Protocol, the 1995 Additional Protocol to the charter providing for a system of collective complaints or the revised European Social Charter (1996), because we adhere strictly to the principle that we should only sign and ratify those instruments which are completely in accordance with our existing legislation.  This has led us to adopt a very cautious approach to the question of signing the above protocols and revised charter. This matter is undergoing detailed examination at present.</P>
    <P>Of the 181 conventions of the International Labour Organisation, ILO, dating from 1919, 50 have been ratified by Ireland and are currently in force.  It is unlikely that the majority of the remainder will be ratified by us because they are outdated or have been superseded by more modern conventions.  We are actively considering the ratification of a number of recent ILO conventions. <Col N="176" /> It should be noted that signatures, as such, does not arise in the case of ILO conventions.  It is the policy to ratify only those conventions which are completely in accordance with our existing legislation.</P>

            <entry>The directive is completely optional. Implementation was examined in 1996. At the time it was decided not to implement the directive due to the preparation of a Draft Financial Reporting Standard for smaller entities, FRSSE, by the consultative committee of accounting bodies, which was designed to relieve small companies of some of the burdens. This standard was adopted at the end of 1997. The EU is likely to review the threshold limits in advance of the introduction of the Euro and it can be further examined at that stage.</entry>

In so far as UCITs is concerned, work is advanced on amending the UCITS Regulations, SI No. 78 of 1989, which implemented Directive 85/611/EEC. This amendment will cover the relevant provisions of Directive 95/26/EC. It is hoped that the work will be completed by summer 1998.</entry>

            <entry>Lack of adequate transparency in the selling of life assurance products has created problems for policyholders. Purchasers of life assurance policies are entitled to an adequate awareness of their long-term nature and the consequences of early encashment with low or even negative value of the surrendered policies relative to the cumulative amount of premiums paid. Draft regulations seek to consolidate and supplement existing EU disclosure requirements and to otherwise ensure, as far as possible, that policyholders are in possession of sufficient relevant information in a comprehensible form, in order to be able to make an informed decision about the purchase of a life assurance- investment policy. The crucial aspect of the regime envisaged by the draft regulations is the requirement on suppliers of life assurance to disclose periodically to the policyholder the net benefits-early encashment value of the policy.</entry>

      <P>The aim of the industrial development agencies is to attract and support projects with sufficient value added to avoid vulnerability to low wage competition.  Competition from low wage economies is an ongoing factor affecting labour intensive industries here. Accordingly, policy in this area is directed at encouraging such industries to reposition themselves in higher value added areas and to adopt product development and other measures to improve their competitiveness.  As I have previously indicated in relation to the impending closure of Seagate's Clonmel plant, the main reasons advanced for closure by the parent company were major worldwide over-capacity and market stagnation as well as substantially lower production costs in the Far East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Labour Organisation, ILO, seeks to improve working conditions throughout the world by adopting and promulgating conventions, which set down minimum labour standards. The ILO is a tripartite body which is representative <Col N="187" /> of workers and employers as well as Government. As a member of the ILO, Ireland participates in the process of negotiating and adopting new standards and overseeing compliance with the existing body of international labour standards. It is a requirement of membership that the Government consult with the representative organisations of workers and employers on all matters pertaining to the ILO.</P>
    <P>The issue of linking core labour standards with membership of the World Trade Organisation, WTO, was considered at the first ministerial meeting of the WTO in December, 1996. In the declaration issued at that meeting the WTO renewed its commitment to the observance of internationally recognised core labour standards.  The declaration went on to say that the ILO was the competent body to set and deal with these standards and the WTO affirmed support for the work of the ILO in promoting such standards.</P>
    <P>It is through Ireland's participation in organisations such as the ILO and the WTO that we would seek to bring about improvements in working conditions in countries where such conditions were considered inadequate, having regard to their stage of development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 171 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> I have no plans to introduce legislation along the lines of the Mechanics' Lien Law which operates in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The question of speeding up payment to small business was considered by the Task Force on Small Business which reported in 1994.  The task force recommended that legislation should be introduced to require public sector bodies to settle their accounts promptly and that the position should be reviewed three years after the introduction of legislation in the public sector to ascertain the merits of the case for the application of similar legislation to the private sector.</P>
    <P>In line with the task force's recommendation, the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, was enacted last year and came into force on 2 January last.  The Act aims to ensure that all public bodies, and contractors on public sector contracts, pay amounts due to their suppliers promptly.  An automatic entitlement to interest is provided for in respect of amounts due but not paid on time under the terms of the Act.  I have, by order and following consultation with the Minister for Finance, set the rate of interest which is applicable in situations where payments are late under the terms of the Act.  The rate has been set at 0.0322 per cent per day, which is equivalent to 11.75 per cent per annum.  This will ensure that suppliers are compensated in the event of payments being late at a rate which is higher than the prevailing AA overdraft rates.</P>
    <P>The Act will benefit all business including, of course, small businesses who supply goods or services to the public sector.  Furthermore, private contractors on public sector contracts are obliged to comply with the payment provisions of the Act, so as to ensure that the benefits flowing to main contractors from being paid on time by public sector bodies will be passed on, in turn, to their suppliers.  This provision is of significant advantage to small business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the introduction of legislation governing payment practices in the private sector, as I have already indicated, the Task Force on Small Business recommended that the position should be reviewed three years after the introduction of such legislation in the public sector.  I intend to instigate such a review not later than two years after the Act has been in operation. That review will, <i>inter alia,</i> consider whether the voluntary codes established in the private sector have brought about improvements in payment practices in that sector.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the strategic review of the construction industry report contains recommendations aimed at assisting in the resolution of disputes involving non-payment for the supply of goods or services.  On 29 October last, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government established a forum for the construction industry to oversee the detailed implementation of the 90 or so recommendations contained in the report.  At its launch, he made it clear that the Government accepts the broad thrust of the report and that it will co-operate by <Col N="190" /> promoting any proposals for legislation deemed necessary by the forum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The two properties in Kilmallock and Newcastle West, which were owned by Neodata, have been put up for sale by a local auctioneer.  Agreement is currently being finalised with a purchaser for the Newcastle West facility.</P>
      <P>FÁS courses have been undertaken by some ex-Neodata employees, while others have found alternative employment in Limerick city.  Companies located there are continually seeking employees with the skills of the ex-Neodata workforce.  My announcement last week of a major investment by Dell in Limerick should very significantly enhance the employment prospects of those still seeking work.</P>
      <P>While interest in the Kilmallock plant has not to date led to a new industry locating there, IDA Ireland representatives have had a number of meetings with the local community during the course of 1997 and 1998.  I met the local Kilmallock community group in November 1997, together with IDA Ireland and SFADCo personnel. At this meeting it was agreed that an economic study group would be established to evaluate the economic strengths and weaknesses of the town, including a breakdown of skills availability. A meeting of this group is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, 4 February 1998.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland will continue to market west Limerick to potential overseas investors and is fully conscious of the importance of achieving a satisfactory outcome in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for ensuring quality control in industry rests with industry itself.  Industry generally is committed to improvement in this area.  This can be seen from the activities of IBEC which encourage the implementation of quality control.  One such example is the co-operation between IBEC and the CBI in Belfast in producing the all-Ireland register of companies with quality systems certified to the international ISO 9000 quality standard.  This register is continually growing and records those companies willing to submit their quality control activities to evaluation by an independent third party body to check compliance with the standard.</P>
      <P>I am committed to supporting all efforts made in both the public and private sectors to ensure the quality control is given a high priority by industry.  In addition, the agencies under the remit of my Department promote the improvement and development of quality control systems in industry.</P>
      <P>Forbairt, through its range of different programmes such as company development, national technology audit, world class manufacturing and its programmes in advanced technologies, PATS, assess the strengths and weaknesses of the quality control systems in place in Irish companies and provides aid, either financial or consultancy, to improve such systems.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland &mdash; NSAI &mdash; provides the national focus for quality control standards which are based solely on international concepts. Consequently, industry is encouraged to implement practices which are recognised within the European Union and worldwide by customers and contractors.  The NSAI seeks to link its work on quality standards to the needs of industry through both direct consultation and provisions of workshops and seminars for industry training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Accreditation Board &mdash; NAB &mdash; is the Irish national body, under the remit of Forfás, with responsibility for accreditation in accordance with the harmonised EN 45000 series of European standards and the relevant International Organisation for Standardisation, ISO, standards and guides.  Part of its activity deals with accrediting organisations involved in the certification <Col N="193" /> of quality systems in industry.  Such accreditation is the final step in ensuring that the level of quality being promoted by a particular body can be relied upon.  It also has responsibility for accreditation of testing and calibration laboratories. It promotes these activities to ensure that industry can achieve the highest international level of quality for products and services.</P>
    <P>In the private sector, I support the work done by Excellence Ireland, formerly the Irish Quality Association, which also seeks to encourage companies to improve their quality control.</P>

      <P>I do not have information available on the specific basis requested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of an EU survey, published in 1997 by the European Statistical Office entitled Continuing Vocational Training Survey in Enterprises: Results, the cost of training courses in enterprises in Ireland as a percentage of labour costs was 1.5 per cent of payroll.  In the case of small firms, most of which were likely to be <Col N="195" /> indigenous, the percentage fell to 1.2 per cent of payroll.</P>
    <P>In some sectors, the percentage was significantly less than in others.  For example, the figure was 1 per cent or less in the construction, retail and hotels-restaurants sectors, whereas the percentage was over 2 per cent in sectors such as engineering and banking.  The comparative position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EU countries is set out in the following table.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that this survey relied, in Ireland's case, on information which was obtained some time previously.  It should also be noted that no distinction was made between enterprises on the basis of their ownership, or between external and in-house training &mdash; the cost of the latter being extremely difficult to calculate.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Redundancy Payments Acts is to provide compensation to workers who have been made redundant.  It is not proposed to alter the terms to these Acts.</P>
      <P>However, under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 the employer is obliged to consult with workers when he is contemplating collective redundancies.  These consultations include such matters as &ldquo;the possibility of avoiding the proposed redundancies, reducing the number of employees affected by them or mitigating their circumstances by recourse to accompanying social measures aimed, <i>inter alia,</i> at aid for redeploying or retraining employees made redundant&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe Social Charter which was adopted in 1961 was ratified by Ireland in 1964.  Ireland reports, on a biannual basis, on its compliance with the provisions of the charter which it has accepted.  This report is examined in the first instance by the committee of independent experts which examine it from a strictly legal point of view.  The conclusions of that committee are then forwarded to the governmental committee which, in turn, in submitting proposals to the Committee of Ministers for a recommendation or any other action, take into account social, economic and other policy considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some provisions in our legislation which are outdated and not in use but are still on the Statute Book, for example, certain provisions of the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act, have been the subject of recommendations by the Committee of Ministers.  Repeal or amendment of these provisions is proposed by my colleague, Deputy Woods, Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, as part of the Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1997, which has been circulated.  The Committee of Ministers has also indicated difficulties in our compliance with certain other provisions of the charter such as Article 4, the right to fair remuneration, and Articles 5 and 6, the right to organise and the right to bargain collectively.  Ireland maintains that our laws in these areas are justified and, in strict terms, are not in contravention of the charter. The concerns of the Committee of Ministers <Col N="197" /> on these and all other provisions have been replied to in Ireland's latest report on the implementation of the charter.</P>
    <P>Following a decision taken by a Ministerial Conference held in Turin in October, 1991, to update and adapt the charter in order to take account of the social changes which occurred since the text was adopted in 1961, a Revised Social Charter was drawn up and opened for signature in May 1996.  Ireland is currently examining the text of the revised charter with a view to its acceptance.</P>

      <P>On 5 January 1998, I received a notification under the Mergers and Take-overs (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996 of a proposal whereby Coillte Teoranta intend to acquire a majority of the issued share capital of Balcas Limited, a sawmilling company incorporated in Northern Ireland.  Under the Mergers Acts I can refer any merger proposal notified to me to the Competition Authority for investigation and report.  I have decided to exercise this option in the present case.</P>
      <P>The purpose of referring the proposal to the Authority is to establish whether, in its opinion, the proposed merger would be likely to prevent or restrict competition, or restrain trade in any goods or services, and would be likely to operate against the common good.  In assessing the likely effect of the proposal on the common good the authority can have regard to such issues as continuity of supplies and services, level of employment, access to markets, employees, consumers and so forth.</P>
      <P>It is not appropriate for me to comment while a proposal is under investigation by the Competition Authority.  I will make my decision in the matter when I have received the authority's report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has been actively encouraging the establishment of call centres in Ireland since 1992. There are approximately 50 centres established employing approximately 4,500 people at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two years a number of companies commenced recruitment at the same time.  This resulted in skill shortages for some of these companies. This was identified at the time and the Government has since responded to these shortages with the announcement in mid-1997 of extra places in the educational system for language training.  Approximately 500 students commenced a two year course &mdash; Certificate in International <Col N="201" /> Teleservice &mdash; in 20 vocational education committees in September 1997.  The intention is that this number will increase to 1,000 students in September 1998 and in future years.</P>
    <P>An increased number of call centres are locating in regional locations where there is an availability of people with language fluency.  IDA Ireland has a close working relationship with its existing clients and most companies have projections over a five year period.  This allows IDA Ireland to work with its clients and the Government to help manage the requirements of these companies in the future, to ensure an adequate supply of people with the relevant skills.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of IDA Ireland to attract overseas investment to the north-west/Donegal region, the results are disappointing. In 1996, 297 jobs were created by IDA Ireland assisted companies in the north-west region with the number for 1997 in the region being 279 jobs.  However, after job losses of 290 in 1997, net employment in the region fell by 11 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the need for a better balance in the regional distribution of inward investment projects. IDA Ireland also recognises this and has put in place a number of measures to achieve a better regional spread.  These include financial incentives which are biased in favour of locations such as the north-west region, including Donegal, and working in partnership with the local authorities in the region to provide high quality sites. An example of this is the Letterkenny Business Park where IDA Ireland is developing a 27 acre business park in conjunction with Donegal County Council.  Serviced sites are also available in Donegal, Ballyshannon and Buncrana.  The measures also include the building of a new 20,000 sq.  ft.  advance factory building to be constructed in Letterkenny, as soon as planning permission has been received.  Letterkenny is being promoted for international service projects thanks to the availability of graduates with appropriate <Col N="202" /> skills from Letterkenny RTC and two senior managers have been allocated to work with the north-west/Donegal regional office in attracting small German companies.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is committed to securing new projects for the north-west region, particularly County Donegal, and every effort is being made to ensure that this result is achieved in the near future.</P>

Following the closure, Forbairt, in co-operation with the other development agencies, has been actively working to find a replacement for the Gaeltex operation and to create new employment opportunities for the workers who have lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>Already a former director of Gaeltex, with the support of Forbairt, is in the process of establishing a new clothing operation in Letterkenny. It is expected that a number of the former workers at Gaeltex will be employed in the new company.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Employment Act, 1977, as amended by the Protection of Employment Order, 1996, imposes certain obligations on employers who are planning collective redundancies.  They are:</P>
      <P>(1) At the earliest opportunity and, in any event, at least thirty days before the first dismissal takes effect, employers must initiate consultations with employees' representatives with a view to reaching an agreement.  Such consultations must include such matters as the possibility of avoiding the proposed redundancies, reducing the number of employees affected by them or mitigating their consequences by recourse to accompanying social measures aimed, <i>inter alia,</i> at aid for redeploying or retraining employees made redundant.</P>
      <P>(2) For the purpose of such consultations, the employers concerned must supply the employees' representatives &ldquo;with all the relevant information relating to the proposed redundancies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(3) Employers must notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in writing of their proposals &ldquo;at the earliest opportunity and in any event at least thirty days before the first dismissal takes effect&rdquo;.  A copy of this notification must also be supplied as soon as possible by the employer to the employees' representatives who may forward to the Minister in writing any observations they have relating to the notification.</P>
      <P>(4) Employers may not effect collective redundancies before the expiry of the period of thirty days beginning on the date of the relevant notification to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The 1996 order amended the 1977 Act to clarify that in a business where no trade union or staff association exists to represent the workers, an employer proposing to effect collective redundancies is obliged to consult with/inform &ldquo;a person or persons chosen by the employees likely to be affected by the proposed redundancies, to represent them&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are penalties prescribed for failure to comply with the above provisions.  The prosecution of offences is considered where breaches of the Act come to attention.  On conviction by the courts, the maximum fine for an offence at (4) above is £3,000 and for each of the other offences, the maximum fine is £500.  The updating of these fines is at present under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the above, other measures are taken by my Department to ensure that employers and employees are aware of their obligations and rights under labour legislation.  For example, the latest edition of the &ldquo;Guide to Labour <Col N="204" /> Law&rdquo; provides a summary of the various Acts which is presented in simple terms for both employers and employees.  More detailed explanatory leaflets on individual labour laws &mdash; including the Protection of Employment Act &mdash; are available from my Department's information unit.  In addition, staff of the unit are available to provide information on the legislation and to answer inquiries from the public.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 200 together. I refer the Deputy to my answer to a similar question to the House on 10 December 1997 and wish to advise on the updated position.  The Marine Institute's fisheries research centre is already engaged in a study of the zebra mussel.  Research work is also in progress in University College Galway. The Marine Institute has, at my direction, carried out extensive surveys of the distribution of the species and will continue these studies in 1998.  The zebra mussel steering group established by the Marine Institute, to which I referred in my reply on 10 December 1997, has met on a number of occasions and is at present examining the reports on the spread and impact of the species. A precautionary approach is being adopted and every effort is being made to supply all parties involved with relevant information.  Two information leaflets, with my endorsement, have been revised and reprinted and widely circulated to a targeted readership, including boat owners and fishermen in particular.  Furthermore, an international conference of experts will take place in Galway next month organised by University College Galway with support from the Marine Institute.  Following this conference the Marine Institute will compile and publish a further leaflet giving the most up-to-date information on the impact of the species and any appropriate remedial measures.  Another international meeting on the subject will take place in Dublin at the Congress of the International Limnological Association in August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> The zebra mussel has been present in the UK and Europe for about 170 years, and I am advised that there are no records of damage in the UK or continental Europe caused by this species.  No serious economic damage caused by the zebra mussel has been reported in this country, nor has any ecological damage become apparent to date.</P>

    <P>Within the sea fisheries sector, certain individual fisheries are regulated by statutory instruments under the Fisheries Acts, 1959-94.  These statutory instruments are routinely made on a monthly or bi-monthly basis to take account of fishing patterns and available quotas.  Such instruments will continue to be made in this context.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that a Fisheries (Common Fisheries Policy) (Control) Order will be made fairly shortly.  The order will, <i>inter alia,</i> consolidate all secondary legislation relating to the provisions of the EU Control Regulation (Reg 2847/93 and amendments) and the provisions of the Logbook Regulation (Reg 2807/83 and amendments).</P>
    <P>In relation to aquaculture, statutory instruments are being prepared to give effect to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997.  Three commencement orders in respect of application, fees and appeal regulations are proposed in addition to the aquaculture regulations, relating to the management and operation of aquaculture.</P>
    <P>With regard to fishing vessel safety, it is proposed to introduce comprehensive safety regulations for fishing vessels on foot of recommendations of the fishing vessel safety review group. The proposed statutory instruments will cover fishing vessels, radiocommunications equipment, safety training and manning.  The proposed effect of these regulations is to: set down specific requirements for fishing vessels in relation to, <Col N="213" /><i>inter alia,</i> construction and stability, machinery, electrical equipment, fire protection, fire fighting appliances and life saving appliances, and to introduce a strict enforcement regime through regular structural surveys and equipment inspections; set down the marine radiocommunications and ancillary equipment required to be carried on board fishing vessels and to provide for regular surveys of same, in order to improve the safety of vessels and their crews by ensuring a rapid search and rescue response to vessels in distress; provide for mandatory basic safety training for fishing vessel crews with a view to protecting fishermen's lives in the event of an accident at sea; and introduce new manning requirements to raise skill levels on fishing vessels.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 was enacted on 14 May 1997.  The principal order giving effect to the Act, with the exception of two sections, will be made on 1 April 1998. The operative dates of the commencement orders relating to the remaining two sections will be decided later.  The sections in question cover the prohibition on licence applicants engaging in aquaculture in anticipation of licence, together with the time limit for licence decisions.  The reason for this is the need to give priority attention to applications already in hand.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992 has not been commenced due to certain legal difficulties which have now been resolved by the enactment of the Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Act, 1996.  It is anticipated that the commencement order for Part II of the 1992 Act will be made later this year.  Part II of the Act relates to the certification of passenger ships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 226 and 227 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the corporisation of eight commercial harbours, a list of which follows, on 3 March 1997 the former trustees of the harbours in question had the sole authority to determine pay and employment conditions for their harbour employees.  My Department had no function or authority under the governing statute, the Har- bours Act, 1946, in the matter of pay and employ- ment conditions.  In addition, the Harbours Act, 1996 protected the position of former staff by providing that those transferring to a port com- pany from a harbour authority would not be sub- ject to less beneficial conditions of service or <Col N="219" /> remuneration than those which applied prior to transfer.</P>
    <P>My Department recently sought details of the remuneration levels and expenses paid to management and executive staff in each of the eight port companies and also in the other operational commercial harbours operating under the Harbours Act, 1946, a list of which follows.</P>
    <P>The results of the inquiries indicated that the actual remuneration of chief executives, for which guidelines are set down in report No. 35 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector &mdash; i.e. Cork, Dublin, Shannon and Waterford &mdash; ranges from almost 30 per cent to 90 per cent higher than those contained in the guidelines.  Salaries and allowances at other port companies and harbour authorities, with the exception of those paid at the Foynes Port Com- pany which was the subject of a separate report commissioned by my Department, are not gener- ally out of line with the pay and conditions which apply in similar sized organisations in the wider public sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to management/executive salaries in port companies or harbour authorities it would be inappropriate to disclose details of individual employees remuneration.  Disclosure of con- ditions of service and remuneration contracted between individual harbour employees and their statutorily independent employers is a matter for such port companies, harbour authorities and their employees.</P>
    <P>As regards Foynes Port Company the Deputy may wish to note that I arranged for copies of a summary of the consultant's report on pay levels and structures in the company to be deposited in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>On foot of the investigations, I have directed that each port company, in determining both the remuneration and allowances for expenses to be paid to all staff members and their terms and conditions of employment, must have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines.  I have also directed that a review be initiated of the 1946 harbours legislation which is still applicable to non-corporatised ports.  I will, on foot of this review, move quickly to update the legislation, as necessary, to strengthen controls.</P>
    <P>My Department will rigorously assess, on an on-going basis, the performance of all of the port companies and harbour authorities in the dis- charge of their corporate governance responsi- bilities.  My priority is to ensure that the essential commercial mandate, to provide efficient and cost effective management of the State's port assets and infrastructure, is discharged fully.</P>

This consultative process will allow all concerned to make their views known on the specific issues, programmes and timetables for action inherent in progressing these proposals.  In the meantime my decision to review the salmon conservation measures for 1998 confirms the ongoing commitment to reducing fishing effort and complements current work on this next phase of salmon management strategies.</P>

      <P>Ireland won vitally important increases over EU Commission proposals for fishery quotas for 1998 at the recent EU Council of Fisheries Ministers on 18 and 19 December last.  These included a 45,000 tonnes quota for valuable white fish species, a 19,180 tonnes quota for herring in the Celtic Sea, an increase of 12,600 tonnes over 1997 in the mackerel quota.  In the case of horse mackerel, I secured a quota of 73,900 tonnes, i.e., some 26 per cent of the total available EU quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of my considerable dissatisfaction in the matter of the setting of quotas for the horse mackerel fishery by the Fisheries Council in December.  The scope and appropriateness of follow up action has been under review in my Department since the start of the year.  In that context the Attorney General has recently been requested to advise whether the Council decision on this matter was appropriately <Col N="221" /> adopted and is legally valid.  I will be considering, on receipt, the Attorney General's advice in the context of deciding on any appropriate next steps.</P>

      <P>The objective of the Fisheries Operational Programme, 1994-99, is to support targeted investment in order to maintain and enhance the fishing industry's contribution to the national economy and in particular its contribution to growth and employment in coastal communities. The impact of the fisheries measures will include increases in direct employment in aquaculture and fish processing together with indirect job gains in related services.  The bulk of the jobs are expected to be created at the end of the programme as projects come fully on stream. A target of 2,000 additional jobs &mdash; full-time and part-time &mdash; was set for the programme.  The external evaluator for the fisheries operational programme is currently developing systems for the generation of comprehensive and robust employment data on the sector.</P>
      <P>Currently available data indicate that employment has increased in both the aquaculture and fish processing sector.  In the aquaculture sector, there has been an increase of 188 in net jobs since 1992 despite difficult market conditions in the early years of the programme.  In the processing sector investment in the early part of the programme was concentrated on upgrading facilities to meet mandatory standards set in EU Health and Hygiene Directives.  This investment has, critically, maintained jobs and enhanced competitiveness to date in the sector.  Further planned investment in processing development capacity expansion has the potential to create significant employment and growth and in this regard the sourcing of additional funding to support such projects is being pursued.</P>

      <P>The objective set for the adjustment of fishing effort measure of the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-99 is to remove some 4,000 gross registered tonnage from the Irish fleet over the period 1994-96.  The total capacity removed from the Irish fleet, under the decommissioning scheme introduced in 1995, was 1,451 gross registered tonnes.  This involved three vessels under 20 years, five vessels between 21 and 30 years, three vessels between 31 and 35 years and eight vessels over 35 years.</P>
      <P>The level of tonnage removed from the Irish fleet under the decommissioning scheme assisted Ireland in meeting its fleet targets at the end of 1996 under the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme III &mdash; MGP III.  The fleet targets for the period 1997 to 2001 under MGP IV were approved by the EU Commission for the Irish fleet on 16 December 1997.  I am satisfied with the outcome for Ireland and I do not envisage that a further decommissioning scheme will be needed to meet the targets.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 to 237, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>EU and Exchequer funding totalling £12.26 million is being provided to support an estimated total investment of £30 million in aquaculture under the Operational Programme for Fisheries, 1994-99.  The total investment approved in five tranches to the end of 1997 under the aquaculture measure amounts to some £18.66 million.  Certified expenditure to the end of 1997 is £8.34 million. The balance of £10.32 million is being certified systematically as the required invoices and documentation is submitted by beneficiaries to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The remaining planned investment of some £7.21 million will be considered for approval in further tranches to be announced during 1998 and 1999.</P>
      <P>The amount of EU funds approved for aquaculture projects up to the end of 1997 was IR£6.6 million involving 73 projects, 63 companies.  In addition BIM, in the period January 1994 to December 1997, has approved grant aid totalling £1,062,000 to 126 companies in respect of 161 projects, under its aquaculture pilot projects scheme.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture measure of the Operational Programme for Fisheries makes provision for the creation of 1,310 jobs and the maintenance of existing jobs in the industry.  These jobs, located for the most part in coastal rural communities with few alternative employment prospects, make a worthwhile contribution to the economic and social wellbeing of those communities.  The number of jobs to be created in projects already approved for EU grant assistance is 234 full-time and 204 part-time at an EU grant cost per full-time equivalent job of £19,780.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> In assessing grant aid particular weighting for job creation is specified in the procedures manual governing the EU grant scheme for aquaculture. Following the mid-term evaluation of the Operational Programme for Fisheries, the weighting in favour of job creation has been increased.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged the external evaluator of the Operational Programme for Fisheries to develop systems for comprehensive and relevant employment data on the fisheries industry, including the aquaculture sector.</P>
    <P>Existing estimates of employment in the aquaculture industry for the years 1994 to 1996 are set out in the following table.  Figures for 1997 are not yet available to my Department.</P>

    <P>The slippage in total numbers actually employed in the industry between 1994 and 1996 was due in the main to temporary difficulties which have been, and continue to be, tackled.  In particular, dumping of Norwegian farmed salmon on the EU market, with consequent depressed prices for Irish farmed salmon, has been addressed by the EU Commission.  New testing arrangements to guarantee the quality of Irish shellfish have also been put in place which has been instrumental in underpinning the development of the rope mussel culture industry.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, provides a new statutory framework for the licensing and regulation of the aquaculture industry which will provide a solid statutory underpinning of existing and proposed aquaculture projects which will directly facilitate job creation over the remainder of the programme.</P>

      <P>To date a total investment of £18.7 million, involving the maintenance of 2,250 jobs and the creation of 130 new jobs, has been approved under the processing measure of the operational programme.  Investment in the early part of the programme was concentrated on upgrading facilities to meet mandatory standards set in EU Health and Hygiene Directives.  This <Col N="227" /> investment has, critically, maintained jobs and enhanced competitiveness to date.</P>
      <P>The average cost of the new jobs created to date in processing development is estimated at £14,000.  Further planned investment in processing development capacity expansion has the potential to create significant employment and growth and in this regard the sourcing of additional funding to support such projects is being pursued.</P>

      <P>Some £9.3 million has been allocated under the Operational Programme for Fisheries, 1994-99, for the development of port infrastructure and facilities.  Up to the end of 1997, approximately £7.3 million has been invested in development works at some 28 harbours.  While significant progress has been made in improving port facilities and infrastructure, a considerable work programme is still required.

The delay in implementing the directive arose due to a combination of factors, mainly the need to put in place the necessary administrative arrangements to facilitate the introduction <Col N="228" /> of the regulations.  The case brought against Ireland by the EU Commission in respect of Council Directive 92/29 is currently before the Court of Justice of the European Union.

      <P>The Operational Programme for Fisheries, 1994-99, provides funding for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet, with some £11 million of EU and Exchequer aid available to support total investment of some £30 million in the fleet.  To date funding has been concentrated on the modernisation of vessels and has not been allocated towards the purchase of vessels. A total of 243 modernisation projects have been approved since the beginning of the programme involving over £7 million in grant aid. The investment in modernisation of the fishing fleet is contributing to the objectives of improving the quality, efficiency and safety of the fleet.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, which commits to modernising the fishing fleet, I have been working to deliver on that commitment as quickly as possible.  In addition to my plans for a capital grant aid scheme for a number of new whitefish boats which are currently being finalised, I am pursuing other options to facilitate and attract investment in the fleet, in line with the An Action Programme for the Millennium which gives a specific commitment to making the industry attractive to providers of capital by examining the provisions of fiscal incentives.  My aim in progressing the various initiatives which I have outlined is to achieve a significant turnaround of the whitefish fleet.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255, 257 and 258 together.</P>
      <P>Compatibility of forestry development with the environment is the essential element of the Government's afforestation programme, and indeed is a basic principle of grant aid.  Virtually all forest planting in Ireland is subject to grant aid and this mechanism ensures that environmental concerns are fully taken into account.  A variety of measures are taken by my Department in this context, including: prior consultation with relevant State agencies on listed environmentally sensitive areas; the publication of guidelines on forestry development and the landscape, fisheries and archaeology; minimum distances that forestry development must be kept back from occupied houses, roads, fisheries, etc. and grant incentives for diversity in planting, with a particualr emphasis on broadleaves.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the threshold at which planning permission and environmental impact assessment &mdash; EIA &mdash; are required for afforestation has been reduced, with effect from October 1996 from 200 hectares to 70 hectares.  In addition planning permission and EIA are also required for cumulative afforestation which results in a total area planted exceeding 70 hectares.</P>
      <P>Environmental controls are regularly reviewed as a matter of course and work is ongoing at present on the revision of the existing guidelines on forestry development and the landscape, fisheries and archaeology and the introduction of additional guidelines on bio-diversity, harvesting and the use of herbicides.  All these controls ensure that afforestation does not happen in an unplanned, environmentally destructive manner.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Central Fisheries Board that the board has not carried out any scientific investigation with regard to large scale forestry plantations in County Leitrim.</P>

The relevant regulations on the authorisation of the use of fishing weirs and other fishing engines for the purpose of capturing eels are set out in section 100 of the Act.  A copy of the relevant legislation is being forwarded to the Deputy.  The legislation governing the issue of eel fishing authorisations and licences generally is currently being reviewed in consultation with the central and regional fisheries boards and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulatory requirements in question is a matter for the regional fisheries boards.  The boards have been requested to provide details of inspections and the results of inspections into the operation of fishing weirs and these will be forwarded to the Deputy on receipt.</P>

      <P>The Government agreed last month, subject to certain safeguards, to the purchase by Coillte Teoranta of the 80 per cent stake in the Balcas Group, the sawmilling company based in Enniskillen.  The safeguards are designed to meet concerns, particularly in relation to the independence of Coillte's log sales system, expressed by the Irish Timber Council.  I should add that the approval of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also required in relation to the proposal, in accordance with the requirements of the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, under which the competition aspect of the proposal will be considered.  I understand that she has sought the views of the Competition Authority on the proposed acquisition as provided for under that legislation.</P>

      <P>As regards the Shannon Estuary the Deputy will be aware that both Foynes Port Company and Shannon Estuary Port Company were established on 3 March 1997 under the provisions of the Harbours Act, 1996, with specific statutory functions and remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> I have no immediate plans to consolidate the existing harbour authorities in the Shannon Estuary. I have, however, asked the chairpersons of Shannon Estuary Port Company and Foynes Port Company to identify and act on ideas for co-operation. These include possible joint use/development of common facilities and future capital investment which could result in reduced costs.  I have asked both chairpersons to report within three months on these issues.</P>
    <P>It is my considered view that the potential for interaction between ports in the same catchment area such as the Shannon Estuary should be developed and fully exploited.  Co-operative arrangements would reduce costs and generate the potential for competitive initiatives of benefit to the economic hinterland and the ports themselves.</P>
    <P>As shareholder on behalf of the State, I would encourage and support such processes to help <Col N="236" /> ports, especially those with shared catchments, to use combined capacities and infrastructures, to meet rapidly changing market requirements.</P>

      <P>The Cowx report was commissioned by the Marine Institute as a technical exercise to review sea trout sampling programme methodologies and its own methodology was subject to independent evaluation at the University of Massachusetts.  As with all such reports, there will inevitably be differing perspectives on the findings and conclusions but this should not lead us down the unproductive road of questioning the bona fides of the report and its author.  These reports, together with further technical assessments by the Central Fisheries Board and others, are informing the current review of the strategic focus and direction of sea trout management, conservation and research programmes.  In that regard the chief executives of the Marine Institute, the Central Fisheries Board and the Salmon Research Agency are drawing up, at the Department's request, proposals to take forward the science, management and structures for dialogue in relation to the sea trout programmes.  My overriding policy objective is to put in place sea trout strategies for the future which are consistent with the overall approach set down by the Whitaker task force in 1994 while drawing on the collective experiences of the last number of years. The collective views of the agencies concerned on future directions will directly inform my thinking in this regard.</P>

I can report that there has been ongoing implementation of the review group's objectives in specific areas and developments have also taken place to facilitate the implementation of further recommendations of the group.</P>
      <P>Safety training, which is vital to protect the lives of fishermen in the event of an accident at sea, has continued to be provided in an accessible manner through BIM's two mobile training units in response to demand at various locations around the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> Having regard to onshore marine radio communications, the Department has initiated EU procurement procedures for VHF digital selective calling equipment which it is proposed to install at Irish Marine Emergency Service coast radio stations.  A notice of the Department's intention to purchase this equipment, which will significantly upgrade our radio communications network, has been sent to the EU Commission for publication in the Official Journal for the benefit of potential suppliers in other member states.</P>
    <P>The Department is continuing to put in place the necessary administrative and technical resources to facilitate the introduction of comprehensive safety regulations for fishing vessels and their crews, as recommended by the review group.  I am, in this regard, pleased to advise that two additional marine surveyors have been appointed so far this year, with a third to be appointed shortly, and the recruitment of an additional marine radio surveyor is also under way.  These surveyors will provide the vital technical input required in the drafting of the safety regulations and they will also be involved in their subsequent enforcement through the carrying out of regular inspections.</P>
    <P>There has also been further progress with regard to the Department's drive to highlight safety issues of particular relevance to fishermen. The safety awareness campaign has gained increased momentum through the publication this year of a booklet on man overboard procedures for fishing vessels, copies of which are currently being made available to the skippers of all fishing vessels on the register.  In addition, guidelines on emergency procedures for fishing vessels have recently been approved by the Department's marine safety working group and it is intended to shortly publish a booklet on this subject for distribution to the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Fisheries, 1994-99, funding has been provided for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet and some 243 modernisation projects have been approved since the beginning of the programme involving over £7 million in grant aid.  The investment in modernisation of the fishing fleet is contributing to the objectives of improving the quality, efficiency and safety of the fleet.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, I am working on new proposals to modernise the whitefish fleet. These proposals include a plan for a capital grant aid scheme for a number of new whitefish boats. I am also examining the scope for provision of fiscal incentives to facilitate and attract investment in the fleet.</P>

      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service was established as a division of my Department in May 1991 following the publication of the Doherty Review Group report on air/sea rescue services.  In 1992 a fully fitted out and equipped Marine Emergency Management Centre, including a marine radio communications centre, was established at Leeson Lane in Dublin.  The service is responsible for the operational control and co-ordination aspects of all types of marine emergency response, including search and rescue, sea and coastal pollution, shipwreck and casualty incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre which was relocated to Dublin from Shannon Airport in 1993, is incorporated in the IMES headquarters.  While the MRCC has overall executive responsibility for the Irish search and rescue region it is the intention to establish marine rescue sub-centres, for the co-ordination of marine emergency response within the relevant area of responsibility, at the existing manned coast radio stations at Malin Head and Valentia. The establishment of these new centres has been delayed pending the resolution of some industrial relations difficulties.  I am confident that these difficulties <Col N="241" /> will be sorted out as quickly as possible and the proposed centres will further improve the existing, first class, service provided to all seafarers by the Irish Marine Emergency Service.</P>

      <P>The following are the multilateral agreements in the negotiation or preparation of which the Department of Foreign Affairs is currently or will shortly be participating: Ireland is participating in negotiations among the states parties to the Convention on the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction &mdash; BTWC &mdash; to draft proposals to strengthen the convention.  It is expected that these negotiations will result in a verification protocol to the BTWC.  At the appropriate time, a decision will be taken by the Government on Ireland's accession to the protocol.</P>
      <P>On 15 May 1997, the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency &mdash; IAEA &mdash; adopted a draft model protocol aimed at strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system of the IAEA.</P>
      <P>On 1 December 1997, the EU Council approved negotiating directives which authorised the European Commission to negotiate, together with the 13 non-nuclear weapons states &mdash; NNWS &mdash; of the European Atomic Energy Community &mdash; EAEC &mdash; and the IAEA, with a view to the conclusion of a protocol additional to the existing 1997 Verification Agreement between the NNWS, the EAEC and the IAEA on the basis of the draft model protocol.  These negotiations will commence in Vienna in February 1998.  At the appropriate time, a decision will be taken by the Government on Ireland's accession to the protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 52nd (1997) UN General Assembly decided that a Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries, <Col N="242" /> open to all member states of the UN or members of specialised agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency, should be held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July 1998 with a view to finalising and adopting a convention on the establishment of an international criminal court.  Ireland, which is firmly committed to the establishment of an international criminal court, will be represented at the conference.

    <P>The Partnership and Co-operation Agreement establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their member states, of the one part, and the Republic of Turkmenistan, of the other part, was initialled at Ashkhabad, Turkmenistan on 24 May 1997.  It is expected that the Agreement will be brought forward for signature by member states in the course of the coming months.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, one of the primary responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs is the pursuance of Ireland's foreign policy objectives in the international arena.  In that context, a great number of international agreements covering a wide range of subjects fall under the auspices of the Department and it must consider on an ongoing basis the desirability of Ireland becoming party to those agreements to which it is not already party.  Given the range of international agreements involved, it would not be practicable to furnish the information sought by the Deputy in relation to every such agreement. However, I am anxious to facilitate the Deputy in as far as is practicable and I am, therefore, circulating in the Official Report an indicative <Col N="243" /> list of international agreements which Ireland has signed, but not ratified.  I would once again stress that, given the number of agreements coming under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs, this list should not be treated as complete.  If the Deputy has a particular interest in these or other international agreements, he might point these out to me and I will provide him with any information he requires in relation to those agreements.</P>
      <P>Council of Europe Conventions: European Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes, Strasbourg, 29 April 1957.  This convention was signed by Ireland in 1957 but never ratified. Ratification is not under active consideration as the convention is out-dated and does not appear to be applied; European Convention on the Abolition of Legalisation of Documents Executed by Diplomatic Agents or Consular Officals, London, 7 June 1968.  This convention was signed by Ireland in 1996 but never ratified. Ratification is under active consideration and it is hoped Ireland will be in a position to ratify the convention in the very near future; Protocol number 7 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Strasbourg, 22 November 1984.  This protocol was signed by Ireland in 1984 but never ratified.  Ratification is under active consideration and it is hoped Ireland will be in a position to ratify the protocol in the very near future.</P>
      <P>United Nations Conventions: The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by the resumed 50th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 10 September 1996.  This convention was negotiated within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament.  The treaty was opened for signature in New York on 24 September, 1996 and was signed, subject to ratification, by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs on that date.  A decision has not yet been taken on when Ireland will ratify this treaty.  The Department will consider, in consultation with other Departments, what steps, if any, are required to be taken before this treaty is ratified; Geneva protocols.  The two 1997 Geneva Protocols, supplemental to the four 1949 &ldquo;Red Cross&rdquo; Geneva Conventions, have yet to be ratified by Ireland. The legislation required to implement the terms of those protocols into domestic Irish law has been prepared and will be before the Oireachtas in due course to enable Ireland to become party of the conventions.</P>

    <P>EU Agreements: The Treaty of Amsterdam was negotiated by an inter governmental Conference of the member states of the European Union.  It was opened for signature at Amsterdam on 2 October 1997 and signed on behalf of the 15 EU Heads of State &mdash; in Ireland's case the Commission authorised by Article 14 of the Constitution of Ireland to exercise and perform the powers and functions of the President of Ireland &mdash; on that date.  Before the treaty can be ratified by Ireland an amendment of the Constitution and an amendment of the European <Col N="244" /> Communities Acts will be necessary.  The Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998 was published on 27 January and will be presented to Dáil Éireann very shortly.  Following passage of the Bill through Dáil and Seanad Éireann, the amendment will be put to the people for decision in a referendum.  Subject to approval of the amendment in the referendum, I shall introduce legislation in due course to amend the European Communities Acts as necessary prior to ratification; Interregional Framework Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its member states of the one part, and the Southern Common Market and its party states of the other part.

    <P>Framework Cooperation Agreement in preparation for the eventual establishment of a political and economic association between the European Community and its member states of the one part and the Republic of Chile of the other part, and the attached Joint Declaration of Political Dialogue.

Ireland hopes to be in a position to ratify the agreement in the near future; Framework Agreement for Trade and Cooperation between the European Community and its member states of the one part and the Republic of Korea of the other part.  This agreement with South Korea was signed on 28 October 1996.  Ireland hopes to be in a position to ratify the agreement in the near future; Global Agreement on Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation between the European Community and its member states of the one part and the United States of Mexico of the other part, and the attached Final Act.  This agreement with Mexico was signed on 8 December 1997. Ireland hopes to be in a position to ratify the agreement in the near future; Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its member states of the one part and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan of the other part.

      <P>The Law Reform Commission has published papers on a number of international conventions and recommended that each of these conventions should be ratified by Ireland.  The up-to-date position as regards Ireland's ratification of the conventions is as follows: The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.  In accordance with the Law Reform <Col N="248" /> Commission's recommendation, the convention has been ratified by Ireland; the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commerical Matters.  This convention has not been ratified by Ireland; the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, 1965.  In accordance with the Law Reform Commission's recommendation, Ireland has ratified the convention; the Hague Convention on Succession to the Estates of Deceased Persons. Ireland has not ratified this convention; UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  Ireland has not ratified this convention; Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents. Statutory instruments implementing the terms of the convention into domestic Irish law are currently being prepared and Ireland should be in a position to ratify the convention shortly; the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. Ireland has not ratified this convention; the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects.  Ireland has not ratified this convention.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for implementing the terms of the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents into domestic Irish law.  The substantive issues dealt with by the other conventions, in respect of which the Law Reform Commission may have made recommendations, are not issues that come under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The Government is concerned at the purchase and intended installation of S-300 missiles by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.  This decision represents an unnecessary escalation of the level of armaments on the island.  It will undoubtedly increase tensions, and the risk of conflict, in an already volatile situation.  We are equally disturbed by the high level of military build-up of Turkish and Turkish Cypriot forces in northern Cyprus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During a bilateral meeting between the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Minister of Cyprus, Mr. Cassoulides, at the United Nations ministerial week in September 1997 Ireland expressed its serious concerns, shared by other members of the international community, at the decision of the Cypriot Government to purchase and deploy these missiles.  We strongly urged the Foreign Minister to reconsider this decision in the interests of contributing to a reduction in tensions on the island. This could only be helpful in producing a better <Col N="249" /> atmosphere for the ongoing UN-sponsored direct negotiations between the leadership of both communities on the island.  The issue has been raised subsequently in diplomatic contacts.</P>
    <P>In his report of 8 December 1997 on the United Nations Operation in Cyprus (UNFICYP), the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, drew attention to the high level of militarisation in both the northern and southern parts of the island.  It was also noted that the repeated appeals of the UN Security Council for a reduction in defence spending and in the number of foreign military troops on the island have not been heeded by either side.  Military forces and armaments in Cyprus have continued to be expanded, upgraded and modernised at an increasing rate.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to urge that both communities engage in serious efforts to agree confidence-building measures and a genuine reduction in the level of militarisation on the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 12 convicted republican prisoners and two remand prisoners currently detained in British prisons.  A further two individuals are currently on bail.</P>
      <P>I attach great importance to confidence-building measures as an essential element in the promotion of trust and the underpinning of peace in Northern Ireland.  In this context, the Government believes that it is essential to continue to focus in an imaginative and progressive way on all the questions relating to those who have been imprisoned in the context of the conflict, both republican and loyalist, while also giving full attention to the concerns of victims of violence.  As set out in the Propositions on Heads of Agreement tabled by both Governments on 12 January, the multi-party talks will consider prisoners' issues in the context of effective and practical measures to establish and consolidate an acceptable peaceful society in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>New regulations governing the transfer of prisoners from Britain to Northern Ireland were introduced with effect from 1 October. The effect of these is that persons tranferred to Northern Ireland are placed on the same footing as those convicted in Northern Ireland except for final release, which will continue to be a matter for the British Home Secretary. They are therefore able to benefit from the classification and temporary release procedures in force in Northern Ireland.  A number of prisoners transferred from Britain to Northern Ireland have benefited from these new arrangements with the granting of periods of compassionate and Christmas leave.  A further prisoner was transferred from prison in Britain to Northern Ireland during December 1997.</P>
      <P>Eleven republican prisoners have been transferred from Britain to Portlaoise prison since 3 December 1997 under the provisions of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  These transfers represent significant progress on this important humanitarian issue and bring the total of republican prisoners transferred from Britain to this jurisdiction under the terms of the convention to 17.</P>
      <P>Of the 12 convicted prisoners currently in Britain, ten have requested transfer to this jurisdiction, one has requested a transfer to Northern Ireland and another has not yet made a transfer application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the ten applications relating to this jurisdiction, one is on hold pending the applicant's <Col N="253" /> appeal of his conviction.  Three applications are currently under examination by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Two applications have only recently been received by the British Home Office.  The remaining four applicants are awaiting determination of their tariffs by the British Home Secretary.  It is the practice of the Home Office not to transmit applications to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from a person serving a life sentence until their tariff has been set.  The Government would hope that this decision can be taken as soon as possible so as to give the prisoners concerned some sense of certainty and to enable their transfer applications to be processed.  Both the Taoiseach and I have raised this matter with the British Government.</P>
    <P>The Government will be seeking to complete the transfer of all republican prisoners who have applied for transfer under the convention as soon as possible in line with its humanitarian provisions.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to monitor closely the conditions under which republican prisoners in Britain are held.  Regular consular visits are made by the embassy in London to these prisoners. Issues of concern which are raised by prisoners and their families form the basis of representations made on an ongoing basis to the British authorities.</P>
    <P>I will continue to pursue these and other issues relating to prisoners both within the context of the multi-party talks and within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>Ireland lodged its instrument of ratification to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 8 December 1989, subject to seven reservations. The reservation entered to Article 6, paragraph 5 regarding the death penalty was subsequently withdrawn as the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, abolished the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six remaining reservations are as follows: article 10, paragraph 2, &ldquo;Ireland accepts the principles referred to in paragraph 2 of article 10 (concerning the right of accused persons, save in exceptional circumstances, to be segregated from convicted persons and to be subject to separate treatment appropriate to their status as unconvicted persons) and implements them as far as practically possible.  It reserves the right to regard full implementation of these principles as objectives <Col N="254" /> to be achieved progressively&rdquo;; article 14 &ldquo;Ireland reserves the right to have minor offences against military law dealt with summarily in accordance with current procedures which may not, in all respects, conform to the requirements of article 14 of the Covenant&rdquo;; article 14, paragraph 6 &ldquo;Ireland makes the reservation that the provision of compensation for the miscarriage of justice in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 6 of article 14 (concerning the right of a person who has been convicted due to a miscarriage of justice to be compensated according to law) may be by administrative procedures rather than pursuant to specific legal provisions&rdquo;; article 19, paragraph 2 &ldquo;Ireland reserves the right to confer a monopoly on, or require the licensing of, broadcasting enterprises&rdquo;; article 20, paragraph 1 &ldquo;Ireland accepts the principle in paragraph 1 of article 20 (that any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law) and implements it as far as it is practicable.  Having regard to the difficulties in formulating a specific offence capable of adjudication at national level in such a form as to reflect the general principles of law recognised by the community of nations as well as the right to freedom of expression, Ireland reserves the right to postpone consideration of the possibility of introducing some legislative addition to, or variation of, existing law until such time as it may consider that such is necessary for the attainment of the objective of paragraph 1 of article 20&rdquo;; article 23, paragraph 4 &ldquo;Ireland accepts the obligations of paragraph 4 of article 23 on the understanding that the provision does not imply any right to obtain a dissolution of marriage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet, at its meeting of 21 January 1998, approved the withdrawal of the reservations to article 14.6 and article 23.4 respectively.  The enactment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993, which made provision for payment of compensation for miscarriages of justice, and the divorce referendum and subsequent enactment of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, have rendered both reservations unnecessary.  My Department is currently taking steps formally to withdraw these reservations.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to withdraw any of the four remaining reservations.</P>

      <P>The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination will be ratified as soon as the domestic legislation which is required to give effect to the convention in Irish law has been adopted.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently working on the necessary draft legislation, namely, a revised Equal Status Bill which has already been tabled <Col N="255" /> in the Dáil and a revised Employment Equality Bill which is expected to be introduced later this year.  These two Bills will replace earlier legislation which was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  Once they have been passed into law, I will seek Dáil approval for ratification of the convention.</P>

      <P>Protocol number seven to the European Convention on Human Rights was opened for signature on 22 November 1984 and was signed by Ireland on that date.</P>
      <P>The rights elaborated by the protocol are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  My Department has an obligation to play a co-ordinating role.</P>
      <P>The provisions of protocol number seven touch upon a number of complex issues currently before the Government.  The question of ratification has received preliminary consideration by the Government Departments concerned but further detailed work and consultation is necessary to establish the legal, constitutional and possible legislative implications of such a step.  In particular, full account needs to be taken of the substantive legislative changes and other legal developments which have taken place in the relevant areas since our signature of the protocol in 1984.  Those complex issues involve matters relating to the expulsion of lawfully resident aliens and equality as between spouses following marital breakdown.</P>
      <P>Concerning the second part of the Deputy's question, a number of the rights elaborated by the protocol are also reflected in the United Nations Convenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Ireland is a party.  In particular, article one of the protocol &mdash; the right of a lawfully resident alien not to be expelled except in accordance with law &mdash; reflects the language contained in article 13 of the covenant.  Similarly, article four of the protocol &mdash; the right of a person not to be tried or punished a second time for an offence for which they have already been convicted or acquitted &mdash; and article five of the protocol &mdash; equality of rights as between spouses &mdash; correspond to articles 14 (7) and 23 (4) respectively of the covenant.</P>

The framework convention has been signed by 36 states of whom 15 have ratified the convention.  The convention will enter into force on 1 February 1998.</P>
      <P>The framework convention sets out a number of principles and objectives for the protection of national minorities in a wide range of areas including the legal, economic, social and cultural fields.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in common with the majority of signatory states, decided that it would be advisable to defer ratification until the outcome of negotiations for the establishment of a reporting mechanism under the convention.  These negotiations have now concluded and the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe at their last meeting in November 1997 adopted proposals for a reporting mechanism which will involve the creation of an expert-level advisory committee for the convention.</P>
      <P>Ratification is under active consideration and it is hoped Ireland will be in a position to ratify the framework convention in the very near future.</P>

Protocol No. 2 to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, signed 10 April 1996 and ratified 10 april 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in a written reply on 4 November 1997, the policy of the Irish Government in relation to East Timor is based on the EU Common Position on East Timor adopted by the Council of Ministers on 25 June 1996.  In accordance with the Common Position, Ireland actively supports international efforts to promote respect for human rights, and to bring about a just and peaceful solution to the East Timor question which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland welcomed the appointment by the United Nations Secretary-General last year of Mr. Jamsheed Marker as his Special Envoy on East Timor, and is ready to support any appropriate <Col N="260" /> initiative taken by the Secretary-General on East Timor.  We have actively supported the idea of establishing a branch of the UN Human Rights Committee in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. However, the agreement of the Indonesian Government for the establishment of such an office has not been forthcoming.  It is clear that the Indonesian Government is also opposed to the establishment of a UN office in East Timor itself.</P>
    <P>I had an extended and very useful exchange of views on East Timor and Indonesia with the Portuguese Foreign Minister Mr. Gama during my official visit to Lisbon on 15 January.  I expressed the Government's continuing deep concern at the situation there and our readiness to help in any way possible, including in relation to the Intra-Timorese dialogue.  We expected that there would be a further resolution on East Timor at the UN Commission on Human Rights meeting in Geneva next March, and I indicated that, subject to its content, Ireland would expect to be able to support such a resolution.</P>

      <P>I fully understand the concern and frustration of local residents in Muff, County Donegal that the section of Canning's Lane, off Coney Road, which lies in Northern Ireland, has not yet been fully opened.</P>
      <P>The Government has made on-going representations on this matter within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, particularly with regard to the intention of the British authorities following the rescinding of the closure order in 1994.  As the Deputy is aware, a difference of opinion between Derry City Council and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment regarding their respective responsibilities in this matter has also arisen.</P>
      <P>At my request, further inquiries were recently made with the British authorities.  Further to these inquiries, the British authorities have responded that it has now been agreed that if there is sufficient public will to do so, Derry City Council should re-establish the public right of way; thereafter the crossing would be brought up to a sufficient standard to be adopted by the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remain concerned that a dispute regarding competencies continues to stand in the way of the full and permanent re-opening of this road.

      <P>A commencement order has not been made in respect of Part III of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, to give effect to four 1975 Protocols to the Warsaw Convention. All four protocols have been ratified by Ireland. The Warsaw Convention established minimum levels of liability for, <i>inter alia,</i> the carriage of passengers and cargo; and the four Protocols updated the compensation limits of the Warsaw Convention.  However, the first two protocols only became part of international law in 1997. The question of making a commencement order to give effect to these two protocols is being examined in the light of recent developments under EU legislation dealing with issues similar to those covered by the Warsaw Convention.</P>

      <P>The main thrust of the agreement reached at EU Council of Ministers level relating to a directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas is to introduce competition into the natural gas industry in the form of third party access to gas networks in the European Union.  Consumers of large volumes of gas will have the choice of buying their gas supplies direct from gas undertakings as at present or of buying their gas from other suppliers and having the gas transmitted through the gas network for a fee.</P>
      <P>Provision for this form of competition has already been made in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995.  The necessary operating and pricing rules, which will be of a detailed and complex nature, are being developed.  The Act is broadly in line with the EU directive.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in the directive enabling member states to apply to the European Commission for temporary derogations to encourage investment in the development and extension of the gas network to areas in which no gas infrastructure has been established or has been established for less than ten years.  This provision is of relevance to areas, such as the midlands and west of Ireland, which have as yet no natural gas service.</P>

      <P>At the Internal Market Council on 27 November 1997 Commissioner Monti presented a proposal for a Council Regulation under Article 235 of the Treaty which would create a mechanism for the Commission to intervene with a member state in the event of serious obstruction to the free movement of goods in that member state. The Council has requested Coreper to examine the draft regulation.  Interdepartmental consultations have been initiated to assess the implications of the proposal.</P>
      <P>At the Transport Council on 11 December 1997 Commissioner Kinnock indicated that the establishment of international transit routes or &ldquo;corridors&rdquo; was one of a number of suggestions put forward by member states and trade interests. One of Commissioner Kinnock's concerns in relation to the proposal is that, in the absence of agreement between the police and protesters, the corridors could become the focus for blockades and confrontations.</P>
      <P>Ireland would welcome any legal and practical means which would assist in maintaining free movement of goods and people which is a central principle of the treaties.</P>

    <P>A spur off the Maynooth line to Dunboyne would give rise to particular difficulties and expense as the former alignment has been sold.

      <P>In 1996 a major review of the health issues raised by non-ionising electromagnetic <Col N="277" /> radiation was carried out by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) &mdash; who are advisers to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on such matters.

      <P>The IRPA guidelines are applied in Ireland through the licences held by mobile telephony operators.  It is a matter for the Director of Tele-communications Regulation to ensure compliance with these requirements.  The director is in the process of putting in place a system of monitoring electromagnetic radiation emissions for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 333, 334 and 335 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> For many years now, the regulatory safety regimes laid down by the relevant international organisations for air and sea passenger carriers provide strict standards of protection to facilitate the safe transport of radioactive materials.  Such materials would typically be used for a whole range of medical, scientific and industrial purposes. In practice, such material carried on passenger aircraft and ships would not include irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium or high level radioactive wastes.</P>
    <P>On passenger aircraft, the carriage by air of dangerous goods, including radioactive materials, must meet the stipulated requirements of Annex 18 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air.  The ICAO Technical Instructions are kept under regular review.</P>
    <P>As regards the carriage of dangerous goods by sea, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, that the carriage of such cargo, including radioactive materials, on board passenger ships is governed by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).  The Code which derives its authority from the 1974 SOLAS Convention and the 1973 Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships lays down requirements in relation to the documenting, packaging, marking, stowage and safe carriage of dangerous goods.</P>
    <P>The information provided to air and sea crews would be consistent with necessary safety standards relating to packaging, documentation, handling and stowage of such goods.  Adherence to recognised international safety standards would ensure that there is no risk to passengers. Accordingly I understand that aircraft and ship passengers would not normally be advised of the nature of cargoes carried on board.</P>
    <P>As to review of current practices, I understand that the 1996 regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in this field are being used as a basis for further updating of the requirements for air and sea transport.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not have a statutory function in relation to the technical validation of such <Col N="282" /> products or the certification of claims made for them.</P>
    <P>The addition of additives to oil-based fuel products is a technical and commercial matter for the companies in the marketplace and it was suggested to the promoter of Soltron that this avenue be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations which apply in Ireland to aircraft noise levels are contained in the European Communities (Restriction of Civil sub-sonic Jet Aeroplane Operations) Regulations, 1993 (S.  I. No. 130 of 1993).  These regulations give effect to the provisions of EU Council Directive No. 92/14/EEC affecting the operation of certain categories of sub-sonic jet aeroplanes within the territories of the member states.</P>
      <P>Council Directive No. 92/14/EEC applies to all member states of the European Union.  The combined effect of the Council directive and the regulations means that aircraft shall not be operated at an airport within the State as from 1 April 1995, unless there is in force in respect of that aeroplane a noise certificate, certifying that the noise made by that aeroplane is not greater than the noise levels specified in Part II, Chapter 3, volume 1 of Annex 16 (2nd Edition, 1988) to the Chicago Convention.  I should add that there are provisions in the regulations which enable me to grant exemptions or to recognise other member states' exemptions for certain stated purposes.</P>
      <P>Discussions are proceeding in the EU Transport Ministers Council on amendment of the 1992 Council directive.  The current Irish regulations will be updated to give effect to any agreed amendments to EU law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Receipts for the use of military property in connection with film making for these years were as follows: 1996 £22,150; 1997 £23,560.</P>
      <P>In addition, £675,000 was paid to the Department by the makers of the film, &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo;, part of which was filmed in Wexford in 1997.  This money was in respect of the cost of allowances paid to military personnel who acted as extras in the film and the catering costs arising from military participation in the project.  The fee also included an amount of £20,000 in respect of administration and miscellaneous expenses.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, Defence Forces equipment is lent or hired to film production companies from time to time.  In such cases, permission to use the relevant equipment is given subject to the payment of a fee, adequate insurance cover being effected in respect of loss of or damage to the equipment and the indemnification of the Minister for Defence against any claims, actions, etc. arising from the use of the equipment for non-military purposes.  Receipts for assistance of this nature totalled £2,749.45 in 1996 and £934 in 1997.</P>
      <P>Army band fees for the periods in question amounted to the following: 1996 £3,400; 1997 £4,950.</P>
      <P>Those engaging Army bands are required to provide suitable transportation for the conveyance of the band and their equipment to and from the venue.  In some cases, those engaging Army bands elect, with the agreement of the officer commanding, Army School of Music, to pay the transportation costs of the band rather than providing the transport themselves.  With regard to subsistence costs, these do not arise as the organisers of events at which Army bands perform are required to provide a suitable meal for the band members where the engagement requires them to be absent from barracks during normal meal times.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases, the services of the Army bands are provided free to festivals and community events where admission fees are not being charged by the organisers.  Transportation and subsistence arrangements in these cases are as outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of free public recitals and school recitals, transportation costs are borne by the Defence Vote.  Subsistence costs do not arise in <Col N="288" /> respect of these recitals as public recitals are generally held locally and in the case of school recitals, refreshments are normally provided by the school.</P>

      <Quest>the rationale for class A and class C rates of remuneration in relation to clergymen and women engaged full-time or otherwise as chaplains to the Defence Forces; if he will outline the meaning of the term a chaplain in charge; and the amounts expended on other chaplains engaged from time to time in each of the years 1996 and 1997.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 6 April 1988, members of the Army Chaplaincy Service did not qualify for social insurance benefits. They first became insurable as a result of the enactment of the Social Welfare Act, 1988 and with effect from 6 April 1988, members were covered at the Class C rate.  This did not result in any changes in their superannuation benefits under the Defence Forces schemes.  The Minister for Finance announced in his 1994 Budget Statement that modified PRSI would no longer apply to new public sector employees recruited on or after 6 April 1995 and, furthermore, the occupational schemes of such employees would be revised in accordance with the arrangements applicable to existing Class A public sector employees to take account of their entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the revised arrangements, members of the Army Chaplaincy Service appointed on or after 6 April 1995 are liable to pay contributions from salary, approximately 5 per cent, towards their personal superannuation benefits and as a consequence adjustment was made to the pay rates applicable to such members, involving an increase in pay of 1/19th of the existing rates of pay.  Members of the Army Chaplaincy Service appointed prior to 6 April 1995 make no contribution towards their personal superanuation benefits.  The position therefore is that there are two sets of pay scales for members of the Army Chaplaincy Service, i.e. rates for those recruited prior to 6 April 1995 and who were liable to pay <Col N="292" /> PRSI at Class C and for those recruited on or after 6 April 1995 and who are liable to pay PRSI at Class A.</P>
    <P>I would add, however, that a member of the Army Chaplaincy Service has raised the question of the insurability status of his employment with the Department of Defence with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  That Department examined the case and, in a decision dated 6 October 1997, adjudged that the employment is insurable at Class A rate since 6-4-1988. The implications of this decision are presently being examined.</P>
    <P>There are three grades of appointment within the Army Chaplaincy Service, that of Head Chaplain, Chaplain in Charge and Assistant Chaplain.  A Chaplain in Charge may be appointed as necessary in a military barracks, camp or post.  Normally not more than one Chaplain in Charge is appointed to minister to each 1,000 officers, non-commissioned officers and privates.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The new format of appraisal of FCA and Slua Muirí officers provides that the officer being appraised is advised of the contents of the appraisal and signs his agreement to same.  It was introduced for the reporting period January-December 1997. As the deadline for submission of returns is the end of March 1998, no details of the numbers appraised or the units where appraisals have been carried out are available yet.</P>
      <P>Before this new format was introduced the views of the officers concerned were sought and the concepts underpinning the new format broadly reflect their input.  A copy of the proposed new format was also submitted to the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association. The Performance Appraisal Reports and Guidance Instruments were issued to the Naval Service and all Commands who in turn were responsible for forwarding to the unit and formations of the Command concerned.</P>

      <P>My Department maintains a training centre as part of the Civil Defence complex in the Phoenix Park.  The facilities both indoor and outdoor are designed to provide purposeful and realistic training for the voluntary members of Civil Defence who regularly attend to learn life saving skills.  The outdoor facilities are laid out in the form of a damaged village and I am delighted to make these available to other emergency bodies who wish to take advantage of this unique training environment.</P>
      <P>The training facilities are used by the Eastern Health Board, the National Ambulance Training School, The Order of Malta and St. John's Ambulance Brigade on 17 occasions in 1997 and by the National Ambulance Training School on one occasion in 1998.  Maintaining records of the members using the facilities on each occasion are a matter for the organising group.  Additional costs arising to my Department as a result of such use are recouped by the relevant body but generally such costs do not arise as the training described generally takes place during normal working hours at times when the facilities are not required to Civil Defence training.</P>
      <P>The facilities are made available to these bodies subject to their accepting a number of conditions including such insurances as are necessary to ensure that there is no liability on my Department.</P>

    <P>*These figures are slightly at variance with the figures given in the reply to Question No. 130 on 17 December 1997, due to the inadvertent omission of amounts in respect of withholding tax in that reply.</P>
    <P>The £1.26 million in 1996 and £1.3 million in 197 was paid in respect of plaintiffs' legal fees for various personal injury claims.  Most of the claims were as a result of traffic and transport accidents; slips, trips and falls; manual handling and machinery accidents.</P>
    <P>Legal fees are still outstanding in about 700 personal injury claims, mostly loss of hearing claims, where awards have been made or settlements reached.  It is not possible to accurately quantify the amount involved but it is estimated to be in the region of £5 million.</P>

      <P>The Internal Audit Unit of the Department of Defence may audit any area of activity involving public funds within the remit of the Department. In 1996, a total of 81 audits of a financial and stock audit nature were carried out in various military barracks posts.  In 1997, 77 such audits were carried out and it is planned to audit approximately 100 such accounts in 1998.</P>
      <P>A written report is produced in respect of each audit undertaken and is sent to the management of the function-location which was the subject of the audit in order that appropriate follow-up action, where necessary, may be taken in relation to any issues highlighted by the audit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Department of Defence civil servants and members of the Permanent Defence Force serve with a number of different missions abroad and different arrangements exist between missions in relation to the allowances payable.</P>
      <P>Personnel serving with peace-keeping, peace-enforcing or military observer missions overseas receive a daily &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; allowance in respect of service with such missions.  Where personnel serving with peace-keeping, peace-enforcing or observer missions overseas are required to provide themselves with accommodation and meals and bear other associated costs such as local transport costs, laundry costs, for the duration of the tour of duty, a mission subsistence allowance is also payable.  In certain missions other than the foregoing, where personnel incur all costs associated with service abroad, a cost of living-foreign service allowance, accommodation-rent allowance, detention allowance, disturbance allowance and children's allowance may be payable as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from a revision in 1995 of the accommodation-rent allowance payable in respect of service in New York, there has been no revision of the allowances payable to civil sevants serving abroad.  In so far as members of the Permanent Defence Force are concerned, under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances, including allowances payable to members serving overseas, come within the scope of representation of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  It is open <Col N="301" /> to the associations at any time to present a claim for a review of allowances which may be processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.</P>
    <P>The rates of overseas allowance payable to military personnel serving with United Nations Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and Cyprus (UNFICYP) were last reviewed by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces in 1990.  The rates of overseas allowance payable to military personnel serving with various observer missions were last reviewed in the context of the agreements reached with the representative associations under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>I would like to add, however, that the rates of daily overseas allowance payable to personnel serving with peace-keeping, peace-enforcing or military observer missions overseas attract increases in line with general round increases in pay and allowances.  The rates of subsistence type allowances may be revised from time to time, e.g. in the light of currency-cost of living changes.</P>
    <P>The cost of these allowances in respect of the years from 1995 to 1998 is as follows:</P>

      <P>The cost of Defence Forces participation in United Nations missions in 1997 is £22.3 million approximately, comprising £14.3 million approximately for normal pay and allowances and £8 million in respect of extra costs, chiefly overseas allowances, cost of telephone calls and postage, temporary promotions, travel on leave and preparation of contingents.  Ireland is entitled to a total annual reimbursement of approximately £6 million in respect of participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), the only missions for which we qualify for reimbursement.  Reimbursement of £8.2 million approximately was received from the United Nations in 1997 in respect of these missions. This sum included an element of arrears relating to previous years.</P>

There is no breakdown available of expenditure by military appointment holders in the format requested but the main part of their allocation was expended on official visits by foreign military attachés.  Expenditure on commissioning ceremonies in 1994 amounted to £2,324.</P>

      <Quest>the entitlement of a member of the second line reserve to undertake annual paid training, in relation to hours attended and Defence Force regulations; the number of members of the Reserve who were unable to undertake paid annual training due to insufficiency of financial resources available to the Defence Forces in 1997; whether these members who do not attend a course of paid training may receive their annual training bounty; if so, whether this has been paid in each of the years from 1994 to 1997; the amount paid in this regard; and whether this situation will occur in 1998.</Quest>

      <P>Defence Force regulations provide that members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Mu with their own consent, be required to attend in each training year for a course of training for a continuous period of not less than seven days, and not more than 21 days, in the case of the FCA, or not more than 14 days in the case of An Slua Muirí, at such times and places as the relevant military authorities may determine.  While members who wish to attend for such training are facilitated as far as possible many, due to business or other commitments, are unable to make themselves available.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for consideration for full-time attendance at annual training or other courses of instruction members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí ar to be on the effective strength of their units.  Only personnel who attend the necessary minimum number of training parades or their equivalent in hours of training in any training year are retained on the effective strength.</P>
      <P>It has been found necessary, as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure, to curtail annual training for members of the Reserve having regard to the provisions in the Defence Vote for the training of the Reserve. Accordingly, each year approximately 8,500 members of the FCA and the Slua Muirí attend full-time annual training and courses of instruction.</P>
      <P>A gratuity is payable to members of the FCA and Slua Muirí who complete a course of annual training or other full-time instruction and in addition they are paid at the same rates of pay and allowances as those that apply to corresponding ranks in the Permanent Defence Force.  Notwithstanding the reduced period of annual training that has applied in the case of the FCA and Slua Muirí since 1983 the gratuity payable to qualified members who complete the maximum permissible period of training is at the full rate, and not at the reduced rate that would normally apply in respect of attendance for the shorter period. The same arrangements apply this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396, 397 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that two agreements which have been signed are awaiting ratification and the question of signing two others is at present under consideration.  Details are as follows: The International Cocoa Agreement 1993 was opened for signature at New York on 16 August 1993, Ireland signed the agreement, subject to ratification, on 16 February 1994.  The international organisation responsible for the agreement is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.  It is proposed that Ireland will ratify the agreement when all EU member states are also in a position to do so.</P>
      <P>The International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants of 2 December 1961 as revised at Geneva on 10 November 1972 and 23 October 1978 was ratified by the Government in May 1981.  The convention was again revised at Geneva in March 1991.  That revised version was signed on behalf of Ireland, subject to ratification, on 27 February 1992.  The international organisation responsible for the agreement is the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.  The domestic legislation to facilitate ratification, the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Bill, is currently before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals which was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 13 November 1987, was negotiated through the Council of Europe and has not yet been signed or ratified by Ireland.  The convention has been under examination to determine its full implications and a decision on its signature and ratification will be made in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Protocol of Amendment to the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes which was opened for signature on 6 February 1992 in Strasbourg was negotiated through the Council of Europe.  It has not yet been signed or ratified by Ireland owing to the need for legislative change but the matter is under consideration at present.  The convention itself was ratified on 7 April 1986 by Ireland and entered into force for the State on 8 October 1986.  There are already some rules in force at EU level which include elements of the convention. In addition, Ireland is currently participating at EU Council Working Group level in discussions on a proposal for a further directive on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. <Col N="315" /></P>

      <P>I received a submission from and met with representatives of the small abattoir group of the Irish Butchers Association in relation to amendments to the Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Abattoirs) Regulations, 1989.  These amendments which arose out of the requirement to fully implement Council Directive 91/497 EEC and Council Directive 95/23/EC are now in place and come into effect on 4 February. It has not been possible to provide financial aid in this particular context from the resources available to my Department.</P>

      <P>A provision of £2.75 million has been included in the 1998 Estimates of my Department for the operation of the Control of Horses Act, 1996, the implementation of which is primarily a matter for the local authorities.  From such funds, grant assistance will be made available to local authorities to assist them in discharging this function. In that context and in instances in which a local authority is itself supporting and involved in a particular urban horse project, I am prepared, on application, to make grant assistance available to the local authority to help it support the project in question.  In all cases grants will be paid to the local authority rather than direct to the project and it is not envisaged that grant assistance will be offered to a project which does not, within the context of implementation of the Act, have the support and involvement of the local authority within the functional area of which it is located.  It is intended that some £0.75 million of this sum referred to above will be available for these projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives of the EU's Common <Col N="324" /> Agricultural Policy, as laid down in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome, are to increase agricultural productivity, ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, stabilise markets, assure the availability of supplies and ensure reasonable prices for consumers.  In the formulation of the CAP to meet these objectives, the different soil types, altitudes and climates involved has had to be taken into account, as well as the socio-economic need to support a large number of family farms and a high rural population. In addition, the Common Agricultural Policy has undergone a gradual process of adaptation in line with changing socio-economic realities so that it now accommodates new considerations such as consumer concerns about food quality and safety and society's growing awareness of the need to protect the rural environment and the welfare of animals.  It is by virtue of its multiple objectives and roles and, in particular, of the importance attached to family farming, the environment, food quality and safety and animal welfare that European agriculture is different from that in many other competing countries.</P>
      <P>The European model of agriculture, and the policy which sustains it, take account of the physical, climatological and socio-economic circumstances of Irish agriculture and have, in general, provided a suitable framework for the development of the sector.  It is my intention to ensure that this model is respected in the current negotiations within the EC on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and defended by the EU in the next round of trade negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to transfer funds from Measure 1 of the Food Sub Programme was taken as part of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework which was carried out last year following independent reviews of both the Framework and its component Operational Programmes. The main factors which influenced the decision were: the substantial underspend on Measure 1 up to that time and, having regard to the prevailing level and flow of aid applications under it, the very real danger that the remaining funds might not be fully utilised; the need to meet commitments and priorities under other measures for which funding had been exhausted.</P>
      <P>The transferred funds were reallocated to areas which will benefit the food industry, either directly or indirectly &mdash; namely, the industry research, technology and innovation measure and farmyard pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the lengthy time lag between approval and execution of a capital project and the need to comply with the timescale set out in the Community Support Framework for the draw down of funds, the funds remaining under Measure 1 of the Food Sub Programme must be committed within the next few weeks.  While the applications for funding exceed the amount available, I should point out that eligibility under the measure does not confer entitlement to grants and that all applications are subject to a strict assessment and selection process.  That process takes into account the contribution of projects to the sectoral objectives set out under the measure as well as their potential benefits in terms of the <Col N="330" /> farming sector, the overall economy, employment and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The current Food Sub Programme and the range of support measures provided under it recognise the food industry's multi-faceted contribution to the economy.  That contribution will continue to be taken into account in formulating a post-1999 strategy for the industry in the context of a national development plan for the next round of Structural Funds.</P>

    <P>Statistics are not available on the number of hares injured or on the nature and cause of injuries sustained.  However, it is clear from reports of occurrences at meetings that the extent of injuries to hares was relatively small.</P>
    <P>The ICC has veterinarians and experts in hare husbandry assigned to each coursing club to oversee generally the care of the hares while being held in captivity.</P>
    <P>The number of coursing meetings held to date is 73.</P>
    <P>While my Department does not have any information on the number of coursing meetings at which wildlife officers were present, the National <Col N="331" /> Parks and Wildlife Service has indicated that it is continuing to monitor a random sample of coursing meetings.  Veterinary inspectors from my Department are present, for monitoring purposes, at roughly 10 per cent of meetings.</P>
    <P>Most of the statistics used by my Department on hare kills, etc. at coursing meetings are supplied by the Irish Coursing Club in weekly reports.  When veterinary inspectors from my Department attend meetings they also furnish reports and information is cross checked with the Irish Coursing Club reports.</P>

      <P>Approximately 7,000 farmers have applied for allocations of quota from the 1998 national reserve and the amount of quota available for distribution is 11,000 premium rights.  Eligible applicants with a livestock unit level of five or less will be offered quota first.  Any residue will be then offered to farmers with six livestock units <Col N="332" /> and so on, on an ascending basis, until all the available quota is distributed.</P>
      <P>Applicants with more than 15 livestock units are unlikely to receive an allocation.  The maximum number of premium rights that will be allocated to any successful applicant is ten.  It is expected that all applicants will be notified of the result of their applications by 31 March 1998.</P>
      <P>The person named has applied for an allocation of quota but, as the processing of applications will not be completed for some weeks, I cannot say at this stage, if her application will be successful.</P>

Following an inspection of the sheep on which the person named claimed premium he was deemed to be in breach of the above condition and his application for premium under the 1997 scheme was rejected and he was also debarred from participating under the 1998 scheme.  He was informed of this decision in writing and under the Charter of Rights for Farmers he appealed this decision to the local headage office.  The appeal was rejected and he subsequently submitted an appeal to the appeals unit in Agriculture House who upheld the original decision to reject the application.</P>

      <P>Section 45 of the Land Act 1965 provides that all &ldquo;non-qualified&rdquo; persons must get the consent of the Land Commission before acquiring an interest in &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo; land.  Although the term &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; person is sometimes assumed to refer only to Irish nationals there are other categories of &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; persons.  Statutory Instrument 56 of 1995 broadened the term &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; person to include among other categories, persons whose principal residence is in an EU member state and corporate bodies incorporated in an EU member state.</P>

In his application, the herdowner quoted a tag number for one amimal which following a computer cross-check turned out to be invalid for payment purposes. The helpsheet which issued with application forms advised herdowners that errors, where found in ear tag numbers listed on applications, would lead to loss of compensation on the relevant animals(s).  However, in view of the fact that the herdowner has since supplied the correct version of the number to his local livestock office, arrangements are being made to pay agrimonetary compensation on this animal.

      <P>The recouped money is then to be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.  Recoupments under the regulations are continuing and when all moneys are recouped the rate of payment can be decided.  It is expected that the Department will be in a position to make these payments before the end of June 1998.</P>

      <P>My Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands reached agreement in February of last year with the farm organisations on a package of measures to provide compensation for farmers who have lands in special areas of conservation &mdash; SACs &mdash; or special protection areas &mdash; SPAs.  It is intended that compensation will be available either through increased payments under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) or under a national scheme operated through the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>Approval is required from the European Commission for the revised REPS package for SACs and SPAs.  Payments can commence only when this approval is received.</P>
      <P>I understand that the national scheme under the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is in place but that no payments have been made to date.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted three ten month special beef premium applications on 16 June 1997, 24 July 1997 and 14 October 1997, respectively, and one 22 month special beef premium application on 16 June 1997.</P>
      <P>The ten month application dated 16 June 1997 was selected for a field inspection and it was discovered that four of the animals involved had not been registered with the calf registration service. These animals have now been registered and payment will issue in the next fortnight on all eligible animals on the application.  The ten month application dated 24 July 1997 involved one animal. There was a problem with the cattle identity card for this animal and it was returned to the applicant to have the position rectified.  Instead of responding the applicant submitted a new application dated 14 October 1997 in respect of this animal.  A valid card was submitted and payment issued to the applicant on 20 January 1998.</P>
      <P>The 22 month special beef premium application involved seven animals.  The applicant failed to submit cards for four of the animals. Two written requests were sent to him requesting that the cards be submitted for the purpose of having them stamped and punched.  The applicant replied stating that he had sold the animals. Accordingly, these four tag numbers were subsequently deleted from his application and the herdowner was informed in writing on 28 November 1997.  Payment issued to the applicant on 2 December 1997 for the remaining three animals.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 1997 suckler cow premium grants on 18 cows but he was only paid an advance on 5.7 cows as this was the quota held by him since 1994 when he was party to a purchase of six rights with a 5 per cent deduction for the national reserve.</P>
      <P>He applied to the 1997 national reserve for 12 additional quota rights and these were granted to him.  Due to an oversight the Department's records were not updated, prior to issue of the advance payment, to take account of the additional quota rights allocated to him from the national reserve.  This matter has now been rectified and he will be paid the balance on 5.7 cows and full grants on the remainder of his eligible cows up to his quota limit of 17.7 shortly.</P>

This compares most favourably with the position at this time last year when some £111 million was paid to applicants under the 1996 disadvantaged areas' headage schemes.</P>
      <P>The remaining applicants under the 1997 schemes are under query for one reason or another.  Payments are continuing on an ongoing basis as outstanding queries are resolved.</P>

      <Quest>if he will reconsider the decision in relation to a person (details supplied) in County Limerick in view of the fact that he was paid for 26 animals under the BSE compensation scheme in 1995, that he applied for the 21 month beef premium and was paid 60 per cent of this payment in December 1997, that there was an unfair deduction of £550 as the person did not submit his application for the ten month premium in December 1996 but instead submitted the application in January 1997 as some of the animals qualified for payment at that time and, thus, the person was unfairly penalised and was not aware of the guidelines on this matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU rules top-up payments in respect of BSE compensation measures were payable in 1996 based on the number of animals qualifying for special beef premium and/or suckler cow premium in 1995.  The regulations required subsequent adjustment, upwards and downwards, to take account of the number of animals qualifying for the premium in 1996.  Those producers who had fewer animals qualifying for the premium in 1996 would have to refund overpayments and money so refunded would be used to make further top-up payments to those producers who had more animals qualifying for the premium in 1996 than they had in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned received a BSE compensation payment of £496.08 in 1996, representing a top-up of £19.08 per animal on 26 animals which qualified for the special beef premium in 1995. Since no applications for special beef premium were received from the person concerned in 1996 the total BSE compensation payment fell to be refunded and was deducted from the amount due in respect of the herdowner's 1997 special beef premium entitlement. <Col N="347" /></P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, since 1 March 1985, articles of children's personal footwear of sizes which do not exceed the size appropriate to children of average <Col N="348" /> foot size of 10 years of age, but excluding footwear which is not described, labelled, marked or marketed on the basis of age or size, are zero rated for VAT.  The provisions of EU VAT law would rule out any extension in the scope of the zero rate at this stage.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the administration of the VAT system is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  In this regard, the VAT administration branch of the Revenue Commissioners and the representatives of the footwear trade agreed at the time of implementation of the zero rating for children's shoes, that all baby and infant footwear and all children's footwear up to and including size five and a half (38 continental or equivalent) qualified for the zero rating provided the footwear was labelled and marketed on the basis of age or size.</P>
      <P>However, during the course of 1997 it came to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners that changes in fashion trends had made it difficult to distinguish between children's and adult footwear. This is particularly the case in relation to footwear which is suitable and sold for adults and children across a range of sizes.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners were concerned that this should not give rise to an anomaly.  For instance, a strict interpretation of the legislation could have resulted in a child's size 3 &ldquo;Doc Marten&rdquo; being liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent as they were not specifically designed for children.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid such a situation, the Revenue Commissioners agreed with representatives of the footwear trade that footwear manufactured in the full range of sizes from the smallest children's to adults' sizes could be zero rated up to an including size 5½ for these specific styles.  All other footwear will remain liable for VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent unless it can be shown it was designed for the use of children, in which case the 5½ size cut-off will apply.  Thus, there has been no restriction in administrative practice in relation to the application of the zero rate for children's shoes.  The contrary is, in fact, the position.</P>
      <P>The revised practice which applied from 1 July 1997 was made known to the trade at the time and an information notice was placed in Issue 27 of &ldquo;Tax Briefing&rdquo;, a Revenue Commissioners publication, in August 1997.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners also intend to issue a statement of practice on the matter.</P>

      <P>Subsections 6 (1) (c) and 6 (1) (d) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939 permit the Government to transfer functions from one Minister or Department to another, while subsections 6 (1) (a) and 6 (1) (b) authorise the Government to change the name and title of the Ministers and Departments by similar procedure.  Such orders do not deal with non-statutory functions which are transferred by administrative action.</P>
      <P>The transfer of the functions of the Department of Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Justice was effected by S.I. No. 297 of 1997, dated 8 July 1997, and the renaming of the Department of Justice was effected by S.I. No. 298 of 1997, on 9 July 1997, reducing the number of functioning Departments to 15, two below the 17 permitted under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  The questions of assigning a ministerial seal or appointment of a Secretary General to the Department of Equality and Law Reform did not arise.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the shell of the Department of Equality and Law Reform, along with that of the former Department of Communications, will be extinguished when the Ministers and Secretaries Acts are next amended.</P>

      <P>The following conventions have not yet been signed by the State.</P>
      <P>The Convention on Customs Treatment of Pool Containers used in International Trade, which is under the aegis of the United Nations, was opened for signature from 15 April 1994 to 14 April 1995 at the Office of the United Nations in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Ireland has not yet signed this convention. However, it is envisaged that the European Union and the EU member states will accede to the convention when certain modifications to the Community Customs Code, which will facilitate its implementation, have been adopted by the EU Council.  Technical discussions on these modifications to the code are taking place at preent between the Commission and the member states. These modifications are being considered within the context of the ongoing review at EU level of the provisions of the code.</P>
      <P>The Joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Assistance on Tax Matters was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 25 January 1988 and entered into force on 15 December 1995 following its ratification by a fifth party.  The Secretaries-General of both organisations function as depositaries of the convention.  The purpose of the convention is to provide a new framework for multilateral co-operation between tax authorities.</P>
      <P>To date many OECD and Council of Europe members have been reluctant to sign the convention. Whether Ireland will become a member to the convention is still under consideration.  Provisions for mutual assistance are already provided for under existing networks of double taxation agreements and under EU legislation.</P>
      <P>Additionally, in order to fully implement the convention it would be necessary to introduce specific legislation, for example, to provide for assistance to be given in the recovery of tax debts to other countries.</P>

      <P>The following legislative provisions are not yet in force.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976, which will repeal enactments mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Act has not been brought into force.  Commencement of the section is dependent on the making of the principal Civil Service pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28 (4) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  It is not at present proposed to commence this subsection.  In line with commitments <Col N="355" /> given in the Oireachtas during the passage of the Bill, difficulties raised by the industry are being addressed in the context of legislating for an overall system of compensation for clients of investment firms in the proposed Investor Compensation Bill, currently being drafted.</P>
    <P>Section 51 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  This section imposes a requirement on investment business firms to hold a bond.  This requirement has not been commenced in respect of a number of categories of investment business firms and it is not proposed to commence the section in respect of such intermediaries.  The proposed Investor Compensation Bill will make comprehensive provision for compensation in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 75 of the Finance Act, 1996 has not yet come into force.  It will come into effect on the enactment of the Greyhound Industry Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1997 provides that the Minister for Finance, having consulted with the Minister for Public Enterprise and having received a proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations in an area or areas immediately adjacent to seven airports, may designate by order that the areas in question be enterprise areas eligible for incentive tax reliefs and the designation order shall specify the qualifying period for the area.

      <P>Work is progressing in my Department and in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on a number of statutory instruments, details of which are set out below.</P>
      <P>Statutory instruments are being prepared consequential to Orders made earlier by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government with regard to designated areas and in relation to the extension of the qualifying period for the urban renewal scheme and enterprise areas.</P>
      <P>A statutory instrument is being prepared to give the force of law to the convention on the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to make an Order under section 2 of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, as amended by section 80 of the Central Bank Act, 1997.  The effect of the Order would <Col N="356" /> be to provide updated provisions governing investments in which funds controlled by trustees whose investment powers are governed by the Trustees (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, may be invested.  The draft Order is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>A draft statutory instrument entitled &ldquo;Financial Transfers (Angola) Order, 1998&rdquo; to be made under section 4 of the Financial Transfers Act, 1992 has been prepared and is currently with the Attorney General's office for clearance.  The Order provides for the application in Ireland of United Nations sanctions against Angola in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 2229/97 of 30 October 1997, which prohibits certain transactions, including the sale or supply of petroleum products, aircraft and aircraft components. Certain exceptions are provided for in cases of medical urgency or flights of aircraft carrying food, medicine or supplies for humanitarian needs, subject to prior approval of the relevant United Nations Security Council Committee and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>A regulation is proposed to change the regulatory framework for VAT on property transactions. This is linked to changes to the VAT Act made in the Finance Act 1997.  The regulation will relax the rules concerning the waiver of exemption in a short-term letting to the benefit of the taxpayer. It will also specify the limited circumstances in which the 1997 changes in the valuation of favoured rents will be applied.</P>
    <P>A regulation is proposed to change the regulatory framework governing the retail export scheme.  This is also linked to changes to the VAT Act made in the Finance Act 1997.  The Regulation will strengthen Revenue's control of the retail export scheme under which non-EU tourists are given VAT refunds on purchases here which are then exported outside the EU.  The changes are intended to safeguard the financial position of tourists.</P>
    <P>A statutory instrument is under preparation to provide for the designation of officers to assist European Commission inspectors in the conduct of on-the-spot checks under Council Regulation (EC, EURATOM) No. 2185/96 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities.  The regulation in question was adopted for the purpose of enabling the Commission to conduct on-the-spot checks where serious or transnational fraud or irregularities are suspected.  It requires that appropriate contacts and assistance be provided in the member state concerned to assist the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act will commence on 21 April next for Government Departments and offices.  The following regulations must be made by commencement date.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Access to information by parents and guardians (section 28).  Regulations are required to set out guidelines for access to records by parents or guardians in respect of children <Col N="357" /> or those under the care of a guardian who are unable to personally exercise their rights under the Act.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Access to information relating to deceased persons (section 28).  The Act respects the right to privacy of deceased persons.  Regulations are required to set out guidelines on access to such records in limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Designation of health professsionals to whom sensitive medical information can be released (section 28).  The Act provides a mechanism for release of sensitive medical information to a health professional nominated by the person to whom the information relates, where direct access to the information may be damaging to that person's physical or mental health, well-being or emotional condition.  The purpose of these regulations is to nominate categories of health professionals for this purpose.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Nomination of Ministers to review ministerial certificates (section 25).  The Act provides for the use of ministerial certificates in certain limited circumstances where the information in question would be prejudicial to law enforcement, security, defence, international relations or matters relating to Northern Ireland and is of sufficient sensitivity or seriousness to justify non-disclosure of the information to the Information Commissioner. The Act provides for review of the use of certificates by the Taoiseach and nominated Ministers.  The purpose of these Regulations is to designate certain Ministers for this purpose.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Fees to apply under the Act (section 47). The purpose of these Regulations is to prescribe the level of fees to be charged in accordance with the charging principles set out in section 47 of the Act.</P>
    <P>A number of statutory instruments in relation to the superannuation arrangements applying to members of the Oireachtas and civil servants are under preparation in the Department and these are as follows:</P>
    <P>Superannuation-Oireachtas Members</P>
    <P>(a) to make some minor amendments to the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme relating to (i) the ill-health retirement provisions and (ii) the time limit applicable to certain payments by Members who had previously ceased to be Members and who had received a refund of contributions at that time, and</P>
    <P>(b) regulations are being prepared under section 13A(7)(d) of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, to give statutory effect to the conditions attached to the provision which allows former Ministers to draw an actuarially reduced ministerial pension at age 50.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Superannuation-Civil Service</P>
    <P>The following statutory instruments are being prepared under section 2 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976:</P>
    <P>Civil Service Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme: to give statutory effect to revision to the scheme which were introduced following an agreed recommendation under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  The revised scheme provides pension benefits for the spouse of a member of the scheme who marries after retirement and for all children of the member.  Voluntary Early Retirement Scheme: to give statutory effect to voluntary redundancy-early retirement in the case of Established Civil Servants; to carry through the agreements in relation to purchase of pensionable service by civil servants, at their own expense.  Superannuation Scheme for Established Civil Servants: to provide for consolidation of the principal superannuation arrangements for established civil servants into a single scheme.  Prison Officers: to give statutory effect to revised early retirement arrangements for certain grades of prison officer which were introduced following an agreed recommendation under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  Regulations are being prepared under section 29 of the Pension (Increase) Act, 1964 to give statutory effect to pension increases which have been awarded to civil servants.</P>
    <P>Legislation, which would probably take the form of a statutory instrument, may be required to give effect to Council Regulation (EC) 515/97 of 13 March 1997, on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the member states and co-operation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters.  A decision whether law is needed and, if so, its form will be taken on foot of advice from the Attorney's General's office.</P>

These rates will become effective on 1 January 1999 and, in line with the Treaty on the European Union, the actual setting of the conversion rates against the euro can only take place on that date.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works has been appraised by Limerick County Council of the flooding problems at Dromcolliher, County Limerick, which is situated in the Deel River catchment.</P>
      <P>The drainage works suggested in the interim report by Limerick County Council for Dromcolliher are outside the scope of the Office of Public Works maintenance responsibilities for the Deel catchment drainage scheme.  The resources of the Office of Public Works are fully committed for the foreseeable future to progressing the schemes originally selected for priority attention under the Urban Flood Relief Programme and, just this week I inaugurated phase 2 of the Mulkear drainage scheme which deals with the alleviation of flooding in the Cappamore area.  The estimated cost of this scheme is of the order of £7 million and will take approximately two and a half years to complete.  Consequently, no progress has been made regarding the preparation of a flood relief scheme for Dromcolliher and there are no plans to have one prepared at present.</P>

      <P>It is not clear on whose behalf the Deputy is seeking this <Col N="366" /> information but as most of the facts are already in the public arena, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that according to their records, the amount of tax outstanding in the case referred to is in the order of £250,000.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners have been concerned about the outstanding liabilities for some time and have been maintaining ongoing pressure on the company to come to an acceptable arrangement to deal with the matter.  A judgment was registered against the company.  More recently, in the absence of satisfactory proposals to deal with the debt and to prevent the debt increasing further, a letter in accordance with section 214 of the Companies Acts was delivered with a view to liquidation of the company on the basis that it was unable to pay its debts.</P>
      <P>A receiver was subsequently appointed to the company.  In addition, another creditor has made application to the court for appointment of a liquidator to the company.  The Commissioners will not oppose such appointment.  In accordance with company law, the receiver &mdash; and the liquidator, if appointed by the court &mdash; will be responsible for the realisation of the assets of the company and the distribution of proceeds to creditors, including Revenue.  The success, or otherwise, in the sale of the assets will determine the amount available for distribution.  Revenue will be in close touch with the receiver and liquidator in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 502, 506 and 507 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my Budget Statement, I announced the introduction of a new tax relief on company donations, within certain limits, to eligible charities. Details of the proposed legislation regarding company donations to charities will be available <Col N="367" /> in the Finance Bill which is due to be published in mid-February.  The intention is that the relief will be available directly to companies for donations to eligible charities by way of a deduction from their profits for tax purposes.  The legislation will also provide for information regarding the names and addresses of eligible charities for the purposes of the relief to be available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The new tax relief was introduced along the lines requested by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group sought the introduction of a tax relief on company donations only.  The aim of the relief is to stimulate donations from companies.  To extend the relief to donations from individuals would substantially increase the cost of the relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided in November that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Compeitiveness and Work should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3 per cent in their pensions or 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent.  In implementing these increases, Departments were instructed that every effort should be made to ensure that pensioners received the arrears of payment due to them before the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>As regards the Civil Service pensions, for which I have direct responsibility, it was not possible to pay all pensioners their arrears of pension by the end of 1997.  However, most of the pensioners did receive an advance payment of 3 per cent or 2 per cent in the case of those who had already received an advance payment of 1 per cent.  Pensioners who did not receive any advance payment then have received it since or will receive it in the near future.</P>
      <P>In a number of cases, the advance payments are more beneficial than the application of parity on a traditional basis.  Accordingly, such retired civil servants have received, or will shortly receive, their full entitlement under the Government decision.  In the case of those pensioners who are due more than the minimum increase, work is in progress, in conjunction with the Departments from which they retired, to identify the individuals and the amounts due.  Because of the complexity of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work pay deals, a considerable amount of research is required.  For example, many of the pay increases in question involve the addition of one or more long service increments to the relevant pay scales: determining whether individual pensioners had sufficient service on the maximum of the relevant pay scales to benefit from these increments will take some time.</P>

      <P>While I can appreciate the points made by the Deputy, the purpose of the scheme is to give an incentive to individuals to invest in quality hotel accommodation in the seven named counties which are less <Col N="369" /> prosperous than other areas of the State.  I regret, therefore, that it is not proposed to extend the scheme to County Meath.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the budget ring-fenced the capital allowances on hotels, which an individual passive investor may claim, to rental income.  The new scheme for investment in quality hotel accommodation in seven counties in the north and north west of the country operates by not applying this general restriction to such hotels in the seven counties, apart from hotels in the designated seaside resorts in those counties.  The budget did restrict the allowances available to individuals directly involved in the running of hotels or to companies, and such allowances are available in these circumstances on a general basis throughout the State.</P>

      <P>The rate of stamp duties in the UK is 1 per cent and it applies only to property over £60,000. However, in addition to this, I understand that property owners face substantial annual charges, that is in areas of London a property valued between £160,000 and £320,000 could have an annual council tax of £1,000 in addition to other local charges.  Apart from the UK, Irish stamp duty rates compare favourably with rates on the transfer of all property in several other EU member states and these are set as follows:</P>

However, if for example the present stamp duty bands were indexed to take account of the increase in the consumer price index since 1990, which was when the last change to the bands was made prior to the introduction of the higher rates in 1997, then the following bands would apply:</P>

    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have estimated that to re-base the existing band structure to reflect changes in the consumer price index since 1990 would cost the Exchequer about £6 million per annum.  Furthermore there would be an additional further loss in revenue if the rates were indexed on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Any major relieving changes in the existing rules would be very costly to the Exchequer.  The existing yield from stamp duty must be viewed in the context of overall tax policy, a key element of which is to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues and stamp duty plays a significant role in this regard.  Furthermore any reduction in stamp duty liability may be to the benefit of the vendor rather than to the purchaser and lower <Col N="371" /> rates might encourage speculative investors to get involved in the housing market in the hope of realising a quick profit.</P>

      <P>In the case of Ireland, the travel tax &mdash; currently £5 &mdash; is imposed by virtue of the Finance Act, 1982, as amended.  The tax is payable by carriers and is levied on all chargeable tickets issued both in the State and abroad for travel commencing in the State to a place, other than Northern Ireland, outside the State.  It is not a barrier to free movement and the rate of tax has remained unchanged since 1 April 1983.</P>
      <P>Not all the member states charge travel tax and those that do impose varying rates and have different conditions attaching.  As far as I am aware, the EU Commission has no proposals to harmonise the rates of such taxes.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest information available on the cost of tax relief under the pilot seaside resort scheme relates to the year 1996-97.  The results of a limited survey carried out on claims made for that year indicate that tax foregone on the scheme countrywide could be of the order of £5 million. This estimate is tentative and is subject to revision and is likely to be higher for subsequent years.</P>
      <P>The actual areas included in the pilot scheme were decided by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. These two Departments consulted with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the relevant local authorities in defining the precise boundaries of each area.</P>

      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An inter-departmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, co-habiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by mid-year 1998.</P>
      <P>Section 462 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides that a lone parent can claim tax relief for a year of assessment where a qualifying child is resident with him or her for the whole or part of the year.  Where all other conditions for qualifying for lone parent allowance are met, both separated parents can claim the allowance where custody of a qualifying child is shared and the child is resident with each parent for part of the year of assessment.  Where a separated parent has a new partner and the parent and the partner are living together as man and wife the law specifically precludes the parent from qualifying for lone parent allowance.</P>

      <P>The reduced rate applies to fuel generally, including not just electricity and gas for heating and lighting but also solid fuels such as coal, peat and the like, as well as hydrocarbon oil for domestic and industrial heating.  In this regard, Ireland avails of certain options for reduced rating contained in EU VAT law.</P>

    <P>Telecommunications services are taxed at the standard rate of VAT which in Ireland is 21 per cent.  The standard rate applies generally to such services within the European Union.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that where pensioners and others are in receipt of free allowances for gas, electricity and telephones, the VAT due on the supplies is borne by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>A paper on public-private partnerships compiled by the IBEC and the Construction Industry Federation was presented to me recently and my Department is examining its contents in the context of work which was already under way in the Department. Also, the Partnership 2000 agreement of December 1996 indicated support, in principle, for public-private partnerships in construction and agreed to assess the scope of private financing mechanisms for public infrastructure and the methodology of suitable project identification.  In the same year, a report commissioned by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Association of Investment Managers and the Irish Association of Pension Funds identified the greater involvement of private financing in the provision of public services as a possible investment outlet for pension funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department are examining this issue in the context of total Exchequer costs, the short and medium-term budgetary impact, accounting arrangements, public expenditure priorities, etc. and will report to me directly on <Col N="376" /> the matter.  They have already had preliminary discussions with IBEC and the CIF, and with other Government Departments, and will consult as necessary with other interested parties.</P>

      <P>Assessments carried out by my Department into the possible impact on the Irish economy of the continuing economic and financial situation in Asia indicate that the exposure of the Irish economy is limited at the present time.</P>
      <P>The primary channels through which developments in Asia could extend outside of the region are through their impact on trade performance and investment flows.  The Irish economy's exposure to the current situation in Asia in each of these areas is small.</P>
      <P>As regards trade, the current turbulance in the Asian markets should not have any significant direct impact on Irish exports reflecting the small share of our total merchandise exports going to this region while there could be some drop in the price of imports coming from the region.</P>
      <P>In relation to investment there is not expected to be a significant impact on the level of foreign direct investment in the Irish economy as a result of the difficulties in Asia since investment from Asia into the Irish economy only constitutes a small proportion of total FDI flows into the economy.</P>
      <P>Both the IMF and OECD are forecasting a small slowdown in EU growth as a result of the ongoing problems in Asia.  If these forecasts prove correct the impact of the Asian crisis on the Irish economic performance overall in 1998 will be correspondingly small.  However, the situation in Asia is still evolving and I will keep it under review in conjunction with the European Finance Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 525, 528, 530, 531, 532 and 569 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory fees for searches in the indexes of the records of births, deaths and marriages maintained by the General Register Office, fees for certified copies from the records and fees generally in respect of sevices provided by local registrars under the various Registration Acts have not increased since 1987 and are currently being reviewed.</P>
      <P>The current statutory fees include a £12 fee for a general search of the indexes to the birth and death records, a £12 fee for a general search of the indexes to the marriages records and a £1.50 fee for a particular search, that is for a particular stated event.  Proposals in respect of a new fee structure are being finalised by An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir &mdash; Registrar-General &mdash; who bears a statutory responsibility for the administration of the system and, at this point in time, I am not in a position to give a definitive answer in relation to the proposed fees.  Having regard to the increase in costs of services in the interim, the many developments and changes which have occurred in the services provided and the necessity for each Department and Office to recover a more substantive proportion of the direct cost of providing services, the Deputies will appreciate that a significant increase in the fees is warranted.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Church of Latter Day Saints was granted permission to microfilm some of the indexes to the civil records a number of years ago for particular religious reasons, subject to certain conditions.  An t-Árd Chláraitheoir retains the copyright of the material and the church is precluded from making unauthorised copies of the films, or from charging commercial fees for access to information contained in the film of the records.  The Deputies may also be aware that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir has given controlled access to a number of heritage centres to local records of births, deaths and marriages to enable them to construct a local genealogical database and develop a service, particularly for persons anxious to trace their Irish ancestry.  I understand that the centres also charge fees for their services, including access to their records.</P>
      <P>I am advised that representatives of the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland had a meeting with the Assistant Registrar-General, at which their concerns were discussed and the need for a review of the fee structure was explained to them.  I understand that a number of written observations from genealogical interests are also under consideration.</P>
      <P>I am advised that representatives of the genealogical interests have been informed that the current research facilities provided in the General Register Office are currently under review and that there is an ongoing programme for rebinding indexes in need of repair.  I am satisfied that an efficient service is being provided in the research room at the General Register Office within the constraints of the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> The Deputies may also be aware that a project is under way at present in Roscommon involving the conversion of birth, marriage and death records and associated indexes to an electronic medium which, it is expected, will take three years to complete.  Completion of this project will enable An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir to provide services in a modern, cost effective, flexible and customer oriented manner.</P>

Before the convention can be ratified in Ireland, it will be necessary to give it the force of law in the State.  This will involve making changes to the adoption Acts which contain the current procedures for the regulation of foreign adoptions.</P>
      <P>My Department signed a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia for temporary visitors in September 1997 which will come into force in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also negotiated an agreement with the Romanian Committee for Adoptions to facilitate the adoption of Romanian children by Irish residents.  It is hoped to be in a position to sign this agreement in February. <Col N="383" /></P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.  It should be noted that the delay in implementing Council Directive 93/43/EEC of 14 June 1993 and Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs, was due to a long running industrial dispute involving environmental health officers employed by health boards.  This dispute was resolved in late 1997 and arrangements are now being made to have these directives transposed as a matter of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a transport service for patients to and from hospitals is a matter for each individual health board in the first instance.  This service is provided by health boards either directly or on a contract basis depending on local needs and circumstances.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy on this matter is in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Health Act, 1970 which provides that health boards make whatever arrangement are considered necessary for the transport of patients.  In making such arrangements, health boards have regard to the circumstances of the person concerned, the resources available to the boards and the many competing demands being made on these resources.  I am committed to the continued development of transport services in the context of the Government's ongoing commitment to the development of the ambulance service.  This year I am providing £1.7 million in additional funding to the health boards for the continued improvement of this service.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the Older Women's Network in regard to this matter and of some of the local initiatives that have been developed to meet needs such as those identified by the network.  Given the success of such initiatives in this area, and in the context of the role of health boards with regard to ambulance and transport services it would be appropriate for the Older Women's Network to contact the health boards with a view to discussing with them what further measures can be taken to progress their proposals.</P>

      <P>I am conducting a general review on health and <Col N="390" /> smoking policy and as part of this review I will be looking at the area of advertising and sponsorship. When this review is completed I will make a further statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>Advertising on tobacco products in newspapers and magazines is currently restricted by the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Regulations, 1991 and amendments.  The regulations among other things provide for curtailment of expenditure on advertising of tobacco products by tobacco companies.</P>
      <P>At European Union level Ireland supports the introduction of a ban on advertising of tobacco products in member states.</P>
      <P>On 4 December last a measure was agreed by the Council of Health Ministers to introduce a complete Europe wide ban on the advertising of tobacco products.  While there are a number of further stages to be completed before we finally adopt the measure I am confident that it will be successful.  I intend to introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to the measure as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the cost of extending medical card eligibility to all people aged over 66 regardless of income; and the plans, if any, the Government have to extend medical card eligibility for senior citizens particularly in relation to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board concerning the person in Dublin 12 and understand the health board has no record of an application for a medical card from the person concerned.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970 determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66 to 79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> In view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to above the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and my Department has made the necessary arrangements to advance this review with the health boards.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the cost under the general medical services scheme of extending medical card eligibility to all persons aged 66 and over would be approximately £21 million.  This figure takes into account potential savings to the general medical services scheme of current payments to such persons under the drug cost subsidisation scheme, the long-term illness scheme and the drugs refund scheme.  However, the loss of income to hospitals from the statutory charge and costs such as those for community care services, which are difficult to quantify, would have to be added to the £21 million referred to above.  The most recent set of population projections published by the Central Statistics Office in 1995 indicate that the number of persons aged 65 years and over will increase considerably in the future, reaching 495,000 by the year 2011.  Furthermore, the extension of eligibility to special groups not covered would clearly increase the total percentage of the population with eligibility.  Should the percentage of the population covered by medical cards reach 40 per cent the general medical service, as currently structured, is subject to review with the medical organisations.  This would entail significant costs additional to those included in the above estimate.  It is not possible to calculate what these costs would be in advance of such a review.</P>

      <P>The National Intellectual Disability Database, <Col N="392" /> which was launched last year, includes information on the needs of all persons with a mental handicap, including persons with autism, although the specific disability is not included.  As part of the implementation of the recommendations of a policy document on services to persons with autism which was published in 1994, the health boards have been obtaining additional information on the needs of persons with autism in their regions and, in particular, on those who require or will require specialist services.</P>
      <P>Due to problems with definition, the exact prevalence of autism in Ireland is still open to debate.  Depending on the diagnostic criteria being applied, up to 5 per 10,000 children manifest autism to a marked degree.  A greater number may show lesser symptoms and it has been suggested that there is a &ldquo;autistic continuum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability.  There is increasing recognition of the condition of autism here. Whether this is due to a greater awareness leading to better ascertainment or whether there is actually a true increase in the prevalence of autism has not yet been determined.</P>
      <P>Overall responsibility for the provision of educational services for children with autism is a matter for the Department of Education and Science. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education, that children with autism have access to a range of educational services which, depending on the nature of the support required, are provided in mainstream schools, with the support of remedial teachers, special schools for children with a mental handicap and those for children with emotional/behavioural disorders.  The Department of Education and Science also established in the 1995-96 school year a pilot programme specifically for children with autism which is currently being reviewed.  The health boards provide a range of assessment and diagnostic services and support services, such as home support and respite services for children with autism and their families.</P>

      <P>There are currently 22 speech and language therapists employed by the Western Health Board.  Speech and language therapy services in all areas are in need of development.  Health boards regard this as a priority and 31 additional posts of speech and language therapist have been created in the boards in the last four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future</i>, which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of services, including speech and language therapy services.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities are being put in place in each of the health boards.  One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees will be to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.  An allocation of £3 million has been provided in the budget for the development of theses services in 1998 and £285,000 of this has been allocated to the Western Health Board.  The <Col N="394" /> question of allocating funds for the provision of additional speech and language posts will be considered by the chief executive officer of the board in consultation with the local co-ordinating committee. The total allocation of additional funds to physical and sensory disability services in 1998 will be £8.4 million when the Estimates provision and capital allocation are taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 559 and 560 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons in counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board.  I understand from the board that the gross expenditure allocation for orthodontic services in the board's 1998 revenue budget is £607,000.  The board currently employs one consultant orthodontist with four senior dental staff and supporting dental surgery assistants working under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant to provide the board's orthodontic service.  In the board's opinion this is a satisfactory staffing level for the level of service provision required.  A number of vacancies due to retirements and illnesses took place in 1996 and 1997 which impacted severely on the orthodontic service.  These have now been resolved and the board is satisfied that waiting times and waiting lists will show considerable improvement in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 607 persons on the assessment list for orthodontic treatment with 3,035 on the treatment list.  The waiting times increased sharply during 1996/97 because of the staff vacancies already mentioned.  All posts have now been filled and the impact on waiting lists and waiting times will be noticeable.  The board anticipates that the waiting time will be reduced to 12 months by the end of the current year.  This should be contrasted with the very unacceptable <Col N="395" /> seven year waiting time which existed when the board's in-house service was introduced in 1994.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board has informed me from the most recent information &mdash; at 31 December 1997 &mdash; the number of addicts awaiting treatment in the board's area is 369.  The corresponding number in 1996 was 560.  However, the number of treatment places in 1997 increased from 1,861 to 2,776.</P>
      <P>The Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street works a monthly appointment system whereby persons ringing for an appointment will be seen in the following four weeks.  No waiting list is therefore kept at this centre.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has made considerable progress in developing treatment services and reducing waiting lists across its area in 1997. In particular, in the Clondalkin and Tallaght areas the board in partnership with the local communities now provide satellite clinics in Killinarden, Brookfield, Fettercairn, St. Aengus and Jobstown in Tallaght and through Clondalkin Addiction Support Programme-CASP-in Clondalkin.  The board has also commenced a satellite treatment service at Deansrath Health Centre in October 1997.  In addition, the treatment programmes and emergency assessments run from the Aishling Clinic and Fortune House in Cherry Orchard are also available to the Clondalkin area and the inpatient detoxification programme in Cuan Dara takes referrals from both areas.</P>
      <P>The board is also continuing to recruit additional general practitioners and pharmacies in these communities who are now providing local methadone treatment services.  The board has indicated that as services have increased it has led to a raised awareness of drug treatment options available.  Consequently, more clients are making contact with the network of services available.  In 1998 the board's service plan provides for the provision of one addiction centre in Tallaght and one in Clondalkin as well as satellite clinics in Springfield and St. Dominic's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in relation to the number of persons seeking treatment in all areas will continue to be monitored and the health board will continue to establish facilities to provide drug treatment to anyone who needs it.  In addition, education officers and counsellors will continue to <Col N="396" /> work in these areas at preventing people turning to drug misuse in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 529 and 563 together.</P>
      <P>The availability of non-drug items on the General Medical Services Scheme (GMS) is a matter for the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  In 1992 the board established a working group which included relevant professional expertise to carry out an in-depth review of how the needs of people receiving non-drug items, including incontinence products, under the GMS scheme, were being met and if these needs could be met more efficiently and effectively.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the review of incontinence products on the GMS scheme was to ensure that the needs of patients requiring incontinence products would be met in the most effective manner and that the most modern, high quality, &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; products would be available to GMS patients.  As a result of this review, older and outdated incontinence products including the product referred to by the Deputy, were replaced by newer more advanced &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, where patients were using the delisted incontinence products, health boards arranged an assessment on a case by case basis by the appropriate professional personnel and where possible their needs were met from the revised reimbursable list.  The boards, however accepted that there were exceptional cases where it was not possible for persons to change from the older type items which they were using and in such cases special arrangements were made to continue to reimburse these non-listed items. Doctors and pharmacists were notified of the revised arrangements. <Col N="397" /></P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> Additional funding of £16 million has been provided in 1998 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  This includes £7 million for the development of new residential, respite and day care places and £3.75 million to meet identified needs in existing services, £5.25 million capital funding is also being provided in 1998 to begin the implementation of a £30 million capital programme which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the service developments identified in An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.</P>
    <P>Recently I approved an allocation of £742,000 to the Western Health Board region for the provision of new residential/respite and day care places in 1998.

Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Western Health Board region and the individuals who will benefit from these services will be agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee in line with the priority needs which have been identified for the region.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the expenditure of this additional funding, as agreed by the Regional Co-Ordinating Committee, will shortly be submitted to my Department.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of psychological <Col N="400" /> services for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science.  As the psychological services provided by the Department of Education and Science to primary schools are still in the development stage and are at present limited to a small number of schools, health boards currently provide some services for school children on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, that the planning process for the establishment of a national educational psychological service to provide services for all primary and secondary schools, as well as to pre-school children has now been initiated. Fifteen qualified psychologists are to be employed on a contract basis for the duration of a three year project.  These psychologists will work in regional teams under the management of the psychologists service in the Department of Education and Science and will be taking up their duties during the current school year.  The needs of all areas, including County Meath, will be taken into account when these psychologists are being deployed.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board's psychological service in County Meath is a clinical and not an educational service and therefore does not provide routine educational assessments to schools.  The service provides assessment, therapeutic and treatment services to children, adolescents and their families who present with a wide range of emotional, behavioural and psychological difficulties.  A total of 297 children and adolescents were referred to this service in 1997. In the period January to November 1997, 232 clients were seen by psychologists and 118 children await appointments.  Because of the high demand for the services a system of prioritisation is being used based on the information provided at the time of referral.  The length of time children and adolescents have to wait for a service depends on the nature of the problem which led to the referral.  Priority treatment is given to the children who come within the following categories: children at risk of child abuse; children in the care of the health board; children who have been abused; children who are in danger of self harm; and children with developmental delay.</P>

      <P>Molecular oncology is the study of molecular, biological &mdash; enzymes, genetic and immune &mdash; abnormalities found in association with cancer. Studies of these are useful to determine cause as well as diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> In Ireland, studies are being carried out using enzyme abnormalities and their inhibitors in colon cancer &mdash; St. Vincent's Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital &mdash; and genetic changes in bowel and breast cancer &mdash; Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, University College Dublin and University College Hospital Galway.  Other studies include research into immune changes with a view to treating eye tumours &mdash; Trinity College Dublin &mdash; and research into gastrointestinal tumours &mdash; Cork University Hospital.  Specific immune changes have been discovered in relation to lung cancer at the Mater Hospital and have been investigated for use in treatment.</P>
    <P>A number of units in Dublin are working on the genetic molecular aspects of cancer in association with the national genetics centre in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin.  Most of these projects are supported by the Health Research Board and the Irish Cancer Society.

The institute is carrying out a national geographically based radon survey which is scheduled for completion this year.  The survey will assist in identifying areas at greatest risk of high indoor radon levels.  The institute offers a radon measurement and advisory service to householders.  The National Cancer Registry records cancer incidence and mortality in Ireland and cross referencing data with information on relevant risk factors such as radon will contribute to research into the epidemiology of cancer.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has published guidelines which give information to householders and building designers on measures that may be taken to reduce high radon levels in buildings.

      <P>Under present arrangements, Irish patients considered in need of a lung or heart-lung transplant are referred by their medical consultant for assessment to an established transplant centre in the UK and if suitable are put on the waiting list for a transplant.  At present there are more than <Col N="404" /> 300 patients on this waiting list, which greatly exceeds the availability of suitable organs.  A total of 20 Irish patients are on the active waiting list, including 11 who are awaiting a heart-lung transplant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government, &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;, includes a commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.  My Department is progressing this complex service issue in the following manner.</P>
      <P>The immediate requirement is to examine whether the existing service provided to Irish patients and their families in the UK can be improved.  Officials from my Department have been pursuing this matter in discussions with their counterparts in the UK.  Following these discussions, arrangements have been made for site visits to selected transplant centres in the UK with a view to contracting work to a proven centre. The requirements of Irish patients on the waiting list will be discussed in detail with the individual sites.  In addition, the training requirements for Irish surgical, medical, nursing and support staff will be discussed in preparation for the establishment of an Irish based programme.  It is expected that preliminary discussions with selected sites will be concluded in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>The overall assessment of the issues involved in setting up a lung and heart-lung transplant facility in Ireland will have particular regard to the experience of other countries, including those with a similar population size to Ireland, who have previously examined the feasibility of establishing a successful transplant programme.  My Department is drawing upon the expert views of key professionals in this field as part of the assessment.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that the establishment of a lung and heart-lung transplant programme here is an extremely complex and difficult task.  One of the critical factors in the successful delivery of a quality transplant programme is whether the level of transplant activity in an established programme is sufficient to maintain the level of expertise required to achieve successful outcomes. It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes. A phased approach needs to be adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and to create a programme that is viable in terms of the outcomes for patients, whether it be at home or abroad.</P>

    <P>In summary, it is my view that a lung or heart-lung transplant programme should commence in Ireland when the necessary expertise has been developed to the point where we can guarantee results which are on a par with those achieved internationally.  In the meantime, my Department is looking to improve the level of service by UK transplant centres to Irish patients.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties being faced by lung and heart-lung patients and can assure the Deputy <Col N="405" /> that this matter is being treated as a priority issue by my Department.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of suitable services, including speech and language therapy services in the Dublin area is the <Col N="406" /> responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  I have asked the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to examine this matter and to respond directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Speech and language therapy services in all areas are in need of development.  Health boards regard this as a priority and 31 additional posts of speech and language therapist have been created in the boards in the last four years.  The Report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future,</i> which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities are being put in place in each of the health boards. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees will be to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.  An allocation of £3 million has been provided in the budget for the development of these services in 1998.  The question of allocating funds for the provision of additional speech and language therapist posts will be considered by each health board in consultation with the local co-ordinating committee.  The total allocation of additional funds to physical and sensory disability services in 1998 will be £8 million when the Estimates provision and capital allocation are taken into account.</P>

      <P>Under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 &mdash; as amended &mdash; a member of an Garda Síochána may remove to a Garda station a person believed to be of unsound mind who should for public safety or the safety of the person himself or herself, be placed under care and control.  The Act also provides for members of an Garda Síochána to assist in conveying a patient, the subject of an application for detention of a person of unsound mind, to a psychiatric hospital or unit, however the gardaí are not empowered to assist with the conveyance of persons who are the subject of applications for temporary detention orders.  I am aware that these provisions pose difficulties particularly where problems are encountered in conveying a person who is the subject of an application for a temporary detention order to hospital.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 583 and 615 together.</P>
      <P>The valuable role which is played by home helps in the overall care of older people here is widely recognised.  In this context, my Department has arranged to have an examination of the home help services carried out by an independent body, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, to advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services.  I expect work to be completed on this review by early summer and when I have received the report I will be in a better position to consider how better to bring about improvements in the overall organisation and development of the home help service.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of and the rate of payment to home helps are matters in the first instance for the individual health boards.  The questions of increasing the rate of payment or the recruitment of additional home helps would have to be considered in the context of competing demands for the resources available to the boards.</P>

      <P>The current initiative on Statutory Registration commenced in 1995 when officials of my Department held a one-day information workshop on &ldquo;The Statutory Registration of Certain Designated Health and Social Professions&rdquo; in Dublin Castle.  The workshop provided a forum for discussion on the possible introduction of legislation which would allow for the regulation and control of a number of professions with a view to the maintenance of a high standard of professional education and conduct amongst registered members of those professions, and so to protect the public.  Representatives of a wide range of professional bodies, including members of four groups which represent the interests of chiropodists, were in attendance.</P>
      <P>Following this workshop, my Department circulated a consultative document for comment to the professional representative bodies which had attended.  Comprehensive replies were received from these bodies and my Department has been considering what steps should be taken in order to advance matters.  However, it has become necessary to defer further action pending the completion of other legislation currently being pursued by my Department.</P>

      <P>I understand from the National Rehabilitation Board that difficulties were experienced by the board towards the end of 1997 in servicing the hearing clinics in County Wicklow.  This situation arose from one audiology clinician being on a career break and a second audiology clinician being on sick leave.  There is an acute shortage of trained audiology clinicians and, accordingly, the board experiences extreme difficulties in obtaining suitable replacements for existing staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> During December 1997 the board offered the option of an emergency clinical service in Dublin at its Clyde Road and North Great George's Street centres for people in the Wicklow area. This option was taken up by many people.  The board has succeeded in obtaining emergency clinical cover for County Wicklow and clinics resumed as normal in January 1998.  This will enable the board to bring waiting lists in the county back to normal by the end of February 1998.</P>

      <P>There is no statutory charge for attendance at out-patient clinics.  I presume the Deputy is referring to the charge for a visit to an accident and emergency &mdash; A&amp;E &mdash; department.  Persons who attend a public hospital accident and emergency &mdash; A&amp;E &mdash; department directly without having a referral note from their GP are liable for a charge of £20 which applies only to the first visit of any episode of care.  A charge of £12 on this basis was levied from March 1994 to December 1997.  The charge was increased to £20 with effect from 1 January 1998.  The charge is applicable only to the A&amp;E department and is not levied on referrals to an out-patient department/clinic.</P>
      <P>There are a number of exemptions to the charge including medical card holders, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children referred for treatment from a child health clinic or school health examination.  The charge may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

      <P>Successful completion by a student nurse of the three year registration/degree programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment.

      <P>The gross provision for the Health and Children Estimate after the Minister for Finance's announcements on budget day is £3,111 million. This figure includes £147 million for the Capital Programme and £100 million for compensation payments to be made under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997.  The total excluding the compensation payments represents an estimated 6.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>The OECD publishes figures comparing the level of public expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP.  The latest figures available are for 1996.  The following table shows the comparison with the other EU countries.  The OECD in its economic survey of Ireland in 1997 compiled a special report on the health services.  The report indicated that within Europe, the average share of GNP devoted by Ireland to public health spending was only slightly below average, though the absolute level of per capita spending was also lower than the European average.  It noted that there had been major increases in expenditure on community care services and that there had been significant improvements in hospital productivity in recent years.  The report concluded that the Irish health system based on a mixture of public and private care resulted in good provision of health care at relatively low cost to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The majority of persons with autism avail of the generic mental handicap services, including assessment and diagnostic services, day, residential, respite and home support services, which have been substantially enhanced in recent years.</P>
      <P>A minority of persons with autism require specialised facilities.  Additional specific services for persons with autism have been provided in the Eastern, North Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards which now provide between 128 and 130 residential places overall.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities as outlined in my Department's Policy Document on Services to Persons with Autism, which was published in 1994, is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.  Additional funding amounting to £225,000 in 1994, £300,000 in 1995 and £500,000 in 1997 was made available for the development of services specifically for persons with autism in line with my Department's policy document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to be in a position to provide £16 million for services to persons with a mental handicap and autism in 1998.  This includes additional revenue funding of £7 million and capital funding of £5.25 million in 1998 to continue the process of delivering on the Government's commitment to provide additional services in line <Col N="429" /> with the needs outlined in &ldquo;An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001&rdquo;.  £3.75 million was also provided in the Estimates to strengthen the existing services.</P>
    <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.  A programme of new building is essential for the delivery of the services required to meet the needs which have been identified in the Assessment of Need.  I am, therefore, putting in place a £30 million capital programme for mental handicap and autism services to run over four years in tandem with the Assessment of Need, beginning this year with the capital allocation of £5.25 million which I have already mentioned.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House last year I am adopting a broad approach to the issue of improving the reporting of child abuse.  I have already announced my intention of continuing to progress the initiatives to strengthen arrangements for reporting of child abuse as outlined in &ldquo;Putting Children First &mdash; Promoting and Protecting the Rights of Children&rdquo;. At present I am in the process of establishing a working group to review the 1987 and 1995 Child Abuse Guidelines.  The Government's commitment to mandatory reporting as outlined in the programme for Government stands and will be progressed in the light of the developments which have previously been announced.</P>
      <P>I regard it as essential that this be done in a way which will have wide support from the professions who will have to comply with the requirement and which will produce a reporting scheme that is effective, efficient and sensitive to the needs of children here.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in Dublin is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board.  I understand from the board that the northside of Dublin, comprising community care areas 6, 7 and 8, has been identified by both the board and the central mental handicap planning committee as a priority area for service development.  At present the board and the voluntary mental handicap agencies provide 1,087 residential places and 2,470 day places to persons with a mental handicap in this area.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £16 million in 1998 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  This includes £7 million which was announced in the budget for the development of new residential, respite and day care places and £3.75 million in the Estimates to meet identified needs in existing services.  Capital funding of £5.25 million is also being provided in 1998 to begin the implementation of a £30 million capital programme which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the service developments identified in An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.</P>
      <P>Three million pounds of the £7 million revenue funding has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board region for service developments in 1998 based on the priorities which have been identified by the central mental handicap planning committee. I understand from the board that while their proposals in relation to the development of new services in 1998 are still being finalised, it is anticipated that a major portion of the new service developments will be on the northside of the city.</P>

      <P>At present, access to birth records by adopted persons is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.

      <P>As I have previously explained to the House, the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for post-adoption contact between birth mothers and adopted persons and access to birth records is a priority.  However, It would not be prudent to proceed with the necessary enabling legislation at present as there are a number of legal and constitutional issues awaiting clarification following the hearing of a Supreme Court case on 16 and 17 July 1997.  Judgment in this case was reserved and is still awaited.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the previous administration decided on a series of initiatives to best promote and protect the rights of children arising from the consultative process on mandatory reporting during 1996. Details of these initiatives were published in January 1997 in Putting Children First &mdash; Promoting and Protecting the Rights of Children and the then Minister of State gave a commitment that their impact would be evaluated over three years. I announced my intention to continue to progress these worthwhile initiatives in my reply to a Dáil question on 9 October 1997.</P>
      <P>The initiatives published in Putting Children First &mdash; Promoting and Protecting the Rights of Children, and the progress achieved to date, are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) Designated officers in the health boards to co-ordinate inter-agency approaches to child protection at a community care level. Funding was provided in 1997 development funding to begin the introduction of designated officers in each community care area by each health board.  To date, half of these posts have been put in place.  Further funding <Col N="433" /> for this purpose has been approved in 1998 so that the process can be completed.</P>
    <P>(ii) regional and local child protection committees, operating at health board and community care level, to enhance inter-agency and inter-professional approaches to child protection.  The Department of Health and Children has requested health boards to arrange for the establishment of regional and local child protection committees and discussions on this matter are on-going.</P>
    <P>(iii) Multi-disciplinary training, under the aegis of the regional child protection committees, to increase inter-agency and inter-professional approaches to child protection. £100,000 was provided in 1997 child care development funding towards the expansion of multi-disciplinary training on child protection.</P>
    <P>(iv) The new Social Services Inspectorate to review the 1987 Child Abuse Guidelines and the Procedure for Notification of Suspected Cases of Child Abuse between health boards and gardaí.  I am currently establishing a working group to review the 1987 and 1995 Child Abuse Guidelines.</P>
    <P>(v) A public information campaign to heighten public awareness of child abuse and of the system to respond to cases of child abuse.  This campaign has not taken place. However, my Department is making £100,000 available to the Children's Rights Alliance in 1998 as a contribution towards the cost of an Awareness Campaign on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    <P>(vi) The provision of support services by health boards for victims of past abuse. £100,000 was provided in 1997 Development Funding towards the establishment of support services by health boards for victims of past abuse.</P>
    <P>(vii) Funding of voluntary agencies dealing with children to be conditional on procedures being in place to deal with allegations of child abuse.  Health boards have been asked to ensure that this measure is implemented and this matter is being addressed by them.</P>
    <P>(viii) Evaluation of the impact of the above measures on the reporting of child abuse.  It is envisaged that evaluation of these measures will take place over a three year period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 614 and 619 together.</P>
      <P>I have now approved the Revised Phase II Development Brief for Naas General Hospital. Following detailed discussions between my Department and the Eastern Health Board, I have agreed to the extension of the brief, as compared with the board's original proposal.</P>
      <P>As now approved, the brief incorporates the following additional provisions: additional general medical and surgical ward &mdash; 31 beds; Department of Medicine for the Elderly; Day Services Unit; Department of Radiology; Operating Department; and Department of Physical Medicine.  The detailed planning of this major new development is now proceeding rapidly. Financial provision has been made in my Department's capital budget and the hospital authorities are now engaged in a process of consultation with the hospital staff regarding the draft development control plan drawings.  The Eastern Health Board has assured me that the development is being progressed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Hospital continues to experience overcrowding problems.  The task of addressing these problems in the short term is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance and the board has implemented a number of initiatives to ease the difficulties being experienced.  These include the provision of a dedicated day ward, the provision of an observation unit to accommodate up to 13 patients, the appointment of a bed manager and the creation of two additional consultant posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to alleviate space pressures in the hospital, there have been changes in the use of some areas.  The board is confident that the completion <Col N="436" /> of phase II of the hospital development will address all of the problems currently being encountered.  In the interim, the hospital manager, in consultation with the Director of Nursing and the Medical Advisory Committee, will continue to consider all options open to them to deal with any difficulties which may arise.</P>

      <P>A total of £8.4 million is being made available this year for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  One of the priority areas for funding from this allocation is aids and appliances and prostheses.  Indeed, the Government has already allocated £4,325 million last year out of savings on the Vote of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to voluntary organisations for the provision of aids and appliances to people with disabilities.  This should have a positive impact on waiting lists for these items.</P>

Central heating may be included as part of such adaptation works and, in circumstances where a proposed central heating system extends beyond the accommodation for the disabled person, an apportionment of the cost is made.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will provide a grant to Kilkenny Corporation in order to provide a flood relief wall at John's Quay and an embankment at the rear of Green Street, Kilkenny in view of the small sum involved which will remove the intolerable inconvenience and pressure on the families affected by the frequent flooding of this area and the fact that both measures have been identified as necessary in each survey undertaken by the Office of Public Works and the local authority and as it may be many years before the Office of Public Works will undertake a major drainage scheme which they are currently planning for the River Nore.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The design and implementation of flood relief schemes is a matter for the Office of Public Works and I have no function in this matter.  There are no funds available to my Department out of which a grant could be made to finance such works.  In addition, local authorities are empowered under the Local Authority (Works) Act, 1949, to execute works affording relief or protection from flooding but my Department has no substantive involvement by way of grant assistance or otherwise with these provisions.  In relation to roads, my Department allocates grants to Kilkenny Corporation on an annual basis towards the cost of the maintenance and upkeep of the non-national roads in its area. These grants must be applied to specific categories of road works which can, in certain circumstances, include works involving retaining walls. It is a matter for Kilkenny Corporation to decide whether its non-national road grant could properly be applied to the works in question.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Question No. 26 of 14 October 1997. The Government is committed to an ongoing programme for the renewal of local government.  A number of significant reform measures are currently under way and at various stages of implementation. Guidelines for the establishment and operation of strategic policy committees issued to city and county councils last November and a seminar on implementation will be held next week.  Earlier this month I announced details of proposed new arrangements for the future funding local government which will come into effect on 1 January 1999.  Legislation to underpin the funding proposals will be brought before the Dáil as early as possible in the current sitting.  Currently negotiations with staff interests in relation to the strengthening of management structures in local authorities are ongoing.  Side by side with these initiatives, a range of other reform measures such as the modernisation of local government financial management systems and of the human resources area generally are currently ongoing.  In addition to the matters mentioned I intend, following consideration by Government, to bring forward a range of further initiatives later in the year as part of the programme of renewal.</P>

    <P>Cases for designation under the new urban renewal scheme, which is due to come into operation on 1 August 1998, will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans to be prepared by local authorities for areas of greatest priority in urban renewal terms.  Guidelines have been issued which set out the criteria to be used by local authorities in the selection of such areas.

There may be particular applications or locations at which such machines could be successfuly deployed; this would be a matter for recycling operators.</P>

      <P>The information requested is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Under section 17 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, a dog fouling a public place was an offence only where a local authority had made relevant by-laws including specific provision for such an offence.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, which replaces the 1986 provision on dog fouling, makes it an offence for the person in charge of a dog not to clean up when the dog fouls in specified public places.  The on-the-spot fine system applies in relation to such an offence under the 1997 Act.  In accordance with established practice, statistical information on the total numbers of on-the-spot fine notices issued, prosecutions and convictions under the litter legislation is sought from local authorities each year in respect of the previous year.  Details of specific offences under the 1997 Act are a matter for the relevant local authority.</P>

      <P>The initiation and planning of sewage treatment facilities, including <Col N="462" /> the location of these facilities, and the area to be serviced, is a matter for the proposing local authority. Where sewerage treatment facilities are to be located within the area of the local authority developing them, one of two procedures applies. Smaller facilities must generally comply with Part X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 1994.  In the case of proposed sewage treatment facilities with a capacity greater than 10,000 population equivalent, an environment impact assessment must be carried out in accordance with Part IX of the 1994 regulations.  Where the sewage treatment facilities are to be located in the area of another local authority, planning permission must be obtained from that local authority and an EIA must be carried out, where appropriate.  In considering proposals received from local authorities, it is a practice of my Department to assess the proposals in relation to the extent of drainage area(s) covered and cost.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 684, 685 and 686 together.</P>
      <P>There are a series of international agreements and Conventions relating to social security which it is open to Ireland to become a party to or to ratify.  Details relating to the main such instruments follow.  A list of the other instruments will be supplied to the Deputy, together with information on the position on ratification-agreement, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The European Code of Social Security, drawn up by the Council of Europe, lays down minimum standards in this field.  The code was opened for signature on 16 April 1964.  Ireland has ratified the code and accepted five parts relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, old age benefit, family benefit and survivor's benefit respectively.  It has not been possible to date to ratify the remaining four parts dealing with medical care, employment injury benefit, maternity benefit and invalidity benefit, but these parts are subject to review to establish whether ratification has become possible.  A revised code was opened for signature by member states of the Council of Europe on 6 November 1990.  Ireland has not signed nor ratified this revised code, to date.</P>
      <P>Ireland has ratified a similar ILO Convention No. 102 concerning minimum standards of social security on 17 June 1968, and accepted parts of the Convention relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and survivor's benefit.  A similar review procedure in relation to its unratified parts &mdash; medical care, old age benefit, employment injury benefit, family benefit, maternity benefit and invalidity benefit &mdash; applies as in the case of the European code.</P>
      <P>Detailed provisions for the co-ordination of social security schemes throughout the European Union and European economic area are contained in Council regulations (EEC) Nos. 1408/71 and 574/72.  These regulations provide for the co-ordination of social security schemes for employed and self-employed people and their families moving throughout the European Union and the European economic area.  They also cover refugees, stateless persons who are residing in an EU/EEA member state as well as members of their family, regardless of their nationality, and their survivors.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe's European Convention on Social Security was opened for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe on 14 December 1972, and was signed by Ireland on 23 February 1979.</P>
      <P>The Convention is designed to ensure, in each ratifying country, equality of treatment in social security for nationals of other ratifying countries and for refugees and stateless persons and also to ensure that entitlements to social security benefits is maintained despite changes of residence within such countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, eight of the member states of the Council of Europe viz.  Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and <Col N="468" /> Turkey, have ratified the Convention.  All, except Turkey, are members of the European Union and, accordingly, the social security entitlements of persons moving between Ireland and those countries are already protected by the EU regulations on social security.</P>

      <P>The provisions of Part IV of the Social Welfare Act, 1997, which provide for the introduction of a new sickness allowance scheme have not yet been commenced.</P>
      <P>It was originally envisaged that the sickness allowance scheme would commence in 1997. However, it has been found that the level of computer systems development work which would be required to introduce this scheme is such that it could jeopardise the critical work which it is necessary to undertake in order to ensure that all of the Department's computer based payments systems are fully prepared for the year 2000.  In the circumstances, it has been necessary to defer the introduction of the sickness allowance scheme for the present.  I will be reviewing the position in mid-1998 in the light of progress on year 2000 preparations.</P>
      <P>I should point out however, that all of those who would qualify for this new payment, are currently catered for under existing social welfare payments, such as supplementary welfare allowance and will not lose out as a result of the deferred implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another provision of the 1997 Act which has not yet been brought into effect is section 22(3) which provides that the cost of medical certificates obtained by a claimant for the purposes of disability allowance and sickness allowance will <Col N="469" /> be met by my Department, as is currently the case with disability benefit, invalidity pension and maternity benefit.  My Department and the Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in discussions on this matter.  When these issues <Col N="470" /> have been resolved this section will be commenced.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidated Payments Provisions) (Educational Opportunities) Regulations, 1998, are at an advanced stage of preparation.  These regulations extend the scope of the Back to Education programmes by providing that unemployed people may now attend approved courses of education, training or development which largely fall outside the realm of formal second level and third level courses.  Participants on these courses may continue to receive their social welfare payments for the duration of the course.  The qualifying conditions for all educational programmes are also standardised, requiring participants to be at least 21 years of age and in receipt of a social welfare payment for at least six months.  These regulations which require the counter-signature of the Minister for Finance will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future.  I am also considering introducing, during 1998, statutory instruments relating to:</P>
      <P>&mdash;late claims for contributory pensions;</P>
      <P>&mdash;supplementary welfare allowance appeals;</P>
      <P>&mdash;rounding provisions for special partial old age (contributory) pension;</P>

      <P>The methods of assessing capital for the purposes of old age non-contributory pension were revised with effect from 17 October 1997.  The changes significantly improved the position of pensioners in that a far greater proportion of capital, including savings and investments, may now be disregarded for means-test purposes and a further amount of up to £20,000 is assessable at a lower rate.</P>
      <P>As a first step, existing pension claims where all or part of the means were derived from capital were reviewed and the rate of payment adjusted to take account of the improved methods of assessing capital.  This review involved over 20,000 claims, including old age pensions, blind pensions and carer's allowances, and the rates of payment were increased in approximately 60 per cent of cases.</P>
      <P>In addition, all cases originally disallowed during 1997 on the basis of capital assessments were examined and application forms were issued to enable the people concerned to have their claims reconsidered in the context of the improved qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>The information leaflet dealing with the relevant pensions was updated to include the improved methods of assessment.  A further edition of this leaflet will be available shortly from the Department's local offices and will also be widely distributed through the network of citizen's information centres and other organisations dealing with welfare rights.  The improvements were also outlined in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>Sunday Business Post.</i>  They were also made available to the public via with AERTEL service for RTÉ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> The thorough examination of all relevant claims within my Department, together with the distribution of updated information leaflets, has resulted in the vast majority of eligible pensioners benefiting fully from the changes introduced in October last.  The revised conditions, will of course, be applied to all applications received since the relevant date.</P>

Regulatory power to extend backdating beyond 12 months in these cases is also provided.  These provisions are limited to claims received on or after 1 January, 1997.</P>

      <P>The general insurance contributions conditions which govern the award of unemployment benefit require that a claimant must have 39 weeks PRSI paid and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year &mdash; i.e. in the last complete income tax year before the benefit year in which the claim is made.  These conditions ensure that a claimant must have a reasonable recent level of attachment to the active labour force in order to secure entitlement to unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The EU Social Security Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72 provide for the co-ordination of social security schemes &mdash; including unemployment benefit &mdash; for workers, self-employed persons and their families moving throughout the EU as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.  There are a number of options available to unemployed Irish people who last worked in an EU member state or one of the other states referred to above. They can, subject to satisfying certain conditions, have their unemployment benefit payments from the state in which they were last employed paid to them for up to three months when they return to Ireland in search of work.  They can, on returning to Ireland, qualify for Irish benefit if they satisfy the conditions for entitlement based on their Irish PRSI contribution record.  Irish unemployment benefit is, however, not payable for any period during which they are in receipt of unemployment benefit from another member state.</P>
      <P>If a person fails to qualify for Irish unemployment benefit based on his/her Irish PRSI record, there is provision, under the EU legislation referred to above, for taking into account periods of insurance or employment in all states to which the Regulation applies in order to determine an individual's entitlement to unemployment benefit. In order for such periods to be aggregated it is necessary that the person was last insured or employed in the state in which unemployment benefit is claimed.  In Ireland's case this necessitates the payment of at least one employment contribution.</P>
      <P>In the case of a worker who has been employed in a country which does not come within the ambit of the EU legislation, entitlement to unemployment benefit is based on the same general conditions which apply to all other claimants.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce changes to these conditions.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, contained 12 sections, ten of which (sections 2 to 11) required a commencement order.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995 (sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10(1) and 10(2)) (Commencement) Order, 1997, (S.  I. No. 194 of 1997) brought those provisions into effect from 21 April 1997.  These sections provided the necessary changes in the social welfare code so as to ensure that a spouse is not disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> Section 10 (3) of the Act was brought into effect by the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995 (section 10 (3)) (Commencement) Order, 1996, (S.  I. No. 94 of 1996).  This section provides for regulatory powers for determining the circumstances in which a person is or is not to be regarded as wholly or mainly maintaining another person.  Those circumstances are outlined in the Social Welfare (Consolidated Payments Provisions) (Amendment) Regulations, 1996 (S.  I. No. 95 of 1996).</P>
    <P>Section 11 amended the provisions for the assessment of means for Unemployment Assistance purposes in the case of a person engaged in insurable employment of a seasonal nature.  This section was brought into effect by the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995 (section 11) (Commencement) Order, 1995 (S. I. No. 241 of 1995) from 7 September 1995.</P>
    <P>The only provision remaining to be commenced is section 10(4).  Under existing provisions a qualified adult allowance or increase of pension may only be paid in respect of one person. Section 10(4) amends these provisions to provide regulatory powers to pay an increase in respect of more than one person.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining the effect of introducing such regulations to ensure that there are no adverse implications for any party to the claim.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance from 1992 based on a means assessment of £4 per <Col N="477" /> week, derived from the value of board and lodging at his parents' home.  In the course of a review of his entitlement in 1997, he was requested to provide details of income derived from fishing. He did not provide this information and accordingly a deciding officer decided that he had failed to disclose details of his means and disallowed his unemployment assistance with effect from 30 July 1997.</P>
      <P>He re-applied for assistance in August 1997. Following an investigation, a deciding officer, by a decision dated 6 November 1997, assessed means of £81 per week derived from self-employment from fishing with effect from 19 August 1997.  This effect of this decision was that the person concerned did not have any entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>On 18 November 1997 an appeal was received from the person concerned against a deciding officer's decision dated 13 July 1997.  As this was well outside the statutory period of 21 days within which an appeal must be made a late appeal was not accepted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question is being taken as notice of the person's intention to appeal the decision of 6 November 1997 and an appeal has been registered. The person concerned has in the meantime re-applied for unemployment assistance on 15 December 1997 and this is being investigated.  As soon as these investigations are completed the papers will be submitted to the social welfare appeals office for consideration by an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 702 to 705, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local community groups comprised of lone parents, including unmarried fathers, are eligible to apply for grant assistance under a number of grant schemes operated by my Department and are not discriminated against.  To be eligible for funding groups must subscribe to a self-help, community development ethos and must satisfy <Col N="478" /> the criteria as laid down for each scheme.  Applications received under each scheme are assessed initially by the relevant regional office before being finally assessed by the voluntary and community services section of my Department.</P>
    <P>The same criteria are used in assessing all applications within a particular scheme and no group is discriminated against.  However, each year the number of applications received under the various schemes greatly exceeds the funds available to meet them.  Therefore, it was not possible to meet all the demands within the resources available including that from the Tallaght unmarried fathers group.  Grants ranging from £500 to £3,500 and averaging £1,350 each were paid to a number of groups under the relevant scheme in the Dublin west region.  The 1998 grants will be advertised shortly and it is open to the various groups to submit a fresh application for funding which will be again considered on the same basis as all applications received and in the light of the available resources.</P>
    <P>As you may appreciate a large number of groups apply for funding each year, with some 2,500 applying in 1997 alone.  While I receive many requests to meet with a variety of these groups it is not always possible to do so.  Indeed, in many cases staff from the Department's local regional office meet with groups to assess their applications and are best placed to assist and deal with the group's queries.  However, requests from groups who wish to meet with me are, and will continue to be, dealt with on an individual basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>In formulating a position on the proposal to develop the port at Drogheda, my Department took account of all available data, including the views of BirdWatch Ireland.  Following extensive consultations between Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, and the port authorities, the original proposal, which involved the disposal of dredged material on the beach at Baltray, was modified in order to avoid damaging the dune habitats in this area.  Under the modified proposal, dredged material will be spread on about 30 acres, or 10 per cent of the total mudflat system of mudflats at Stagrennan.  It is considered that although this area is used by golden plover, there is ample alternative habitat in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to avoid the permanent loss of this habitat, it is now proposed that all of the material be removed within three to five years, and the mudflat restored to its former state.  In addition, the port company will rehabilitate an additional equivalent area of mudflat at Baltray by controlling encroaching spartina grass and removing a sill left from previous pipe laying.  As well as <Col N="480" /> providing short-term mitigation, this will, of course, constitute a long-term enhancement of the mudflat habitat in the area.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I consider the above to be acceptable, and Dúchas will monitor developments in the area, including implementation of each of the elements described above.  This will include monitoring of the patterns of bird use of the various parts of the port area in winter time.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> The international agreements currently being negotiated include the Proposed UNESCO Convention on the Underwater Cultural Heritage. Following the adoption by the UNESCO General Conference, 29th Session, on 12 November 1997, of Resolution 6.3 concerning the advisability of preparing an international instrument for the protection of the underwater cultural heritage, a draft Convention on the Underwater Cultural Heritage is currently being prepared by UNESCO for circulation to member states for consideration.  My Department will consider this draft of the proposed convention when available.</P>
    <P>Of international agreements not yet signed, the European Convention on Transfrontier Television has not yet been signed by Ireland.  The body responsible for the convention is the Council of Europe and it was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 5 May 1989.  This convention is being amended at present and it is Ireland's intention to proceed with the signing and ratification of this convention as soon as possible after the present amending procedure is complete.</P>
    <P>Ireland has not yet signed the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production but administrative work and consultation preparatory to its signature is now at an advanced stage.  I expect to be in a position to adhere to the convention in the first half of this year.  The body responsible for the convention is the Council of Europe and it was opened for signature on 2 October 1992.</P>
    <P>The Unidroit Convention on stolen or illegally exported cultural objects which was adopted in Rome on 24 June 1995 has not yet been signed. The convention was prepared under the aegis of the International Institute for the Unification of private law, known as &ldquo;Unidroit&rdquo;.  Unidroit is based in Italy and was effectively acting as an agent for UNESCO.  It is my intention that this convention will be signed by Ireland.  To this end, following the recent report of the Law Reform Commission report which recommended accession to the convention, I have agreed to take the lead in discussing the initial issues in relation to the question of ratification and of subsequent implementation of the convention with my Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General.  Ratification and implementation may require legislative action.</P>
    <P>The European Convention on Offences relating to Cultural Property, which was opened for signature by the Council of Europe at Delphi, Greece, on 23 June 1985, has not to date been signed by Ireland.  The question of Ireland's possible participation in this convention is being considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>The question of signing the ASCOBANS Agreement under the Bonn Convention (Agreement for the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas) is being considered at present.  The agreement was opened for signature in New York in 1992 under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> The European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages was opened for signature by the Council of Europe for signing on 5 November 1992.  The question of this country signing is under consideration.</P>
    <P>International agreements signed but not ratified include the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Hague Convention).  Ireland has signed in 1954, but to date has not ratified, the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, the Hague Convention, which was opened for signature at The Hague on 14 May 1954.  UNESCO is currently considering revision of the convention in order to strengthen it.  My Department is currently reviewing the question of ratification of the convention and will participate in UNESCO's consideration of revision of the convention.</P>
    <P>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, CITES, was opened for signature in March 1973 in Washington D.C. and Ireland signed it the following year.  It is administered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources on behalf of the United Nations Environment Programme. This convention cannot be ratified until the amendments to the Wildlife Act, 1976, which I propose to introduce later this year, have been enacted.</P>
    <P>The agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, under the Bonn Convention, was opened at the Hague on 16 October 1995 and Ireland signed it on 27 September 1996.  The agreement was negotiated through the machinery of the United Nations Environment Programme.  This agreement cannot be ratified until the amendments to the Wildlife Act, 1976, which I propose to introduce later this year, have been enacted.</P>

    <P>Council Directive No. 97/62/EC of 27 October 1997, adapting to technical and scientific progress Council Directive No. 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, known as the Habitats Directive.  The new Directive replaces Annexes I <Col N="483" /> and II of the Habitats Directive.  Article 2 of the new Directive requires that all member states shall bring into force the necessary legal and administrative provisions to comply with it by 31 December 1997.  It is proposed to implement the Directive by means of a Statutory Instrument which will amend the European Communities (Habitats Directive) Regulations, 1997.  A draft of the Statutory Instrument has been prepared and will be signed by me as soon as the legal consideration of it has been completed.</P>
    <P>Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 amending Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in member states concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities.  This Directive must be brought into force in Irish laws, regulations and administrative provisions not later than 31 December 1998.  The proposed mode of implementation is likely to be by primary legislation and Statutory Instrument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the claims made on behalf of the Environmental Investigation Agency Limited, or EIA, regarding the level of international concern in relation to the proposals put forward by Ireland for discussion at the International Whaling Commission meeting in Monaco in October last.  I have in previous replies to questions in the House &mdash; No. 3 of 23 October 1997, Nos. 340 to 344, inclusive, and 346 of 2 December 1997 and Nos. 228 to 237, inclusive, of 17 December 1997 &mdash; explained and elaborated on these proposals in some detail.  These proposals were put forward in the context of a situation whereby the number of whales taken has increased from 383 whales in 1992 to 1,043 whales in 1997 and the figure is expected to increase again this year.  The proposals seek to address this deteriorating situation by ensuring less whales are killed and that any whaling that does take place is closely regulated.</P>
      <P>I share some of the concerns which have been raised by the EIA and will certainly ensure that these are taken into account in any deliberations or discussions on the proposals.  However, I do not accept their claims regarding the level of international concern given that their submission reflects only one aspect of international views on these proposals.  I am informed that some of the organisations named as supporting the EIA have not agreed to endorse the EIA's position.  I note that Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have stated that firm action is required to bring current whaling operations under control and the Humane Society of Canada has welcomed the proposals as a serious initiative attempting to resolve a difficult situation.  International press comment has also endorsed our position and <i>New Scientist</i> has stated: &ldquo;If environmentalists are serious about wanting to stop whales from being killed, and if they want to look sensible and scientific about doing so, then this is a deal that they should be embracing&rdquo;.  I also understand that a spokeman for the EIA has stated that the proposals if implemented would provide for an improvement in the conservation status of whale populations of their principal objection related to the difficulties in the enforcement of a regulatory regime established to monitor any agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals have been put forward for deliberation to the International Whaling Commission, or IWC.  The IWC is responsible for the control and regulation of whaling and is representative of all shades of international opinion on this subject.  I am heartened by the fact that at the meeting in Monaco some 20 countries indicated that the initiative was welcome and worth pursuing. It will be a matter for the international representatives at the IWC to consider if these proposals form an acceptable basis for a resolution of the difficult issues facing the IWC.  Ireland's view will, as heretofore, be determined by ensuring that any proposals regarding the control and <Col N="487" /> regulation of whaling must not compromise the conservation status of any whale population.</P>

People who engage in substance abuse on canal property present a danger to themselves with perhaps the risk of drowning, and they may also cause a nuisance or threat to local residents, walkers, and other canal users.  In such circumstances the assistance of the gardaí is sought whenever a public order problem is reported.  There is provision under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, for ths seizure of alcohol by the gardaí from a person who is intoxicated in certain circumstances in a public place.  I believe that the effective enforcement of this legislation offers the best way to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have the full co-operation of my Department in carrying out the full and effective exercise of their duties and functions.  I appeal to members of the public to report any public order disturbance on canal property to the gardaí in the first instance.</P>

      <P>Recognition and legal protection have been afforded to the ruins of the church and the adjoining graveyard at Faithlegg, County Waterford, pursuant to the provisions of section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.  As a consequence, any person proposing to carry out any work at or in relation to the monument must give notice of such intention and shall not commence the work for a period of two months after having given such notice.  However, having regard to the current, extensive level of commitments in the region in question, Dúchas, the Heritage service of my Department, is unable at present to take the ruined church at Faithlegg into State care.  When resources permit, the matter will be carefully reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Royal Canal Corridor Study was launched in 1996 with the broad aim of providing a physical planning framework for the revitalisation of the canal corridor, that will synthesise existing environmental, social and economic elements in a co-ordinated and integrated manner.  The strategy and recommendations set out in the study are not &ldquo;set in stone&rdquo;. Nevertheless, I hope that the general thrust of the proposals can be implemented in due course along the corridor with the assistance of local communities, the statutory authorities, and the private sector.  However, at this stage I cannot provide a timescale for the implementation of the proposals.  The section of canal between Clarke's Bridge and Russell Street Bridge was dredged and restored to navigation in 1992.  It is proposed to install a lifting bridge at Newcommon Junction, near North Strand Road, later this year, which will facilitate opening the navigation to the Liffey.  Furthermore, a major fish stocking programme has been undertaken in the Ballybough area in recent years to develop the fishing potential of the canal and to help encourage the promotion of angling in the area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note that the corridor study provided endorsement for the Croke Park development proposals, stating the &ldquo;proposed GAA development should contribute positively to the canal corridor&rdquo;.  The GAA has received the co-operation of my Department in developing their plans for the new stadium development and they have obtained the necessary planning permission. I believe that the enhancement works being carried on the canal as part of the GAA project will add to the canals' amenity value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be helpful for me to make the general point initially that when issues raised in a Law Reform Commission report are subsequently addressed in legislative proposals it would usually be the case that some recommendations would be accepted as they stand, others accepted but with amendment and others not proceeded with.  For example, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997 dealt with the commission's report on non-fatal offences but not all of the commission's recommendations were accepted.  Accordingly &mdash; and leaving aside the question of resource implications &mdash; it would not be practical in relation to the 55 reports published by the commission over the years to produce a meaningful list simply indicating whether recommendations had been implemented or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of recommendations contained <Col N="507" /> in reports of the Law Reform Commission require legislation to implement them.  The Deputy will appreciate that the legislative proposals of my Department are contained in the Government's legislation programme as announced by the Chief Whip on 23 January 1998 for this session.  Certain of the proposals take into account recommendations of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Of the Bills referred to in Appendix A of the Government's programme &mdash; Bills which were published or restored to the Dáil-Seanad Order Papers during the last session &mdash; the Children Bill, 1997, enacted 9 January, 1998, took into account recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's reports on the rule against hearsay in civil cases, LRC 25 &mdash; 1988; child sexual abuse, LRC 32 &mdash; 1990; oaths and affirmations LRC 34 &mdash; 1990; and family courts LRC 52 ; 1996.</P>
    <P>A number of the Bills referred to in Appendix D &mdash;&ldquo;other promised legislation&rdquo;&mdash; will address recommendations made in Law Reform Commission reports: Civil Evidence Bill, LRC 25 &mdash; 1988; Defamation Bill, LRC 38 and 41 &mdash; 1991; Indexation of Fines Bill LRC 37 &mdash; 1991; and Fraud Offences Bill LRC 43 &mdash; 1992.</P>
    <P>Further proposals to take account of recommendations contained in reports of the Law Reform Commission will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>

      <P>As in the case of other groups established in recent times to look into the operations of organisations like the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prisons, I have endeavoured to constitute the group in such a way as to achieve a fair and objective assessment of the operation of the probation and welfare service. As regards providing operational information to this group, the principal probation and welfare officer, who has been a member of the service for over 30 years, is a member of the group and is in a position to provide detailed operational information to the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, senior officials from my Department recently met members from the probation and welfare service branch of IMPACT in relation to the above matter.  At that meeting the following points were made by Department officials: that the review group would welcome a <Col N="508" /> submission from IMPACT and has agreed to extend the closing date for submissions in IMPACT's case; that the Minister would make contact with the chairperson of the review group to suggest that the group might have further meetings with IMPACT before finalising the group's report; and that there is an absolute commitment on the Department's part to direct discussions with IMPACT on any of the group's recommendations following the publication of the group's report.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the chairperson of the review group and I am confident that IMPACT will be given every opportunity to present their views to the group.</P>

      <P>The position is that Esat Digifone, the second licensed mobile telephone operator, approached the Garda Síochána with a proposal to co-locate their equipment on Garda radio masts or sites in return for the provision of strategically important services to the gardaí and the payment of full commercial rent.  In accordance with the desire to avoid a proliferation of such masts and to promote the sharing of masts by different operators, the previous Government approved the proposal, subject to Esat Digifone complying fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the issue of whether a particular structure such as a communication mast and antennae should or should not be located at any particular place is a matter to be decided by the planning authorities in accordance with the planning laws and is not something on which it would be appropriate for me to comment.</P>

      <P>The project to which the Deputy is referring has been under consideration for some time in the context of the ongoing programme for works in the prisons.  The proposed <Col N="511" /> facility is a new purpose-built, educational and recreational building for offenders.</P>
      <P>The allocation of funding to the various building projects arising from time to time within the prisons is carried out with regard to several factors and as the Deputy will appreciate, the demands &mdash; most of which are, as with this project, worthwhile &mdash; always outstrip the available resources.  The programme of works currently under way includes the provision of 1,000 much needed additional prison spaces, as well as extensive refurbishments and essential maintenance works.  St. Patrick's Institution has in recent years benefited from this programme.  For example, all the prisoner accommodation in the institution has been refurbished and is now equipped with in-cell sanitation and has been provided with modern fire safety installations.</P>
      <P>I am, unfortunately, unable to enter into any commitment, at this time, regarding the commencement of this project, other than to state that, subject to the availability of the necessary financial resources, its status will be reviewed in the context of the ongoing programme of prison works and the overall re-organisation of the St. Patrick's Institution Mountjoy Prison complex, following the completion of construction of the new 400 place remand prison at Cloverhill later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Garda Síochána is concerned the potential crime prevention capacity is the most important consideration when evaluating an application for a Garda CCTV system.  It should further be noted that CCTV systems are not in any way a replacement for Garda personnel but are an aid to existing Garda resources.  The extension of these systems to other areas must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the interest expressed by local business/community interests in Bray in the installation of a Garda CCTV system in the town. However, the Deputy will already be aware that an advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner was set up to examine the future of CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  While their main objective was to evaluate the potential crime prevention capacity of each of the applications received, they were also required to evaluate each application from a technical and <Col N="512" /> telecommunications perspective while also taking into consideration the level of finance available from my Department and from local business/community sources.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in all, the advisory committee has received 25 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.  This includes full and comprehensive proposals which were submitted in respect of eight locations, including Bray. Each of the applications will be prioritised with regard to the respective level of crime in the locations in question and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on same.</P>
    <P>To date the advisory committee has prioritised four locations for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.  However, I must point out that all of the remaining applications on hands are still under consideration and it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as resources permit. Given that the advisory committee has access to all the relevant facts in relation to the application for a CCTV system in Bray to allow them to carry out their evaluation I am of the opinion that a meeting with local business interests would be of little advantage. I am committed to the concept of CCTV as an aid to policing but I must be guided by the recommendations of the advisory committee when considering the extension of CCTV systems to other areas.</P>
    <P>I must also emphasise that the commitment to existing Garda CCTV schemes as well as those already prioritised by the advisory committee limits the scope for the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas at the present time.</P>

This information is not readily available and the use of scarce resources necessary to extract it from records could not be justified at the present time. Not all persons who receive a prison sentence are committed to prison.  Sentences can be suspended for instance and offenders can be released on bail from the court pending hearing of an appeal.  I can confirm, however, that the numbers of persons actually committed to prison on foot of convictions for sex offences for the years 1992 to 1994 are as follows:</P>

      <P>It is a long established practice not to comment on individual cases and I do not propose to make an exception to this practice in this case.  I would like to say, however, that Castlerea place of detention is not an &ldquo;open style&rdquo; prison.  While it has been described as a &ldquo;semi-open&rdquo; institution it has, in common with traditional closed institutions, a high level of perimeter security including a 25 foot high wall.</P>
      <P>Transfers of prisoners between the various institutions, including to and from the place of detention at Castlerea, take place on a regular basis for sound operational reasons and are an essential element in the overall management of the prison system.  Consequently, the fact that a person is currently serving a sentence in Castlerea place of detention does not necessarily mean that the whole of his sentence will be served in that institution.</P>
      <P>The question of the sentence imposed on any person convicted of an offence is entirely a matter for the courts.  The courts are completely independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. Consequently I am precluded from commenting on or intervening in the outcome of any particular court case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda <Col N="516" /> authorities that a local Garda drug unit was established at Kilmainham station to confront the drug problem in the area.  Under Operation Dóchas, three uniformed gardaí patrol this area on a daily basis.  These gardaí are supported by mobile units which patrol the area on a 24 hour basis.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that significant seizures of heroin, cocaine and cannabis have been made in the area which has resulted in prosecutions under section 3 and section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the area will continue to receive the appropriate Garda attention.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, and as I witnessed myself during my visit to the area last week, the gardaí together with statutory and voluntary agencies are united in their efforts to confront the problems of this area.  A task force, set up in November 1993 to deal with the many social problems afflicting the area, resulted in the development of a community based drug treatment programme to provide treatment for the drug addicts who reside in the area.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the corporation has set up an effective estate management system, which provides for liaison with the gardaí to facilitate the effective enforcement of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The local drugs task force for the area prepared a service development plan which was submitted to the national drugs strategy team.  The Government has approved funding of £820,000 to support the implementation of this plan.  Projects to be developed in the task force area include the employment of full-time community development workers, the setting up of a rehabilitation centre, the employment of a drugs education co-ordinator and the setting up of a counselling and therapy unit.</P>
      <P>A community policing forum has been proposed by the local drugs task force and is being actively considered in consultation with the various relevant State agencies.  The Government has approved funding for such a forum which I consider would contribute in a positive way to improved policing and communication in the area concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that a priority requirement is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities to the needs of the communities with the greatest levels of disadvantage.  New procedures to achieve this objective are being developed by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood.  These will be developed in four pilot areas initially, including the area referred to by the Deputy and will be introduced subsequently in the other urban areas of greatest need.  A budget of £750,000 has been provided to the Minister of State for this purpose in addition to the moneys provided in the young people's facilities and services fund.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures that I have outlined above represent a comprehensive response to the problems in the area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 765 and 771 together.</P>
      <P>At present the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests consider applications under the Charities Acts, 1961 and 1973 from Trustees, or bodies of persons formed for charitable purposes, on the basis of: the relief of poverty; the advancement of education; the advancement of religion; and other purposes of a charitable nature beneficial to the community. The last category covers objects such as relief of illness and disability, the provision of welfare services, the advancement of knowledge etc.  The commissioners' attitude is to do what is equitable in the circumstances of each case.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have included in my legislative programme the reform of the law relating to administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the report of the committee on fundraising activities for charitable and other purposes, the Costello report, and the subsequent report of the advisory group on charities/fundraising legislation.  Both reports include recommendations relating to the regulation of charities and the establishment of a registration authority.  The Costello report's recommendations also include the establishment of an index of registered fundraising organisations which would be open to public inspection.</P>
      <P>While it is not possible at this stage to indicate with any accuracy when the text of the general scheme of a Bill might be ready for submission to Government, work will proceed as quickly as possible in the light of other legislative priorities.</P>
      <P>The issue of the categorisation of bodies as charitable for the purposes of tax relief is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda national drugs unit, which has a national brief, is directly concerned with policing the drug problem in Border counties. In addition there are also divisional drug units in the northern region.  These drug units regularly liaise with the national drugs unit in relation to specific drug suspects operating in their respective divisions.  It should also be noted that many members of An Garda Síochána, including those based in the Border counties have received training in relation to policing the drug problem.</P>

    <P>The Garda authorities believe that the national unit in conjunction with the dedicated divisional units, backed up by the other gardaí involved in mainstream policing, adequately police the existing <Col N="521" /> drug problem in the Border counties.  Consequently, there are no immediate plans to introduce a new structure such as a Border drugs unit. I am assured by the Garda authorities, however, that policies concerning the policing of the drug situation throughout the country are reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As far a the Garda Síochána is concerned the potential crime prevention capacity is the most important consideration when evaluating an application for a Garda CCTV system.  It should further be noted that CCTV systems are not in any way a replacement for Garda personnel but are an aid to existing Garda resources.  The extension of these systems to other areas must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that an advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner was set up to examine the future of CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  While their main objective was to evaluate the potential crime prevention capacity of each of the applications received, they were also required to evaluate each application from a technical and telecommunications perspective while also taking into consideration the level of finance available from my Department and from local business/community sources.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in all, the advisory committee has received 25 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.  This includes full and comprehensive proposals which were submitted in respect of eight locations, including Kinsale. Each of the applications will be prioritised with regard to the respective level of crime in the locations in question and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on same.</P>
      <P>To date the advisory committee has prioritised four locations for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.  However, I must point out that all of the remaining applications on hands are still under consideration and it is ancipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as resources permit.  The commitment to existing schemes, as well as those prioritised by the advisory committee, limits the scope for the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas at the present time.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> Since its establishment in 1962, the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure has submitted 25 interim reports to the Minister on a wide range of topics and a number of recommendations, most notably in the area of changes in the jurisdiction of the courts, have been implemented by way of legislation.  In recent years five interim reports &mdash; the 21st to 25th interim reports, as detailed above &mdash; have been submitted by the committee.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the implementation of these reports is as follows.  In the 21st interim report the committee recommended no change in the statutory requirement relating to majority verdicts.  In the 22nd interim report, the committee's recommendation in relation to prosecuting &lsquo;with prejudice&rsquo; appeals against directed acquittals is under examination.  The committee's recommendation that the prosecution would have the right to appeal an unduly lenient sentence was taken into account in the measures providing for appeals against unduly lenient sentences contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.  In the 23rd interim report, the committee's recommendation that the media should be heard on the question of whether a civil case should be held in camera or not is being considered.  The 24th interim report dealt with the issue of preliminary examinations. Measures relating to preliminary examinations are contained in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997.  In the 25th interim report, the committee's recommendation that the trial judge be empowered to order documents to be supplied to the jury is under consideration in the context of measures being prepared to reform the law relating to fraud and measures to apply to criminal trials generally.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that signature on ratification by Ireland of an international agreement is a matter for decision by Government.  The 1962 UN Convention, the subject matter of this question, has not been the subject of any Government decision to date.  The convention would seem to have implications in particular for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and I shall arrange to have the matter brought to the attention of that Department.</P>

      <P>There are three conventions concerning legalisation of documents, they are:&mdash; the Hague Convention abolishing the requirement of legalisation for foreign public documents, dated 1961, the European Convention on the abolition of legalisation of documents executed by diplomatic or consular officers, dated 1968 and the convention abolishing the legalisation of documents in the member states of the European Communities, dated 1987.  The various administrative and other changes necessary to enable the State to give effect to the conventions relating to the legalisation of documents are still the subject of consideration.  In this regard, I have been in touch with the Superior Courts Rules Committee, concerning the making of Rules of Court, as appropriate.  When all these changes are ready to be put in place, I will arrange to have the conventions ratified as quickly as possible.</P>

I previously indicated to the House in the course of debate on the Bill which led to the Children Act that there were provisions in it which would facilitate ratification of the convention.

      <P>The Convention to which the Deputy refers is the draft Convention on Jurisdiction, Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Matrimonial Matters.  The scope of the convention is concerned with civil proceedings relating to divorce, legal separation and the annulment of marriage and to civil proceedings relating to parental responsibility, for example custody, which arise in that context.  At the core of the draft convention are rules of direct <Col N="526" /> jurisdiction which will determine which court is competent to rule on these matters within the European Union.  The draft convention also contains provisions designed to ensure that decisions falling within the scope of the convention will be entitled to recognition and enforcement throughout the Union.</P>
      <P>A broad measure of political agreement was reached on the draft convention at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council which took place on 4 and 5 December 1997.  While some technical work remains to be done on the convention, the aim is that it will be signed by all member states towards the latter end of the United Kingdom Presidency.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy complete details of all the projects which may commence ahead of Ballina as various issues can affect the programme, such as availability of sites and levels of funding.  Also, the list is reviewed on an annual basis in consultation with Garda management and with representatives of the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and, obviously, priorities may change somewhat when circumstances at various stations are reviewed.</P>
      <P>The projects which will be ongong this year are Blanchardstown, Terenure, Waterford, Thurles and it is planned to make a start on projects at Rathmines, Mayorstone, Cobh and Clondalkin.</P>

      <P>The provision and maintenance of court accommodation in County Donegal is the responsibility of Donegal County Council.</P>
      <P>There are five dedicated courthouses in County Donegal at present, which are located at Donegal town, Letterkenny, Glenties, Buncrana and Carndonagh.  I would also refer the Deputy to my reply today to Question No. 775 regarding sittings of the Disctict Court at other venues in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the courthouses in Letterkenny and Donegal town were refurbished in 1993 and 1994 respectively. While plans have been drawn up for the refurbishment of Glenties courthouse it will be necessary to consult with the Heritage Council in relation to our proposals before this work can be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Plans have been finalised for the refurbishment of Buncrana for some time now and Donegal County Council sought tenders for the project last autumn.  However, I understand that no tenders were received by the county council and it is currently considering the options open to it, including retendering, with a view to commencing work on this project as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to Carndonagh, the Deputy may be aware that Donegal County Council is considering the provision of a local area office in the town as part of its decentralisation programme.  It has been suggested that new court facilities could be provided as part of such development. Officials from my Department will be meeting with Donegal County Council shortly to discuss how this project might proceed and to review progress on the other projects at Buncrana and Glenties.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the person to whom the Deputy refers but it is long-standing practice not to comment in detail on the case of an individual prisoner and I do not propose to make an exception to that practice in this instance.  I can, however, advise the Deputy that each application for temporary release is given due consideration having regard to a number of factors, including the purpose for which the release is sought, the nature of the offence committed by the prisoner and the amount of the sentence served.</P>

      <P>There are no international multilateral agreements, under the auspices of my Department, which are currently being negotiated or prepared. Similarly, there are no international multilateral agreements which have yet to be signed, ratified or acceded to other than the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, the ratification of which is pending the introduction of a testing programme in Ireland for combating doping in sport.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently assessing recommendations recently presented by an anti-doping advisory committee established last year by the Irish Sports Council, regarding the establishment of an Irish sports anti-doping policy and operational framework.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 822 and 825 together.</P>
      <P>Measure 4 of sub-programme 2, Product Development, of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 makes provision for EU grant assistance for the development of championship golf courses in remote areas and for the provision or improvement of visitor and learner facilities in Bord Fáilte branded courses.  Responsibility for the selection of projects under this measure rests with the independent product development management boards for the Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development areas.</P>
      <P>Each management board is required to produce an annual report listing all board decisions and advising of any significant developments or trends in relation to applications falling under their aegis.  The annual report includes details of all golf courses assisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> The 1995 and 1996 annual reports were published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available to the Deputy in the Dáil Library.  The 1997 and subsequent annual reports, when completed, will also be laid before both Houses.</P>
    <P>Currently, applications for grant assistance under the programme are now far in excess of the funds available and no additional funds for tourism product were made available after the mid-term review of the programme CSF.  In these circumstances, the product development management boards for the Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development areas have both been asked by the monitoring committee for recommendations in relation to possible inter measures-theme transfers. Until then, recommendations have been considered by the monitoring committee and it is not possible to state what, if any, finance remains available to support the development of golf courses in remote rural areas.</P>

    <P>Brookfield community centre was allocated a grant of £4,000 in July 1997 under the recreational facilities scheme.  However, my Department was subsequently informed that the works in question had already been completed with assistance from another source, South Dublin County Council, and that the centre then proposed <Col N="543" /> using the grant allocation for an alternative proposal which, unfortunately, was outside the terms and conditions of the scheme.  It was, therefore, not possible to accede to the centre's request.  It was informed of this in December 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 826, 909 and 932 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1997 the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arragements were based on the allocation of the surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.  A total of 32 resource teacher posts were allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  Accordingly, I am not in a position at present to allocate additional resource teacher posts to primary schools.</P>
      <P>With regard to the school mentioned by Deputy Ahern, I understand there are four children with special needs registered at this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decision has yet been taken on the question of additional resource teacher posts for the coming school year.  Any such allocation would be made on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department's inspectorate.  As part of this process, regard would be had to the prevailing <Col N="544" /> levels of special need among applicant schools at the time of the allocation.  Applicant schools are not ranked in advance of this process.</P>
    <P>However, I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be considered in the context of any allocation which may be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 842 and 843 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Breaking the Cycle pilot project is being monitored by my Department's inspectorate and the project is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  The outcome of the evaluation will provide a basis for considering future developments in supports for disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I am also reviewing overall provision to combat educational disadvantage and I can assure the Deputy that the needs of schools in the Ballymun area will be fully considered in the context of this review.</P>
      <P>I am currently engaged with senior officials in my Department in planning for a national forum on early childhood education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national forum will bring together service providers and experts in the field for the purpose of advising me on a strategy for the future development of early childhood education services. My objective in holding the national forum is to allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area. The outcome of the national forum will provide an important input into policy decisions on the <Col N="550" /> future development of early childhood education services.</P>
    <P>The operation of the pilot phase of the teaching counsellor scheme is being monitored by my Department's inspectorate.  A detailed evaluation of the scheme is currently under way.  I expect to receive a report on the outcome of the evaluation before the end of the current school year.  The question of any future expansion of this scheme will be considered following completion of the evaluation.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools in the Ballymun area will be fully considered in the context of any developments which may be undertaken in relation to to above schemes.</P>

      <P>I intend taking Questions Nos. 845, 884, and 949 together.</P>
      <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is, in the first instance, the responsibility of individual schools.  However, in exceptional cases my Department does become involved in trying to establish how best the needs of individual pupils can be met and assists in seeking an appropriate school placement.</P>
      <P>My Department's psychological service has liaised extensively with the family in this case endeavouring to make appropriate education provision for the student.  Many avenues were explored and arrangements were made to provide home tuition under the auspices of the local VEC.  This offer was not taken up by the family.</P>
      <P>In addition, a school placement in a mainsteam second level school for the next school year was secured with, in the interim, a placement on a Youthreach programme which is organised by the local vocational education committee.  The student attended the Youthreach programme for a short period of time until he advised the Youthreach co-ordinator in January 1998 that he was leaving the programme to take up an apprenticeship.</P>

      <Quest>the number of mature students who are in receipt of higher education grants per local authority for the years 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98; and the breakdown per local authority of these numbers as to full rate and adjacent rate payments.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of mature students in receipt of higher education grants in 1995-96 and 1996-97 is given in the following tables.  Statistical information in respect of 1997-98 will not be available until April 1998 at the earliest and I have asked my Department to forward the relevant statistics when available.</P>
      <P>As can be seen from the following tables, the numbers of mature students are split between dependent and independent mature students. Under the terms of the higher education grant scheme, an independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who is not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>An independent mature student's residence for the purpose of determining the rate of grant payable under the scheme is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is within 15 miles of the college the adjacent rate of grant, 637 maximum is payable.  If the address is more than 15 miles from the college the non-adjacent rate, £1,600, is payable.  Where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more than 15 miles from the college it is open to the local authority to regard that address as the normal residence and to award a non-adjacent maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>The statistical returns supplied by the local authorities do not include a breakdown of mature students by reference to the rate of grant payable.</P>

      <P>In general, under the regulations governing the middle level technician and higher technical and business skills programme funded by the Department of Education and Science and the European Social Fund, ESF, free tuition may only be granted to a trainee for the approved duration of one ESF aided course only.  An existing national certificate holder or a person who has completed more than year one of a degree level course is not eligible for free tuition or maintenance grants in respect of attendance on a national certificate programme.  National certificate holders are eligible for free tuition for a third &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; year of a related diploma course.</P>
      <P>In response to the shortage of technicians for high-technology industries, a national certificate in technology programme was developed by a joint industry/education task force.  As this is a response to skills shortages in the sector, an addendum to the above regulations issued in December 1997, stating that a number of special features will apply to this course involving free tuition for all trainees, including those already in possession of a third level qualification.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to note that I have overseen the launch of an extended supply panel scheme.  The supply panel is designed to assist boards of management to obtain the services of qualified primary teachers to provide mainly short-term cover for teachers absent on certified sick leave.  In January of this year the scheme was extended, with a further 30 teachers employed in 11 schools throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In addition, the standard rate of capitation grant to primary schools has been increased by £5 to a new rate of £50 per pupil.  The position in respect of capital funding is that the Government has approved an allocation of £39.3 million in the current year and this represents a substantial increase on the 1997 allocation.</P>

      <P>Information and awareness booklets for schools and parents were drafted and were made available, on a trial basis, to approximately 100 primary schools during the first term of the current school year, 1997-98.  These are being revised at present and will be made available generally later this year when the revision is completed.</P>
      <P>At post primary level, the substance misuse prevention programme, &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; continues to be supported through the provision of inservice training for teachers.  A total of 17 training courses, each lasting 50 hours, is being organised during the current school year, 1997-98, in support of teachers implementing the programme.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has been asked to provide guidance on the introduction of social, personal and health education, SPHE, as part of the core curriculum in all schools, at both levels.  Substance misuse prevention education will be included as part of the subject SPHE.  I expect to receive the NCCA report on the primary sector very shortly, and on the postprimary sector before the end of the school year.</P>
      <P>I intend to ensure that issues which concern and touch young people in a personal way, including especially the pressure to use various drugs, will be dealt with as part of the core curriculum in all schools.  I recognise, as well, that school principals have been most co-operative to date in both the development of the particular initiatives I have mentioned and in introducing programmes in their schools.  Support for principals and schools in organising the provision will be a priority.</P>
      <P>In the non-formal education sector, the Deputy will be aware the Government has agreed to the establishment of a youth services development fund of £30 million for the period 1998-2000 to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas to assist young people through the provision of services and facilities.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Education and Science, I am not proceeding with the establishment of regional education structures as proposed in the previous Government's White Paper on Education.

      <P>Available statistics suggest that in the region of 900 pupils per annum do not transfer from primary to second level education.  The recently published ESRI annual school leavers survey, 1994-95 school leavers &mdash; indicated that 2,700 students left at second level without completing the junior certificate.</P>
      <P>My Department has a range of strategies in place to help prevent early school leaving.  These include the development of early start centres, the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas, the Breaking the Cycle initiative, the home school community liaison scheme, curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes, support for junior and senior centres for travellers, the free book scheme and alleviation of examination fees for necessitious pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the mid-term review of Structural Funds 1994-99, new initiatives have been agreed for implementation in 1998 and 1999 under which £2.96 million will be provided over 1998 and 1999 <Col N="564" /> for a new initiative focused on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas which test models for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for young people aged eight to 15 at risk of early school leaving.  A working group has been established to progress the initiative, with a view to implementation early in 1998.</P>
    <P>Some £19.733 million will be provided for a minimum of 1,000 additional places for early school leavers in the Youthreach and traveller training programmes.  Arrangements are under way to establish 750 Youthreach places and 250 traveller places in 1998 by FÁS and the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Some £0.97 million will be provided for the strengthening of counselling, guidance and psychological services for participants on these programmes and £1.97 million will be provided for bridging and progression options for early school leavers through the FÁS training system, and 725 places within the FÁS system will be redeployed to progression options for Youthreach and traveller trainees in 1998.</P>
    <P>This investment will increase the number of early school leavers undergoing training in FÁS and the vocational education committees under the Youthreach and the traveller training centres from 4,525 to 6,250 in 1998, with provision also for some 440 trainees on the FÁS bridging measures.  The programmes are designed to provide integrated education, training and work experience, with a strong focus on the core skills of literacy, numeracy, communications and personal development, and exposure to a range of vocational options.</P>
    <P>Finally, I propose to publish a School Attendance (Amendment) Bill before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly committed to the principle of partnership and the involvement of the partners in education in the development of our education system.  I am also committed to the principle of co-operation at local level among all the bodies with an interest or an involvement in education. The Education Bill which I presented to this House in December 1997 provides a broad statutory support for such partnership and co-operation. Of particular relevance to this question is section 6 (e) of the Bill which states that one of the objectives on which the Bill is founded is the promotion of effective liaison and consultation between schools, centres for education, patrons, teachers, parents, the communities <Col N="565" /> served by schools, local authorities, health boards and the Minister.</P>
      <P>However, it is not my intention to legislate in a prescriptive way for local partnerships and co-operation and I do not propose to establish an intermediate administrative tier for the education system.  I am strongly of the view that such a tier is unnecessary and would not deliver advantages commensurate with its cost.  The priority for me, and for the Government, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, is to concentrate our efforts on meeting people's needs and parental choice in education rather than on bureaucratic or administrative structures.  I intend, therefore, to channel such resources as are available for education directly into the schools and other education institutions.</P>
      <P>In addition, my aim will be to encourage the growth of local partnerships and co-operation in education, which already exist, and to enable them to develop in an organic way as the needs of communities require.  This does not need prescriptive statutory provisions which could, in practice, restrict development or involve the expenditure of scarce resources on bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>In line with this, I would envisage some form of locally based cosultative and co-ordinating structure developing, probably at county level, in the future.  Indeed, this is a matter to which I propose to progress later this year, following the enactment of the Education Bill and further progress on the establishment of boards of management.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 881, 886 and 890 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in non-school attendance. A comprehensive nationwide system for addressing the needs of children with school attendance problems and the needs and responsibilities of their parents is required to replace the School Attendance Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>My objective is to bring the heads of proposed legislation to Government in the autumn.  I hope to be in a position to publish draft legislation before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The question of the future organisation of the school attendance service will be among the issues addressed in the legislation.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, an independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who is not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>An independent mature student's residence for the purpose of determining the rate of grant payable under the scheme is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is within 15 miles of the college the adjacent rate of grant (£647 maximum) is payable.  If the address is more than 15 miles from the college the non-adjacent rate (£1,624) is payable.</P>
      <P>Where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more than 15 miles from the college it is open to the local authority to regard that address as the normal residence and to award a non-adjacent maintenance grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>It had been the practice to recoup the payments made by the local authorities under the higher education grants scheme on a preceding year basis.  However, I obtained the necessary amount by way of a Supplementary Estimate in December, 1997 to bring the recoupment arrangements to a current year basis.  Accordingly, my Department recouped local authorities their expenditure on the scheme for the financial year ended 31 December, 1997 in 1997.  I took this approach to bring the practice into line with the provisions under the Local Authority (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, and to alleviate cash flow shortages which the authorities had previously experienced.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department also made a payment to all local authorities in December, 1997 to enable them to issue the second instalment of maintenance grants for the 1997-98 academic year to students before the end of 1997.  This approach was taken in response to difficulties being encountered by students at the beginning of each term and was intended to facilitate the alleviation of such problems.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these measures have resulted in speeding up the payment of higher education grants by local authorities.  Furthermore, as part of my ongoing review of the higher education grants scheme, I am considering the administrative arrangements for the scheme.  As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support, which was published in February, 1995, found these arrangements to be fragmented, cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1997 a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs commenced an examination of various options for the future administration of the student support schemes including the case for and against <Col N="575" /> transferring this activity to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>I have received the preliminary report of this working group and I am currently engaged in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, regarding a more detailed review of the possible transfer of the administrative arrangements to that Department. This review will involve the participation of interested parties and I would like to emphasise that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.</P>

Courses in medicine, dentistry and veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education are not approved courses in this context.  This extension only applied to maintenance grants and did not include any grant assistance towards tuition fees on any courses.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, clause 7 (7) of the higher education grants scheme provides that grants are not payable to repeat students and students who are pursuing a second period of study at the same level of an approved course.  Students who already hold an undergraduate degree or postgraduate qualification are not eligible for a grant while they are pursuing a second undergraduate degree or postgraduate qualification, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the student in question would not be entitled to grant assistance from my Department in respect of a course in veterinary studies in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the dramatic drop of almost 20 per cent in the exchange rate of the punt vis-à-vis sterling and the effect on Irish students studying in Britain and Northern Ireland in receipt of maintenance grants; the plans, if any, he has to supplement grant aid for the students to help alleviate their serious financial crisis.</Quest>

      <P>In 1996 the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.  Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in Northern Ireland.  In this context and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states (including Northern Ireland) would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his-her course.  Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that the current exchange rates do not favour grantholders who are studying in Britain or Northern Ireland, I believe that these arrangements are equitable and efficient. Furthermore, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to supplement grant aid for the students pursuing courses in the UK and Northern Ireland without giving rise to an anomalous inequity <i>vis-à-vis</i> students studying elsewhere in the EU.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 917, 941 and 942 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October, 1994 on a <Col N="582" /> pilot basis and has since been extended to a large number of nursing schools in association with local higher education institutions.  The programme is funded by the Department of Health, at a cost of some £13 million in 1997.  Accordingly, the question of student fees for the diploma programme does not arise.  Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a Diploma in Nursing Studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the continuing education of nurses is that the Department of Health has been engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which would be open both to nurses who complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualified under the traditional model of education and training.  The purpose of these programmes is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level with an opportunity to do so by means of a one year part-time programme.  The first such programme was offered by Dublin City University earlier this year and I understand that Trinity College Dublin propose to offer a similar part-time programme from February, 1998.  These programmes are provided on a self-financing basis and the nurses involved can claim tax relief on their fees or can apply to their relevant health agency for assistance from the funding provided by the Department of Health for the continuing education of registered nurses.</P>
    <P>A one year full-time degree course leading to a bachelor of nursing has commenced this month in the National University of Ireland, Galway. When the Higher Education Authority became aware of the proposal to introduce this course, it had discussions with the National University of Ireland, Galway and asked the univerity to align its proposal with the approach adopted in the other colleges.  Earlier this month, the university advised the Higher Education Authority of its intention to proceed with the course and I understand that 51 students have enrolled on the course.  In view of these developments and the likely consequences for nursing education generally, my Department is currently engaged in further discussions on the matter with the Department of Health and the Higher Education Authority.  I will advise the Deputies as to the outcome of these discussions as soon as possible. In relation to the specific points raised by the Deputies, I would like to clarify that these students are not the only full-time undergratute students attending college whose course is not exempt from fees.  The free fees initiative applies to full-time undergraduate courses which must generally be of at least two years duration.  The position in relation to the higher diploma in education course is that it is a postgraduate course whereas this course is an undergraduate course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 918 and 919 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the home tuition scheme is to provide compensatory instruction to pupils who suffer a major disruption in their school attendance as a result of a serious medical ailment.  The scheme is not intended to provide supplementary instruction for children with a disability who attend school on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>My Department's decision to terminate the home tuition allocation in this case was based on the student's ongoing good attendance record at school.</P>
      <P>I understand that my Department's decision in this case is currently under appeal and that a decision will be taken on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, made towards the approval of a classroom assistant or child care assistance for a child (details supplied) in County Carlow; and the outcome of the visit by his Department inspectorate to the child's parents in October 1997.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that an application for a child care assistant has been made to my Department on behalf of the child in question.</P>
      <P>My Department's capacity to allocate child care assistant posts in any year is entirely dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area. Where such posts do become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  In recent years, available posts have generally been allocated to special classes which cater for children with a severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that, during the visit by a member of my Department's inspectorate to the child's parents, it was established that a voluntary organisation in the area has undertaken to provide a child care assistant for the child in question.  I understand that efforts are currently being made to fill this post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I further understand that during the course of the visit, the inspector offered to put home tuition in place for the child as an interim measure pending <Col N="584" /> the child's return to school.  However, this offer was not availed of by the child's parents.  I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the child care area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of this child will be considered in this context of any developments which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I am aware that employment in the Teleservices industry is expected to grow from 4,000 to 10,000 in the next three years in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government action plan on skills I have approved the provision of 690 places in 20 selected centres under which a two year NCVA certified PLC course is being provided as part of the national response to emerging skill needs of the industry.  This has been accompanied by an investment of £1.5 million in the selected centres to enable them to provide a quality programme consistent with industry needs.</P>
      <P>As the new initiative involves extensive placement abroad in order to achieve the required level of immersion in continental language and culture, a new student support scheme has been introduced towards the cost of the overseas placement. This is an exciting and innovative development which has been warmly applauded by industry and the development agencies.  Both industry and providers were closely involved in the design and development of the programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new Education Technology Investment Fund, under which £250 million will be provided in the next three years for technology investment at all levels of education in partnership with industry, includes specific provision for the PLC programme.  Some £20 million will be available for PLCs and apprenticeships.  This will enable the Teleservices initiative to be expanded further in the coming years.</P>

      <P>Tenders are currently being evaluated within my Department for the proposed extension at the school referred to by the Deputy.  Subject to the satisfactory completion of this process and the lodgment of the local contribution, a contract can then be awarded and works can begin on site.  At this point, it is not possible for me to give a precise date for commencement of work on site.  However, I expect that works should begin within the next few weeks.  My Department will keep in touch with the school on the matter.</P>

The time recommended for the teaching of music is approximately one hour per week.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the time spent on the different aspects of the primary curriculum would vary somewhat between pupils in junior classes and those in senior classes.</P>
      <P>In second level schools, the minimum recommended timetable requirement is three forty-minute class periods per week in each of the three years of the junior cycle.  In the case of leaving certificate music, it is recommended that not less than three hours per week be made available in each of the two leaving certificate years.</P>

      <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme has not been extended at all for three years, and in these cases for capitation purposes only.  As an alternative to a further widening of the scheme, and following in-depth studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Education Research Centre and the Combat Poverty Agency, a new pilot project, the Breaking the Cycle pilot project, was launched in May 1996.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing overall provision to combat educational disadvantage.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be considered in the context of this review.</P>

      <P>Stage 2 documentation (outline sketch scheme) is currently being examined by the building unit of my Department and a decision on this stage is expected shortly.  A schedule of accommodation has previously been agreed between the Department and the school authorities.</P>
      <P>As this project is in the early stage of architectural planning, it is too early to say when construction will commence.  The question of funding being made available for the project will only arise when construction has started.</P>
