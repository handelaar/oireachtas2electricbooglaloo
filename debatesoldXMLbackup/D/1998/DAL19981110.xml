      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The EU heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission had an informal Meeting in Pörtschach in Austria on 24 and 25 October. As had been decided in advance, given the nature of the meeting, no formal decisions were taken and written conclusions were not issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of essentially forward looking questions were addressed at the meeting. Among these were the issues raised at Cardiff last June, namely, the economic role which Europe should <Col N="446" /> play in a global economy and consideration of how best the Union can be represented externally, including the mechanisms available to co-ordinate policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The meeting commenced with a session with President Arafat who briefed the heads of State or Government on the Wye Plantation Agreement which had been concluded the previous day. President Arafat thanked the EU for its role in the peace process and stressed that the parties involved in the process continued to require the assistance of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gil Robles, President of the European Parliament, joined the meeting for its next session. His address focused on the role the European Parliament can play in the issues facing the Union. He emphasised four themes: the current economic situation in Europe, particularly in the context of the introduction of the euro; internal and external security matters; harmonising social policy; and, democratic legitimacy of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The President of the General Affairs Council, Mr. Wulfgang Schuessel, joined the next session of the meeting. He raised a number of institutional issues which had been discussed previously at the General Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>The next part of the meeting commenced with presentations from the Dutch Prime Minister, Wim Kok, Prime Minister Aznar of Spain and Prime Minister Blair of the United Kingdom. The discussion which began in this way was continued over dinner. I would like to touch on some of the key issues which were raised in those discussions and which were addressed again in the final session on Sunday morning, and to indicate the approach I adopted.</P>
    <P>On the issues arising out of the Cardiff Conclusions such as democratic legitimacy and subsidiarity, I indicated that Ireland supports any moves which would bring the European citizen closer to having a greater sense of ownership of the European Union. I stressed, however, that on these and other ideas designed to bring Europe closer to the citizen, we feel the most practical way forward is the entry into force and full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam which contains relevant and useful, if modest, steps in that direction.</P>
    <P>In relation to economic policy co-ordination within the EU, I indicated that we are already well served through the institutional arrangements and the various instruments already in place. However, I acknowledged that economic and fiscal co-ordination is essential if we are to have an effective response to crises and, indeed, for EMU to succeed. I emphasised that the stability and growth pact sets out the overall framework for fiscal policies and that stability programmes will set out our individual national approaches. I stated that existing surveillance procedures should be fully utilised. The existing procedures for assessing member states' fiscal and economic policies should be given time to develop before considering further changes. I pointed out that Ireland accepts the need to assess the effectiveness of the European Union response, both internally and externally, to a <Col N="447" /> changing international economic situation and to seek improvements where necessary while maintaining the integrity of the institutions and procedures already in place.</P>
    <P>On the issue of co-ordinating fiscal policy and tax harmonisation, a number of countries proposed the notion of a common tax level throughout the EU. However, it is also true that other countries, such as ourselves, have very strong views that tax rates should continue to be decided at a national level. On the issue of the role and reform of the GAC, I stressed that in any examination of the role of the council, Ireland would be concerned that the central link between the General Affairs Council and the European Council be maintained. In this respect, reforms should be oriented towards making this link more direct, more dynamic and more efficient.</P>
    <P>In this context, I expressed support for splitting the agenda of the GAC into a two day session dealing with horizontal issues and external relations, respectively. However, I emphasised there is a need to bear in mind that reorganisation is no substitute for the political determination to make a system work and it must work if the Union is to master the immediate challenges it faces. I also expressed Ireland's support for a rationalisation of the number of council formations.</P>
    <P>In relation to internal security, I stressed that this is a sensitive and important area of work within the EU at the moment and that Ireland is satisfied that it is being addressed in the context of an EU action plan for the area of freedom, security and justice which is proceeding in the Justice and Home Affairs Council. I pointed out that Ireland considers that the best means of advancing the security of the European Union lies in the development of the action plan which will also include provisions regarding the EU's relationship with third countries. The incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Treaty of Amsterdam is also a complex institutional and legal issue and while Ireland is currently outside the Schengen Agreement, we are closely monitoring developments in this area. It was decided that the Finnish Presidency would host a special summit on justice and home affairs issues.</P>
    <P>I indicated that Ireland attaches great importance to EU wide measures to combat issues such as crime and drug trafficking. I also expressed support for the ongoing work on the initiative by the Austrian Presidency for the development of an EU strategy paper on migration and asylum policy.</P>
    <P>The meeting raised the challenge of how the European Union can enhance its action for peace and stability in crises such as that in Kosovo. It was acknowledged that the EU has a significant combined influence politically, diplomatically and economically. It was agreed that an increased focus should be given to combining that influence so that it is used as effectively as possible. On the issue of a High Representative for CFSP, I stressed that Ireland believes this role should be filled by a person with strong political skills and extensive experience of the EU and its institutions <Col N="448" /> and preferably who comes from one of the smaller member states.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was broad agreement that member states should seek to implement those conventions agreed but not yet ratified and also that the fundamental rights of citizens must be protected.</P>
    <P>The German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, attended for the first part of the meeting only. Accordingly, I did not have the opportunity to meet privately with him. However, I look forward to an early opportunity to do so before the German Presidency of the EU commences on 1 January next year. While the President of the Commission attended the meeting, I did not hold any private discussions with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his long answer, the last paragraph of which is, I take it, his reply to Question No. 2 concerning discussions with the German Chancellor, Mr. Schröder, regarding duty free. I take it the Taoiseach did not have such discussions. Did he take the opportunity at the Vienna summit to raise the issue of duty free?  He wrote to Mr. Jospin some time ago about the matter. Did he get a reply to that letter?  Did he raise the issue with Mr. Jospin? Will the Taoiseach tell us when he found out that EU Commissioners, who lectured Members of this House and of the European Parliament about the need to abolish duty free, had done a deal whereby they can continue to buy duty free goods <i>ad infinitum</i> as a result of their diplomatic status?  If the Taoiseach did not raise the issue, will he say why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not raise the issue because it was not on the agenda. As always, I privately raised it with some of my colleagues. Mr. Schröder was not the German Chancellor at the last meeting, he had not been installed at that stage. He attended part of the meeting and then returned home to finalise his agreement for Government. The first time I heard of the arrangements for Commissioners was when I read about them in the papers last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Schröder is now Chancellor and in view of his public statements of support before becoming Chancellor that duty free should be maintained, has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity to talk to him and make a case for the retention of duty free?  What exactly is the Taoiseach doing on this issue?  I reject the suggestion that the matter was not on the agenda of the Vienna summit as it could have been raised on behalf of Ireland under tax harmonisation, or is the Government just playing PR games with the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have since written to the Chancellor and hope to meet him early next month. The Minister for Public Enterprise will raise the matter with Neil Kinnock at a meeting next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Taoiseach say whether there was any detailed discussion on <Col N="449" /> unemployment in the EU in the wide-ranging discussions which took place among the Heads of State, and the fact that in the 11 countries which are planning to be part of EMU, 12 per cent of the workforce is unemployed in 1998, half of whom are out of work for more than a year? Against the background of growing instability in the world economy and the austerity measures already stipulated by the Maastricht convergence criteria, was concern expressed that unemployment has remained persistently high and may grow in view of the two issues I have raised? Regarding the discussions on the economic role of the EU and the global economy, what was the assessment of the Heads of State in regard to world capitalism and the world economy in the next year or two, particularly in view of the collapse of the so-called tigers in south-east Asia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, employment policy was discussed as it is a major priority for the Union. The experience across Europe has been that the absence of fiscal discipline in the past was detrimental to economic prosperity and employment. The Council was particularly anxious to ensure the stability and growth pact, negotiated here some years ago as part of the Irish Presidency, and the individual stability programmes represented the best way forward in promoting employment policies. Concern remains, however, that unemployment levels are too high and that there should be co-ordination of policies and actions, both individually and collectively, to ensure we continue to create greater numbers of jobs across the Community as well as reduce unemployment. The Commissioner for Social Affairs continually brings position papers before the Council on ways to push forward EU action employment policies. We are working to our own action plan which has been seen to be effective, but we must also examine the ideas of others and continue to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>The outlook for the future will vary because many countries will reduce their growth next year; this has been indicated in the UK, France and Germany. Other countries have maintained the <i>status quo</i> in regard to their projections for next year. Much will depend on how those countries in recession in South America, the Far East and Russia impact on the global economy. The general feeling is that the totality of the impact will be negative but we must wait and see whether multinational companies throughout the world suffer adverse effects. There will be some knock-on effect in Ireland but I hope it will not be too dramatic. We must monitor the position and continue to pursue intelligent economic policies. Most countries are waiting to see what happens in the early months of next year, although nobody is certain about the extent of the downward effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply to seven questions and hope the Chair will bear with us as we ask supplementaries. On the question of the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, was the meeting informed by the French Prime Minister that the French <Col N="450" /> National Assembly and the Senate, meeting in constitutional convocation, are unlikely to ratify the treaty until February or possibly March, that subsequent to that the role given to the European Parliament in the treaty will require its involvement and that, having regard to the fact that the last plenary session of the European Parliament will take place in the first working week in May, it is unlikely that the negotiations on the Agenda 2000 package will be formalised before 11 June when the European elections take place?  Was that political timetable discussed?  Were the consequences for member states, including Ireland, outlined or discussed by the Heads of Government present?  What contingency plans, if any, has the Taoiseach decided to put in place to ensure we do not experience budgetary problems towards the end of this calendar year when the new Parliament and Commission will come into place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to those questions. In relation to the Amsterdam Treaty, it appears that it will be some months before all countries ratify the treaty. The exact dates were not clearly outlined by either President Chirac or Premier Jospin but it seems likely we will be some months into next year before that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they refer to it at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They did, but they have never indicated the exact timetable for ratification. I and others have continually argued that we should not get into discussing institutional areas until the treaty is ratified. If we do, this will drag on for even longer.</P>
      <P>On the other question, Chancellor Schröder, the President of the Commission and everyone else emphasised at the meeting in Pörtschachthat we should complete the negotiations by Easter. That is still the view, and if anything it was reinforced even more strongly than in Paris when the then Chancellor, Mr. Kohl, set the original timetable for this during the German Presidency. For the reasons mentioned by Deputy Quinn, there is a very strong view within the Council that these matters would be best dealt with before April, thereby keeping within the timescale outlined by the Deputy. That is a wise decision, because otherwise we will not only drift into the second half of next year but realistically we will drift into 2000. That would cause enormous budgetary problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the consensus view of this informal meeting of heads of Government that the preferred timetable is to ratify Amsterdam and Agenda 2000 before Easter 1999?  That being the case, when will this House and the citizens of this Republic know what the Government's position is in relation to our proposals for reform in the complex structures of Agenda 2000?  When will the Government formally communicate its opening position on this vexed issue to the Commission <Col N="451" /> and its colleagues on the various councils?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To give an accurate assessment of the meeting, the ratification of Amsterdam and Agenda 2000 are not being joined, though the summary of Deputy Quinn's comments would still be correct some time during the summer. There is not as much focus. People want to see Amsterdam dealt with next year and are not putting that on the terms of Agenda 2000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Parliament has a role. There is a clear conflict in the timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The French are well aware of that and it was originally hoped that they would wrap it up this year. However, I told the House some months ago that I did not see that as being likely, which is how it is turning out. The French have all the time tended to want to get into other institutional issues before ratification, which makes no sense to me or to most others. That view has been clearly put by the majority of other countries.</P>
      <P>Regarding Agenda 2000, it is the view of the Council that we meet the March deadline. I strongly favour this and hope everyone else does also. In terms of our proposals and our first discussions, we will start putting forward our proposals at the General Affairs Council meeting in early December and lead on to a more detailed discussion in Vienna in mid-December. Separate discussions and working papers are being dealt with by the Commission, though I have not seen any of the preliminary or preparatory figures yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his extensive reply. I believe it is the first time a Taoiseach has volunteered information about the positions he has taken at a meeting of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did so because it is unusual for an informal meeting to put forward no conclusion whatsoever. I thought it only right to report on what we dealt with for the information of the House. There was no formal conclusion at the end of the meeting, and everyone was left to make their own point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My comment was not intended to be a criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed it and hope the Taoiseach gives the House more information on future occasions. My question relates to the debate on the legitimacy of the Union. Will the Taoiseach agree that, apart from implementing the important advances made in the Amsterdam Treaty, one of the ways in which the legitimacy of the Union could be enhanced would be to enhance the role of national parliaments in relation to positions adopted by member states in various debates at European level?  The European Parliament already has a significant role in <Col N="452" /> previewing decisions and proposals and co-decision making afterwards. Will the Taoiseach agree that a role for national parliaments, in advance of decisions being made, would enhance the legitimacy of the Union and, if so, what proposals will the Government make to achieve that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not understand the Deputy was being critical. It is better that these matters are discussed. We tend always to discuss matters about Europe after they have been completed. We discuss the reports of a particular six month period six to nine months after the event. When there are major discussions it is useful for the House to have a view. This is becoming increasingly important, unlike at the earlier part of the decade. The European Parliament and the President of the Parliament, Mr. Gil Robles, always attends and puts forward his assessment of the Parliament. I would be open to a similar type discussion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the information provided to the House on the response of the European Union, both internally and externally, to the changes taking place in the world economy, was the issue of a review of the stability and growth pact raised?  Given that in Germany there is now a social democratic party in power, along with the Greens, does the Taoiseach consider there needs to be a revisiting of what are essentially monetarist criteria established by Maastricht?  We need to review how the Union can intervene more effectively, both internally and externally, in relation to the operation of the global economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The stability and growth pact stands on its own. It is a good document and a good policy. It emphasises the experience of recent times, and perhaps during the past decade and a half, that tight fiscal stability more or less drives the success of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it would prevent, forever and a day, the dangers of the 1997 manifesto, which was a fiasco?  A 13 per cent of GDP debt problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It all started before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was all in a very bad period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather talk about the 1987 one, on which I had a direct influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the 1997 one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government came to power in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to wait a while before I had influence. The stability pact makes common sense. It is clear, even if one goes back to 1977, that it is a well managed economy with tight fiscal policies and a sensible exchange rate policy that leads to economic growth. The stability pact will stand <Col N="453" /> the test of time. I do not see why it should be changed. There are arguments about interest rate policy, on which I have already given my views. The discussions which took place in Pörtschach about interest rates were interesting but were out of order because the European Central Bank has that power. While people may talk all night about interest rate policy, they have no influence. The European Central Bank and those who appeared to challenge that have now accepted them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, did the Taoiseach formally or, more importantly, informally make any recommendation that such a person should come from Ireland?  If so, did he put forward any specific names for consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no formal discussions on that issue. It has been well publicised informally in European and Irish newspapers that there are a number of names on a short list. My views are well known to my colleagues.

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the portion of the report dealing with the possible division of the General Affairs Council, the body which deals with overall housekeeping. Does the Taoiseach regard it as appropriate, 25 years after Ireland joined the European Union, that Ministers with responsibility for foreign affairs should have a co-ordinating role for the internal operation of the European Union, having regard to the advent of the single currency and the fact that the internal market is all but completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not a contradiction, in institutional terms, in giving responsibility for the co-ordination of internal affairs to a group of Ministers and their Departments or secretariats whose focus is external to the European Union?  Did he personally express a preference which could, for example, <i>inter alia</i> assign some of the responsibilities of the GAC to either ECOFIN or a new body which would be formed by the Tánaiste and <Col N="454" /> Deputy Prime Ministers of the participating member states?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a frank discussion on that issue. I favoured the view, for, among others, the reasons mentioned by Deputy Quinn, that the workload is too great for the General Affairs Council. One example, with which the Deputy is familiar, is that under present institutional rules Agenda 2000 technically comes under the Foreign Affairs Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While Foreign Affairs Ministers are highly competent political figures in their own right, I do not really see them being able to deal with the teeth of the Common Agricultural Policy or the Common Fisheries Policy. I have long held the view, which I expressed forcibly at the meeting, that it should be split in one form or another.</P>
      <P>I supported the concept of a body comprising the Tánaiste and Deputy Prime Ministers or, if that option were not accepted, that the agenda should be split, preferably at different times of the month. I think it will end up, because of the strong lobbying by Foreign Affairs Ministers in other jurisdictions, as a two day session, with one day for external foreign affairs issues and the second for internal issues. Member states will probably have some flexibility in terms of who will represent them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Taoiseach say he is attempting to arrange a meeting with the new German Chancellor. We all fear that the change of Government in Germany might have repercussions for this country. Does the Taoiseach anticipate there will be a major reduction in the German contribution to EU funding and that Ireland may shortly become a net contributor to, rather than a major beneficiary of, the funds?  Will this change of Government in Germany constitute a grave threat to our financial situation in the EU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There will clearly be a change of emphasis in the European Council &mdash; I would mislead the House if I said that were not the case. At the last meeting Chancellor Schröder was sitting quite near me and the Italian Prime Minister, who replaced the former Prime Minister Prodi, was on my other side. There was a different emphasis on how matters will proceed and that was spelt out by the Chancellor and others. Agendas will change. This is a political issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer the Deputy's question one need not look further than the new German Government's manifesto. It is short compared to political manifestos in the European context and those with which we are familiar. The issue of own resources is prominent in it. It is no secret that the German contribution will change fundamentally. Our contribution is increasing all the time and there has <Col N="455" /> been a significant increase in it this year because of our economic growth rate. However, we are still the fourth poorest country in the Community in terms of Eurostat's figures. It is my argument, and I am sure that of anyone who attends European meetings, that we should continue to be a net beneficiary for some years to come.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Returning to the economic discussions among the Heads of State, while the majority of them are politically committed to EMU, in view of the slow growth rates in many of the countries to which the Taoiseach alluded &mdash; some of which are on the verge of recession &mdash; did he detect any nervousness that the strict Maastricht criteria on restrictions on public borrowing, budget deficits and fixed currency rates might give rise to severe tensions in the EU against a background of recession in the next few years?  When matters are going well everyone considers EMU is hunky-dory, but when there is a sudden crisis there can be a tendency for every State and the ruling elite in a nation to take to its own boat. Does the Taoiseach consider the EMU project and a common currency could come under severe strain and be blown out of the water with the onset of a world recession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not detect that. I remind Deputy Higgins that practically every country in the Community, including those who joined and did not join Euro plus, have bent every way possible in the past 12 months to ensure they can join the Euro and that they met the Maastricht criteria and adhered to the stability and growth pact. Rather than countries turning away, parties of all persuasions and coalitions of all political perspectives in Europe have tried to follow that policy. Countries appreciate there are strictures related to the Maastricht criteria and that they are not easy to meet, but the reward on meeting them is the possibility of increased economic growth and stability. The European Council, ECOFIN and other ministries hope the Euro will bring stability with the desired effect of economic growth and thereby employment in the years immediately ahead. While many countries, probably half the world, will experience an economic downturn at one stage or another, by acting in a co-ordinated way countries will build confidence and see us through that economic downturn and out the other side. Countries, particularly Euro plus countries, appreciate that the inextricable linking and fixing of their currencies in seven weeks' time, will provide an opportunity for people to live in a more confident economic climate. There are dangers involved and the system is based on discipline, but the dangers are well outweighed by the good prospects.</P>

      <P>What prospects for the current arrangements for stability and growth were under question at the summit?  The Taoiseach <Col N="456" /> indicated in his reply that he acknowledged certain things, stated certain things and that we accepted certain things. It is clear, therefore, that there were suggestions in the discussion we were not fully in agreement with and that we were putting down markers on our stance on the matter.</P>
      <P>There is a need for us to address the question of how effective the current procedures are in ensuring there is sustainable growth in the EU, both economically and environmentally, and how we deal effectively with issues arising from collapsing economies outside the EU, especially crises arising from natural phenomena in Central America. The developed world appeared to be able to produce $30 to $40 billion dollars to bail out bankers a number of weeks ago, yet the most we can produce to help Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica is a couple of hundred million pounds. There appears to be a grave imbalance in how we treat different crises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to address the broader question. I could express views on what is happening with the stability and growth pact but the Deputy did not wish to comment on that. The parts of the pact and the stability programmes under discussion were concerned with interest rates. I judged the discussion was not in order. The comments made afterwards created a stir in the markets.</P>
      <P>The issue of interest rate levels is for the European Central Bank. While the discussion was ongoing for a considerable time it has no bearing on the matter. People urged regeneration of economic activity on the basis of a quicker reduction in interest rates. They were concerned with the lower range at which rates are currently set falling further, not with the higher range, at which we were positioned. However, it is an unrealistic discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The strategic management initiative instigated a wide ranging programme of modernisation throughout the Civil Service and the public service involving both legislative and administrative action. The Office of the Attorney General is part of the general practice. For instance, the office published a statement of strategy, 1997-9 in April 1997, is subject to the Freedom of Information Act for matters of general administration and is involved in the developments relating to financial management, such as administrative budgets and the internal management of the advisory committee system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key developments relating to the office this year are the publication of the first annual report in May, the Attorney General's decision to consent to the application of the Public Service Management Act to his office with effect from 1 September-the Director General of the office is required to prepare and submit to the Attorney General a strategy statement within six months of <Col N="458" /> the coming into operation of the Act in respect of that office, and this is now in preparation; and the expected availability of the Irish Statute Book on CD ROM at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>Other developments, such as the establishment of the Statute Law Revision and Consolidation Unit within the Office of the Attorney General are in hand. Discussions between the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance about the staffing of the new unit and the overall staffing requirements of the State's drafting services are continuing.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on the Law Offices of the State was published on 24 February 1998. The Government accepted the recommendations of the review group for a study of proposals for a unified prosecution service, a separate statute law revision and consolidation unit and a consultative committee among the law offices.</P>
    <P>The membership and terms of reference of the group, which is to review the legal and organisational arrangements for the public prosecution system, were announced on 6 October 1998. The study will be carried out under the auspices of the Attorney General and the group will be chaired by Mr. Dermot Nally, former Secretary to the Government. A press release listing the membership and terms of reference of the group was placed in the Oireachtas Library and I am circulating the relevant details with this reply for inclusion in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The group will consider, <i>inter alia</i>, whether there is a continuing role for the Garda to prosecute as well as to investigate crime. It will consider whether and in what circumstances prosecutions should be conducted by members of the Garda. The secretariat for the study will be provided by the Institute of Public Administration and the group has been asked to report back to Government by mid-June next year. The group, which held its first meeting on 2 November, has invited submissions from interested individuals and organisations by 18 December.</P>
    <P>The review group recommended that a consultative committee be established, on a trial basis of two years, to promote greater liaison and communication among the law offices on issues of common interest. The committee has been established and has met twice to date. It is chaired by the Office of the Attorney General and membership includes the law officers, the Law Reform Commission and the departmental legal advisers. The following are the group's terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for taking Questions Nos. 9 to 13 together. I do not think time will permit us to address all of these matters.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement and wish to ask three specific questions. First, can he indicate when the publication on CD ROM electronic data storage of all post-1922 legislation will become available, and can he indicate the retail price of that disc?  Supplementary to that first question, can the Taoiseach indicate when pre-1922 statute legislation will become available on CD ROM?</P>
      <P>The second question relates to the integrated prosecution service. Do I take it &mdash; or is this a separate and totally unrelated question &mdash; that the Revenue Commissioners could be free to initiate and to pursue into the courts cases they wish to prosecute and will not be dependent on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> Third, can the Taoiseach indicate whether, under the Director General &mdash; that is the term the Taoiseach used, but I think he meant the Secretary General &mdash; that Department of the Attorney General can be considered to be virtually integrated in a manner similar to other Government Departments in terms of its internal operation?  Do I take it that the acceptance of the strategic management initiative, publication of annual reports and so on, means that this previously rather secretive office has now come out into the open and will be treated like other Government Departments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of strategy statements, subject to the Freedom of Information Act, for matters of general information although not for everything, financial management, the administrative budget system, the publication of an annual report and the Attorney General's decision to comply with the Public Service Management Act, the reply to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. &ldquo;Director General&rdquo; is the title used by the Office of the Attorney General. The reply to the Deputy's question about the Revenue Commissioners is also &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but I will check it to make sure.</P>
      <P>I do not have the retail price for the CD ROM, but I have seen the figure and my recollection is that it is not excessive.</P>
      <P>The first issue of the Statute Book on CD ROM will include the statutes from 1922 to 1997 and the statutory instruments from 1973 to 1997. It will be available shortly and the updated issue will be available in the middle of next year. It will contain all the Acts from 1922 to 1998 and all the statutory instruments from 1922 to 1998. It will be an entire package of material since the foundation of the State. This work is almost finished and will be finalised next summer. The cost of the project is approximately £825,000. I have no information about whether any work has been done on the pre-1922 period.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State dealt with this question on a previous occasion. The proposed retail price for law offices was ludicrously low. Having regard to the similar cost to prepare the pre-1922 legislation of approximately £1 million, the State should on behalf of its citizens recoup the cost of the first phase. It should ensure that the second phase can be financed from the sales of the first phase.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that so many important questions are being taken at the last minute and there will not be time to delve into the replies. Regarding the review group on the prosecution service, will the Taoiseach tell the House why there is only one woman member of the body from a total of 13?  Given that the prosecution service is so relevant to victims of crime and people who must seek justice in the courts, will <Col N="461" /> the Taoiseach consider appointing a representative of the consumer side of the courts service, such as Victim Support, Women's Aid or the National Women's Council?  They would represent people who suffer as a result of the prosecution service. Will the Taoiseach tell the House why it was only possible to find one woman to sit on the review group in view of the Government's professed desire to have the membership of bodies made up of 40 per cent women?</P>

      <P>I appointed independent consultants to carry out a strategic review of rail safety earlier this year. The review was undertaken by a consortium of consultants led by International Risk Management Services. It is a comprehensive report and addresses all relevant aspects of rail safety. The consultants' brief required them to consider the adequacy of Iarnród Éireann's existing safety policy, systems, rules and procedures and its arrangements for implementing safety rules and procedures on the ground. They also considered the adequacy from a safety viewpoint of the existing railway infrastructure and facilities, including track, signalling systems, rolling stock and level crossings. I have just received the report and made copies available <Col N="463" /> to Members of the Oireachtas. It has also been published.</P>
      <P>The consultants concluded that the condition of much of the track, signalling and other infrastructure was poor, while the condition of the rolling stock was on the whole satisfactory. The most serious deficiency highlighted in the report is the lack of a systematic approach to identifying safety hazards and prioritising and implementing remedial action. The consultants found that an encouraging start had been made at senior management level on implementing a systematic approach to addressing safety on the railway. They stressed the importance, however, of improving the approach to safety management on the railway and creating a safety culture that reaches every facet of the company's activities. They emphasised that safety related investment in the railway infrastructure, while necessary, will not be enough. The company also needs to tackle the management aspects of safety.</P>
      <P>The consultants estimate that a 15 year safety investment programme costing of the broad order of £590 million will be required. About £23 million of this needs to be spent immediately. This overall expenditure requirement includes about £230 million for a programme of improvements to rectify safety deficiencies in the railway infrastructure, including track, signalling, bridges and level crossings; about £60 million to improve safety management systems and £20 million per annum over the 15 year period for ongoing renewal of the permanent way.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to establish immediately a high level task force comprised of officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and CIE to prioritise recommendations on necessary rail safety expenditure requirements. This will be completed by the end of January. In the meantime CIE is to begin implementation of the report's recommendations giving particular attention to the immediate safety needs identified by the consultants. Pending consideration by the Government of the task force report, CIE has been authorised to undertake the necessary borrowings to finance the implementation of safety measures. I have also begun the process of recruiting two additional railway inspecting officers for my Department.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 7.6, page 43 of the report, refers to unreasonable risks and states that a list outlining the most urgent issues has been transmitted to the Department. Will this list be published and has there been an effective response? The Government's response to the publication of the report has been to commission another report. The Minister always seems to be one report away from action. On this occasion we have been informed that the report will be completed by the end of January. The previous report by Auther D. Little indicated that there were serious risks. Will the Minister give a commitment that the recommendation that £230 million <Col N="464" /> be provided to rectify safety deficiencies and £20 million per annum for track renewal will be implemented?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which should report within six months. I have suggested three months. This has been agreed by Cabinet. The report identifies the immediate safety needs which Iarnród Éireann has been given the go-ahead to address. I was grateful for the support from all sides of the House when we engaged in this exercise. I recall that Deputy Yates demanded that it should be an international study, completely detached from CIE, and I was glad of his support, which I was able to quote subsequently. I heard his radio interview in recent months when he said that this would be the only type of safety report in which people would have confidence. We now have such a report. It is not the case that safety is referred to in another report as the Deputy said. The review outlined that a high level group should report within six months, a term which I reduced to three months.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and I discussed the terms and remit of the review in the House and at the time I stated that if the group came up with deficiencies which demanded responses, they would be brought immediately to Iarnród Éireann's attention. A list of deficiencies was outlined, all of which related to critical situations involving various signalling measures and I will forward it to the Deputy if he requires it. This list was reported to Iarnród Éireann which has clearly responded.</P>
      <P>The implementation group will lay out, apart from the £23 million, what must be done over the entire programme. It should first home in on the initial five year period but that is for the group to identify. The report proposed a 15 year programme beginning with audits, which will be published, after six and 12 months, and annually thereafter. I accept that. This is a chance, which I commissioned with the support of all other parties and the Cabinet to conduct a total and comprehensive review of safety.</P>
      <P>An outside group has not carried out such a review in the history of Iarnród Éireann. The group examined the company, warts and all, and said that there is a very good standard of safety in our railways <i>vis-àvis</i> Europe. It then identified everything that needed to be done but the group will look at what must be done when the initial investment of £23 million is put in place. As I said to the Deputy last Saturday his party will surely be in Government over the next 15 years and have a chance to put the rest of the money in place. I can only follow my remit while in office but I am determined that this blueprint for safety will be put in place.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that she inherited a frightening legacy of neglect of our railways, based on ideological grounds that public was bad and private was good and I am glad there has been a move away from that. I congratulate her for tackling the issue head on by commissioning the scientific report, which all of us supported at the time, and on her speedy action in getting Government approval for the report and funding for its implementation so quickly after it was published and presented to her.</P>
      <P>How soon will the implementation task force be in action?  Will it give regular reports to CIE on the implementation of the report during the three month period referred to by the Minister? When will the legislation on rail safety, specified in the report, be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his decency and recognition of what has been done. The Deputy is correct that the issue was not tackled previously and I was aware that many difficult decisions would have to be taken when I commissioned the review. I do not see how one can be the Minister responsible for transport and not implement a comprehensive safety report. Again, it was a case of &ldquo;pass the parcel&rdquo; and I was left holding the parcel. However, I was glad to do it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the implementation task force. There is very little time so I hope it gets moving next week. Christmas is only two months away but CIE will be on the task force. The Deputy appears to be concerned that something might arise which would require immediate attention. We would deal with that as promptly as we dealt with the consultants' report.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the assumption that what is in the public sector is bad and what is in the private sector is good. I agree with his comments on that. I met the board of Iarnród Éireann last night and am due to meet the unions this evening. At last night's meeting it was put to me that the board needed to report a profit. I said I did not require it to report a profit but to commence implementation of the safety report. What price profit in that context?  If something arises in the implementation report which requires immediate attention &mdash; CIE will be represented on the group &mdash; and CIE has no means of financing it, the need will be financed immediately by the Government.</P>

      <Quest>if she will authorise the application by the ESB to build a 350 to 400 megawatt combined cycle gas turbine power station in order to prevent the possibility of power cuts in 2001; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals by any party, including the ESB, to construct new generating plant in the future will require an authorisation from the new commission for electricity regulation to be established under legislation which I will bring before the House in the next few weeks. I announced on 16 September last that the Government had approved the drafting of the necessary Bill to establish the independent regulatory commission. I hope the commission will be in place by early next year.</P>
      <P>I gave a detailed reply on this issue on 30 September in response to a similar question from the Deputy. A number of electricity generators, apart from the ESB, have signalled their intention to enter the Irish market under the provisions of the new electricity directive to be implemented here by February, 2000. I published a report last month on generation capacity requirements up to 2005 prepared by the ESB in consultation with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current legal situation is that the ESB requires my approval under the Electricity Supply Acts for capital expenditure on any new plant. Private sector companies who wish to enter the market require a permit from the ESB under the Electricity Supply Act, 1927. The ESB therefore, is currently in the position of operating in the <Col N="467" /> market and at the same time regulating the entry of competitors.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Attorney General to introduce a Bill to establish an independent commission for electricity regulation to oversee the electricity sector. It will operate a licensing regime for operators wishing to generate and sell electricity. It will also issue authorisations for the construction of generating stations. I hope to have the Bill ready at the end of this month and the advertisement for the position of commissioner has been published in the newspapers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to have missed the point of the question. If there is no additional generating capacity in the interim period between the appointment of the regulator and the construction of new power stations, there will be power cuts in Dublin. The ESB is planning to build a power station of the capacity it is required to provide under the 1927 Act. It should be allowed to proceed with the power station in the interim period to prevent power cuts in Dublin and elsewhere before the new regime begins to operate and new power stations are built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that point. The ESB decided, correctly, that it required an extra power plant. However, the Attorney General said authorisation could not be given in the run up to open competition. I could not authorise finance for the power station while the ESB remains the group which can allow or disallow any incoming group wishing to become involved in the electricity generation sector. That was the dilemma posed.</P>
      <P>I am aware there are genuine concerns within the ESB that power cuts will occur because the company's generating capacity will not be sufficient. The only recourse open to us is to deal briskly with the legislation, the third draft of which is currently with the Office of the Attorney General. Applicants for the job of regulator will be interviewed in the near future and we will then attempt to progress matters. The chief executive of the ESB has again raised with me his concerns about this situation. However, it must be recognised that the Attorney General has conveyed to me the legal constraints placed on me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB is not concerned that power cuts will occur, it is aware there will not be sufficient generating capacity to meet demand by the year 2001. The Minister's proposals will not allow for provision of the additional capacity before that date. Even if Members agreed to rush through the legislation, there would be a one to two year period during which there would be a shortage of electricity supplies. In such circumstances, the ESB is required under the 1927 Act to provide the generating capacity and it will be liable to pay damages to those affected by power cuts if it does not do so. The Minister's refusal to give them a mandate to provide the capacity will <Col N="468" /> have the effect of making the company liable to pay such damages.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point about the advice she received from the Attorney General and the provisions of the existing law. However, surely that law takes precedence over planned legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point. I put it to the officials from the Attorney General's office that the current law states that the ESB has the power and the duty to provide an uninterrupted supply of electricity. The Attorney General sought advice on the matter from Europe and it emerged that another law would deem me to be acting in a non-competitive nature if I gave the ESB the mandate to which the Deputy referred in the run-up to 17 February 2000.</P>
      <P>This is a real dilemma. As a solution I propose to introduce the legislation, which contains 15 heads, as quickly as possible, interview applicants for the post of regulator and select a successful candidate so that the two will combine and work can progress.</P>

      <Quest>if she will intervene in the dispute between Aer Rianta and air carriers in relation to the abolition of the landing and departure charges discount and rebate schemes which are being abolished in early 1999; and the discussions, if any, she has had with either party on the matter to date.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22381/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Aer Rianta has decided not to introduce a new cycle of discount schemes related to airport charges at Dublin Airport and that the company informed the airlines of this by letter in late September. In my view this is a prudent interim position, pending further decisions on airport charges by me. However, the benefits of the 1997 and 1998 discount schemes will continue to apply until 2003 and 2004, respectively.</P>
      <P>Last March, the European Commission sought information on these discount schemes on the grounds that they could constitute a distortion of competition. Members will recall the political event which led to that. The Commission was supplied with full information and I understand it is continuing its examination of the schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the recently enacted Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, I have responsibility for the regulation of airport charges levied on all airlines at the three State airports. In this context, I expect to receive comprehensive proposals in respect of airport charges from the board in due course. The chairman has informed me that the board has commissioned consultants, to report within two months, to assist it in formulating these proposals. In considering these proposals, I will take all relevant factors into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> I had discussions on this issue with the chairman of Aer Rianta, in the context of regular meetings, and the chief executive of Ryanair, whom I met on two occasions &mdash; once formally and once informally. I will continue to consult with Aer Rianta and the air carriers on this issue in the months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. She stated that she is awaiting a report from Aer Rianta and the consultants it commissioned which could take two months to arrive. Is she aware that Aer Lingus and Ryanair are currently planning their route development for 1999, that they will make decisions on it in December and that they may redirect some flights, planes and routes to operate out of the UK?  Is she also aware that there could be a potential loss of customers if air fares rise by £10 per ticket or a potential increase of 1.5 million passengers if low fares are maintained?  Does the Minister not agree that, in the interests of the national tourism industry, the economy and Aer Rianta, she should intervene to try to achieve, if not a mediated settlement, an interim continuation of the discount scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have authority to do so. I have such authority under an Act in this jurisdiction, but it is clear that big brother is watching us because on each occasion there is a furore about airport charges there is an intensification of queries from Europe regarding whether airlines are gaining or whether subsidies could be granted to certain airlines to underpin their operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of VAT, Aer Rianta's decision to commission a study is extremely important. We are giving consideration to the ground handling directive which also affects this issue. I received a request that an obligation be placed on carriers at Dublin Airport to put in place a wheelchair facility for those who require it. One airline charges £12 for this service and it will not allow people to use wheelchairs, regardless of their level of disability, unless they pay. That is not good enough. We are seeking to include a provision in the ground-air handling directive to resolve this problem.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have the power under Irish law to fix the charges to which Deputy Yates referred. However, I do not have the power to grant subsidies to certain airlines and not to others. To use an old cliché, the best result we can achieve will be to ensure there is a level playing field in the operation of these charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the contention that this could add £10 to the price of air fares if it is put in place?  Does she accept that, in effect, Aer Rianta holds a monopoly over operations at Dublin Airport and, in that context, she <Col N="470" /> has a special role as regulator?  Is she aware Aer Rianta maintains that, of the 27 airports it uses, Dublin is the most expensive?  Any EU problem should be seen in that context. Will the Minister intervene to encourage Aer Lingus &mdash; in which she has a clear interest &mdash; British Midland, Ryanair and other carriers using this competitive route to enter negotiations on this matter?  The Minister could act as mediator in the first instance and then decide whether she needs to intervene directly by way of regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the proposed decision of the UK Environment Agency concerning the commissioning and operation of the mixed oxide, MOX, fuel fabrication plant for Sellafield. However, it is important to recognise that UK Ministers have final decision-making powers relating to this matter. The agency has referred its proposed decision to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for their consideration as to whether they wish to direct the agency to make a different decision or to issue a further policy guidance to the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1997 and 1998 my Department made two submissions to the UK Environment Agency detailing the Government's concerns about the proposed MOX plant. In the view of the Government, <Col N="471" /> the claimed economic benefit of MOX production does not in any way outweigh the detriment to society in terms of increased risk to public health, the environment and security. Any extension of operations at Sellafield is totally unacceptable to the Government.</P>
    <P>In light of the agency's proposed decision, I have written to the relevant UK Ministers reiterating the Government's opposition to the proposed MOX plant and requesting that they overrule the agency's proposed decision for the reasons outlined in my Department's two submissions on the MOX plant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is he sure that enough is being done to resolve this matter which is of acute concern to everyone on this island, particularly those who live near the east coast?  He was reported in a newspaper as stating that we would not lie down under this issue and that we would do everything possible internationally to resolve it. Does he remember saying that?  Those remarks underline the concern of everyone in this House. As every representative in the Northern Ireland Assembly, for example, is opposed to this decision and in view of the concerns expressed by people on this island, has the Minister taken any steps to co-ordinate opposition to this decision North and South?</P>
      <P>During questions to the Taoiseach, much comment was made about the influence of the General Affairs Council. Why has the Minister not referred this matter to the General Affairs Council in view of his comments that he would do everything possible internationally to resolve it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy and all Members that this matter has been and will continue to be dealt with comprehensively. I have met and written to UK Ministers on numerous occasions. Two detailed submissions were sent to the UK Environment Agency emphasising the concerns of the people and of this and previous Governments about the installations at Sellafield and this proposed plant. They highlighted the fact that the plant would perpetuate the UK nuclear industry, particularly the UK fuel reprocessing industry, and that it would add to the multiplicity of operations at Sellafield, thereby increasing further the accident risk, which is the main concern of this Government and the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of MOX fuel will lead to more plutonium being produced and to further reprocessing of this fuel when spent. I have stated that plutonium is a dangerous substance and should not be seen or used as an energy asset. We have <Col N="472" /> said that while the bulk of the plutonium for the plant will come from THORP, there is the possibility of supplies coming from overseas sources, thus increasing the security and safety risk associated with transport. The MOX operation will result in additional radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. No waste management and disposal strategy has been identified in respect of plutonium contaminated material which will be generated from the plant. The economic case advanced for the MOX plant assumes the continuation and justification of reprocessing at THORP.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 235 <i>et al</i> of 30 September 1998 in which I stated that I had informed WaveGen Ireland, the winning applicant, that the EIOP Monitoring Committee, which includes the European Commission, had decided not to provide grant assistance from the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme for the wave energy station but that I was prepared to consider nominating the project to receive an offer of a power purchase agreement with the ESB at the bid price.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the Minister's reply and that is why I tabled a question similar to the previous one to try to win the lottery of having it answered in the House.</P>
      <P>This is the second proposal within the alternative industry programme proposed by the Government which has lost EU funding. There was a waste to energy proposal and then this innovative wind to energy proposal. Does the Minister of State agree there seems to be a less than energetic defence of the retention of funding for these proposals at EU level by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's desire to proceed with wave energy. Like him, I am enamoured with the project. Ireland as an island nation is theoretically geared to the generation of electricity using wave energy. However, my inquiries have informed me that much needs to be done with the technology.</P>
      <P>The assessment of the application to which the Deputy referred was conducted by ETSU whose report was submitted to the EIOP monitoring committee, which includes the European Commission. It supported the view expressed by its independent assessor that the wave project was more suited to a research and development programme, hence the suggestion that the technology needs to be improved. On that basis, the EIOP decided not to grant aid the programme.</P>
      <P>That said, we offered the power purchase agreement to the winning applicant, WaveGen. That is now under consideration and I hope it will proceed to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the offer the Minister of State has made to the winning entrant through the ESB for the power purchase agreement and it is to be hoped it can proceed. I accept his point about the technology being more in the area of research and development. Given that the wave energy off our coast is calculated to be sufficient to fill all our energy needs, does the Minister of State envisage or know of any programme in which research and development funds are available to develop this project from an Irish perspective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>We have examined that option and the response was that there needs to be a considerable improvement in technology. That is not to say we will leave it at that. I agree with Deputy Stagg regarding the meritorious nature of this mode of energy generation. As an island country, we are ideally positioned to proceed with it and I have discussed it with people on an ongoing basis. I hope the project will proceed. There were some legal aspects to the questions WaveGen asked us but we now have the answers and will reply to the group. Our response to the preliminary questions may generate others.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Amending schemes were drafted to give effect to the necessary restructuring of CIE's salaried staff superannuation schemes. When the previous Government thought it had dealt with the problem at the end of 1996, legal problems were identified by the Attorney General which necessitated considerable detailed attention. When those were dealt with, further difficulties were discovered at the beginning of this year which are proving complex to resolve. They are being urgently addressed by the Department, CIE and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>It is sad that people who worked for years for CIE for low wages and who are now on small pensions are awaiting their due. I hope we are nearing the end of this problem. After it was thought the initial difficulties were dealt with, further ones arose and it now seems as if primary legislation will be needed. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, hopes to introduce the Road Transport Bill before Christmas, and it is planned that an amendment will be included in that to address the issue. Deputy Michael D. Higgins has often asked the Taoiseach on Question Time about this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing that, after four and a half years of examination, the combined legal and political minds of the country cannot find a means to pay CIE workers their pensions. I am sure the Minister agrees with me on that. I was partly involved in trying to resolve the problem when I was Minister of State in the Department. Some of the people on whose behalf I worked are now dead and more will die before they receive their pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that primary legislation is now required, will the Minister find a mechanism to make payments on account without legislation pending the rectification of the scheme?  The rates of payment to the people are well known and it is legalising <Col N="476" /> them which is at issue. Can the Minister make payments on account to the people involved pending the legislation and, if so, will she do it before Christmas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it can be done legally so I will not make any commitment or give a guarantee. However, I will suggest it to my officials because the situation is sad. The people involved received low salaries and their consequent pensions are small. The problem has defeated the previous Attorney General and this one. However, it appears that, through legislation, there is a chance to resolve the problem by inserting an amendment in the Road Transport Bill. I will certainly raise the issue of payment on account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by Iarnród Éireann that rail safety is the company's main priority. I am aware of the discomfort and delays which passengers have experienced recently on the Maynooth to Dublin rail service. The Department's railway inspecting officer &mdash; there will soon be two others &mdash; has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann regarding the potential safety implications of overcrowding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment package, which was the bounty from Luas, will alleviate the current difficulties experienced by passengers. The measures being funded in the Maynooth corridor out of the £63 million include: extra rail cars, two additional services on the Maynooth line during morning and evening peak times, the doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth, resignalling of the Maynooth line and lengthening of station platforms. Iarnród Éireann has advised me that a comprehensive engineering assessment of the line between Maynooth and the city centre has been completed and additional rail cars will be in service shortly. The company will review the timetable <Col N="477" /> in early January with a view to increasing the frequency of services. Luas gave rise to much angst&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;but has produced this bounty of money. CIÉ would want to tell me the news before it tells the Deputy. I have no problem with that as I am able for it as I am for the Deputy. Quite an amount of that bounty will go to this line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an ill wind which does not blow some good. I was active in seeking that bonus from the failed Luas proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated what will happen with the line. However, the problem is one of overcrowding. If the line was made of gold this would remain the problem due to the success of the service. Is there a limit on the number of people who can be packed into a carriage or who can stand in a carriage?  My understanding is that Iarnród Éireann is suggesting it will fit as many people in as possible on suburban lines. People are fainting every morning on this train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated there will be extra services at peak times from early January. The Department's railway inspector who reports to me is discussing overcrowding with Iarnród Éireann as it is becoming an issue on main lines at peak times. I am awaiting further information from the inspector but I understand from preliminary discussions that he has been informed by the company that it operates what it says is a safe system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information. Common sense would tell one how to operate this. Iarnród Éireann is faced with the dilemma of so many people seeking to get a train. The railway inspector is continuing to talk to the company about this issue.</P>

It nearly held up the reforming of the Government but that fell through with Deputy Spring and Fianna Fáil because of her insistence on this point and my disbelief in it. That will be in my book.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg mentioned packers in a facetious way. I do not expect to see packers. I am sure the Deputy has used the underground in London and other cities. One has to squeeze in and hang on by one's bootstraps. The problem is arising on many routes and the inspector is raising this issue with Iarnród Éireann. I will come back to the House or to the Deputy with the results of these discussions.</P>

      <P>As regards question No. 129, does the Minister accept that, given her reply to previous questions and action in this area in January, the conditions on the Maynooth line, particularly as regards safety, are unacceptable by national or international standards?  Is she aware of the serious possibility of an accident between now and January which would put life and limb in danger?  Can she give the House an indication of the measures she proposes to take to make it possible for passengers to travel in reasonable safety between now and January and to provide a reasonable quality of service in terms of trains which run on time?</P>

      <P>I can convey the House's concerns to Iarnród Éireann. I do not have day to day operational responsibility for how many people travel on every train. It would not be possible for me to have such a responsibility. However, I have political responsibility which I am glad to assume and I am happy to answer appropriate questions. I will ask Iarnród Éireann to reply to Deputy Durkan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton's first question is an offshoot of Deputy Stagg's question. I do not have the facts he asked for as I did not know he was going to raise that question. However, I will reply in writing to the Deputy. The £15 million still stands. For the first time, EU money is not being matched by CIÉ money but by Exchequer money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Currie said that he is afraid to turn on the radio. I too worry constantly about safety and that is why I am determined to back this report. I would not be a proper Minister for Transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Following all party agreement on 21 October to a motion to amend the compellability of witnesses legislation and related Acts, I asked the Taoiseach last week about the introduction of legislation on the matter. He indicated that the Attorney General would communicate with the Committee of Public Accounts as a matter of urgency to facilitate the early introduction of the legislation with a view to having it enacted before the end of this session. Can he indicate when the legislation will be introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of meetings have been held on this issue which has also been discussed at Cabinet. The Committee of Public Accounts has issued proposals which will entail a number of crucial stages. The Committee wants investigations to be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General with the Committee becoming involved only when the Comptroller has completed his part of the investigation and it recommended legislative amendments to facilitate these arrangements. This matter is both novel and complex and we are trying to see how we might best proceed.</P>
      <P>I understood the Committee wanted to investigate matters; however, it is asking that powers of investigation be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General with the Committee's involvement along the way. I support the Committee in this matter. It is appropriate that committees of these Houses investigate matters such as these; however, that is not what is being requested here. We are trying to see how these proposals can be married as the manner in which they are structured resembles an agency agreement. I am not saying it will be impossible to accede to the Committee's request but we are trying to find out how it can done legally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not debating it. I am merely <Col N="483" /> trying to get an answer; when will we get firm, legislative proposals from the Government?  With respect, it was the Taoiseach who introduced the element of debate into the nature of the legislation. I remind him that the House and, in particular, the Committee of Public Accounts, resolved that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be the most effective agent of inquiry. That was the thrust of the motion agreed in this House; the Government accepted that motion without division and committed itself to producing legislation at an early date to give it effect. It seems to me the Taoiseach is now moving away from that position. Will he clarify whether the Government is committed to the early enactment &mdash; by early, I mean before Christmas &mdash; of legislation which would give effect to the motion passed on 21 October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to moving this matter forward if it is possible to do so. The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, allows committees to investigate matters and gives them the powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and admission of documents. The Committee of Public Accounts sought additional powers in that regard. I welcome that; committees of these Houses should have such powers.</P>
      <P>Members should be aware that it is the view of the Committee of Public Accounts that making such an investigation would involve a massive time commitment on the part of its Members to the detriment of their other legislative and representational duties. The Committee wishes to confer certain crucial status on the Comptroller and Auditor General and to feed in and out of the process itself. I am not sure how that can be done. I have read the reports of the Committee's legal advisers and the Attorney General's correspondence on the matter. I have also read some submissions from the Department of Finance. I am not sure at this stage how it would be possible for the Committee to feed in and out of an investigation; we must find a structure to do that. Essentially, we are being asked that a committee of the House would investigate a matter but that someone else would actually carry out the investigation with intermittent involvement from the committee. As I said it is not what I was asked in the first matter. I was asked to find a method where we can try to do this, and this is what I am doing.</P>

The proposal in the form I am receiving it is not the way forward &mdash; I thought the committee was pursuing it. However, I understand the committee's point of view that it may not have the resources or time to do things in the way it originally thought it could. I am also aware that the issue of conflict of interest arose. The answer to the question raised by the Deputy is, as soon as we can find a method, something which will hopefully happen at the meeting with the Whips this evening. The chairman of the committee, the Department of Finance, the Attorney General and the legal team for the committee have done a considerable amount of work. What we are trying to do is novel and different from what we set out to do. The House has my assurance that if we can find a legal way of doing this it will be done as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Not quite. In June, while pay negotiations were under way, Deputy McManus asked whether the cost of the pay deal would be met by savings in the Garda Vote or by a Supplementary Estimate. In my reply I said at the time that the cost would be met by a special contingency fund of the Department of Finance and that a Supplementary Estimate on the Garda Vote was not anticipated. That statement was made in good faith. Vote 4 is for increases in remuneration and is administered by the Department of Finance. It is the central contingency fund used for the funding of PCW local bargaining settlements. Vote 4 contained £84.14 million in the revised Estimate for 1998. This included a general contingency fund for the cost of settling the Garda matter as well as for the Defence Forces and craft workers' claims based on certain assessments made at the start of 1998. As the various pay negotiations progressed to a conclusion, it became clear to the Department of Finance, which has a role in these negotiations, that the contingency provision in Vote 4 would not be sufficient for all pay increases. The overrun on expenditure would require a Supplementary Estimate. The alternatives were to include the full amount in a Supplementary Estimate on Vote 4 remuneration or to include some or all of it in Supplementary Estimates for the relevant departmental votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time I made my statement to the Select Committee in June, the assumption was that <Col N="495" /> there would be no Garda Supplementary Estimate and that the additional cost of the Garda deal would be covered by the Vote 4 remuneration. However, it is now clear that a Supplementary Estimate on the Garda Vote will be required even without taking account of the Garda pay deal. The Supplementary Estimate required for the Garda Vote is £80.98 million, of which £53.5 million relates to the pay deal. The Supplementary Estimate on the Garda Vote has to be taken this month or the Vote will be exhausted. I understand that regardless of the Garda pay deal a Supplementary Estimate will be required but the Minister for Finance does not propose to take it until early December. In the circumstances it was agreed, between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Finance that the full amount of the pay deal should be included in the Garda Supplementary Estimate with a corresponding reduction made in the remuneration Supplementary. It should be pointed out that whether the cost of the Garda pay deal is included in the remuneration Supplementary or the Garda Supplementary, the total amount of additional funding required will be the same.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the House about the issue of regionalisation. Regionalisation for Structural Funds purposes has already been subject to discussion in this House through parliamentary questions to the Taoiseach and myself and through Adjournment debates in both this House and the Seanad. Officials of my Department have also appeared on this issue before the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs. It is nonetheless most appropriate that the House should consider an issue of central concern to all Deputies, urban and rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> However, before dealing with the issue of regionalisation for Structural Funds purposes, I wish first to set out the background at European level for the House. Last March the European Commission unveiled its Agenda 2000 proposals. These proposals basically had a twin focus: first, to set out the Commission's proposals as to the income and expenditure of the Union for the period 2000 to 2006; second, to put forward proposals for the Union's common policies over that period consistent with the 2000-2006 budget proposals and against the background of prospective enlargement to the east.</P>
    <P>Agenda 2000 is based on a number of key principles which are important to recite. First, a tight fiscal regime is to operate at European level over the period to 2006. Reflecting this, the ceiling on member state contributions is proposed to remain at 1.27 per cent of the Community's GNP. All costs, including these arising from enlargement, are to be met from within this parameter. Whilst Ireland has accepted retention of the 1.27 per cent ceiling as a working hypothesis for the negotiations, we have queried if it will be sufficient to meet expenditure demands, especially after enlargement. Realistically, however, it is most unlikely that further spending will be facilitated by a relaxation on the receipts side. Apart from the concerns of net contributors &mdash; which I will address presently &mdash; it would be inconsistent for the European Union which, in the context of economic and employment policy, is urging fiscal restraint on member states, to embark on a course at European level contrary to this prescription without clear cause.</P>
    <P>A second key principle of Agenda 2000 is to concentrate Structural Funds assistance, especially at Objective One level, on the poorest regions of the Community. This concentration principle means for example that the Commission is resolutely determined to rigidly enforce the 75 per cent of GDP criterion for Objective One eligibility. Concentration is a principle that the member states support and, indeed, it is one from which we have benefited in the past. This principle does, however, have implications for Ireland's negotiating position in that it highlights the central and key truth of this issue.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether we regionalise, Ireland, because of its own exceptional economic performance, faces a serious drop in overall Structural Funds receipts over the next round.</P>
    <P>In 1997 Ireland received about £2,500 million of EU receipts broken down as £1,520 million under the CAP and £980 million of Structural and Cohesion Funds. Our EU budget contribution was £514 million leaving Ireland as an EU net beneficiary to the extent of 4.1 per cent of GDP. Ireland's net beneficiary position has fallen from a level of 6.6 per cent of GDP in 1991 to an estimated 3.3 per cent of GDP this year. Whilst Ireland will continue to be a net beneficiary under Agenda 2000, by 2006 the combination of drastically reduced Structural Funds transfers and increased Exchequer contributions will mean the <Col N="497" /> gap between our receipts and contributions will have sharply narrowed. With present indications and trends, and assuming enlargement goes ahead as planned, Ireland is likely to become a net contributor during the financial perspective beginning in 2007. Before that, the Union will have to deal with what could be the most intractable issue of the current negotiations &mdash; the so-called net imbalances of some member states. Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden claim they are saddled with excessive net contributions to the EU budget and want remedial action to be taken in the context of the overall Agenda 2000 negotiations. The UK already has a rebate system which effectively means it pays only one-third of its share of the cost of additional EU expenditure.</P>
    <P>The European Commission recently produced a report on the issue of net imbalances which put forward some options for dealing with the situation if there was a political consensus that action was necessary. From an Irish viewpoint, the most unfavourable of these options was one which would provide for 25 per cent national co-financing of part of CAP expenditure. This could cost Ireland some 200 mecu by 2006 and both I and the Minister for Agriculture and Food have voiced strong opposition in principle to the idea. The Government will be extremely vigilant to protect Ireland's interests on this issue. As a major net beneficiary, albeit declining in terms of receipts, proposals which target the expenditure side of the budget would hit Ireland disproportionately and compound the difficulties we already face in regard to the Agenda 2000 proposals on CAP and Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Government is prepared to listen to the case made by the net contributors and to explore the options put forward, especially in regard to the basis for calculating contributions. The final deal we agree in regard to Structural Funds and CAP will be influenced by what, if anything, transpires in relation to the issue of alleged excessive net imbalances. The House should note the linkage between all these issues.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the considerations arising in relation to regionalisation, I firmly reject the notion that, if the Government decides to apply for regionalisation, it would somehow reflect an unrealistic approach by Ireland in the negotiations at EU level. Apart from the strong justification on its own merits for regionalisation, the reality is that Ireland's stance to date in the Structural Fund negotiations has been grounded in realism. We have accepted the inevitability of a reduction in Structural and Cohesion Fund receipts and have not advanced unreasonable proposals to mitigate this such as relaxation of the 75 per cent of GDP threshold rule or increases in the proposed Structural Funds envelope. We are, however, fully justified, if we so decide, in putting forward proposals that will facilitate more balanced regional economic growth and assist those regions of Ireland which are lagging behind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> The issue of regionalisation for Structural Funds purposes is before Government on foot of a memorandum for Government and an accompanying paper prepared by my Department. The paper has also been the subject of consideration by the Ministers and Secretaries General Group on EU policy.</P>
    <P>The House will understand I cannot anticipate the outcome of the Government's decision on the issue. However, this opportunity allows me to comprehensively brief the House on the facts in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a whole, is currently treated for Structural Fund purposes as one single NUTS II region under Objective One. NUTS II regions, which are established by Eurostat, the Commission's statistics agency, for various statistical purposes, are also used for the purpose of determining eligibility for Objective One assistance. Objective One assistance channels Community support to the most disadvantaged regions of the Union which are lagging behind economically. The criterion for Objective One eligibility is for a region to have a <i>per capita</i> income in GDP terms below 75 per cent of the Community average. Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> now well exceeds this figure. Accordingly, Ireland as a whole no longer qualifies for Objective One status.</P>
    <P>Ireland has long pointed out in Brussels that GDP indicators tend to exaggerate our economic progress and that GNP would be a far more reliable guide to our relative wealth. The divergence between GDP and GNP indicators, relatively marginal in other member states, is substantial in Ireland's case. This approach has, however, won no support from other member states or from the Commission. In any event, Ireland's <i>per capita</i> GNP, expressed as a percentage of the EU average, has been over 75 per cent for several years.</P>
    <P>There has been some recent comment to the effect that GDP <i>per capita</i> is not a good indicator of regional disparities and comparative levels of poverty. No doubt, there may be some validity in these comments but they are not relevant in this context. The fact is that the indicator chosen for Objective One status must be one which commands support and acceptance across the European Union. GDP <i>per capita</i> meets this requirement and in the negotiations to date there has been no pressure by any member state to open up this issue.</P>
    <P>If the eligibility requirements for Objective One assistance were strictly applied, Ireland as a single region would simply not qualify for Objective One status under the next round. However, the European Commission in its Agenda 2000 proposals recognised it would be undesirable for a region to be suddenly cut off from Objective One assistance. The Commission, therefore, proposed that regions like Ireland should be given transition status, whereby Objective One assistance, albeit at a gradually diminishing level, would still be available. In practical terms, this <Col N="499" /> would mean that a region in transition would experience a progressive reduction in EU funding over the period of the next Financial Perspective, that is the years 2000 to 2006. Initially, a region in transition from Objective One would enjoy full Objective One benefits. From then on, a gradual reduction in support levels would occur until, by the year 2006, lower levels of Objective Two-type funding are reached.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious that certain sub-regions of the country at the NUTS III regional level, the next level of statistical mapping below the NUTS II configuration, have not performed as well as the rest of the country in terms of GDP growth. In particular, the sub-regions of the Border, the west and the midlands currently have a <i>per capita</i> GDP of less than 75 per cent of the EU average and are likely to be below 75 per cent for the reference period to be used for the next round of Structural Funds. It is estimated that GDP for Ireland as a whole increased by 21 per cent in the period 1991-1995, as compared with increases in the regional authority areas of the west, Border and the midlands over the same period of only 13 per cent to 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>These divergences in economic growth are reflected in the significant regional changes in population distribution that has occurred over the past 30 years or so. For example, the combined regional authority areas of Dublin and the mid-east have seen their proportion of the national population rise from 34 per cent to 39 per cent. For the same period, the combined population of the regional authority areas of the west, Border and midlands has fallen as a proportion of the overall population from 30 per cent to 27 per cent. A similar pattern of lagging-behind is illustrated by the regional breakdown of grant-aided job-creation over the years 1995-1997. When we look at the figures, we find that just over 77 per cent of the grant-aided jobs created were in that part of the country which would constitute the region in transition, while less than 23 per cent of grant-aided jobs created went to the west, Border and midlands regional authority areas.</P>
    <P>The imbalance in economic growth, population distribution and job-creation, combined with the fact that the west, Border and midlands have a <i>per capita</i> GDP below 75 per cent of the EU average, gives rise to the possibility of seeking to adopt a regionalisation approach to the next round of Structural Funding. In the context of the Commission's proposals and the position that parts of the country were lagging behind, it was incumbent on me to consider the possibility of seeking to adopt a regionalisation approach to the next round of Structural Funding.</P>
    <P>Under the most straightforward regionalisation approach, the existing single region of Ireland would be reconstituted as two new regions, of which one could consist of those regional authority areas whose <i>per capita</i> GDP is below 75 per cent of the EU average. If such an approach were put in place, the region with a <i>per capita</i> income <Col N="500" /> below 75 per cent of the EU average would qualify for full Objective One status, while the rest of the country would still be a region in transition for Objective One funding.</P>
    <P>This proposition, if decided upon by the Government and accepted by EUROSTAT, would mean that a region comprising the west, Border and midlands regional authority areas would qualify for full Objective One status and thereby obtain a higher level of Structural Funds than if it were part of a single region in transition. Such a region would also potentially qualify for Structural Funds transition arrangements after the year 2006. It should also qualify for a better State aids regime for attracting new industry for the years 2000-6 than it would if it were in transition.</P>
    <P>This last point is a very significant one. Under the State aid rules, an Objective One region should also qualify for a higher level of assistance by way of industrial grants from national agencies e.g. IDA industrial promotion grants. This is in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to bring about the targeting of those sub-regions of the country which, despite Ireland's recent economic progress, are lagging behind. The development of an economic base for the future in these areas would, therefore, be facilitated.</P>
    <P>I must stress that the scope for geographical reclassification is limited. The regional classification operates on an EU basis. The NUTS classification system entails the combining of successively larger units to form regions at various levels. Any new regions at NUTS II level &mdash; the reference regime for Objective One status &mdash; must be generally in line, as regards population and size, with the norm across the EU. Its components must also be geographically contiguous. This means that the option of designating micro-regions, such as poverty blackspots within regions and cities, to avail of Objective One funding for those particular areas is not available. In any case, if it were possible to direct Objective One assistance to relatively poor urban micro-regions, very wealthy areas of the Community, such as the cities of London, Paris or Hamburg, would be able to seek Objective One status for their urban blackspots. This would dissipate the overall allocations for Objective One assistance, and would reduce the amount available for Ireland, whether under transition arrangements or for a region enjoying full Objective One status.</P>
    <P>Consideration could be given to including some adjoining counties in the new NUTS II region with Objective One status. This would, however, involve consequential changes at the next level, NUTS III, which might not be acceptable to EUROSTAT and might also endanger qualification for Objective One status by breaching the 75 per cent GDP threshold.</P>
    <P>I would stress that if a part of the country were to qualify for Objective One as a result of the proposed reclassification, this would not mean that the rest of the country would be treated any <Col N="501" /> less favourably than it would have been anyway under the transition regime currently proposed for Ireland as a single region. The Government will insist that the non-Objective One part of the country would qualify fully for the transition regime, and we have no reason to believe differently. Consequently, if one region in Ireland qualifies for full Objective One assistance, the other region will qualify for the transition regime currently on offer for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Overall, there will be a substantially lower <i>per capita</i> transfer of Structural Funds in the next round to Ireland as compared with the current round. In addition, any region in Ireland which receives Objective One status will not achieve the same <i>per capita</i> transfer of Structural Funds as Ireland as a whole received in the current round. This reflects the improved economic performance of the country at national and regional level as compared with the European average in recent years. More specifically, being below 75 per cent of GDP for a region is not the sole factor as regards shareout. Other criteria are equally important. In the final analysis, the levels of assistance going to a region are determined by reference to its population, relative prosperity and unemployment levels. In regard to the latter, for instance, Ireland's unemployment rate and the unemployment rate of any prospective Objective One region in Ireland are significantly below the levels of unemployment in some of the more populous Objective One regions elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>In summary, the arguments for regionalisation are compelling. The new Objective One region would continue to receive full Objective One assistance over the period and, therefore, more Structural Funds. It would also have access to a better State aids regime and potential access to transition after 2006. The other region would enjoy transition status as it would if the country were treated as one region. There is, in my view, no downside to the proposal.</P>
    <P>In the event of a regionalisation approach being adopted, the regional administrative framework may require adjustment. Such adjustment as is necessary will be the subject of discussion with the Commission and will take account of the views of the regional interests. A major consideration in this general regard is that the efficient and effective administration and management of Structural Funds spending, for which Ireland enjoys a just reputation, must not be jeopardised, particularly in the coming period of declining overall assistance from Europe. Notwithstanding this, the Government would, I believe, be prepared to give any new regional structures a real role in the preparation, management and monitoring of the regional components of the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the linkage between regionalisation and the efforts being made to tackle the problems of social exclusion, particularly as they affect disadvantaged urban areas, the so-called urban blackspots. In this context, it <Col N="502" /> is important to place the role of Structural and Cohesion Funds in perspective. In 1998 total gross public expenditure will be £16 billion, of which £.2 billion or 7.5 per cent is expenditure co-financed by the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Of this £16 billion, £11 billion will be spent in the general area of social expenditure. Of this amount, approximately £244 million, or 2 per cent, is cofinanced by the Structural Funds. Regionalisation will have absolutely no implications for the vast bulk of this expenditure, including the major areas of social expenditure such as social welfare payments, £4.9 billion in 1998; public health expenditure, £2.9 billion in 1998; and local authority housing, £244 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>Urban disadvantage and poverty are closely linked in three ways: first, there is a higher risk of poverty in disadvantaged urban areas; second, residents of disadvantaged urban areas experience cumulative disadvantage in terms of long-term unemployment, educational disadvantage and social isolation; third, the quality of life in disadvantaged urban areas is significantly inferior to that in more affluent areas in terms of crime levels, drugs, environmental conditions and socio-economic features such as access to banks, shops, local business activity and recreational amenities.</P>
    <P>Under the current round, the specific EU-assisted programmes and initiatives which relate directly to tackling the problems of poverty and social exclusion are the human resources operational programme, the local urban and rural development programme and the urban initiative. These programmes fund a number of very important schemes in the area of social exclusion, including training for early school leavers and the long-term unemployed, local enterprise development through the county enterprise boards, integrated development of disadvantaged areas through the partnerships and community groups and urban regeneration in particularly poor parts of Dublin and Cork through the URBAN initiative.</P>
    <P>With regard to the URBAN initiative, I should mention that the Commission does not propose the retention of this initiative in the next round. Ireland has expressed concern in the negotiations that the type of schemes and projects assisted by URBAN in this round should not be neglected and we are calling for the retention of the URBAN initiative after 1999.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the bulk of the expenditure under these programmes in the current round occurs in what would be the region in transition next time round, I would stress that this region will have access to the same transition regime currently on offer for the whole country.</P>
    <P>Regionalisation of itself will not have a significant impact on the priority to be attached in the next National Development Plan to these programmes. Human resource development and social inclusion &mdash; particularly in urban blackspots &mdash; will remain priorities, along with improvements in infrastructure and general economic <Col N="503" /> development in both regions. However, the balance between these priorities will necessarily reflect the particular profiles of the regions e.g. measures to tackle disadvantaged urban areas would receive a greater emphasis in the region in transition.</P>
    <P>More generally, in the formulation of the National Development Plan for the post-1999 period, I would stress that measures with an objective of tackling social exclusion will continue to receive special consideration. Proposals will be considered with particular reference to reducing long-term unemployment by securing increased job placement; discouraging early school leaving, the primary cause of long-term unemployment; addressing adult illiteracy; and tackling the problems of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the general preparations for the National Development Plan 2000-2006 in the context of regionalisation. The National Development Plan will seek to consolidate and build on our progress in economic and social cohesion through programmes which will aim to enhance our economic potential; contribute to continuing growth in sustainable employment and to the reintegration of the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming so into the economic mainstream; and contribute to a balanced geographic distribution of economic activity which is consistent with maximising national economic growth.</P>
    <P>As part of the plan preparations, the ESRI has been engaged to carry out an <i>ex ante</i> evaluation of investment priorities for the next round, including a separate assessment of the submissions from the various interests and Departments. The ESRI has been asked as part of its evaluation to review international and other developments which might be critical for Ireland's economic growth in the 2000-6 period and to quantify the levels of investment required to close the gap in key areas of infrastructure relative to move developed regions of the Community. In keeping with the Government's commitment to meet the needs of less developed areas in Ireland, the ESRI evaluators have also been asked to provide an assessment of the strategies which are likely to be successful in achieving a more balanced spatial distribution of economic activity in Ireland consistent with maximising national economic growth.</P>
    <P>The plan is being developed in partnership with regional authorities and social partners. To date submissions for the plan have been received from all regional authorities, relevant Departments and most of the social partners. These submissions are currently under consideration in my Department, which will be engaging in due course in further consultations on these submissions with the regional authorities, the main social partners and Departments.</P>
    <P>In the event of a regionalisation approach being adopted, the new regional structures for any new regions in Ireland will be involved in the <Col N="504" /> overall process of formulating the next national plan. They will also have a crucial role in monitoring and managing the regional components of the CSF subsequently agreed with the Commission. This will provide for regional interests to have a more strategic input into the delivery of Structural Funds assisted investment. These new structures would also enhance co-ordination across the current regional authority boundaries, thereby helping to maximise the value of Structural Funding.</P>
    <P>Discussions will also be held with the appropriate Northern Ireland authorities to explore and develop the potential for cross-Border co-operation. The nature and extent of these consultations will be influenced by broader developments in relation to the peace process. The proposals of the Border Regional Authority and the submissions from other interested parties in relation to the potential for North-South co-operation will be taken into consideration in any consultation which will take place in this regard.</P>
    <P>The final shape of the National Development Plan will be governed by Ireland's shareout of Structural and Cohesion Funds and the decision on regionalisation. In the event of regionalisation, each region will have its Structural Funds allocation ringfenced. The plan will have to take full account of national priorities and expenditure in the regions will have to support this. The Government will also have to consider the appropriate level of plan investment and the funding of this investment against a background of declining EU Structural Funds. Our budgetary position means that Ireland is now strongly placed to meet this situation. As long as we continue with the prudent policies which have played a major part in securing the economic growth of recent years, we should have the resources to make good the reduction in EU aid for the country as a whole. In any event, the declining importance of Structural Funds in co-financing public expenditure in the next round will mean that allocation of assistance from the funds should not distort overall public expenditure priorities.</P>
    <P>I wish to nail a number of erroneous contentions regarding regionalisation. Regionalisation would not adversely affect the region in transition by comparison with the single region in transition option. It would not adversely affect the Government's discretion to deal with the problem of urban blackspots. The Government cannot unilaterally define regional boundaries, nor incorporate elements as regards eligibility for Objective One status. On the positive side, regionalisation would guarantee full Objective One status and more funding, as opposed to transitional arrangements, for the region that qualifies; regionalisation should enable that region to enjoy a more favourable State aids regime than if it were part of a region in transition; and regionalisation will leave open the potential for the region to qualify for transition under Objective One in the years after 2006.</P>
    <P>The negotiations ahead at European level will <Col N="505" /> be tough and complex and are likely to continue for at least several more months. The European Council in Cardiff last June did not involve substantive conclusions on Structural Funds. While the European Council in Vienna next December can be expected to advance the negotiations, it is unlikely that any final agreement will be reached before the target date of next March.</P>

      <P>When the Government agreed to this series of statements in the House, Members were universally pleased. This House is one of the most pro-European Parliaments in Europe and Members fully appreciate the dramatic economic improvements that have occurred since we joined the European Union. Members particularly appreciate the improvements which have taken place in our infrastructure as a result of the major transfers of funds from the European Union to Ireland, particularly in the form of Cohesion and Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>No matter how buoyant our economy is all Members would be worried at the prospect that the flow of Structural Funds would slow down and eventually stop. Members would accept any coherent Government strategy which would protect the flow of Structural Funds during a transitional period to the year 2006, which would guarantee some modest flow of funds to the country after that date.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that such an important debate is taking place under a cloud of indecision and misinformation. It is the Government's job to govern. In matters such as negotiating future tranches of Structural Funds, the responsibility is entirely that of the Government, not that of this House. Yet as we participate in this debate, the Government has not put its cards on the table. We do not know what strategy it intends to follow and all members of Government from the Taoiseach down have deliberately sought to disguise their intentions on this matter. This debate would be far more fruitful if the Government put its cards on the table and informed the House of the present position and what decision it has taken, if it has taken one. It is holding back information and this debate is diminished as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a lengthy reply to parliamentary questions on Wednesday, 14 October 1998, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, informed the House that the Government is currently considering the option of an approach to Eurostat, the Commissioners' statistical office, with a view to having Ireland reclassified from its present single region status. That is a fairly circuitous statement. That paragraph was taken from the document on the word processor and included as a key element in <Col N="506" /> the Minister's speech today, one month later. The Minister further informed the House in that reply that he had a memorandum and an accompanying paper prepared by the Department of Finance before the Government and that he could not anticipate what decision the Government might take. He repeated that today in exactly the same terms. The Minister's attitude, as distinct from that of the Government, is clear from that reply. He favours dividing the country into two regions, one consisting of the regional development areas of the west, the midlands and the Border counties and the second consisting of the remainder of the country. The Minister for Finance envisages that Objective One status would apply to the first region, that additional Structural Funds would accrue to that region between now and 2006, particularly between 2002 and 2006, and that reduced Structural Funds would be available to that region after 2006. The Minister also envisages a gradual reduction in Structural Funds for the remainder of the country, whose status would be that of a region in transition.</P>
    <P>Reading between the lines of the Minister's reply it is clear he envisages significant additional Structural Funds would be available to the country as a whole by following that particular negotiating strategy. That reply was given on 14 October and one month later, as far as we can confirm &mdash; it was confirmed in the Minister's speech &mdash; the Government has not moved forward one inch and continues to disguise its intentions.</P>

      <P>A month later the Minister repeated in the same terms what he said on 14 October. We can take it that his memorandum and accompanying paper is still before Government and that the Government has not made a decision.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today of a meeting in Cork on 16 October between the Taoiseach and EU Commissioner Wulf-Mathies. Despite the fact that the Commissioner could not confirm to him that additional Structural Funds would be available, even if the Government followed the regionalisation policy implied in the statement by the Minister, the Taoiseach chose not to reveal this information to the House when answering questions on 20 October. Not only did he not inform the House of the Commissioner's view but he proceeded to imply that extra Structural Funds would automatically be available if the regional strategy were followed.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to close down the shutters on this issue. Despite the fact that the Department of Finance listed ten documents or papers which have been produced, requests to disclose them under the Freedom of Information Act have been refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> The Government is responsible for negotiating the next package of Structural Funds. We would have a far more fruitful debate if it had already made a decision and the House knew where it stood. It is a normal procedure for other Governments to take the views of their parliaments before making a decision, However, in this House it is a procedure more honoured in the breach than in the observance. Nevertheless, the House cannot be used as a sounding board if the Government does not lay before it the information it has to enable Members form a view and if the Taoiseach misleads the House when he is asked for information in the form of parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>What is happening today is an exercise in political cuteness, which is becoming the hallmark of the Government. Members of the House, and the Opposition parties, are being asked to take a position in advance of a Government decision while it holds back documents on which it will be made. The Government must think we on this side of the House are dim-witted if it believes we are going to fall into that trap while it holds back and uses the agencies of the State to refuse to give information which should be put before the House.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the amount of Structural and Cohesion Funds to be paid to Ireland will be reduced over the next eight years. While these funds have been a significant factor in the recent social and economic advances made by the country, their impact should not be exaggerated, although if they were suddenly cut off from the Exchequer the impact of a hard landing would be significant. Nevertheless, the country can now cope with reduced funds from 2002 and can, I hope, eventually cope with their phasing out. However, we have received a great deal of money and we would like to maintain as much of the flow as we can.</P>
    <P>I understand we receive approximately £1 billion per year in Structural Funds at present. Members of the Rainbow Government, in which I had the honour to participate, believed this would be reduced to approximately £700 million per year in the period 2002-6 and if this amount was to be enhanced or if significant funds were to be attracted after 2006 a change on the basis of the allocation would have to be negotiated.</P>
    <P>In his statement to the House today, and in his reply to which I referred, the Minister indicated he saw no hope of renegotiating the basis on which Structural Funds will be drawn down. He explained that in the first instance, the basis of Objective One status was purely statistical. A country or a region was eligible if Eurostat stated that the <i>per capita</i> income of the region in GDP terms was below 75 per cent of the Community average. Since the Republic of Ireland, which has always been treated as a single region in terms of Objective One status, has now an average <i>per capita</i> income which far exceeds this the country as a whole is no longer eligible for Objective One <Col N="508" /> status and if any part of the country were to continue to maintain Objective One status a regionalisation policy would have to be followed.</P>
    <P>The Government appears to be resigned to making no attempt to renegotiate the basis on which Structural Funds and Objective Status is decided. Yet, on Friday, 15 November 1996, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, speaking at a two day seminar on Structural Funds at Ballyconnell, County Cavan stated:</P>
    <P>The focus of Structural Funds will be shifted from infrastructure and road building from which Ireland has benefited significantly, to unemployment, which has been identified as one of the most pressing concerns for the Irish Presidency. The new focuses will be job creation as the paramount objective; competitiveness and development of small and medium enterprises; research and development and a labour force qualified in future technology; environment and sustainable development; and equal opportunities.</P>
    <P>He remarked that one of the areas of major focus would be territorial pacts and that Ireland was one of the first countries to introduce such pacts. He also pointed to a pilot project amalgamating 11 Dublin partnerships from Tallaght to Blanchardstown. The groups would work more closely together as well as liaise with other groups across the EU.</P>
    <P>EU Commissioner Wulf-Mathies also spoke at the seminar. She did not demur from the views expressed by Deputy Quinn and confirmed that there would be no immediate fall-off in funding when the next series of Structural Funds was negotiated post 1999. I can find no reference by anybody in the Government to a renegotiation of the basis on which Structural Funds are allocated along the lines suggested by the then Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Minister believes that the criteria for Objective One status are narrow and non-negotiable. Only regions approximating to the size of regional development authorities may be considered. Regions would have to be contiguous and individual poverty black spots, of which there are approximately 170 in the country, could not be included if they fell outside areas to which the total criteria applied.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us of all this on 14 October. The only significant movement he made today is his definition of &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo;, which would now, with a nod in the direction of south County Kerry and County Wicklow, include adding counties on an individual basis. I presume the Minister drafted this part of his script himself. It did not emanate from Brussels if measured against the criteria which he outlined on the last occasion he addressed the issue in the House.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why an approach advocated by the previous Minister for Finance on behalf of the then Government has been abandoned by the Government without any explanation being offered. If, of course, the ten documents <Col N="509" /> in the Department of Finance in which this issue is discussed were put before the House we might discover the answer to this question.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that national policy must be framed so that all areas of the country and persons who live in them may prosper equally. At present, despite the boom conditions in the economy, there are great disparities of wealth, income and living standards in the country. There are also huge disparities in the opportunities available to citizens for reasons almost always beyond the control of individual citizens.</P>
    <P>The Government must deal with the issue of Structural Funds in the best interests of the country as a whole and of all its citizens. If, as media reports of the last 24 hours suggest, no additional advantage or no additional money will be gained whether the country is regionalised or not then this debate is much ado about nothing. In addition, if, as Commissioner Wulf-Mathies has stated, there is no possibility of Northern Ireland retaining Objective One status post 1999, then those negotiating the North-South bodies arising from the British-Irish agreement will shortly find themselves facing in two directions.</P>
    <P>If, however, the Commissioner is wrong in her estimation of the outcome of the negotiations and if regionalisation delivers significant additional funds, as the Minister seems to claim, without adversely affecting either the rest of the country or cross-Border relationships that is the way to go. It is, however, very difficult to make a judgment on this matter when the Government is not stating its position clearly, when it is refusing to make a decision and when it is deliberately withholding relevant information from the House.</P>

      <P>I am bitterly disappointed that the Government had not the courage to make a political decision. For the past number of weeks we have been told that the decision would be made on the following Tuesday. The Tuesdays are running out, and we are near the end of the year. I am sorry the Minister for Finance has left the House, but I am glad his officials remain. The Government gave a commitment in its programme for Government that the west, the midlands and the Border regions would have Objective One status. Objective One status can only be got for the Border, the midlands and the west because of our GNP, and the rest of the country got Objective One status in the last round because of the west. What have the begrudgers against the west?  The west is entitled to Objective One status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government will have the courage to make the right decision next Tuesday or the Tuesday after, or whenever it makes the decision. The case has been made and the figures proven. We are entitled to Objective One status, but the officials in the Department do not want regionalisation. Who is running the country, the officials or the Minister?  Members of the Dáil are elected. The Government was elected and it gave <Col N="510" /> a commitment to the people of the west that the west would get Objective One status. The Government should honour that commitment. Forty thousand farmers marched in Dublin last week and there will be 120,000 people from the west outside the gates of Leinster House if we do not get Objective One status and nothing in this city will move for the next six months. We will camp outside this House until we get our rights.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should keep her mouth shut. She will have her chance to speak later. The only time the Deputy acknowledged the west was when she came down to collect. She should not annoy me this evening. Her father, who is in Brussels, was against Objective One status when the Government was against it. When the Government came on side, he came on side. I have always been supportive of Objective One status. I am for the people of the west. The Government gave a commitment and we want that commitment honoured. We do not want shilly-shallying with one message one day and another the next.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister sent out a message, and I never saw rabbits running to their burrows as fast as members of this party did yesterday when that Minister insulted the farmers of the west. Deputy Cooper-Flynn got the message because she was quick enough to say one thing on the radio in Mayo and another in the Dáil. When I joined Fine Gael I said what I thought about the people of the west. I tell the truth. Some people in Fine Gael do not like that, but I tell them what I think because I represent the people of the west and nobody else.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, should bring that message to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. The Minister has a cold, but he will have a worse cold if he does not grant Objective One status to the west. The Minister should keep his word. He went into Government under the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>To Deputy Proinsias De Rossa I say that we in the west have suffered for enough years. Why does he not leave us alone on this occasion. If there are a few pounds to be got, let us get it and leave us alone. We are only asking for fair play. This is our last chance. Dublin received two rounds of Structural Funds. This is our chance. It is now or never for the survival of the west. I hope that if we have to march through the lobbies against the Government in protest at not having received Objective One status, Deputy Beverley Cooper-Flynn will join us.</P>

      <P>The issue of regionalisation of the country for the next round of EU funding has received much coverage in recent weeks. However, it has all been very vague, and this uncertainty is now epitomised by the most recent <Col N="511" /> reports, the claim that regionalisation will not bring in one extra penny.</P>
      <P>In reply to a Dáil question on 14 October the Minister for Finance stated that if, based on the qualification criteria for Objective One status, Ireland was reclassified and if this was accepted by Eurostat, a region comprising the west, Border and midlands would qualify.</P>
      <P>He also stated that these areas would qualify for a better State aid regime for attracting new industry for the years 2000 to 2006 than they would if they were in transition. Other than this, we do not have much more information, and, almost one month later, the Government is less forthcoming than before as it seeks to let others make the decision for it. Most people here are in favour of maximising the grant aid we can get from Europe. However, this is a simplistic approach, and until such time as all the pay-offs and balances are known, it is not possible to make an informed judgment.</P>
      <P>What might those pay-offs be?  We have benefited greatly from our membership of the EU and yet we will not make the most minuscule contribution to its security. To date our European neighbours have looked upon us in a favourable light. Now that we have made progress, will this perception change if we are seen to &ldquo;play around&rdquo; with regions just to maximise funding. More important, having spent three generations trying to neutralise a man-made boundary between North and South, are we now going to create one between east and west to add half-pence to the pence.</P>
      <P>Every Member can make a good case for the region he or she represents. Statistics tell us what we want them to. I represent the mid-east, and the perception is that it is well off. Parts of it are well-off, but it has areas that are as poor as other regions. The mid-east has received the lowest share of Cohesion/Structural Funding in the current round. The mid-east region has both the highest rate of net inward population migration and natural increase. There is a clear divide between its eastern parts linked to the Dublin metropolitan areas and the outer periphery which is more typical of the midlands and other regions. In addition the high rate of urbanisation is not without its growing pains and its infrastructural and human resource needs. While the proposal to regionalise the country for the next round of funds looks right in theory, it fails to take into account that there are areas of deprivation and marginalisation in other regions. Until such time as this Government puts all the proposals and measures on the table it is not possible to make an informed judgment.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that we are having this debate in a vacuum. Most of us expected that we would have a Government decision and would be able to react accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread familiarity throughout the country with the consequences of Objective One <Col N="512" /> status, regionalisation or Objective One in transition. All Members can make a good case for the inclusion of their own region, but the bottom line is that, in terms of potential economic development, we cannot accept a two-tier system. I attended a public meeting in north-west Duhallow in my constituency which is one of the most depressed regions in the country. Some of my colleagues claim to represent prosperous regions, regions with black spots, and regions that are entirely in depression. I would invite any of them to look at what is happening in the Duhallow region where people are leaving the land at an alarming rate and where it has not been possible to attract alternative industry to drive the local economy.</P>
    <P>One of the major consequences of regionalisation is being overlooked. That is not so much that there will be a two-tier system of grants for agriculture, because the Department would not get away with that. There is a very serious downside in respect of areas outside Objective One status, those that may be categorised as Objective One in transition, and that is their capacity to attract alternative industry. A document from the Irish Business Bureau in Brussels states:</P>
    <P>The Commission has set down a formula whereby the amount of grant-aid permissible will be modulated into the two categories of regions within Ireland. Objective One will be able to have a grant aid maximum of 40 per cent for new industry, and Objective One in transition will have a maximum of 20 per cent, and this limit may be as low as 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>That has very serious consequences for areas that will not make Objective One status, and there is no capacity for national Government to make up the shortfall in that area. I am extremely disappointed that we are accepting the criteria the Commission is quoting for determining what is in or what is out, because GDP is an unfair mechanism.</P>
    <P>I live in the south-west region of Cork and Kerry where there is an excessive concentration of multinationals in the Cork Harbour area who repatriate much of their profits. If that aspect was taken out of the equation, we would be among the lowest. However, if one takes average weekly household disposable income, the regions it is proposed to include under the current criteria, such as the midlands and the west, would be excluded because they are in the top three. It should have been possible to construct some matrix of economic criteria that would genuinely reflect regions in need. However, it appears we have thrown in the towel in terms of the criteria which will be used to determine whether we will qualify for Objective One status. This is most disappointing.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that the Department of Agriculture and Food is sleep-walking through this entire debate. The Minister for Finance appears to be well briefed. He was hoarse during his contribution but many of the people in Duhallow <Col N="513" /> with whom I attended a meeting last night would have preferred him to be more hoarse or practically voiceless a few days earlier. There is great outrage at the slur he cast on the farming community and the attempt he made to fan the urban rural divide which is the most divisive debate in the country. There are even elements of it during the discussion on Objective One status.</P>
    <P>Due to Objective One status, Ireland receives a total of £184 million annually between the REP, early retirement and forestry schemes. However, there is not a giggle from the Department of Agriculture and Food during this entire debate. There is a real danger that these schemes will be undermined. To safeguard the interests of those who may fall outside Objective One status, there is an obligation on the Government to publish simultaneously when it submits a national development plan for the region which may qualify for Objective One status a transparent document that will be a blueprint for the development of the regions which will have Objective One in transition status and take account of their inability to attract industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the regionalisation of the country with regard to Objective One status. The issue is extremely serious. The Border, west and midlands regions have propped up the rest of the country over recent years. It got Objective One status at our expense. A map, issued as part of the document on the railways today shows a white area covering Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal. That is so because the region does not have a railway or proper roads. Not one penny from the last round of Objective One status money has been spent on by-passing any of the towns in the region. The Border, midlands and west regions should have Objective One status, but it should be stipulated that this money from Brussels is additional and not a replacement for other funds as was the case under INTERREG and other programmes.</P>
      <P>I am most disappointed that the Minister did not state that the Government has made a decision. For months the Government has repeatedly stated that it will make a decision shortly. I accept the Minister for Finance's commitment to this issue. He, and many of his officials, have made it clear that there would be a direct benefit from the regionalisation of the country. However, the Taoiseach said this would mean that no extra funds would be made available to Ireland. One must react with disbelief at this statement.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach involved in this debate in Europe on our behalf?  Is he stating in discussions that if Ireland had Objective One status, it would draw money from a larger pool not only for the next seven years, but beyond?  Is the Taoiseach trying to court votes in Dublin?  Deputy De Rossa is doing something similar but the Taoiseach should see the bigger picture and ensure that the areas which are entitled to Objective One status receive it so they will have a chance of survival in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> The Government has failed to secure approval for the rural renewal plans for the Shannon basin and the urban renewal plans which were promised months ago. One must be extremely anxious about the efforts it is making to secure the best results in Brussels. The Taoiseach rushed home to attend a football match against my county in Dublin recently. Is he trying to build relationships in Europe?  Former Taoisigh from all sides had good relationships and secured the best possible results in Europe.</P>
    <P>Approximately 40,000 farmers marched in Dublin recently seeking their rights. Many of them were from the areas I mentioned. Time is not on our side and if Objective One status is not secured quickly, there will be a revolt in those areas which have been left out. According to the last census, my county is one of the few where there was no increase in population. People did not stay because funds, which we helped the country to secure, were not spent in the regions which were entitled to them.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to stand back and allow that to happen in future. We beg the Taoiseach to make a decision quickly and ensure that as much aid as possible is secured on an ongoing basis for the areas which needs it most. This does not mean that urban renewal blackspots cannot get funding from other sources. The Minister for Finance stated that this is possible. However, we should not allow ourselves to be sailed down the Swanee for political opportunism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate because it offers us a snapshot of our political culture. It offers us an opportunity to take stock of where we stand as a country and an economy. It is particularly important because it gives us an opportunity to redefine ourselves in relation to the rest of the European Union and other member states.</P>
      <P>The debate is not exclusive to the House. It has been ongoing for some weeks at different meetings throughout the country. However, much of the debate has been disappointing, not least because of the ham-fisted and secretive way in which the Government in general and the Minister for Finance in particular have behaved. This is a matter of national interest, which affects the national interest.</P>
      <P>If we were to adopt a genuinely regional approach to a development strategy, it would involve fundamental and radical structural reform which deserves wide public debate before the issue is even mentioned in Brussels. Instead, the Government is attempting to insinuate that any debate is in itself contrary to the national interest because it might affect the Government's negotiating stance. This attitude tells us much about what we need to know. The proposal is not the imaginative commitment to regional development which is needed. It is no more than an inept ploy to extract a few extra euros from the German taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the House recently, there is a need <Col N="515" /> to redefine our attitude to the European Union. It is time to put away the begging bowl before it is thrown back in our collective faces. We are no longer the poor relations of Europe and we must take some responsibility for our future. One should consider the figures. The Government is due to run a current budget deficit of almost £2.5 billion this year, with an overall Government balance of close to £1 billion. The £2.5 billion figure is equivalent to the entire expected take from Structural and Cohesion Funds over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>It is argued that regionalisation would allow us to increase our share by perhaps £120 million or approximately £20 million a year over the next financial perspective. This is one fiftieth or 2 per cent of the general Government surplus for this year alone. The Minister for Finance and the Department underestimated the tax take this year by close to £1 billion or £20 million a week. A total of £20 million a week more has been taken in than the Government predicted in the financial statement at the end of last year. Yet, the Minister has developed an apparently elaborate plan which will do no more than realise the same amount over the course of an entire year. It is time to ask if the game is really worth the candle.</P>
    <P>Ireland has serious infrastructural needs and these are explicitly recognised in Agenda 2000. The Commission appears to have gone seriously out of its way to accommodate Ireland and its needs. The notion of areas in transition appears to have been developed, at least in part, with Ireland in mind. This reflects the fact that the Commission accepts that we have spent the funds well and to good effect. It also reflects the goodwill and influence Ireland has built up in the 25 years since we joined the European Economic Community in 1973 but that goodwill and influence are not without limit and there have been clear signs that we are pushing close to that limit. It is no secret that the agreement with Commissioner Monti in relation to corporation tax has upset many of our partners. It has become difficult to get agreement from the Commission on the use of State aids of any kind. Deputy Crawford mentioned several. The point has hit home to our partners that we are no longer as poor as we once were. All this means that we are under far greater pressure than heretofore to justify special pleading. Our partners expect us to take a far greater level of responsibility for our future and who could blame them?</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister said that he intended to bank £1 billion of taxpayer's money to reduce the national debt. It is staggering that this decision, this political choice has hardly aroused a ripple of criticism. Government Deputies have been falling over themselves with enthusiasm to extract a few million pounds from the German taxpayer while the Minister is refusing to spend £1 billion of taxpayer's money on anything. How can we ask <Col N="516" /> others to invest in our future if we refuse to do so ourselves?</P>
    <P>When the Minister attends an ECOFIN meeting between now and next March and puts his case to our partners, not least the Germans, the Swedes and the Austrians who have invested heavily in us, he will produce his elaborate maps and tell Mr. Lafontaine and his colleagues that we are entitled as of right to direct transfers from the German taxpayer. The German Government has a borrowing requirement pushing the Maastricht Treaty limits and an unemployment rate of almost 25 per cent in the eastern Lander. Is Mr. Lafontaine not entitled to ask why we want to spend German taxpayers' money on development in Ireland and to put our taxpayers' money in the bank for a rainy day?</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of special pleading. Deputy after Deputy will look to make the case for a particular programme, project or region but the object of the exercise is deeply mistaken. Europe holds some of the purse strings but the far greater purse is in the Minister's back pocket. It is no longer possible or desirable to blame others for our deficiencies. If the roads in Cavan are full of potholes, the blame lies with the Minister, not with Mr. Santer or Mr. Schroder. If our public transport system is inadequate and our sanitation system underfunded, the blame lies in Dublin, not in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Minister banked £1 billion last week, £1 billion of opportunities lost, of development foregone. The Minister is uniquely fortunate. He has real choices. He can choose to invest in our development or he can bank the money. He can choose to help create a developed civilised society or he can give tax breaks to the rich. He can choose to bring our public services up to European standards or he can ask our German friends to do it for us. So far he has chosen to ignore the advice given by Dr. Michael Somers of the NTMA that money is better spent not in reducing the national debt but in investing in our future and public services on which so many depend.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister make a case in Brussels when he fails to practice what he preaches?  How can we look to spend German, Swedish or Austrian money on our development if we refuse to spend our own?  Most of Europe is now social democratic which should work to our benefit. We have a decent case to make for the continuation of regional aid which our colleagues are willing to accept but that case will be damaged if we fail to meet our responsibilities. We cannot ask others to do what we are not willing to do ourselves. If we do, we will be laughed out of court.</P>
    <P>This is not an each way bet. If we are seen to chance our arm for a few pounds more and to engage in a mapping exercise which is seen by others as a ready-up, we risk losing much of the influence which has sustained us well. We have often relied on the help and friendship of our partners to get us a good deal and we should think long and hard before jettisoning that goodwill. <Col N="517" /> The cost in terms of money and influence may outweigh any short-term gain.</P>
    <P>The next few years will be challenging for Ireland and the European Union. We face EMU at a time when the economy is out of sync with the rest of the European Union. We are looking at enlargement in four or five years' time which will demand serious renegotiation of the common agricultural policy. Does anybody seriously believe that Hungary and Poland can be accommodated within the common agricultural policy as constituted?  Our friends have supported us through challenges of this kind. It is important that they do so again. If we put that friendship in jeopardy for the sake of a few pounds more, we are at risk of making a mistake of historical importance.</P>
    <P>For many years we have behaved as supplicants in our approach to the European Union. We have sought and received the support of voters for referenda on European issues largely, although not exclusively, on the basis that it was financially good for us. It is time to broaden the debate and there is an urgent need for Government to show leadership. The <i>raison d'etre</i> of the European Union is and always has been political as well as economic. We have chosen to emphasise the financial benefits. The time has come to address the broader picture. When next we face a European referendum we will be in a different relationship than we have been on previous occasions. It is up to us to ensure we do not come in for a rude awakening.</P>
    <P>It is impossible and undesirable to deal with the issue of regionalisation without placing it firmly in the context of the big picture. If regionalisation is merely a ruse to dupe the Commission into giving us a few pounds more, we should abort that ruse immediately but that does not mean that there is nothing to be said for a regional approach to development. I was struck by the contribution of Mr. Liam Scollan, chief executive of the Western Development Commission, at a conference in Galway a few days ago. He set out a cogent case for an integrated approach to development in the west. He said, &ldquo;mere designation of Objective One will be of little use unless it is accompanied by a clear commitment to a timescale of significantly increased investment in the physical and social infrastructure of the regions&rdquo;. He referred to &ldquo;the utter fallacy of regarding EU money as the solution&rdquo;. The thrust of his contribution &mdash; I hope I do not do him an injustice &mdash; was to play down the importance of the European dimension while emphasising the importance of the regions as a focus for planning, investment and development.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of merit in the argument made by Mr. Scollan and there is no reason similar thinking could not be applied to other regions. Real planning and development at regional level could play an important part in addressing regional inequality and the social inequality that comes with it. The Labour Party is much in favour of tackling inequality wherever it arises and <Col N="518" /> giving power to local people to make decisions which affect their lives. We will support any genuine move to address inequality and devolve power. Does the Government's proposal represent a genuine effort to do either of these things?  All the evidence suggests the Government has no genuine interest in devolution or tackling inequality at regional level.</P>
    <P>The regional authorities are incapable of doing a serious job of work. They have no decision-making powers and their structure would make it almost impossible to give them powers of this kind. Fitzpatricks and Associates, economic consultants, carried out an assessment of the regional effects of the CSF two years ago. On the regional authorities, the report was unambiguous. The consultants found that the review process carried out by the authorities was generally unsatisfactory. They made a list of stinging criticisms and a further list of recommendations, none of which has been implemented.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the authorities would have to be dramatically restructured to allow for any genuine decision making at regional level, yet the Taoiseach has made it crystal clear that he envisages only small changes by Government order. We must wonder at the seriousness of the Government's intent if its reforms are of a nature that do not even require legislation. Perhaps a further hint can be gleaned from the comments of Mr. Noel O'Gorman, a Department of Finance official, when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs recently. He emphasised that &ldquo;the efficient and effective administration and control of Structural Funds spending,.must not be jeopardised&rdquo;. Strangely, the Minister used the same phrase earlier. This message is transparent coming from the Minister and a senior official in his Department, even one as progressive as Mr. O'Gorman. The central control by Merrion Street has served us well and must not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>Another indicator of the Government's intent is its treatment of the national plan. A number of months ago the Government commissioned consultants to draw up a national plan to form the basis for the next CSF. The terms of reference envisaged one national plan, not two or more regional plans. However, the notion of regionalisation had not taken off at the time. When Mr. O'Gorman appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service two weeks ago I asked if the terms of reference had been changed to incorporate the regional strategy. He appeared to be genuinely bemused at the suggestion and his response suggested that regionalisation was little more than a lever to extract more money rather than a serious commitment to regional development.</P>
    <P>If Ireland is to adopt a genuine regional strategy it will require a complete reorientation of the entire strategy, which is a great deal more than a change in the structure of regional authorities. Fitzpatricks point out that &ldquo;the CSF does not contain regional objectives, either overall or by <Col N="519" /> region: it contains no quantified regional targets and no projected expenditure by region. .There are, therefore, no integrated regional strategies, plans or programmes. Instead, the CSF is designed, structured and implemented on a national basis through national programmes&rdquo;. That is the status quo as evaluated by the consultants only a year or two ago. Does the Minister agree with that conclusion and does he intend to do anything about it?  I suspect the answer to the second question is &ldquo;no&rdquo; whether he is prepared to acknowledge this.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the possibility of retaining in transition status for the areas that might be granted Objective One status beyond 2006. This must be seriously questioned and I do not wish to make any plans on the basis of that assumption. The Commission that will come into power next year will already have sought control by the time the next Financial Perspective from 2007 onwards is negotiated. Most of the current political leaders in Europe will most likely have moved on. Perhaps more important, we are talking about a Union which is likely to include six additional countries or more, many of which have a GDP/per capita ratio lower than Ireland's or the European average. To assume we have any chance of retaining in transition status for any part of the country beyond 2006 is extremely speculative. We could not justify a division of the kind the Minister seems to advocate, based on a faint hope of a carrot in the distant future.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a more cogent and interesting argument regarding regional aid. There has been a dearth of information on this issue over the last while. Under the agreement already negotiated with the Commission, the entire country has lost A status for regional aid grant purposes and currently has C status. It is possible under the terms of reference published by the Commission that if part of the country were to retain Objective One status it could be regraded to A status but this is not certain and again this involves serious speculation. Even if we accept that the lower levels of grant-aid will apply, how often is that exceeded?  Is it normal practice to give grant-aid in excess of 20 per cent plus ten?  On many occasions grant-aid in excess of 25 to 30 per cent has been declined even when it might have been possible to attract even significantly large industry. There is merit in this argument and I am interested to know what the instance of it coming into effect would be.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the 1.27 per cent limit on funding is no longer sustainable. It is difficult to see it sustaining the existing Union over the duration of the Financial Perspective while it is impossible to see it sustaining a Union which might include several other poorer countries over that period. Notwithstanding Ireland's interest in the future as a net contributor, it has an interest in increasing the level of own resources, as the Minister rightly pointed out. That should be <Col N="520" /> clearly articulated and those looking for an increase in own resources should be supported.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Union continues based on solidarity, accepts international competences and is willing to support, for example, through the regional and agricultural funds, areas that are less well off. The effect of Government policy to date, and some would say the intention behind it, has been to divide the nation between those who believe they will benefit and those who believe they will lose. I, and the Labour Party, do not intend to go along with this policy of division. There is something particularly squalid in a policy which encourages the disadvantaged in one part of the country to believe that they can only get on at the expense of the disadvantaged in another part.</P>
    <P>We must not allow ourselves to be drawn into false choices. We have a moral and political obligation to tackle poverty and disadvantage wherever it arises, be it in the centre of Dublin or Cork or rural Achill or Cavan. Is anybody seriously suggesting that we should invest in the roads infrastructure in Mayo but not in South Kerry? Does anyone seriously believe that a specified course in Letterkenny IT should receive ESF funding while the same course in Carlow IT should not?</P>
    <P>We should refuse to get drawn into the politics of division. The people in the west made their case well, as Deputy Ring did earlier, and I have sympathy for it. Much underdevelopment and disadvantage in the west must be addressed as a matter of priority. However, the facts do not lend themselves to the easy, map drawing exercise in which the Government seems to be engaged. The Fitzpatricks report points out that European funding has had different effects in different parts of the country. For example, the Border region has received the greatest input per capita but has responded least well and it also suggests that different types of spending produce different results and different regions may well require different mixes of spending.</P>
    <P>This is the last time Ireland can expect to receive significant Structural Funds. It is important that they are spent fairly and well and the money is used to tackle poverty, disadvantage and exclusion wherever it exists and support the needs of the economy and the people. There may be an argument for more regional decision making and control. If so, we have yet to hear it from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on this important topic. I welcome the Minister's comment that the arguments for regionalisation are compelling and there is no downside to the proposal. With you, a Leas-Cheann <Col N="521" /> Comhairle, and our colleagues in the Border region, I look forward to a decision by the Government to put forward proposals that will facilitate more balanced regional economic growth and assist those regions which have lagged behind.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the statistics quoted by the Minister and from previous replies in the House to parliamentary questions and Adjournment debates that the Border region, the west and the midlands are lagging behind the rest of the country and require special development. I have had the opportunity, through parliamentary questions and Adjournment debates, to highlight the developmental needs of the Border region and I wish to put on record some of the valid and cogent arguments in that regard.</P>
      <P>The retention of Objective One status for the period 2000-2006 for the Border region is essential if regional imbalance and disparities in economic performance are to be eliminated. The case for Objective One status is economically and politically justifiable. The infrastructural deficit suffered by the Border region must be addressed and this can only be achieved by drawing down the maximum level of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Structural Funds after 1999 have exercised the minds of public representatives in the midlands, west and Border regions for some time. That is also true of our colleagues north of the Border. They are particularly concerned about the existing economic divide and the lack of development west of the Bann. Last June the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, launched the Border Regional Authority report: &ldquo;The Border Region after 1999: the case for special status&rdquo;. That report outlined in a comprehensive manner the arguments for the retention of Objective One status and it obviously has been the subject of consideration by the Department of Finance. The report outlines the poor performance of the region in socio-economic terms and articulates clearly the region's unique status in the Irish and European Union context.</P>
      <P>It must be accepted that the prolonged Northern troubles had a devastating effect on the economy of the Border counties. The seemingly intractable situation inhibited the normal pace of economic growth and development in the region. The Border created an economic divide with towns being cut off from their natural hinterland and rural areas being cut off from their natural town centres. The area suffered from security problems and from a general lack of development in social and economic terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, 14.7 per cent of the labour force in the Border region was unemployed. This was the highest unemployment rate recorded in any region and was well above the national average of 11.8 per cent. Fortunately, employment increased in the area in the period 1993-7 and unemployment fell. However, its performance lagged behind that of the other regions which meant that fewer jobs were created and the <Col N="522" /> reduction in unemployment was lower than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Border region experiences the highest rate of long-term unemployment. In 1997, 58.7 per cent of unemployed people were classified as long-term unemployed. The underdeveloped nature of the region is clear from the poor levels of economic growth and poor performance in attracting inward investment. The statistics quoted by the Minister for the areas which attracted inward investment were extremely interesting. If one were to take it that the Border region, the midlands and the west were to retain Objective One status, the regions in transition attracted 77 per cent of all inward investment during the period 1995-7. It is clear that the three regions mentioned must catch up on inward investment and job creation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the level of assistance that would be available by way of industrial grants will be greater for a region that retains Objective One status. The Border, midlands and west regions need the maximum level of grant assistance to create employment and attract inward investment.</P>
    <P>Urbanisation is a feature of economic growth and the Border region is hindered in its potential development due to its largely rural nature. As a region it was not able to achieve the full benefit of the Objective One status the country has enjoyed to date because of the political difficulties on its doorstep. The region looks forward to the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement. The ongoing peace process must be under-pinned by large scale investment in infrastructure, inward investment and the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to address the economic difficulties the region suffered over the past 30 years. It also faces new opportunities for the future arising from the peace process. However, it also faces a new challenge in being on the exchange rate frontline when Ireland enters EMU without Britain.</P>
    <P>The region has benefited from Structural Funds expenditure, funds which were successfully negotiated in 1989 and in 1992 by Fianna Fáil Governments. However, the Border region and its neighbours did not achieve the success rate of the rest of the country. The report of the Border Regional Authority, to which I referred earlier, clearly outlines why the region should retain Objective One status. This region, in addition to the midlands and the west, is below the 75 per cent of GDP threshold which determines eligibility for Objective One status. It continues to be remote and peripheral in EU terms and it has special status regarding the historic, political and economic opportunities arising from the peace process.</P>
    <P>The region meets the key principle of Agenda 2000 which is to concentrate Structural Funds assistance on the poorest regions. The implementation of the British-Irish Agreement should add considerably to economic convergence on the <Col N="523" /> island. The retention of Objective One status for the southern Border region, the west, the midlands and, indeed, north of the Border and west of the Bann is needed so that necessary economic development can take place to underpin the peace process. Investment on a large scale is needed and this is an opportune time to show that the Government and the European Commission are committed to the necessary economic and social progress that is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I compliment the Minister on a comprehensive statement. The objectives of the EU Structural Funds, as determined by the European Union, are to put in place economic and social infrastructures to reduce inequalities between regions and within regions.</P>
      <P>In recent years the regional funds, coupled with sound management of the economy, have served to increase equality between Ireland and other European states. It is also apparent that the national development plans submitted to the Commission during earlier rounds of funding have been the key mechanisms for prioritising how moneys are spent. The national development plan for the 2000-2006 round of Structural Funds is now at an advanced stage. It is my aim to ensure that problems specific to the Dublin region are addressed no matter what regional lines of delineation are put in place.</P>
      <P>I do not challenge the claim that moneys should be invested in the poorer regions of Ireland. However, I am concerned that the over-simplified statistical analysis places the average income in Dublin at 121.5 per cent of the EU average. Not only does this figure include the incomes of many civil and public servants who reside or work outside Dublin, it takes little account of real household and personal incomes and higher transport, housing and other costs in the region, a fact borne out in a Dublin regional authority survey carried out by Dr. P. Drudy of Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The figures also sweep over the fact that the economic growth experienced in the last five years has failed to trickle down to many of the urban blackspots that persist in our capital city. The national development plan must address urban problems too. The success of the economy, combined with targeted use of EU funds, will provide many of the resources necessary to eliminate long-term unemployment and social disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I accept that these problems permeate throughout the country but they are concentrated in the cities and particularly in Dublin. An analysis of the August live register reveals, for example, that there are 68,000 people registered as unemployed in Dublin city and county. Almost all of these people are concentrated in specific blackspots. The Government, in formulating the national development plan, cannot ignore this statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's statement that <Col N="524" /> proposals for the national development plan post-1999 will place particular reference on reducing long-term unemployment by securing increased job placement, discouraging early-school leaving &mdash; the primary cause of long-term unemployment &mdash; addressing adult illiteracy and tackling the problem of drug abuse. Strategies to deal with these problems are already being put in place, including measures to tackle ten to 15 year old early school leavers and the allocation of moneys, £30 million, to the provision of youth services and facilities.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts that low educational achievement and early school leaving lead to fundamental long-term problems such as unemployment, poverty and disadvantage. Two of the most deprived communities, Ballymun and Finglas, are situated in my constituency. Ballymun is a case study of an urban blackspot, performing poorly across the main socio-economic indicators. The area has the highest unemployment rate in the country and the highest proportion of lone parent families. Opportunities for lone parents to enter the labour force are generally limited due to con-strained employment mobility. I pay tribute to the Ballymun Women's Resource Centre for its promotion of the NOW project and the innovative programmes in architecture, town planning, etc. , it is running in co-operation with Ballymun Regeneration Ltd. Such initiatives will help people to break out of the cycle of long-term endemic unemployment.</P>
    <P>The level of educational disadvantage in Ballymun is also striking, with over 50 per cent of the population having completed their full-time education at 15 years of age. The combination of social problems experienced in Ballymun are characteristic of those in other blackspots in that they demonstrate that piecemeal approaches to their solution will fail. An all-embracing approach is necessary if we are to alleviate the cycle of deprivation in these communities.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by the Minister's comments regarding the URBAN initiative, which the EU Commission does not propose to retain in the next round. I am glad the Government is taking steps to try to ensure that the URBAN initiative will be retained after 1999. It is imperative that the House, on an all-party basis, should urge the Commission to expand and develop the initiative further. I accept it has been slow to get off the ground but it is an important initiative and it should be continued.</P>
    <P>I endorse the measures advocated by the Dublin Regional Authority, which are: raising awareness of the value of education; the provision of additional resources for special needs education; targeted interventions to reduce early school leaving; increased resources for remedial teaching at post primary level; increased staffing resources to reduce pupil-teacher ratios; the extension and targeting of programmes such as the early school leavers programme and Youthstart; consultation in the setting and development of curricula; the provision of additional resources for career and <Col N="525" /> guidance counselling; and increased teacher resources.</P>
    <P>Training programmes must continue to be put in place and be made more innovative in order to give the unemployed the necessary skills to enter the labour market. The European Social Fund must be spent in a manner which discriminates in favour of assisting poor and disadvantaged areas in urban parts of Ireland. It must also be used to retrain people with updated skills in addition to taking advantage of new schemes to promote changing information technology systems.</P>
    <P>Promoting social inclusion and combating poverty should be key objectives in the use of the next round of Structural Funds. My views on the issue of allocation of Regional Funds are heavily influenced by the need to make a massive effort to tackle poverty in Ireland. There is fresh evidence that poverty now exists at regional and local level. The National Anti-Poverty Strategy identified that 9 per cent to 15 per cent of the Irish population is affected by persistent long-term poverty, with up to 34 per cent of the population at risk from poverty. Specifically, these categories include: the unemployed and the long-term unemployed; children in large families; lone parents; people with disabilities; and travellers. The Combat Poverty Agency report &ldquo;Where are the poor households &mdash; the spatial distribution of poverty and deprivation in Ireland&rdquo; also shows two pertinent conclusions, namely, that poverty is pervasive and that large concentrations of poverty and disadvantage can be identified in urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Funds must be directed at creating more effective models of regeneration at local level that are linked to effective national policies. Measures to be prioritised could include: improving the housing and physical environment &mdash; maintenance, energy efficiency and estate management; developing local infrastructure &mdash; credit unions and small businesses; increasing social provision &mdash; community health services, recreational and educational opportunities for youth; and enhancing local enterprise.</P>
    <P>When the last national development plan was put in place in 1993, traffic congestion and related transport problems in Dublin city were not nearly as acute as they are at present. For the economy in Dublin to work effectively, a user-friendly transport system is imperative. It is essential that the EU co-finance measures to alleviate traffic congestion in Dublin city and county in the next round of Structural Funds. Statistics in this regard provide compelling evidence regarding why EU Regional Funds should be made available to combat traffic congestion in the Dublin region. For example, it is estimated that car ownership will increase by 35 per cent in the next ten years. The statistics also show that, between 1991 and 1996, passenger and freight traffic using Dublin airport and Dublin port doubled while the figure for rush hour car journey jumped from 174,000 to 227,000 in the same period.</P>
    <P>Controlling and defeating the traffic congestion <Col N="526" /> problem in Dublin city is one of the greatest challenges facing representatives from the Dublin region. The European Commission must be made aware of the transport problems faced by people who live and work in Dublin. Co-ordinated proposals must be included in the national development plan if the effort to combat traffic congestion is to be supported by the Commission. The concept promoted by the DTI strategy must be preceded with as a priority. This includes: public transport in the form of light rail transit; quality bus corridors and the extension of the DART. Submissions supporting a rail link to the airport, which I fully endorse, have also been made. Dublin must be one of the few European cities which does not have direct rail link between its airport and city centre.</P>
    <P>Other projects which have been identified as important are the completion of the C ring, which includes port access, completion of phase two of the northern motorway from the airport to Balbriggan, the construction of a new bridge over the Liffey, completion of the Church Road phase three connector from Dún Laoghaire to the motorway, completion of the outer ring and the development of a regional strategic cycle network.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the fact that local authorities in Dublin face problems in disposing of the 3.5 million tonnes of waste which accumulates in the city and its environs each year. There is growing public concern about the long-term environmental impact of landfill sites. The future of waste disposal must not lie in the continued search for landfill sites nationwide. The Government must include innovative waste management proposals in the forthcoming national development plan. Ireland is currently experiencing strong economic growth and part of our resources must be invested in alternative waste management schemes. Investment in a clean environment will, in the medium to long-term, justify any additional expenditure incurred.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to commission a study into the possible use of new and alternative forms of waste generation and disposal. We must secure EU funding to invest in the cleaner and newer technologies coming on stream in order to deal with the problem of waste management in Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of new waste facilities, a waste management study was carried out on behalf of the four local authorities in the Dublin region by MCCK Consultants. It indicated that the total cost of new waste facilities up to the year 2011 would be £253 million. In addition, the report made a number of recommendations which are worthy of consideration, including: the construction of a facility to manage biological waste and the provision of integrated waste management centres in each of the four local authority areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to future consultative <Col N="527" /> mechanisms and I am pleased that, regardless of the strategy the Government adopts, the role of regional bodies and their subsidiary bodies will be enhanced and that they will be given a more strategic input in the delivery of Structural Funds and Structural Funds assisted development. That is an important step. The new national development plan which will be prepared by the Government in the coming months ought to be cognisant of the need to encourage people to be aware of proposals that will have a serious impact on their lives. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>

      <P>I regret I only have one third of the time I would need to address this issue. Deputy Pat Carey said he welcomed the Minister's commitment to give regional authorities more power. However, the Minister did not say that. He stated:</P>
      <P>In the event of a regionalisation approach being adopted, the regional administrative framework may require adjustment. Such adjustment as is necessary will be the subject of discussion with the Commission and will take account of the views of the regional interests.</P>
      <P>That is not a commitment to give more powers to the regions.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with Deputy Pat Carey's speech. As a colleague of his in Dublin North West, I expected he would represent more clearly the strong concerns in that constituency about the Government's proposal to split the country into two economic regions. He opened his speech by dismissing that issue as unimportant and then spent the rest of his time speaking well meaning waffle about what he would like to see. What he would like to see will not happen if the Government adopts the two region strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this debate is over, not today or tomorrow, he will have to match his words with his commitment. Well meaning waffle is not good enough on this issue.</P>
      <P>This is not a real debate because the Minister made a statement to which we must respond without having seen it in advance. In his speech he said we already had a debate in this House. However, we did not. We were permitted to ask questions within the rules of the House and the Taoiseach gave inadequate replies. I will deal at a later stage with the fact that the Taoiseach misled this House by omission about what Commissioner Wulf-Mathies told him when she met him in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact we have finally forced a debate in this House. It is being held at the eleventh hour when the Government already appears to have committed itself to a specific course of action. It has taken several weeks to force the Government into conceding this debate, which is <Col N="528" /> symptomatic of the totally unacceptable way the Government has tried to suppress real debate, discussion or analysis on this issue. The reports which have emerged within the past 24 hours of the meeting in Cork between the Taoiseach and the EU Commissioner for Regional Affairs provide further compelling evidence that the Government has been less than forthcoming with the people and the Dáil on this issue.</P>
    <P>The transfer of resources through EU Structural Funds has had a huge impact on economic development. However, while the amount we receive in the next round is important, what is even more important is the manner in which we will be enabled to apply these funds. We must seek to ensure that not only can we sustain economic growth and provide physical infrastructure, but that the benefits of growth are spread more evenly throughout every community in the country.</P>
    <P>The original objective of the Government was to make a Cabinet decision with the minimum of discussion or debate. The matter was originally brought to Cabinet in September and a decision would have been made at that stage only that Democratic Left, organisations such as the Combat Poverty Agency, community development groups and individual economists began to question the wisdom of dividing the country into two separate economic regions for the purposes of the next round of funds. This was not a strategic approach to planning, development and eliminating poverty, but to extract the last penny from Europe. This alerted many Government backbenchers to the consequences of this strategy and forced a delay in making the decision which allowed a debate to begin.</P>
    <P>At this stage we are still operating in the dark as to the basis on which the Government has apparently made a decision in principle to draw an artificial economic border through the heart of the country. Despite the vital importance of getting this decision right in the interests of all citizens, no discussion paper or economic data was published by the Government. If any independent assessment of the social, economic and industrial consequences of this strategy was commissioned by the Government, it has not been published.</P>
    <P>At the eleventh hour the Minister for Finance announced that he had asked the ESRI to do a study on what should be in the national plan. However, he has not told us the terms of reference of that report, when it was given to it and when it is expected to reply. Will the ESRI address the issue of a single or two region strategy? I doubt it, given the wording of the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The limited information available to the public has emerged through the work of parties such as Democratic Left, journalists and economists. It allows us to draw a number of conclusions with reasonable certainty, including the fact that the measure used to determine qualification for Objective One status, gross value added, is a totally <Col N="529" /> unreliable measure of regional income in the Irish context and significantly distorts the real picture of disadvantage in urban and rural areas, not just in the Dublin area; that splitting the country into two regions will have at best a token impact on the global figure the country is likely to receive in Structural Funds and is likely to make no difference at all, and that splitting the country into two regions will severely restrict the tactical options open to the Government in targeting resources towards those areas of disadvantage outside the 13 counties proposed to make up the Objective One region, especially in terms of industrial development and job creation measures.</P>
    <P>This debate has been depicted as a case of the west versus Dublin or, more misleadingly, the west versus the rest. However, it is not. I regret that Deputy Crawford and Deputy Ring chose to present it in that way by identifying me as some type of ogre on this issue. This debate is about recognising that poverty and disadvantage is a country wide problem and that it is just as severe in Ballymun as in Belmullet. I have always believed that economic help to improve living standards and enhance employability must be aimed at clusters of people, rather than areas of land or parts of maps.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I recognise the particular disadvantage suffered by some in the west, the midlands and the Border counties and I do not object to them getting a fair share of European and Exchequer support. However, I object to some of the poorest and most disadvantaged areas being put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> these regions by allowing the Government to avoid the tough option of targeting support only at those people who really need it.</P>
    <P>Report after report by the Combat Poverty Agency has identified low income urban neighbourhoods as key sources of disadvantage. If the Government persists with a two region strategy, areas in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford will be at a considerable disadvantage in their efforts to tackle poverty and deprivation.</P>
    <P>Unemployment remains probably our biggest social and economic problem. According to the live register area analysis for September, 65,000 of the total of 219,174 on the live register were in the proposed Objective One area, which means that 70 per cent are outside it. More significantly, using data obtained from the 1996 census, the CSO identified 110 unemployment blackspots with average unemployment rates of 37.6 per cent. Some 75 of these blackspots are in the main urban areas with 47 in Dublin, 12 in Cork city, 11 in Limerick city and five in Waterford city. Most of the rest are in the proposed Objective One area with 17 in Donegal, nine in Galway and seven in Mayo. What social or economic sense does it make to cut these areas off from the maximum possible level of support, especially in terms of job creation?</P>
    <P>The debate has tended to focus on two options only. The first, which is the one the Government <Col N="530" /> wants, is to seek to have the country sub-divided so that some areas will continue to qualify for full Objective One status. The second is that the entire country should be reclassified as Objective One in transition. This would mean that EU funding would be gradually reduced over the seven year period of the next round.</P>
    <P>However, a third option, which does not seem to have been given any serious consideration &mdash; the Minister seemed to imply it was unrealistic &mdash; is to change the criteria used in determining eligibility for the maximum level of aid. Why does the Minister now say it is unrealistic?  Over recent years the European Union defined the objectives it proposes to achieve. It has reduced the number of objectives from seven to three. Why did the Government not make the case for new criteria when the three new objectives were being defined?  This is the approach which should have been adopted because Ireland has a strong case for a new system of assessing variations in wealth between it and the rest of the EU and within different parts of the country. Studies and papers produced by a number of highly qualified experts, including Professor Jim Walsh of the geography department of NUI Maynooth, Jim O'Leary, chief economist with Davy Stockbrokers, and P. Drudy and Michael Punch of the department of economics in Trinity College, have all argued that a <i>per capita</i> income in GDP terms is an inadequate measurement. What I have to say on this subject has been drawn from these sources. GNP <i>per capita</i> would be a more accurate measurement. Unlike other EU countries where the difference between GNP and GDP is much less, GNP in Ireland in the current year is likely to be around 85 per cent of GDP because of the high level of income outflows, such as profit repatriation by the many multinationals based here.</P>
    <P>The method used to measure GDP <i>per capita</i> is gross value added, or GVA, per person. It is important to remember that this is not a measure of household income. GVA includes the profits of companies based in the region concerned. Thus a region like Dublin, which has a large number of foreign companies and is the headquarters of many Irish ones, might have a significant GVA, but it does not add to the income of local residents. In addition, a significant proportion of the workforce of Dublin commutes on a daily or weekly basis to other areas, so a large portion of their income will be spent elsewhere. For example, the earnings of the 166 TDs and 60 Senators in the Oireachtas is regarded as part of the GVA for Dublin, but a great deal of it is spent elsewhere. The income of Deputies Crawford and Ring is included in the GVA for Dublin but is spent in Monaghan and the west, not in Dublin. Items such as social welfare payments and education grants, which can form an important part of household income, are not included in GVA. In addition, what are called &lsquo;overhead subsidies&rsquo; may be a significant factor in distorting the real figure. Into this category fall most farm income <Col N="531" /> supports, including headage payments, and these are not included in GVA.</P>
    <P>Many economists believe the household budget survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office is a more accurate measure. If GVA is used as a measure, Dublin fares well on 121 per cent of the national average with the Border, midlands and west at the bottom of the table with 72.2 per cent, 71.8 per cent and 70 per cent respectively. However, if direct household income as measured by the household budget survey is used, a different picture emerges. For a start, the gap between the regions ranked first and last is much narrower and their ranking is different. Using GVA, the midlands and west are the two regions which rank lowest, but on the basis of household income, they rank second and third. The south east, which ranks around middle on the basis of GVA, is last in terms of household income. When allowance is made for State transfers, such as social welfare payments, child benefit, etc. , and direct taxation, such as income tax and PRSI, the gap is closer again, with Dublin on 113 per cent of the national average and the lowest ranking region, the Border, on 90 per cent. This is a more accurate reflection of the real picture and effectively demolishes the argument that income levels between the top ranking and the lowest ranking regions are so great that splitting the country into two regions for the next round of EU funding is justified and is in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Another key issue is whether dividing the country into two regions is likely to add significantly to the global sum received. The only document on this matter is the Department of Finance memorandum published in <i>Business and Finance</i> which showed that splitting the country into two regions for the next round of EU Structural Funds would result in a negligible financial advantage. The memorandum was leaked; the Government did not offer the information to the House. We now also know from the account of the meeting between the Taoiseach and Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in Cork last month that she told him there was no guarantee that dividing the country in two would result in additional funding. More significantly, the leaked Department of Finance paper suggested that, if the two regions strategy was pursued, long-term unemployment blackspots in areas outside the west, midland and Border regions would be at a significant disadvantage regarding aids for job creation, with grants for start-up industries falling from a high of 75 per cent to as little as 20 per cent. The paper also suggested that dividing the country into two regions would deliver about an additional £100 million. Spread over the seven years of the next round of funding, this would be under £15 million per year to be spread over 13 <Col N="532" /> counties. This is small beer in budgetary terms. It is the revenue equivalent of about a 2p increase in the price of the pint.</P>
    <P>The overall global funding is only part of the picture. Equally important is the consequence of excluding the largest part of the country, which includes the vast majority of unemployment blackspots, from a range of schemes and programmes which could be available under an alternative strategy. Such a strategy could encompass transitional arrangements, Cohesion and social policy funds and rural development programmes as part of CAP reform. The Minister for Finance today dismissed CAP reform out of hand because he said it would require us to pay a little more to support the farming population and the price of produce. That is a totally inadequate response to a fundamental aspect of European Union policy which will impact not only on Ireland but also on the world at large, especially the Third World. It is important to note that, under the proposals for CAP reform, there are guarantees for the inclusion of rural development, regardless of what happens to the Structural Funds regions of Objectives One, Two or Three. A serious debate is needed on that issue. What study, if any, has been made of these options, and if a study has been carried out, why has the House not been briefed on it before now?  Whatever combination is achieved, the best approach for the country would be to retain a single economic region structure. This will make little difference to the overall amount we receive, but will allow greater flexibility in targeting resources towards those people who need them most regardless of where they live, east, west, north or south.</P>
    <P>The argument that we would receive more funding was one pillar of the Government's case for splitting the country in two. The other pillar was that, if we could retain Objective One status for the 13 counties, these areas would then be automatically eligible for &lsquo;Objective One in transition&rsquo; status after the next round was completed in 2006. I always thought this was a wildly optimistic view and the account of the meeting between the Taoiseach and the Commissioner confirms this. According to the account, the Commissioner said it was not possible to say at this stage and it was not necessarily the case that transition status would exist for any or all Objective One regions after 2006, with the potential consequences of the expansion of the EU to include a number of relatively poor applicant states. Despite the fact that the Commissioner has gone on record about the argument that, if Objective One status were retained for the 13 counties proposed, it would mean the &lsquo;Objective One in transition&rsquo; category being secured for those areas after the end of the next round, the Minister for Finance spoke today of the potential for transitional <Col N="533" /> funds for Objective One regions after 2006.</P>
    <P>I share the Commissioner's view. With ten prospective members knocking on the EU door and other countries expressing interest in joining, including some of the poorest and least developed countries in eastern Europe, it is likely the EU of 2006 will be very different from that of today. There will be greater demands on the Community's resources and more competition for what is available. We have no idea what Structural Funding will be in place at that stage, and cannot predict that areas will qualify for &lsquo;Objective One in transition&rsquo; status. It makes more sense to plan effectively for what is available now and seek the maximum degree of flexibility in how we spend it, thus preparing the country for the time in the future when we are likely to be a net contributor to EU funds rather than a significant beneficiary. I look forward to that day.</P>
    <P>The publication of the account of the meeting in Cork has effectively undermined the case put forward by the Government for dividing the country into two regions. A further serious question arises: why did the Taoiseach fail to convey this vital information to the House?  I also sought information from the Department of Finance under the Freedom of Information Act. I was refused that documentation on the basis that it would be contrary to the national interest for it to be revealed. The Department said that about ten documents had been prepared. What damage could be done to the national interest by an open debate based on information available to the Government on the pros and cons of how we apply for regional funds?  Such a debate would enhance democracy and the role of this Parliament as to how we do business with the EU.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the fact that people with mental handicap continue to live at the outer margins of society, and that their families frequently suffer great stress and hardship as a result of the denial of basic rights; aware, from Government-commissioned reports, that more than 1,000 people with a mental handicap live in completely inappropriate surroundings, and that thousands more are on waiting lists for essential services; believing there is a continuing and growing crisis in the legitimate demands of people with a mental handicap for residential services, respite care, training, education and employment; conscious that the Government and Dáil Éireann have welcomed the publication of a number of critical reports in this area, notably the Strategy for Equality, which contains 402 recommendations about the rights of people with disabilities, and Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &mdash; An Assessment of Needs, which establishes a scientific database illustrating the gravity of the problem facing thousands of families; aware that the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 both accord significant priority to the needs and rights of people with a disability; believing that the current strong state of the Exchequer finances provides a unique and unanswerable opportunity to make significant inroads into the unacceptable waiting lists; calls on the Government to mount a front-loaded assault on the problems in the context of this year's budget, and, in particular, to allocate a minimum of £30 million in capital funding to enable the residential and respite care crisis to be addressed, with a further amount of at least £30 million in revenue funding for new services and places in education, training and sheltered and supported employment.</P>
      <P>This House recently debated and called for action to address the scandal of the growing public, in-patient waiting lists in hospitals in every health board region. It is scandalous that more than 34,000 people are waiting, some for over two years, for pain relieving, corrective or life-enhancing surgery or treatment. People are rightly out-raged by this delay in the provision of treatment or surgery which can cure a condition or relieve pain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion concerns the scandal of yet another waiting list. The people on this list do not require medical intervention. Their condition will not be cured by the provision of corrective surgery or treatment. They have waited a long time and must not be made to wait any longer. The <Col N="535" /> State's commitment to provide services for those with an intellectual disability must be ongoing. A lifetime commitment is required for every child and their families.</P>
    <P>Every day the parents of a child with a mental handicap are faced with the painful reality that their child's quality of life will always be decided by others. Far from benefiting from a comprehensive, seamless service, parents and families may face a lifetime of struggle and delay. An extract from one of the submissions to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities included in the report of that body, A Strategy for Equality, graphically illustrates this point. It indicated how the parents of a disabled child face a lifetime of fighting each and every agency and Department for their rights and those of their child.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children's document, Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap/Intellectual Disability &mdash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001, added a new dimension to the development and planning of a comprehensive service for people with a mental handicap. It comprehensively describes the essential needs of those with a mental handicap. It provides us with real information on the need for additional services and on the quality of services currently being provided. This document is the means to an end.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House welcomed the publication of that report. We might ask how there can be any room for complacency when there is such apparent consensus. For those with a mental handicap, their families and carers, it is &ldquo;payback time&rdquo;, to borrow an infamous phrase.</P>
    <P>An additional £56.8 million was provided between 1990 and 1996 for the development of services for persons with a mental handicap. However, the data available in the assessment of needs document, proves that a further substantial investment is required to provide even the most basic care and meet current needs. The intellectual disability database identifies 26,694 people with a mental handicap, of whom 604 receive no service from the State. Some service is being received by 22,804 people. Of the 26,694 men, women and children, 1,439, one in every 20, are waiting for residential and respite care and 1,036 are waiting for the provision of day care. Analysis of the data shows that, due to medical advances, the adult population in the database has increased by 31 per cent since 1974. Of the 26,694 people on the database, 61 per cent, 16,453, are aged 20 or over. Of those 16,453 people, 8,283 are aged 35 or over and 2,203 are over 55. The Department of Health and Children states that the average age of those requiring residential placements is 31.6 years, and 35.9 years of age for those requiring day places.</P>
    <P>The principal carers of persons with mental handicap are their parents. The age profile of those identified as requiring a service has a significant implication. There are many elderly parents <Col N="536" /> caring for middle-aged and older sons and daughters. Parents in their 70s and 80s are looking after adult mentally handicapped sons and daughters. For all of these people, quite apart from the daily physical and emotional demands, their is the fear of what will happen to their child if they die or become incapacitated.</P>
    <P>As a society, we claim to value our elderly people and the Minister of Finance has said that he will concentrate resources in this year's budget on pensioners. Based on the figures I have put forward it is clear that there are more than 8,000 old age pensioners caring for a dependant, mentally handicapped son or daughter. What will the Minister do for them?  Will an increase in their old age pension, welcome though it would be, relieve the pressure of caring?  Will it provide the residential day or respite care they so desperately need for their children?  Will it end the sleepless nights or provide the peace of mind?</P>
    <P>In a submission to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the parents of a mentally handicapped adult stated that parents do not expect the State or society to take over their responsibilities. They are prepared to make whatever sacrifices are necessary, but with the best will in the world, they cannot do it beyond the grave.</P>
    <P>The decision to avail of residential care for their mentally handicapped son or daughter, even if it was available, is not an easy decision for parents. However, in certain cases there is no choice. The death or incapacity of a primary carer, usually the parent, forces this issue. We have all felt the pain of losing someone close to us. How more acute would that pain be if we were sent away from home to totally unfamiliar surroundings while still grieving?  Unfortunately, this is the nightmare scenario facing many people with a mental handicap. They are denied the opportunity to adjust to residential care while their parents are still living. While many parents may have mixed feelings about residential care, many would realistically prefer that their son or daughter would have the experience of living away from home, even in short-term respite care. This would help prepare them for the day when, through death or incapacity, they can no longer be cared for in the family. Neither they nor us can afford to wait any longer. The Minister will have the wholehearted support of Members of this House if he agrees to this motion. We have the resources; we just need to prioritise the manner in which they are used.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as saying in December 1997 that it was unacceptable that a parent of a son or daughter with a mental handicap should have to worry about who would look after their child when they were no longer able to care for them and that he intended to ensure their fears would be allayed. If the Minister is serious about allaying those fears, he can give this House a commitment this evening. The Government can guarantee that in this year's budget, provision of £30 million capital funding will be <Col N="537" /> made to wipe out the waiting lists for residential and respite care. The Government can accelerate the process and provide peace of mind for the families of the 1,439 people who are in need of residential and respite care. A total of 6,971 people will require alternative day services over the next five years. It is estimated that 2,359 adult day places will be required over that period. We already know there is a shortfall of 1,430 day places and we know what it will cost to provide those additional places.</P>
    <P>The motion has already had one very positive effect. Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children announced the provision of an additional £7 million from the Department of Health and Children and £4 million from the sale of lands for the development programme at St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane. The Minister somewhat disingenuously announced again the provision of £5 million in capital funding which had already been committed in August. However, such advances are welcome. Those in St. Ita's who, in spite of the best efforts of committed, skilled and dedicated staff, have had to exist in accommodation and facilities which were totally inappropriate to their real needs, can now look forward to an enhanced quality of life. The Strategy for Equality document described facilities such as those at St. Ita's as &ldquo;unacceptable and degrading&rdquo; and urged they be among the first to be replaced.</P>
    <P>Sectional improvements such as those in the Eastern Health Board area only go a small way towards eliminating the unacceptable and degrading conditions endured by people with a mental handicap who are inappropriately placed in other psychiatric hospitals countrywide. The assessment of need document estimates that of the 970 people with a mental handicap currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals, 310 have been classified as being inappropriately placed. The National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland estimates far exceed that number. It must be noted, however, that while the funding announced by the Minister will at long last address the needs of those already in full time residential care in St. Ita's, it will not provide one extra day care, residential or respite place. A total of 2,457 people and their families will still be waiting.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's responsibility to support the members of those families who, for too long, have had to shoulder an unfair burden and it is everyone's responsibility to ensure quality of treatment for those who cannot speak for themselves. It will be an indictment of all of us if, at the end of a period of unprecedented prosperity, we fail to provide the necessary resources to vindicate the human rights of people with a mental handicap who require improved and additional services.</P>
    <P>There is, in effect, no real disagreement in this House on this matter. Government and Opposition parties are agreed on the action which must be taken. The assessment of needs document <Col N="538" /> indicates that the State needs to provide £36 million for residential places, £10.36 million for day places, £14.14 million for changes in services and £3 million for home support and additional support services. This issue should not be turned into a cynical party political football.</P>

      <P>We, on this side of the House, and those on the Government benches, cannot claim to be holier than thou. All the major parties in the House have been in Government in recent times. All parties did their best in Government; we all tried and failed, mainly for budgetary reasons, to put in place the required support services. This Government is in a different position; all the groundwork has been done and it is fortunate to have available to it the resources to achieve what we all recognise needs to be done. We will not begrudge the Government the opportunity to deliver the range of services it is its duty to deliver. We all agree that £63.5 million is required to provide appropriate, comprehensive and equitable services and support to persons with a mental handicap and their families.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 states that services to people with a mental handicap will be developed within the overall resource parameters based on the needs identified by the national intellectual disability database. Added to that, the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, states that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are committed to radical change to ensure the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed. Each of these commitments was made before it became clear that Exchequer receipts would exceed all of even the most optimistic forecasts and before the budget surplus for this year was announced. There is no reason for delay. The anger and frustration of the parents and families of adults and children with a mental handicap is reaching boiling point.</P>
      <P>While substantial funding has been invested in services in the past, much more needs to be done. Conditions were never more favourable than at present. The parents, carers and advocates of adults and children with a mental handicap are right to be cynical. They already fear that the National Disability Authority will not be given the necessary powers recommended in the Strategy for Equality document. Why should they wait again when there is no need?  People should not have to take to the streets to demonstrate their right to day care, respite care, education and training. We should be ashamed of ourselves if we fail to address those needs now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all the information, planning and evidence we require. We simply need funding. We have agreed that money is required; all that remains to be agreed is the date on which it will be provided. Why should the House approve the Government's commitment to provide funds over <Col N="539" /> a four year period when they could be provided this year?  How can any Deputy in this House justify asking those people who for years have put up with inadequate and inappropriate services for themselves and their children to wait any longer?</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities states that its report is an ambitious one which, when its recommendations are implemented, should change the world for many people with disabilities, their families and carers. That is no less than people with disabilities deserve, nor what they, as equal citizens of this State, are entitled to. We are committed to changing the world for people with a mental handicap but let us do it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason behind this all party motion is quite clear. For the first time in the history of the State we have the resources to make a real and substantial difference to the lives of thousands of families and we now need the Government to demonstrate it has the political will to make the necessary investment. We, on this side of the House, are determined to ensure that people with a mental handicap attain full equality in Irish society. We recognise that this will entail significant investment and we are deeply concerned that the Government will not have the courage to make this investment. Therefore, the Labour Party, Fine Gael, the Green Party, Democratic Left and some of the Independents have tabled this motion in an effort to concentrate the Government on the legitimate needs of people with a mental disability in advance of the budget.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have a shameful record in their response to mental handicap. We have been remiss in the practicalities of caring for the needs of people with a mental handicap. In the past, as in so many areas of the social services, religious orders did their best. In more recent times the parents of people with a mental handicap have banded together in various organisations to campaign for basic services where the State has failed miserably in its responsibilities. The main burden has always remained with the parents and families of those with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest worries for parents of a child with a mental handicap is the total lack of respite care. These parents are saving the State many millions of pounds each year by their commitment to the care of their children. This entails enormous extra burdens on parents. Family life can be totally disrupted, usually requiring at least one parent to forgo their choice of a career outside the home. There can and often is extra stress in homes where parents try to balance the demands of the child with a mental handicap with the emotional, physical and financial needs of their other children. Many such families need structured respite care for their children at regular intervals to maintain the integrity of their family. While the rest of us take for granted such <Col N="540" /> things as a night out or a weekend away, for the parents of children with a mental handicap such events entail enormous pre-planning and effort, if possible at all.</P>
    <P>Respite care must be made available as a right. It is essential so that parents and families can continue to give loving care and affection to all their children, especially those with a mental handicap. It must be provided on a regular basis and not just in crises. It is needed so that parents can have time to themselves and can spend quality time with their other children. It also helps the child with a mental handicap to get used to the idea of residential care outside the home, a situation which may arise in the future if the parents die or become too old to look after their child. Such facilities should be provided in community or village type settings and not in decaying Victorian mental hospitals which are reminiscent of an age that many of us believed to be long gone.</P>
    <P>In this respect I welcome the announcement yesterday that the Department will provide part funding for the Eastern Health Board's redevelopment plan for St. Ita's. It is long overdue and welcome development. However, it is important to bear in mind that the development will not provide one single additional place.</P>
    <P>The urgent needs of the mentally handicapped and their families should be self-evident. Until recently the extent of the problem was unknown. However, it is now known that over 1,300 people with a mental handicap are without residential or respite care and that a further 1,000 people require day care services. In the Dublin north region of St. Michael's House, for example, there are 413 people on the waiting list for residential care, 235 of whom need places urgently.</P>
    <P>Recently, Karen Canning, Chairperson of the Parents' Future Planning Group, St. Michael's House, said:</P>
    <P>The only way to get a residential place for any of our children is for both parents to die. Fear of the future is what we all worry about. We want our children settled in a suitable residential place before we die, not an unsuitable place after.</P>
    <P>That fear and the determination of parents to ensure their mentally handicapped children are given their basic rights has led to the setting up of the National Parents' Alliance. Recently parents from around the country gathered in Dublin to establish this new organisation to campaign for a fairer deal for their children. Central to their purpose is the securing of the necessary funding for the required respite and residential services. However, issues such as the lack of choice of service, the exclusion of parents from management boards and the absence of independent advice and information are also critically important. As politicians we must respond to these legitimate demands and be prepared to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>To begin providing the necessary services an allocation of £60 million will be required in next <Col N="541" /> month's budget. This is a small sum in the context of the £1 billion in additional tax receipts this year. The halving of capital gains tax in the last budget represented a gift of at least £50 million to those who are already among the wealthiest members of society and highlighted the priorities of the Government.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has been speaking about repaying the national debt. I put it to him that it is now time for us to repay the national debt to the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>In addition to residential and day care places there is an urgent need for investment in education and training opportunities for people with a disability. I welcome the Government's decision to accept a key recommendation of the recent Report on Employment for People with Disabilities and transfer responsibility for training to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. However, the real import of that report, namely, the call for an immediate investment of £11 million in sheltered training and employment, has not been acted upon by the Government and the motion before the House this evening demands that the Government provide funding for this in the current year.</P>
    <P>The motion also calls for significant investment in education opportunities for people with a disability. In relation to this aspect of the motion I call on the Minister for Education and Science to ensure provision of equal treatment for all special needs children. Currently a child with special needs who is fully integrated into the mainstream school system receives less capitation support than a child who is not integrated into our mainstream primary education system. This policy actively discourages integration. It effectively imposes a severe financial disincentive on schools which actively strive to integrate special needs children. The policy does not serve the interests of children with special needs, their parents or the schools they attend.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is in favour of a system that provides financial support to a special needs child regardless of the type of education he or she receives. This grant would remain with the child throughout his or her education regardless of the setting or type of class in which he or she is taught. Neither the school nor the child would be penalised were the child to be fully integrated into the mainstream school system. If the Minister and the Government are serious about encouraging integration in our education system it is imperative that the Department of Education and Science's funding system be immediately reformed.</P>
    <P>Also in this regard it is essential that funding be made available to provide classroom assistance for children attending mainstream schools. It is all very well to pay lip service to the idea of integration, but unless we are prepared to put money where our mouth is and provide the necessary support, staff integration is simply not possible.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that, unless current attitudes change, the position of the parents of those with <Col N="542" /> a mental handicap can only deteriorate and this is simply not acceptable in a developed and caring society. It is time to act before we reach that stage. What is needed to assist people with a mental handicap and their families is not an enormous sum when we consider the demands that have been placed on public coffers by other sections of society. Such a commitment would be a welcome and long overdue recognition of the rights to full citizenship for all and of the unstinting care given by many parents and their families to children with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>I specifically call on Deputies Fox, Healy-Ray and Gildea to support this motion and vote for it tomorrow night. These Deputies have used their considerable influence over the Government on a number of issues in the past. This motion is of the utmost importance. It concerns the civil rights of a substantial number of citizens. To vindicate the rights of these citizens it is essential that £60 million be invested in services this year. We now have a unique opportunity to do this: what is necessary is the political will. The passing of this motion tomorrow night will place considerable moral and political pressure on the Government to progress the equality agenda and advance the cause of people with a mental disability. The support of these three Independent Deputies is critical to the success of the motion. I call on them to seriously reflect on their position this evening. Is there one constituent of theirs who is opposed to the wording of this motion?  Is there a single cogent argument against using part of our new found and considerable wealth to give decent treatment to people with a disability and their families?  The answers to these questions are self-evident. The decision rests with these three Independent Deputies. I hope after tomorrow night's vote they will be proud of the decision they took.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a range of Opposition parties and Independent Deputies could agree on the tabling of this motion on the needs of those with mental handicap. Few other issues could have brought together such a range of parties and individual Deputies, and I particularly thank Fine Gael for being so willing to make its Private Members' time available for this unique initiative.</P>
      <P>All Governments in recent times have tried to do something for the needs of the mentally handicapped and their families, but no Government has done enough. This motion is not a political attack on the current Government but rather an attempt to focus attention on the growing needs of this sector and to ensure that at a time when revenue is available on a scale never before experienced, a real effort is made to provide the residential and care places required. As stated in advertisements placed in newspapers yesterday by the federation of voluntary bodies providing services to people with mental handicap, it is Ireland's chance of a lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hallmark of any civilised society is the way in which it treats the weakest and most vulnerable <Col N="543" /> of its members &mdash; the old, the very young, the ill, the infirm and the handicapped. Judged against this yardstick, our treatment of the mentally handicapped raises questions about our right to describe ourselves as a civilised society. We have simply failed to provide the level of services required and at the speed required. This has resulted in unnecessary suffering for those with a mental handicap and has placed great pressure on their families. Thankfully, as our understanding of mental illness and mental handicap has improved, we have moved away from the 19th century attitudes which saw these people as some kind of threat who had to be locked away from public view. Most can now enjoy a warm and loving relationship with their families and many can play a happy and fulfilling role in society.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Services for Disabled People, Towards a Full Life, published 15 years ago, described the broad objective of services for those with physical, mental or sensorial handicap as being &ldquo;to equip them to realise their full potential and to participate to the greatest extent possible in the life of the community&rdquo;. Our failure to provide adequate services means that many people with mental handicap are not being allowed to realise their full potential and are being denied an opportunity to participate fully in the life of the community.</P>
    <P>That mentally handicapped people have not suffered even more has been largely due to the love and care lavished on them by their families. I welcome the families who have taken the trouble to come here this evening to listen to this debate. It is important that they listen but it is equally if not more important that they be heard. It is also due to the Trojan work undertaken by many voluntary organisations working in the area. What causes most anger and frustration to those voluntarily involved in the care of the handicapped, whether families or groups, is that the more work they do and the more they achieve, the more content the State seems to be to wash its hands of its obligations and to load even more work and responsibility on families and the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the scale of the problem is so great that families or voluntary organisations alone simply do not have the resources to deal with the problem. While the trend has been to move away from automatic institutional care, the level of handicap suffered by some is so severe that institutional care will always be required. The costs involved in caring for the handicapped and ensuring they get the treatment they need are enormous and will require substantial central funding.</P>
    <P>There are particular requirements for families caring for a person with a mental handicap at home. In many cases it is simply not possible to provide the level of care required on a 24-hour basis every day of the year. Day places are needed to provide training and support employment. With improvements in medical care people <Col N="544" /> with mental handicap are, thankfully, living longer but this in turn means they need care for a longer period. Many parents who are getting on in years are caring for sons or daughters in their 30s or 40s. Their main fear is what will happen to their sons or daughters when they are too old to care for them or when they are dead.</P>
    <P>As recently as December 1997, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, stated:</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that a parent of a son or daughter with a mental handicap should have to worry about who will look after their child when they are no longer able to care for them. I intend to ensure that their fears are allayed.</P>
    <P>I hope this is one commitment that will be honoured in full and without delay.</P>
    <P>The needs of this sector were identified in a series of reports, the most recent and detailed of which was Services to Persons with Mental Handicap: An Assessment of Need 1997-2001. The work is done and we know the extent of the problem. There is little dispute about the number of places required &mdash; approximately 1,400 additional residential or respite places and approximately 1,000 day care places. The estimated cost of providing these places is approximately £60 million. It is a substantial sum of money but today the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced a Supplementary Estimate of more than £90 million, including an additional £56 million for Garda pay. Imagine the difference the commitment of a similar amount would make to the quality of life not just of those with a mental handicap but also that of their families. The Government has already made a commitment to provide the resources to meet the needs set out in the assessment of needs. In this motion we are seeking a commitment to speed up the programme of spending.</P>
    <P>I note the newspaper reports today of the Minister's announcement about St. Ita's in Portrane, although I accept the point that some of this money has already been announced. It is a welcome and important step forward on the part of the Minister but it should highlight for us the difficulties experienced by people with mental handicap and their families in getting initiatives from any Government. This is a long and tragic saga which we, particularly the Minister, must examine and learn from. It is unfair and unkind to people who are struggling to have to put up such a battle as that fought in the case of St. Ita's.</P>
    <P>We should be more compassionate when we are living in such prosperous times. For the first time we are in a position to make a real and significant difference to people in our community who for so long have been discriminated against and forgotten.</P>
    <P>I, too, urge the Independent Deputies to live up to that name. One of them comes from my constituency of County Wicklow and I have no doubt she believes the mentally handicapped should be cared for and supported. This is the choice Deputies have to make and it is not always <Col N="545" /> easy. There are families in County Wicklow struggling to do their very best for their children &mdash; some are now adults &mdash; whom they continue to love and cherish. As Members of this Parliament we have an obligation to assist those families in the valuable work they do. I call on all Deputies, particularly those who claim to be independent, to use that independence in a way that will bring real meaning to the lives of those families.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services to persons with a mental handicap and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments which include:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of additional funding of £25 million;</P>
      <P>&mdash; a £30 million National Capital Programme, over four years, to put in place appropriate infrastructure to support the services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity tonight to speak on issues related to the provision of services to persons with a mental handicap and to outline what the Government is doing to meet the needs which have been identified for this population group.</P>
      <P>The philosophy which underpins the development of services to persons with a mental handicap is that people with a mental handicap should be given the opportunity to live as full and independent a life as possible, and to live with their families and as part of their local communities for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>Since the 1970s the main thrust of service provision has been towards the development of community based services designed to provide a range of services for both the individual with a mental handicap and his or her family.</P>
      <P>This principle has been endorsed over the years by a number of policy documents. In particular, the 1990 report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap, &ldquo;Need and Abilities&rdquo;, and more recently in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo;, which adopted three guiding principles in carrying out its work: equality, maximising participation, and enabling independence and choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These principles are at the core of the planning and delivery of services to persons with a mental handicap. While there has been a substantial investment in the services in recent years, and the overall level of service provision has been greatly <Col N="546" /> enhanced, there has also been a corresponding increase in the numbers of persons with a mental handicap in Ireland. This has led to a change in emphasis for the services with the main focus for future planning now clearly on the development of services for adults and the growing number of elderly persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, despite the many competing demands which are made on the resources available to my Department, and in particular in relation to waiting lists for services in the acute hospital sector, I have consistently identified as one of my priorities the provision of the additional residential, respite and day services outlined in the &ldquo;Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &mdash; An Assessment of Need 1997 -2001&rdquo;. I have, in the past 12 months or so allocated an additional £25 million to the services. This is more than double the additional funding allocated by Deputy Bruton's Government in 1997. I have also put in place a £30 million national capital programme, to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need, to provide the infrastructure necessary to support the services.</P>
    <P>The availability of data both on the services currently being provided and on current and future needs has enabled us to identify clearly, for the first time, the level of unmet need over a five year period and to plan to meet those needs. The national intellectual disability database is now providing us with this information and while the picture which has emerged does not surprise us, it provides confirmation of the growth in the adult population and illustrates for us how the demographics of this population group are now mirroring that of the general population, including a growth in the number of elderly people.</P>
    <P>There are a total of 26,694 persons with a mental handicap on the database. This represents an increase in the numbers ascertained across all categories of mental handicap since the last census of mental handicap was carried out in 1981. Of the 26,694 persons with a mental handicap on the database in 1996, 22,804 persons were receiving a service, 604 persons had no services and required either a residential and day service or a day service only, while 3,286 persons had no current service requirements.</P>
    <P>While our main concern must be to meet the needs of those who are waiting for placement in either residential or day care services, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 23,000 persons are already in receipt of a significant level of services. My Department will spend approximately £271 million in 1998 on services to persons with a mental handicap and while acknowledging what still needs to be done, it must also be seen in the context of the existing level of expenditure. The figures from the database reveal an ageing population in the more severe range of disability. This changing age structure among those with moderate, severe and profound disability has major implications for service planning. Decreasing <Col N="547" /> numbers of children will have implications for the educational services. The higher numbers of young adults and increased life expectancy, however, will mean that the pressure currently being experienced by adult day services will increase as this group ages and requires residential services. This is reflected in the current waiting lists for services and the changing pattern of care towards a more intensive range of service provision.</P>
    <P>Another implication of ageing and the increase in the severely disabled population will be a demand for a higher degree of support within the residential services and the need to develop specific geriatric support services. The database has identified 4,152 persons in the 35 to 54 age group and a further 1,434 aged 55 and over. So we already have a sizeable number of people for whom issues related to growing old are becoming or have become a reality.</P>
    <P>The Assessment of Need 1997 &ndash; 2001, which was published in April 1997, identified a need for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places at an estimated cost of £63.5 million over the period in question. This Government is committed to putting in place these additional services. Between 1997 and 1998, more than 500 new residential and 760 new day places have been provided, leaving a balance of more than 900 residential-respite and around 300 day places to come on stream over the next three years.</P>
    <P>While the additional services which have been put in place have made a significant difference, their impact on the waiting lists has been reduced because of the numbers of emergency admissions which had to be made to the residential services. My Department carried out a review of the emergency admissions to residential care in 1997. The average age of the 107 persons admitted to residential care as emergencies that year was 31 years. More than half of these admissions were as a direct result of the carer's inability to continue to care for a relative with a mental handicap. The age profile of those admitted as emergencies clearly demonstrates the change to a predominantly adult population.</P>
    <P>Examples of the situations which led to these emergencies included cases where the ill-health or death of the primary carer meant that their relative could no longer be cared for at home; the primary carer could no longer cope with increased behavioural problems; individuals with a mental handicap who required specialised care because of medical problems; and individuals who were considered to be at risk in their home or in other situations.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work families and carers of persons with a mental handicap undertake in caring for their relatives. I understand the frustration of families whose relatives are on waiting lists for services and the toll which both the caring and the waiting can take on their health. We wish to be of assistance to those parents in working with them and the service providers to meet the needs <Col N="548" /> which have now been clearly identified. We are really only now getting into a situation where we can develop the services in a planned and co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>The management of emergency admissions to residential care presents a major problem in most health board regions and will become an increasing feature of the services over the next decade as the population ages. This problem was particularly acute in 1996 and 1997. A reduction in the level of additional funding made available by Deputy Bruton's Government in 1996 for service development to £3 million upset the delicate balance achieved in previous years in managing the various demands on the residential and respite services. As a result, there was a large build-up of emergency cases within the services which were unfunded and which subsequently had first call on the resources provided in 1997. This in effect meant that the ability of service providers to deal with both cases on the waiting lists and emergency cases was severely restricted in both day and residential services, but in particular in residential services. This also affected the respite services in that those services became blocked by emergency cases. The knock-on effects of this drop in additional funding in 1996, when the Opposition was in office, are still being felt today.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that we should welcome the Opposition's new-found commitment to the development of the mental handicap services. In allocating the additional funding provided for new services this year, I asked health boards to begin to put in place measures to enable them to manage emergency cases. Most health boards have now set aside funding to assist with the cost of emergency admissions. The boards will be requested to develop these measures even further next year. The provision of additional respite services is vital if families are to be supported in caring for their relatives at home. As well as the provision of additional residential places for respite, this also involves the enhancement and expansion of the various &ldquo;share a break&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakaway&rdquo; schemes and the home support services. This approach will build in both a flexibility in responding to individual needs and an element of choice for carers.</P>
    <P>Since the service was initiated in 1992, the home support services have provided a variety of responses designed to meet individual needs. In 1997, more than 2,200 children and adults benefited from this service. The services provided fall within three main categories: provision of home help, enabling carers to take time off and facilitating attendance at social activities.</P>
    <P>Given the age profile of clients and carers and the general unavailability of planned respite breaks, the expansion of the residential services must be tackled on three fronts: provision for the management of emergency cases; provision for new residential places for those who have been assessed as requiring this service; and provision for an increase in the level of respite care. I have <Col N="549" /> already begun this process and intend to further develop it as additional resources come on stream.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing funding for new services, it is necessary to ensure existing services can continue to provide an appropriate level of care for their clients. The changing age profile has meant the needs of many of those in residential care have changed. There is an increasing need for more intensive levels of support as the numbers of persons who are terminally ill or suffering from Alzheimer's and other health problems associated with growing older increases. I provided additional funding to assist with these issues this year and I hope to be in a position to continue this work in 1999.</P>
    <P>In the case of some of the smaller voluntary service providers, many of which are parents and friends' associations, the historic base funding is inadequate. I am tackling and will continue to tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a substantial development in the number of residential-respite and day places available to persons with a mental handicap. These have been provided either by adapting existing accommodation, by purchasing and adapting other accommodation or by building suitable facilities. The existing facilities are stretched to capacity. Some of these facilities are inadequate and must be upgraded. A programme of new building is essential for the delivery of the services required.</P>
    <P>In late 1997 I put in place a major capital programme of £30 million for mental handicap services to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need report. This is the first time we had a muti-annual designated capital programme for mental handicap services. During the next four years this capital programme will provide for: new residential and day care facilities and the up-grading of existing facilities; the provision of alternative accommodation for persons with a mental handicap who are accommodated in St. Ita's, Portrane, St. Raphael's, Youghal, and other psychiatric hospitals and the up-grading of existing facilities which will continue to be used in the medium to long-term future; and the provision of facilities for persons with a mental handicap who require specialist services in a secure environment.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I announced the first of a number of measures which are being taken to fulfil the commitment I made, as part of the national capital programme, to provide alternative and refurbished accommodation for persons with a mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate places.</P>
    <P>A £13 million project, which will be funded jointly by my Department and the Eastern Health Board, will provide alternative and refurbished accommodation for persons with a mental handicap accommodated in facilities on St. Ita's campus. The plan provides for the development of two bungalow complexes on sites located off St. Ita's campus in Oldtown and Lusk, Dublin, and a <Col N="550" /> further two bungalow complexes on the campus. The day and other therapy services will be relocated on campus and up-graded. Some of the existing units on the campus are to be refurbished to provide appropriate accommodation for the remaining elderly clients.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Shortall stated earlier today that the development project for St. Ita's was in the pipeline for some time and that there was an inevitability about it happening. It has been a priority for the Eastern Health Board for many years but this is the first Government not only to fully appreciate the need for this development but to provide the necessary funding to make this a reality. This development project will be the biggest such project ever undertaken in relation to mental handicap services. I am particularly proud that this Government is providing the necessary resources to make it happen.</P>
    <P>I was the first Minister for Health and Children to visit St. Ita's in recent years &mdash; I visited the entire campus. Following my visit, I asked my officials to initiate discussions with the Eastern Health Board regarding the inclusion of this project in the public capital programme. The final plan was submitted earlier this summer and I responded with a comprehensive funding package within a matter of months, not because Deputy Ahearn put down a notice of motion.</P>

      <P>Funds were available in 1995, 1996 and 1997 but nothing was done. After my visit and on receipt of the board's most urgent needs for the development of the mental handicap facilities, I allocated £550,000 for the upgrading of the admission-assessment unit and commissioned the development of an acute psychiatric unit in Beaumont. Earlier this year I provided £250,000 for the mental handicap services in St. Ita's for a special maintenance <Col N="551" /> programme for the hospital. On the occasion of my visit to St. Ita's I did not get a PR machine to inform everyone I was there, I merely went out and did my duty.</P>
      <P>This investment is further evidence of the Government's commitment to the development and enhancement of services to persons with a mental handicap generally and for those persons who, due to lack of suitable services in the past, were accommodated in inappropriate facilities such as psychiatric hospitals. It is also in line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities regarding the general replacement of sub-standard facilities for people with disabilities and for those in St. Ita's hospital as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>I am also providing a capital grant of £200,000 to enable the Eastern Health Board to purchase a holiday home for the clients in St. Ita's hospital. Many of those resident in the mental handicap services have not been able to enjoy holiday breaks and this is a facility which the board and the parents and friends' association are anxious to provide.</P>
      <P>In addition to announcing the St. Ita's project yesterday, I also announced details of the allocation of the additional £5 million capital funding which I made available some weeks ago. The £500,000 to be provided for St. Michael's House and for the Brothers of Charity in Limerick, announced in Kilrush, were the only specific projects announced out of the extra £5 million I have decided to allocate over and above the £30 million multi-annual programme, the first ever provided for mental handicap services. I do not need to take lectures from the other side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I had previously announced two of the agencies which were to benefit from this funding. This funding has been allocated to assist a wide range of services, including health board and voluntary services, across the country. These agencies include among others: Stewart's Hospital, Dublin; Children's Sunshine Home, Dublin; The Irish Society for Autism; Daughters of Charity, Limerick; St. Senan's Hospital, Enniscorthy; St. Raphael's, Youghal, and Grove House, Cork; North Western Health Board's services, including Cloonamahon, County Sligo; County Longford Association for the Mental Handicapped; various Camphill communities; the L'Arche Community, Cork; Western Care Association; Galway County Association; Cregg House, Sligo; Kerry Parents and Friends' Association and St. John of God's, Drumcar.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, I have provided additional funding amounting to £21 million this year for services to persons with a mental handicap. Revenue of £10.75 million was used to meet identified needs in existing services and to put in place new residential, respite and day care places. Capital funding of £5.25 million, which is the first phase of the four year national capital programme, was provided to support new developments, and a further £5 million capital, over and above the national capital programme, was provided to meet the maintenance and refurbishment costs, some of which I have already mentioned. This £21 million, together with the £4 million capital allocated by me late last year, brings the total additional funding provided to £25 million. In the three year period from 1995 to 1997, the previous Government allocated a total of £36.22 million in capital and revenue funding, or on average just over £12 million per year. This should be compared to the £25 million I have made available in the past 12 months or so.</P>
      <P>In the past, because of the lack of multi-annual budgets, there was a much more haphazard approach to the planning of services. The introduction of multi-annual budgeting has meant that a more co-ordinated approach can now be taken, with the facility for forward planning in respect of both revenue and capital. The national capital programme is visible evidence of the fact that this approach is facilitating the planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional residential, respite and day places have been put in place in 1998. By the end of 1998, approximately 250 new residential places, when account is taken of the emergency cases, and over 300 day places will have been provided. A number of health boards have also put in place additional health related support services for children with autism who are being placed in the special classes which my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, is establishing around the country. I also welcome his recent announcement in respect of the additional supports which are to be provided for children with special educational needs, in particular those in the more <Col N="553" /> severe categories of mental handicap and those with autism.</P>
    <P>It is important that, in addition to putting in place new services and strengthening existing services, we evaluate the outcome of those services for the individuals and their families availing of them. We must endeavour to ensure that the services are targeted to meet the specific needs of individuals or groups of individuals.</P>
    <P>At the request of my Department, the Mid-Western Health Board is currently undertaking a project to look at the early intervention services for children with physical or sensory disabilities and/or delayed development. The purpose of this project is to examine the processes of referral and access to support services, beginning with the earliest stage in maternity hospitals, and working through the roles of the various other multidisciplinary inputs which these children may need and the services which they provide. This would include paediatricians, directors of community care, counselling nurses, public health nurses, community based multidisciplinary staff and specialist diagnostic and treatment services in the acute hospital system.</P>
    <P>Particular emphasis is being placed on the importance of the initiation and maintenance of the lines of communication necessary to enable parents to freely access the various services which their child requires, and on the provision of information regarding their entitlements, the support which may be available to them to enable them to access that support. I expect to have a report on the outcome of this project towards the end of this year or early in January 1999. It is my intention to circulate this information to the other health board regions with a request that they use it as a basis for examining the practices in their regions.</P>
    <P>Given the level of development which has already taken place in the area of residential services and the planned enhancement of those services over the coming years, it is important that we develop mechanisms for evaluating the outcomes for individuals of the various types of residential care. As a first step, my Department has commissioned the Centre for the Study of Developmental Disabilities in UCD to undertake a research study on residential services for persons with a mental handicap. The study will look at issues related to the quality of life and outcomes for clients residing in both community and campus based accommodation. The study will assist both my Department and service providers to begin to develop evaluation tools which will enable us to monitor and evaluate the improvements in services on an ongoing basis. As well as being a first step in developing management evaluation tools, the research will also enable us to evaluate how successful we have been in implementing the policy of community based residential services.</P>
    <P>The level of additional funding provided to date has given clear and concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to meeting the needs <Col N="554" /> identified in the assessment of need. We have demonstrated how much more serious we are about addressing these issues than was the previous Government. This commitment, together with the multi-annual budgeting framework, will facilitate a very significant development of services for those with a mental handicap in a well planned and orderly way. This will represent a huge improvement on the <i>ad hoc</i> stop-go approach to such development in the past.</P>
    <P>The £25 million additional funding and the national capital programme which is already being implemented have made a significant impact in the short period in which this Government has been in office. While at this point I am not in a position to give details about specific resources which may be made available to my Department in 1999, I have, to date, clearly demonstrated my commitment and that of the Government to meeting the identified needs as set out in the assessment of need of persons with a mental handicap. I assure the House it will remain a top priority.</P>
    <P>I have not appeared before the House to suggest that all is clear and that everything is rosy in the garden, it is far from it. However, at least now we have the mechanism by which we can evaluate our performance and the ability to seek more funds. There was just as much money available to our immediate predecessors but they did not deliver. I intend to do far better than they did.</P>

      <P>This very important motion seeks specific funds in this year's budget and specific services for those with mental handicap. I wish to put on the record the crisis that exists in mental handicap services in the south-east Dublin and east Wicklow regions.</P>
      <P>There is now an unacceptably long waiting list &mdash; the waiting period can be as long as ten years. There are 97 people on the waiting list for residential places in that area, there are 180 people waiting for respite care, there are 25 crisis places required and 22 people waiting for day services. In addition to the waiting lists, there is insufficient co-ordination and co-operation between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science in regard to the provision of education and other essential services, such as speech therapy, physiotherapy and psychological assessment. As a result, children are being deprived of either education or health related services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we solve the problems in this region? <Col N="555" /> The capital cost of covering the current waiting list for residential accommodation would amount to approximately £6 million and staff and running costs would amount to an estimated £2 million. The capital cost of covering the current waiting list for respite care, crisis care and new day services would amount to £1 million; staff and running costs would amount to £500,000. Therefore, the total amount of money required for a very large section of the population is £7 million in capital costs and £2.5 million in current costs. That region needs that money now. We also require resources for adults with learning difficulties, for special schools and classes and to integrate children into mainstream schools.</P>
    <P>On 20 October my party colleague, Deputy Barnes, and I, who represent the Dún Laoghaire constituency which forms part of this region, together with our colleagues Deputies Hanafin, Gilmore and Eoin Ryan attended a meeting in Dunmore House on the crisis which exists in the mental handicap services in the south-east Dublin and east Wicklow regions. I can honestly say that in almost 25 years of public life I was never before so struck as I was by the parents at that meeting who felt so let down by the way they and their children have been treated over many years. I am not blaming the Government for the current crisis. We all share the blame, but the Government can do something about it. There is no point in the Minister harping on about what his predecessors did or did not do. There is a crisis not only in the south-east Dublin and east Wicklow region, but throughout the country and, as Members of the Dáil, it is our responsibility to ensure it is addressed. We should also note that mentally handicapped children cannot speak for themselves. They have to speak through a parent, a parent's friend or a relation and, ultimately, through their public representatives. That is why this motion is so important.</P>
    <P>Many parents spoke at the meeting to which I referred and I took notes of their contributions. One parent told us he has a ten year old mentally handicapped son and other children. All that man is seeking is residential care five days a week for his mentally handicapped child so that he and his wife can have a break and devote time to their other children during the week. They are prepared to look after their mentally handicapped son at the weekend. Another lady told us she has a 30 year old son with Down's syndrome who is confined to a wheelchair. She is getting older and her main concern is what will happen to her son when she dies. She is not terribly concerned about the quality of her life, she is concerned about her son's future when she will not be here to look after him. Another lady told us she has a daughter with spina bifida and, among other items, her daughter is waiting for a pair of special boots. She has been waiting five months for them in this era of the Celtic tiger. Another 82 year old lady has a 38 year old son who has lived with her <Col N="556" /> all his life and her main concern is what will happen to him when she passes on.</P>
    <P>The story of another lady who attended that meeting and who has two sons is reported in this evening's newspaper. She poured out her heart at the meeting and explained the trauma she was going through with her mentally handicapped son who has severe behavioural problems. She openly admitted that at one point she had to put him outside the door because she had a knife in her hand. She said that at that moment the easiest thing for her to do was to get rid of him. I can understand her frustration day after day trying to share her time between her husband and her other child. All she wants is residential care for her son so that she can have a break, ensure her marriage will last and she can be a mother to her other son and to her mentally handicapped son. Another husband and wife, who have a 30 year old mentally handicapped son, told us they have not had a holiday or a break for many years. All they want is residential care for their son. If they could get residential care for him for five days a week, it would give them a break and some quality of life.</P>
    <P>I came away from that meeting with an understanding of the sheer sense of frustration and fear felt by those parents, and, above all, the great love they have for their children. I honestly vowed that as long as I remain in public life this issue will remain at the top of my agenda. That is the issue we are discussing this evening. It is not a question of which Minister did what, it is a question of whether we, as a group of elected representatives, are prepared to stand up for people who cannot speak for themselves and who depend on us and their parents to make their case, give them a fair chance in life and guarantee their rights under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Those people have waited many years for things to happen. Now that more income than ever is going into the State's coffers, to quote the words of a newspaper headline carried in the run up to the last general election, it is payback time for these parents and their children. All Deputies, whether Independents or members of a political party, will have a chance to do something about this issue tomorrow night. At their parliamentary party meeting tomorrow, Government Deputies should forget about amendments to this motion and consider the specific sums mentioned in it. As a group of elected representatives, we should show these children we care and put £30 million aside this year to provide residential places and £30 million to provide services and back-up facilities. Now is the time for Independents to show their independence. They should not be bought off by promises. Now is the time for Fine Gael, Labour, Democratic Left, the Greens and Government Deputies to walk through the same lobby to ensure these people get what they deserve, having waited a long time for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the many people who voluntarily or otherwise work with people <Col N="557" /> with physical or mental handicap. In my constituency there are numerous individuals and organisations who make an enormous contribution without seeking monitory gain. Through a family connection I have regular contact with the Cheshire Home in Tullow where much good work is done by the staff. The new administrator started a building programme to house some of the patients independently. While some funding has been received much more is necessary to make up the shortfall from local fundraising. Local effort has also contributed greatly to the comfort of the residents in the Cheshire Home in Shillelagh. A visit to either of those locations would make one realise how lucky one is and when questioned on the availability of funding it is very difficult to justify some of the projects that have been grant aided when the homes merely wants to replace old wooden windows.</P>
      <P>During the summer I had a visit from the parents of a young severely mentally and physically handicapped boy who they can no longer manage. I am currently assisting them to find a place in care for him, but should this not be achieved as a matter of course?  The parents of such children should at least have the comfort of knowing that if things get difficult they can automatically obtain a place for their child where he or she could be well cared for.</P>
      <P>We all remember the terrible accident involving a school bus and truck on the N11 during the summer when five people, among them two young children who attended the special needs school at St. Catherine's, Newcastle, were tragically killed. Without the fundraising undertaken by the school chairman, Mr. Harry Cullen, his staff and several volunteers, this school could not remain open. While I realise this is a matter more appropriate to the Department of Education and Science, I was embarrassed to hear that one of the handicapped children attending that school is strapped into his seat on a minibus at 7.20 a.m. until he reaches the school just after 9 a.m. How can we continue to let that situation prevail?</P>
      <P>In the run-up to last year's budget I requested the Minister for Finance to target any additional available resources at the old, the sick and the disabled and to make the educational system more equitable. One year later I make the same request. Many sections of our society are seeking additional funds. However, health care, particularly for the old and the disabled, and education should be at the top of the list.</P>
      <P>I welcome this motion tabled by the Opposition parties, but I regret the Government has failed to accept it. I look forward to the introduction of the measures proposed by the Minister. No political party has a monopoly on concern over this issue and anyone who purports to have is manipulating the most vulnerable section of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. The neglect of those members of our society who cannot speak for themselves is shameful. It is neglect at a time <Col N="558" /> when we are recognised as one of the strongest economies in Europe. Those members of our society whose minds work in a different way are considered to have a mental ability inferior to others. Nobody with a learning disability should be considered inferior. People are different and are born with a different mental ability or, perhaps, with a mental ability that has been altered in some way through accident or illness. None of us are put on this world to judge, but we are here to help and support those weaker members of our society and not put them in a position where they must beg for handouts or charity, as has been the case historically here.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government will support the motion and see its way to providing people with a learning disability and their families with the necessary support to ensure they can reach their maximum potential and live their lives to the full. Think of the value a personal assistant would bring to a young child with Down's syndrome, giving them the opportunity to attend his or her local national school. Such children deserve and have a right to be fully integrated into society. All members of his or her class in school would also benefit.</P>
      <P>The toll that a person with mental disability makes on family members cannot be underestimated. It is a full-time job, 24 hours a day, seven days per week. There is no freedom to even go as far as the local shop without providing care. These families need respite care, the type of care that will give them the opportunity to recharge their batteries away from the constant demands and worry of their home environment.</P>
      <P>Some 1,400 people are on a waiting list for residential places. Many of them are elderly parents struggling at home with their diminishing mental and physical strength, worried about their charge and who will care for him or her. Where will they go when they can no longer cope?  Why will the State not help them?  This is the torment and worry that many of these parents go through daily. The day their child was born with a disability was a sad day for them because they knew of the hard road ahead of them. These devoted parents do not deserve to be ignored. Instead the State should thank them for the support they have provided and the assistance they have given to their child.</P>
      <P>Day resource centres play another vital role in the development and stimulation of the child or adult with learning disability. It is estimated there are 2,667 people who could use these facilities. Of that number, 1,248 rarely, if ever, get out of their homes for any reason. Such a simple thing as a few hours in a day care centre can calm the frustrations, provide vital stimulation and develop a routine, all increasing beyond measure the quality of life of a very important sector of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with autism need and will also benefit enormously from special schooling and the opportunity to communicate with the assistance of a speech therapist. Spouses and family members of those who suffer from Alzheimer's disease need the support of society. They need <Col N="559" /> help, respite care and the support of day care centres.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Government's programme where it states that it recognises that disability is one of the most important social issues facing Ireland today. All the reports made since the middle 1990s spell out the gaps in the services. What is needed is a commitment by all Members to these members of our society and to give them the necessary financial support to enable these children and adults live their lives to their full potential.</P>

      <P>This motion is not just concerned with money, it is also concerned with people. It could have a great effect on the personal lives of a large number of adults and children. I recently attended a funeral of a young woman in County Mayo. There was a large crowd at the removal. As she lay in her coffin at peace with herself, probably for the first time in her short life, it was hard to imagine that she had been a handicapped person. The expressions of sympathy were usual and genuine. Her mother told me that despite all the difficulties and that while her child had a short life and a confined happiness, she was also happy her child had gone before her because during her short life there was nothing but a litany of difficulties, barriers and constant effort to get all Governments to provide facilities.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's speech, although members of the public could be confused with the litany of figures provided. I accept the Minister appreciates and understands how this issue impacts on the lives and on the minds of people. We are at a threshold because for the first time the Minister has the resources and is in a position to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the unconfined joy in the central remedial clinic a couple of years ago when the first student ever passed her junior certificate examination?  Last week I raised the issue of children travelling to special schools in County Mayo who were not and are not being provided with the facility of trained escorts on school buses. They are strapped into special harnesses, nobody is available to wipe their noses and those with special needs who may be agitated sometimes jump off the bus or at the driver. Despite this, an extension of the special pilot scheme was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution states that all children of the nation should be cherished equally. We do not do this. The Minister has provided an extra £100,000 to western care. I ask him to issue a directive to ensure that the children are given the opportunity to travel to St. Anthony's and St. Bríd's. A mother called to my office and told me I had no conception of what it is to be a mother of one of the most beautiful children in the world and to appreciate the child's smile when it knows it will have the opportunity to swim in the local swimming pool in Castlebar, which is the highlight of its week. Yet, because it is agitated and because <Col N="560" /> the driver has no trained escort on his bus the child is being left at home. That is not good enough in 1998.</P>
    <P>Every Minister aspires to make his or her mark in politics. It is a long time since the late Donogh O'Malley introduced free secondary education. Other Ministers have made their own mark, but many good ideas have been lost in the confusion of politics. The Minister has the opportunity to strike a blow for the handicapped by dealing with this motion. The Independent Members, who are not present, have told their constituents, as we all do, that if they are given the opportunity to assist they will. They now have that opportunity.</P>
    <P>When one speaks to psychiatric nurses, including those who, because of limitations, must confine their travels to the far reaches of the Barony of Erris or other remote parts of County Mayo to give injections to psychiatric patients once a fortnight in the hope they will be reasonably quiet, etc. , one begins to understand that this issue is not just about money. It is about people. Politics is essentially about people. A good, caring, determined Minister for Health and Children can set aside other matters and deal with something that every Member of the House can justify and willingly support. I received 47 telephone calls yesterday about this motion. The word is out. These people want something done. I ask the Government to accept this motion, and the Independent Deputies to listen to our words and do so as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputy Keaveney.</P>
      <P>The last speaker, Deputy De Rossa, argued strongly against having two regions, but the one-region policy he favours has not worked. There are examples of this in the western region were spending on roads has fallen by 20 per cent compared with the eastern part of the country, and there is less spending on water and sewerage schemes, airports, railways and telecommunications development. Successive Governments have failed to address this issue, particularly in the western region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made some very important points in his speech. He said a key principle of Agenda 2000 is to concentrate Structural Funds assistance, especially at Objective One level, on the poorest regions of the Community. He also said the criterion for Objective One eligibility is for a region to have a <i>per capita</i> income in GDP terms below 75 per cent of the Community average, that Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> now well exceeds this figure and, accordingly, Ireland as a whole no longer qualifies for Objective One status. Later in his speech the Minister stressed that if a part of the country were to qualify for Objective One status as a result of the proposed reclassification, this would not mean the <Col N="561" /> rest of the country would be treated any less favourably than it would have been anyway under the transition regime currently proposed for Ireland as a single region.</P>
    <P>We now have these messages in clear perspective. It has been stressed by the regional authorities for the west, the Border and the midlands that the retention of Objective One status for the three regional authorities will not adversely affect the moneys available to other regions. The regions in this group meet the EU criteria for Objective One status, and the regional democratic structure is in place in the form of regional authorities. The regions in this group are the poorest in Ireland and are losing ground to the other more prosperous regions. To provide this group with Objective One status is not &ldquo;subsidy shopping&rdquo;. It is in keeping with the EU Commission guidelines and not randomly picking counties or townlands.</P>
    <P>Whether we adopt a one-region or a two-region approach, there will have to be a regional dimension to the next national development plan, with a clear acknowledgement of the regions lagging behind economically. If the regions in the group get full Objective One status for the period 2000-06 then, for the following period, these regions may well qualify for further funding. At best the group will get Objective One status or, at worst, Objective One status in transition.</P>
    <P>To increase the visibility and effectiveness of the Structural Funds there are three objectives. Two of the three objectives are regionally based, and the third deals with human resources across the board.</P>
    <P>The first objective, known as Objective One, helps those regions whose level of development is less than 75 per cent of the European Community average to close their development gap. The calculation is based on the figures for the three most recent years available to the European Union's statistical office, Eurostat, and measured in terms of GDP per head in purchasing power parities. These regions will continue to have the same priority they currently enjoy because, according to the EU, &ldquo;they are faced with the most serious problems; lack of economic potential, employment infrastructure and skills levels in the workforce&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, some regions have already benefited from Objective One status, but five of the eight regional authority areas no longer qualify for this funding as a result. However, the European Union offers reduced funding during a series of transition years for areas such as these to help them move to self-reliance, and the five regional authority areas in Ireland are eligible to apply for Objective One transition funding.</P>
    <P>What we are debating is whether the Government should make one application for the entire country for Objective One transition funding or make a separate application for maximum Objective One funding for the west, the midlands and the Border regional authority areas. As these three regional authorities meet the criteria, they <Col N="562" /> are entitled to apply for Objective One funding which will provide Ireland with extra funds. It will also allow these regions to extend the funds available after 2006 as they will then be eligible for Objective One transition funding. These regions will also qualify for the retention of the high rates of State aid to industry. It does not mean the other regions will be denied funding allocated under a different heading. In fact, the whole country will benefit.</P>
    <P>We have eight regional authorities, and they are recognised as democratic structures with democratically elected members working to ensure that the people have a say in the funding. The three regions will also qualify for the retention of the high rates of State aid to industry. It makes sense to maximise the claim by claiming Ireland's full entitlement for Structural Funds. It is also in the national interest. It makes sense to apply for Objective One funding for the west, midlands and Border regional authority areas.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to a conference which was held in Galway on 30 October where a member of the EU Commission Mr. Esben Poulsen made it clear that the European Union would sooner rather than later phase out all funding to Ireland. He told delegates that Ireland would not qualify for Cohesion Funds after 2003, and advised bodies like the area aid partnerships, county enterprise boards and the Western Development Commission to come together and present a joint programme of development to the European Union to maximise the amount of funding. At that conference, the Galway Chamber of Commerce stated that the benefit to the region would be more than the £100 million mentioned because there was no examination of the benefits of Objective One status after 2006, and Objective One in transition status for the period 2007 to 2013 was not looked at.</P>
    <P>It is important that we retain Objective One status for these three regions, particularly to allow the high rates of industrial grants to be paid by the State to that region. The rest of the country will go into transitional status with lower rates of allowable regional aid. However, the differential rates within a country could prove a powerful incentive to investors to consider the west. Traditional industries are in decline in the west and do not offer any opportunity for economic progress, so we certainly need the infrastructural development of road, rail, airports and telecommunications to support the location of industry in the region. At the conference MEP Mr. Mark Killilea said that regionalisation would allow Ireland to draw down grant aid at a continual rate of 75 per cent over a six-year period from 2000 to 2006, funding at the maximum amount for the first three years of the period. Only then would funding taper off over the following four years. We are talking here about half the country below the 75 per cent GDP figure, half the country with only one quarter of the population. I hope we will get support tonight for what we are seeking.</P>
    <P>There are various schemes in the three regions, <Col N="563" /> particularly in the Border region. These include the cross-Border funds and the Ireland funds. We need to have these funds in place so that we can direct funding to the less well off regions. We have Roinn na Gaeltachta and Údarás na Gaeltachta which benefit many parts of my county. Those schemes are important. Nobody would suggest that those very necessary schemes should be abolished. Incentives and assistance must be in place for the people who live in the western, midland and Border regions if GDP in those regions is under 75 per cent and they have not done as well out of the Structural Funds under different Governments in recent years. I would make the same point about urban renewal. Tuam is the only town in County Galway recommended by Galway County Council for urban renewal. It is most important that we get a decision from Europe to give the go-ahead to urban renewal. It should not be said that because we have Objective One status we do not need urban renewal. Urban renewal is most important as is rural renewal. Approval for these schemes, including the Dublin docklands development, must be secured in Europe. We must ensure that they benefit the people who live in the towns and rural areas involved.</P>
    <P>Objective One status must be fought for and won for the people of the western, Border and midlands regions. There has always been agreement in the House to secure funding for regions. Developments in Dublin, such as the Irish Financial Services Centre and ring and toll roads, have been supported. It is only right now, given that there are three regions under the 75 per cent GDP figure, that the House should support what Deputies from those regions are seeking. I am glad the Minister spelled out how benefits can be given. I hope, as the Minister indicated, that a Government decision is taken soon to give Objective One status to the three regions in question.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate on Structural Funds and the Minister's contribution. Coming as I do from County Donegal, a Border county, I have a particular interest in the progress of EU funds post-1999 on two different fronts. The first is the history of how Objective One has not assisted areas such as Donegal in the past and the second is how we can progress in Border areas if we do not receive special status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Donegal is one of the counties which, on the basis of the EU criteria, will be eligible for Objective One status in the future. The calculation, which is based on the figures for the three most recent years available to the European Union's statistical office, Eurostat, and measured in terms of GDP per head in purchasing power <Col N="564" /> parities, shows that our level of development is under 75 per cent of the European Union average. One must ask the obvious question: why are we still below 75 per cent when other regions are well over 100 per cent or 110 per cent?  The statistics on job creation and unemployment in Donegal do not match the national trends. This contributes to the feeling that the Celtic tiger is, as it has been called in the House, a Celtic leopard because it only happens in spots.</P>
    <P>It is time to deal with inequality and develop the Border, western and midlands regions. They have much to offer the country and assisting the regions can only improve the lot of all the people. We constantly talk about the overcrowding of the city of Dublin, the traffic chaos in the major cities, the regional imbalances in tourism and the associated strain. Much has been said about regionalisation and the fact that it would take money from counties which are not included. However, this premise does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I understand the entire country as a unit can only achieve Objective One in transition status, but regionalisation would ensure partial Objective One status for part of the country and full Objective One status for the qualifying region with the possibility of an extension of the funding period at a different level beyond 2006. This makes sense. Is there any justification for begrudging those of us who qualify what we deserve?</P>
    <P>Few people outside the Border area realise the daily issues created by the fact that different supports are contributed to agencies and businesses only a few miles away. Some may argue that we are trying to create new borders. However, the fact remains that for years we were not given support. The facts and independent statistics prove what we in the Border region have felt for years. We are not trying to overtake our neighbours in other counties. We are only playing catch up. Grant aid for new industries is given as a reason by those outside the regions concerned for rallying against regionalisation. However, if people took a look at the situation on the ground in counties such as Donegal, they could not say honestly that we are not entitled to our share of industry. What is the alternative to the reality which exists?</P>
    <P>It is strange but the issue of regionalisation is creating a similar argument in the Six Counties. I am a member of the north-west regional cross-Border group and we have often felt the divide on an east-west rather than a north-south dimension. As a group we have moved forward in a regional manner to improve our area. We see the similar needs and difficulties. We see how structures can work on a regional basis and how true benefits can derive for places with common back-grounds or geographic locations. Our successes cross various lines and I look forward to the infrastructural development of a car ferry from Magilligan to Greencastle in the near future. The development of the A5 road from Derry to Dublin <Col N="565" /> is an example of how united a region can be in its stated aim. Many Ministers, British and Irish, have wondered how we manage to sing from the same hymn sheet.</P>
    <P>An important point is that EU funding should not be allowed to replace national or other finance, otherwise we will be back in the same position in which we find ourselves in terms of lack of additionality. Deputy McDowell mentioned the need to put away the begging bowl and take a new look at Europe. The Deputy's attitude was that we should not ask what Europe can do for us, but what we can do for Europe. However, this issue is beyond the goodwill of Europe.</P>
    <P>As other speakers said, Ireland is in a better economic position than before and this makes it impossible to retain previous supports. However, parts of the country are not doing as well as others and qualify as of right to EU funding. The only aspect with which I agree is the need for continued national support above and beyond other supports to ensure that the infrastructural needs of our underdeveloped regions are met and that they become the tigers they aspire to be.</P>
    <P>I agree with the conclusions of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. He said that regionalisation would not adversely affect the region in transition by comparison with the single region in transition option or adversely affect the Government's discretion to deal with the problem of urban blackspots, which everybody recognises. The Minister continued that the Government cannot unilaterally define regional boundaries or incorporate elements as regards eligibility for Objective One status.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that, on the positive side, regionalisation would guarantee full Objective One status and more funding as opposed to transitional arrangements for the region that qualifies. As the Minister said, regionalisation would enable that region to enjoy a more favourable State aids regime than if it was part of a region in transition. This is much needed in County Donegal. The Minister continued that regionalisation will leave open the potential for the region to qualify for transition under Objective One in the years after 2006. The negotiations ahead at European level will be tough and complex. However, I trust that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will battle on our behalf and get us the best deal. This is what the people want. The national interest is to develop the entire country and the way to do this is to focus the money where it is needed most. The money should not be replacement funds and there is a need for additionality. I wish the Minister and the Government well in achieving that aim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Kenny, McCormack and Ulick Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of great concern to Deputies on all sides that, while Ireland's economic performance is a matter of national pride, the performance of some parts of the country is very poor. While enormous economic growth has been <Col N="566" /> enjoyed, many parts of Ireland are in recession. The island has developed a dual economy.</P>
    <P>It is decision time for the Government. It must decide sooner rather than later on its bargaining position at the negotiations for the next round of Structural Funds. The Government parties have declared themselves, so why is there indecision now?  The programme for Government states that, as a key priority, Objective One status will be sought for the west, the Border region and all other rural areas suffering from population decline for the post-1999 period. Undoubtedly, this would include a county such as Kerry. In June 1997 the Government made a solid commitment to the retention of Objective One status for the underperforming parts of the country. In March 1997 the Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, stated with regard to Structural Funds post-1999 but more probably post-2000 given the time lag in issuing EU payments that we would have to look seriously at regional structures if we were to continue to benefit. He said that the new Government would have to take the issue seriously if we were not to suffer a major reduction in Structural Funds, particularly in areas where they were much needed and the work of improving infrastructure had to continue. He also said that more regional responsibility would improve the dynamism of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>On 11 September 1997 the Progressive Democrats stated that they were committed to the concept of balanced regional development and that they were examining various policy options for the best way of achieving this. They strongly supported the retention of Objective One status for the west and other underdeveloped regions.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet from the east are trying to stall the process. There have been commitments from the Department of Finance and the European Commission that there will be regionalisation. It is up to the Government to declare its policy. Reading between the lines, it is clear where the Minister stands, he favours regionalisation.</P>
    <P>The most revealing information on the issue is set out in a report by Daragh Doyle based on a highly confidential Department of Finance discussion paper leaked to <i>Business and Finance.</i> This suggests that splitting the country into two distinct regions would increase Ireland's share of the next round of EU funding by almost £120 million. The discussion paper, which outlines the shape of a possible regionalisation approach, was submitted by the Department of Finance to all other Government Departments for observations in late July. It is believed that it forms the basis for the Minister's recommendation that we should opt for regionalisation in the next funding round covering the period 2000-6. It focuses specifically on the impact of the new tactics on the industrial aid regime. The suggestion is that regionalisation would allow the Exchequer to offer significant grants to industry in the mooted Objective One region. This was confirmed in a <Col N="567" /> recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which it was stated that the Tánaiste had declared that there would be enhanced grants for investment in industry. This is significant from the point of view of the regions excluded.</P>
    <P>The discussion paper states that the new region would still meet the criterion for Objective One status, a GDP rate per head of 75 per cent, if Kerry and Clare were included. I hope my colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, will declare that Kerry should be included. A study conducted by Tralee Institute of Technology shows that the rate of GDP for Cork and Kerry combined is high but that the rate for Kerry on its own is considerably lower, although still slightly above the rate of 75 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is cautious. He does not lead from the front. He is inclined to size things up for a long time before making any comment. The Government, which has made its decision, has no option but to opt for the concept of regionalisation. It has to honour its commitments in the programme for Government. This is not about 13 counties qualifying for a certain status, about rich and poor or the urban-rural divide; it is about three distinctive regions meeting the criteria for Objective One status based on GDP.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that if nothing was done, there would be no funds available after 2006. By opting for the concept of regionalisation there would be an opportunity to draw down Objective One funds. The Government deliberately leaked information on what had happened at the meeting with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in Cork. To ask what the position will be post-2006 is like asking me who will win the All-Ireland football final in that year and which party or parties will be in office.</P>
      <P>The reason the information was leaked was that the Government wanted to soften the impact for Fianna Fáil backbench Members along the east coast when the decision was made. The IDA has highlighted the value of Objective One status. By stating that the decision would be in the country's favour the Minister for Finance kicked for touch. He has, however, confused the issue by stating that a decision will not be made until the end of March. Two weeks ago in reply to a question from me the Taoiseach said that he would like to see the matter concluded by that date rather than wait until the June summit.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet must opt for the concept of regionalisation for the reasons mentioned. This would allow major investment in infrastructure in the three regions concerned, making them more attractive from the point of view of industry, enabling rural families to continue to live in those regions thus easing the pressure in Dublin which is gridlocked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled as to why the Government is sending out contradictory signals about Objective One status. It appears it has made its decision but for some reason wishes to muddy the waters before announcing it. There is no longer any reason, after the Cork by-election, it should not be announced. At the weekend, the Taoiseach seemed to contradict his previous statements. I was heartened by his reply during Question Time in the House recently where he stressed: &ldquo;If part of the country were to qualify for Objective One status as a result of the proposed reclassification, it would not mean that the rest of the country would be treated any less favourably in EU transfer terms than it would have been under the transition regime currently proposed for Ireland as a single region.&rdquo; He further stated that &ldquo;the Government will insist that the non-Objective One part of the country would qualify for the transition regime&rdquo;, with which everyone agrees. He also stated consequently that if one region in Ireland qualified for full Objective One assistance, the other regions that benefit from the transition regime will be no worse off. He said that any extra benefits for a region qualifying for Objective One status cannot and would not be at the expense of the other regions.</P>
      <P>I was also heartened by the Minister for Finance's comments earlier when he stated:</P>
      <P>This proposition, if decided upon by the Government and accepted by EUROSTAT, would mean that a region comprising the west, Border and midlands regional authority areas would qualify for full Objective One status and thereby obtain a higher level of Structural Funds than if it were part of a single region in transition.</P>
      <P>Such a region would also potentially qualify for Structural Funds transition arrangements after the year 2006. It should also qualify for a better State aids regime for attracting new industry for the years 2000-6 than it would if it were in transition.</P>
      <P>That is as strong a case as I could make for the Government to bite the bullet and apply for Objective One status.</P>
      <P>I took this debate up on behalf of the 13 west, midland and Border counties because this region qualifies under the EU criteria for Objective One status and there is no reason why we should not proceed with it. It would redress the imbalance in spending under the current Structural Funds where £3.6 billion was spent in the 13 southern and eastern counties compared to £1.6 billion in the 13 west, midland and Border counties. This is reflected by comparing the infrastructure in both areas. I counted 26 flyovers between Naas and Dublin as I returned to the city following the Cork South-Central by-election, while on the approach to my home city of Galway, which is the major city in the west, there is one miserable flyover between Oranmore and the city.</P>

We are repeating ourselves, with constant reference to the commitment in the programme for Government to apply for Objective One status.

      <P>It is a misnomer to say this debate is timely. It should have opened several months ago in order to alert the Government that time was running out. It is totally unprepared to make a meaningful case to achieve the best result for Ireland as a whole, and particularly for the west, midland and Border counties. Regionalisation has benefits for the entire country. Commentators and Members have carelessly stated, depending on which group they were pandering to, that if Objective One stated is accredited to this region, other areas will lose. The Commissioner indicated clearly that there is an exclusive fund for regions that qualify for Objective One status which will not impinge on funding available to other areas. It is sad to think that such commentators are putting out misinformation about the claim to Objective One status in this region.</P>
      <P>It is not the case that these areas take all. I represent a western constituency and hope this debate will reflect the concern expressed on many occasions by public representatives and organisations on the ground in these areas to initiate a debate. I am shocked at the hesitancy and dithering of the Government to openly express its intentions on the matter. I do not know why it wants to keep its cards close to its chest, as the Taoiseach said previously. It seems it is just a case of pandering on the one hand to a bewildered urban population and feeding it with a diet of misinformation while at the same time indicating, as it did in the programme for Government, that it will include the west in its application for Objective One status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and Government have for too long allowed this misinformation to become the basis of a supposed policy. The Government has not made a formal or informal application to the Commission for regionalisation and Objective One status for the west, midland and Border counties. It is a pity, if not a scandal, that mixed up in this misinformation are trade union leaders. They opposed our legitimate claim to Objective One status. Lately, Members have joined in the chorus saying that if people in Dublin cannot have access to these funds, the west cannot have them either. It is time to stop this negative <Col N="570" /> debate. Nothing the Minister said earlier will help to resolve the situation.</P>
    <P>Objective One status will be obtained for the west, midland and Border counties if the Government applies for it because the GDP requirement of 75 per cent is already established. The region is currently only at approximately 67 or 68 per cent of the EU GDP average. It is a pity that the statistics upon which this figure is based are three years old because current figures show that the gap between the western regions and more prosperous areas has widened over the past three years, as opposed to what other commentators would have us believe.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, must make sure that we get what we are entitled to and clearly state its intention. There is no case for it to wait or postpone a decision any longer. We are not part of the begging bowl syndrome, often referred to by economic commentators looking for a headline to justify their existence, or Members looking for media attention. Bigger grants will be made available, through Objective One status, to these areas. However, it also means the west can make up for previous neglect. It did not get its fair share from Government in the past. Its infrastructure is inadequate to provide equal opportunities in areas such as employment, roads, water and sewerage facilities. A programme of capital investment is required to develop the area in line with more prosperous parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Social exclusion in the region must be eliminated. It a sad day for the rural population when it is told by the Minister for Finance that there is no hope for 30,000 rural dwellers. Government spokespersons have attempted to row back from this statement. What game is the Minister playing? Is he indulging in the practice of pandering to one group to set it against another?  It is too bad the Government should indulge in such games. The Minister must unequivocally and urgently state that it is the Government's intention to claim and further the case for Objective One status for the west, the midlands and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>A delegation of western Deputies who visited the Commissioner was told that an application for Objective One status for these areas does not exist. The Minister and the Taoiseach must stop equivocating and pandering to certain interest groups outside these regions and state that they are seeking Objective One status for them. The areas need the money to proceed with the many projects which have been put in train to upgrade the regions' infrastructure. The money is also needed to give them the chance to retain their population. People from these regions are emigrating and migrating in increasing numbers. The population in the regions must be stabilised and, to do that, the regions must receive financial assistance. Other, more prosperous areas received the lion's share of such assistance in previous years.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister will quickly declare their intentions on this matter. <Col N="571" /></P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate. I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.</P>
      <P>The Border region can make a particularly strong case for Objective One status. I am disappointed at the Government's waffling on this matter and that it has not yet made the application on behalf of the Border region, the midlands and the west. A survey conducted by Fitzpatrick and Associates for the Border Regional Authority shows that the Border region easily qualifies for Objective One status with a GDP <i>per capita</i> of 68 per cent. The threshold is 75 per cent. In addition, the region had to endure extra problems during the past 30 years as a result of its proximity to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of Joe McCartin MEP, I travelled to Brussels with seven of my colleagues. When I made the case for Objective One status for the Border region to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, she described the region as the necklace of counties surrounding the six counties of Northern Ireland. She said particular support would have to be given to the region and that it was entitled to such support. However, she also told me that an application for Objective One status had not been made so she could not entertain our representations.</P>
      <P>I was embarrassed and annoyed that I was making a case for a region that has been deprived for the past 30 years but on whose behalf the Government had not seen fit to apply for extra funding. If any other part of the country were involved, the Government would have made such a case. Why is the Border region being deprived of the funding to which it is entitled to enable it to catch up with developments in the rest of the country?  We are seeking nothing more and will accept nothing less.</P>

      <P>This country has benefited from European funding and has targeted it extremely well. In addition, Ireland has made a major contribution to Europe. It has contributed in many ways since joining the Union and Irish people have been good Europeans since the 6th century.</P>
      <P>Ideally, one would like the entire island to be accorded Objective One status but that is not possible. On the other hand, we should be pleased with the economic progress Ireland has made in the past ten years. EU funding and the tight rein on spending by successive Governments created an environment in which the economy could rapidly grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of regions now exceed the 75 per cent <i>per capita</i> of European Union GDP and do not qualify for Objective One status. However, three regions in Ireland qualify under the present criteria and the Minister today outlined the differences <Col N="572" /> between those regions and other parts of the country. GDP in Ireland, he said, increased by 21 per cent but in the Border, west and midlands regions it only increased by between 13 per cent to 15 per cent. Only 23 per cent of the jobs created were in those regions. The population in Dublin and the east increased from 34 per cent to 39 per cent while in the west, midlands and Border region the population decreased from 30 per cent to 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>The case for these regions is well made. The Border Regional Authority commissioned a worthwhile study from Fitzpatrick and Associates which highlights the difficulties in the six southern Border counties. Objective One status would result in a higher level of Structural Funds for these counties. It would also facilitate better State aids, particularly IDA grants. That is most important for development. While 400 new American industries located in Ireland in the past 25 years, only 14 of them located in the six southern Border counties. Objective One status would hopefully also facilitate a period of transition after 2006.</P>
    <P>If these three regions are given Objective One status, it will not be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. It will not make any difference to the rest of the country. There are two choices, Objective One status and transition for the entire country or Objective One status for the three regions and Objective One status and transition for the rest of the country. It is not a question of one status causing disadvantage for the other.</P>
    <P>Every Member acknowledges that there are blackspots in every region. They are in the regions seeking Objective One status and in Dublin which has the highest <i>per capita</i> percentage GDP in the country. These blackspots should be a matter of concern for all Members, who must seek to ensure that something is done about them. High unemployment, educational disadvantage and the problems of early school leavers and drug abuse are prevalent in these blackspots. It is incumbent on Government to address these issues, regardless of the region in which they are located. One point is worth mentioning in this regard. While more money is necessary to deal with these problems, it is not simply a question of finance. There is a great deal of bureaucracy and if there was more flexibility, it might be easier to address some of them.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that, no matter what happens, Ireland will probably receive less funding from the European Union after the current negotiations. That is due to our economic success. It is also important to recognise the investment of the national Government in social areas, particularly in health and education, and in the capital programme. I am confident we will be able to make up for any loss of funding.</P>
    <P>The Border region lags behind the rest of the country not only because of its peripherality but also because of the troubles. I would like the 12 Border counties to be given Objective One status. There has been co-operation among these counties <Col N="573" /> in the past and, as a result of the British-Irish Agreement, there is a great opportunity for development, North and South. If the 12 Border counties are given Objective One status, the region's economy will develop and regain parity with those in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister clearly indicated that, in the event of regionalisation, the inclusion of some regions would not affect other regions, which is extremely important. He also stated that this would not effect the Government's discretion to deal with problems such as urban blackspots and everyone supports him in that. He further stated that regions cannot be unilaterally defined. Everyone would like to believe that blackspots, regardless of their location, could be included for Objective One status but the Minister pointed out that this is not possible under European Commission rules. The Minister indicated that regionalisation would guarantee full Objective One status and more funding, as opposed to transitional arrangements, for the region that qualifies; it should enable that region to enjoy a more favourable State aids regime than if it were part of a region in transition and will leave open the potential for the region to qualify for transition under Objective One in the years after 2006.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision on this issue will be made in the national interest, which is vitally important. Whatever decision it makes, the Government should maximise the amount of funding Ireland receives from the Commission. It is important for the Government to recognise that blackspots exist in every region and to take action to address the problems faced by those living in those blackspots, regardless of their location. If such blackspots are not situated in areas which qualify for Objective One funding, moneys should be made available to them from the Exchequer or other sources.</P>

      <P>One must wonder what proofs are necessary to fully establish in the minds of the people who make decisions the legitimacy and the justifiability of Objective One status being granted to Border, western and midland counties. There is little doubt, particularly to those who live in these areas, that the prevailing economic and social conditions clearly highlight a situation which cannot be allowed to continue and which is totally at variance with that which obtains in many other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>As other Members stated, while we acknowledge the existence of social and economic blackspots in other areas, there are few regions &mdash; particularly on the southern part of the island &mdash; with problems as pressing as those in the 13 counties to which I refer. There are a few exceptions but their progress is impacted upon and diminished because the entire region falls well below the threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that a massive investment in infrastructure is required. The level of development needed cannot be achieved in isolation from support from Europe. My county and the surrounding <Col N="574" /> area have been given designation by the Minister for Finance and the Government in the context of the rural renewal scheme, part of which is before Europe at present for approval. That approval will have a massive impact on the possibility of private sector interests taking on the development of infrastructure. Roscommon, Longford, west Cavan, Leitrim and south Sligo are situated in the designated area to which I referred and they require major investment. In my county, an immediate investment of £30 million would be required to clear the backlog of water and sewerage scheme developments.</P>
    <P>My region will not be able to take advantage of designation or the potential opportunities it offers unless we can ensure that the basic infrastructure is put in place. Investors in the residential, tourism, commercial or industrial sectors will not be in a position to develop viable projects there unless the basic infrastructural services are in place. These are heavily dependent on our region being granted Objective One status.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that many people are leaving the west, the Border counties and the midlands to travel to the east coast. When they come within 30 minutes drive of this city, they are obliged to spend two and a half to three hours in traffic. That cannot continue. Infrastructure includes roads and rail services. The authorities can invest as much as they like in the city of Dublin and attract more people as a result, but it will only result in the destruction of a beautiful city. Physical planning is as essential to the protection of Dublin as is investment to the survival of the west. Such planning must be supported by economic investment.</P>
    <P>The city of Dublin, its native population, its corporate sector and its social life have suffered while criminals and others have gained by virtue of the fact that it is currently overpopulated to the tune of 300,000 people. Many people could live in other parts of the country, particularly in the 13 counties to which I referred earlier, if proper infrastructure, roads and rail services were put in place. My region cannot hope to put such services in place without the additional investment Objective One status would provide in the coming years.</P>
    <P>In considering this issue, we must take account of our ageing population. The presumption is that a person living in the west who reaches old age should be placed in a welfare home or geriatric hospital and consigned to obscurity. That is not good enough. The facilities that are available and taken for granted in other parts of the country must be provided in my region. I refer to recreational and sporting facilities which can ensure that those who have retired or reached old age will have an opportunity to participate in whatever physical, sporting or recreational activity they wish to pursue or enjoy.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that the technology is made available to the counties to which I referred. This will only happen if people can use road, rail and other infrastructural services. Technology <Col N="575" /> ensures that people can live and work outside Dublin, that they can purchase houses at a lower cost, that their children can have quality educational opportunities in school and that they can avail of all the services and facilities associated with a good social setting. However, they must be in a position to do their work efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>For a long period I have been of the opinion that there is more than one area in this country and that there are more justifiable reasons than ever for investment in the west, the midlands and the Border counties. Dublin's traffic problem, which I am currently examining as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, cannot be solved in isolation from the problems faced in other areas. It will only be solved by ensuring that the west, the midlands and the Border counties are given the same opportunities as the eastern region to develop, promote and attract industry and commercial activity.</P>

      <P>If Ireland loses its Objective One status it will automatically be classified as Objective One in transition. If some regions do not exceed 75 per cent of GDP, the Government faces a stark choice. Should it allow the entire country to lose that status or should it consider those regions which have fared particularly badly where <i>per capita</i> income is down and GDP has not attained the relative status?</P>
      <P>I come from a Cork region which will lose its Objective One status. People believe I am opposed to regionalisation but I am not because it is not the end of the world if places such as Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Dublin lose Objective One status. We have spoken for years about decentralisation and the number of people leaving rural Ireland. The time has come when regions such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick must face the fact that they have fared particularly well and that the proper balance in terms of regionalisation is no longer a luxury but an essential.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission is of the view that if we change our regional structure certain difficulties will arise. We have been accused of adopting a &ldquo;subsidy shopping&rdquo; approach. It is extraordinary that the Commissioner looked at Ireland in that way and did not pinpoint other countries where regionalisation has occurred. She did not, for example, refer to the fact that three regions in France have been chosen for Objective One status or that the same thing has happened in Belgium.</P>
      <P>Regionalisation is a fact in European terms. Europe wants these regions to be administered directly. The regions in France and Belgium are administered by a particular Department. There is a Department in Ireland which could administer the regions effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to tell people that funding will not be affected during the first three years of <Col N="576" /> transition but in the latter three years up to the year 2006. It will be important for the Government of the day to ensure that programmes of support match what is gained from Objective One. The Government's objective must be to set up a national programme for those regions which do not retain Objective One status so that they do not lose out.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy from Cork I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. While I do not want to take away from the west or from Border and midland counties, it is dangerous to try to divide the country into two economic regions. The best approach would be for the entire country to be classified as Objective One in transition. It would then be up to the Government to secure as much funding and investment as possible under this heading.</P>
      <P>The Government knows the problems of high unemployment in urban regions and that is where we must target funding. It is difficult to say this country has poor regions. We must recognise that it does not have poor regions, but poor areas within regions.</P>
      <P>The objective of the European Union is economic and social cohesion. Agenda 2000 recognised the progress made by the member states towards convergence. The criterion used by the Union to measure convergence is GDP, which is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced in a state or its regions. Gross national product is a measure of the production for the final demand and is therefore a measure of the income of a state.</P>
      <P>In most European countries the ratio of GNP to GDP is much higher than in Ireland. The reason is that there are more multinationals operating in Ireland than in any other European country. The inflated GDP of the south-west region can be attributed to this multinational output. As the percentage of Irish firms operating in foreign regions is less than in other countries, the return of foreign earnings to the economy is also less.</P>
      <P>Figures from the south-west region illustrate this point. In 1994 the profits from the region were estimated at £1.129 million, which is 35 per cent of the profits in the State. Of that figure, 74 per cent was earned in the chemical and electronic sectors. The remaining sectors account for 26 per cent of the profits in the region, although they provide 70 per cent of the employment. Three-quarters of the profit outflows from the region come from the chemical and electronic sectors, which are made up of foreign owned multinationals. This underlines the fact that GDP, which is a measure of output, does not reflect the true position in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> The regions seeking to retain Objective One status on the basis that their GDP is lower than the European average are making an argument which must be recognised. However, if one looks at the figures published by the Department of Finance on disposable family incomes as a measure of the standard of living, it is clear that two regions, the west and the midlands, are well above the south-west region. The ESRI conducted research into poverty which showed that between 1987 and 1994 the risk of poverty fell for people in rural areas but rose for city based households, with Dublin showing the worst growth in poverty statistics.</P>
    <P>These figures underline the fact that a single measure cannot reflect the economy of a region or state. There is a difference between choosing GDP or GNP as a measure of the well being of the State. The two figures for this country give a completely different picture. I have no doubt there are poor regions in the west, the midlands and the Border areas. However, there are also poor areas in the south west, such as those in Cork city, in Dublin's inner city and in our large urban areas.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance that if we divide the country into two regions the needs of areas of high unemployment and social exclusion will be addressed and will not be forgotten by the Government. We should not create borders at a time when we are attempting to break them down. We should maintain the <i>status quo</i> which will assist the Government in having a countrywide distribution of new investment funding for manufacturing.</P>

      <P>Much of the discussion has been generated by Members from the 13 counties which want to retain Objective One status. The criteria for determining that status, which is based on GDP, should be examined. An artificial measure in terms of GDP is probably given for the strength of the economy in my area, the mid-west, due to the large electronic multinationals which have large outputs. Outside Limerick city, many of the difficulties encountered in the western counties and the midlands are likely to be found, such as inadequate infrastructure in terms of water and sewerage schemes, poverty and 20 per cent of the rural community being composed of small farmers. If people were asked the level of GDP, they probably would not be able to answer. However, if they were asked the weekly family income, they would probably answer immediately. GDP is an artificial measure. The average family income in the mid-west is probably about £18 a week less than in western and midland counties which form part of the 13 seeking to retain Objective One status. In that regard, there has been distortion in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of me as a representative of the mid-west region if I did not focus on and articulate its concerns. County Limerick is finding it difficult to attract industrial development. Industry is not attracted to greenfield areas which <Col N="578" /> exist in small rural communities. They require industrial premises and gravitate towards large urban areas which probably have a technical college and industrial premises. Were I to agree to the approach being adopted for the negotiation of the next round of Structural Funds for 2000-6, there is a distinct possibility that the amount of industrial development in the area I represent would diminish.</P>
    <P>Communities are being polarised. Deputy Clune was right in one respect when referring to poorer counties. There are poor regions in every county, so how can specific regions in the country be isolated and be described as poorer, thus ignoring other poor regions which exist in other counties and certainly in my area?  I am concerned about the direction being taken. I bid good luck to the Deputies from the western, midlands and Border counties who fight their corners. The rest of us are also here to articulate the concerns of the areas we represent. I am concerned the mid-west, the region I represent, will suffer if Ireland is divided for the purposes of retaining Objective One status for certain areas.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed with the contribution of the Minister for Finance. He and the Government have maintained the same position for the past two to three months. They have given no indication other than to say they support every position. That is not the manner in which a Government should operate. It should be seen to be solid, constructive and to make a decision. When we visited Brussels, we met Commissioner Wulf-Mathies who explained in no uncertain terms that it was up to the Government to put forward the case on behalf of the country. That was a number of weeks ago and nothing has happened since. Having listened to the Minister for Finance, it seems nothing will change.</P>
      <P>We were led to believe by a spin put on the story and relayed through local radio and newspapers that a decision would be made next Tuesday. The Government, however, has not made a decision and it is obvious it will not make one. It will wait until the last minute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Many months ago, the Council of the West asked me as a Deputy representing the constituency of Longford-Roscommon, which is both in the west and the midlands, to attend a meeting in the Shelbourne Hotel. I explained at the meeting that one could talk to the Deputies representing the area until the cows came home but that they were all in favour of the obvious. It is so obvious it is hard to believe the Government is stalling on it. That is the most surprising aspect. It says it supports the position but it has done nothing about it. What it has done over the past months <Col N="579" /> is to stall. Had it adopted a proper approach to the issue, there would be no problem with negotiations with the EU. What has happened is that the Government has done nothing and the chances are the proposal will be ruled out of order because no structure has been put in place.</P>
    <P>The people of Longford-Roscommon need all the support they can get. The Government may yet deny Objective One status to the constituency, the west and Border counties because it has done nothing constructive &mdash; Commissioner Wulf-Mathies was the first to say that to us in Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I will focus on two issues; the alleged partition of the country and the benefit of Objective One status not only to the three regions but to the country as a whole. Repartition has already occurred on an economic basis and no one should forget that. The spending pattern for the current round of Structural Funds is contributing to the increasing disparity. For example, under the Operational Programme for Transport, the west received 7 per cent of total spending between 1994 and 1996. This is a much lower percentage than is required given the infrastructure deficit, the length of roads and railways requiring upgrading and the need to reduce peripherality costs for industry and services. The region has 10 per cent of the State's population but 20 per cent of the land mass. The position is similar with other operational programmes. This must be deliberately corrected if the position of the west is to be reversed and the elimination of regional disparity within Ireland is to be promoted. A policy of targeting Structural and Cohesion Funds to those regions lagging behind must be in place for the years 2000-6.</P>
      <P>Objective One status for the west, midlands and Border counties would not only be of benefit to those regions but also to the rest of the country. There are major problems in the east with housing, traffic, sewerage and other services. Objective One status would help encourage industry to move from the east to the less developed regions of the west, midlands and Border where such problems do not exist and will not exist for the foreseeable future. This would reduce the pressure on services in the greater Dublin area which would require less transitional EU and Exchequer funding. Without Objective One status, all State grants and tax designation would be severely restricted in the three regions. These grants and tax breaks are now being questioned as regards the Dublin docklands development. Can we allow the EU to object to such support in under-developed regions?  The loss of State aid would jeopardise further inward investment by multinational companies and the expansion of indigenous industry in the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Dublin Deputies spoke of the disaster which would unfold if the country is split for EU funding. I warn those Deputies that everyone accepts that the regions need priority EU funding <Col N="580" /> and that without regionalisation of these funds, urban blackspots will pale into insignificance compared to the disadvantaged regions which I represent. Objective One status will not only benefit the west, the midlands and the Border regions but the whole country. It has been made clear that the rest of the country will not lose a penny as a result of regionalisation. However, the attitude of some politicians is that if they cannot have Objective One status for their region, no one should.</P>
    <P>The population in the west has been declining for years. They have been coming to Dublin and other major population centres. We want our young people back and the only way we can do so is through Objective One status and the targeting of Government funds towards these regions. I urge the Government to initiate Objective One status for these regions immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is unfortunate in that a division is arising between different areas. The Government will have to counteract this by initiating a positive plan towards areas within regions which will not be designated. There are poor regions in areas which will not retain Objective One status. For example, County Limerick is part of the mid-west but it is not a homogeneous area. Those parts of the county not serviced by main roads have higher levels of unemployment and population decline than most areas, particularly in the west of the county. A major concern is the population decline in towns and villages.</P>
      <P>Agriculture and the processing of agricultural products account for 62 per cent of employment in the region and we know what is happening with agriculture. Large areas of County Limerick are receiving the pittance which the Minister for Agriculture and Food is paying out because of the fodder crisis. This indicates the difficulties being experienced. County Limerick is more dependent on farming for employment than County Longford which is designated as a rural area for tax purposes. The Government will have to ensure that special programmes are introduced to counteract the situation which will arise as a result of the changes which will inevitably occur.</P>

      <P>South-west Cork comprises three peninsulas &mdash; Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and the Beara peninsula. I do not have to remind the Minister of the serious disadvantages which the inhabitants of this region are labouring under, trying to eke out a frugal livelihood in a job starved area which embraces the towns of Bantry, Castletownbere, Dunmanway, Schull and Skibbereen. What other region has a mountain range known as &ldquo;Hungry Hill&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area has suffered from emigration for the past 50 years. The majority of its youth has emigrated to make a living in England, the US, Canada and Australia. It is not blessed with large tracts of fertile farmland. It only has thin layers of soil nudged between rocks. The region has poor infrastructure, no airport, no railway network and <Col N="581" /> not one mile of national primary road. The pier in Bantry cannot cater for the mariculture industry in the area.</P>
    <P>The south-west and north-west of County Cork, like the neighbouring region of south Kerry, are neglected and starved of their rightful share of industrial and infrastructural development. We have only received the crumbs which fell from the table of EU funding.</P>
    <P>The area from Malin Head to Mizen Head was always identified as the real disadvantaged area of the country. What genius advised the Minister to designate south-west Cork and south Kerry for Objective One status in transition while the 13 counties of the west, the midlands and the Border region are classified for Objective One status?</P>

      <P>A columnist in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently argued that rural Ireland no longer exists. This view is testimony to the huge gap between many political and media commentators and the reality of life for tens of thousands of citizens who live outside the large towns and cities. I would invite that commentator to travel the deplorable roads of Cavan with me, as I have done extensively in recent months, and assert that rural Ireland and rural disadvantage do not exist. The comment is indicative of a narrow and negative view which is widening the divisions in society. This narrow view has been on display in the debate on Structural Funds. This has been a heated debate, inside and outside the House. As a result, a clear choice has been made unnecessarily complicated.</P>
      <P>Because of their misunderstanding of the question or a narrow vested political interest, some commentators have muddied the waters and made the debate baffling to many citizens. I wish to record my support for the regionalisation of the State and the retention of full Objective One status for the west, the midlands and the Border regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The core argument in favour of regionalisation is the need to recognise the disadvantage born of historic experience in the three regions which have enjoyed the least economic development. No amount of obfuscation can get away from the reality of the disparity between regions. The concentration of the best infrastructure and the bulk of industry and commerce in the east and south <Col N="582" /> is a reality. A two track system already operates whereby those regions which were disadvantaged before Objective One status was ever heard of, are still disadvantaged in comparison with other regions. They are running to stand still while other regions speed ahead.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, emigration has declined in most of the country and net immigration is being experienced. However, for many communities in the predominantly rural areas of the three disadvantaged regions, the loss of young people, aging populations and high old age dependency ratios are real social problems. The landmark NESC report published last year showed that the four worst affected counties of Cavan, Leitrim, Mayo and Roscommon have lost about one-fifth of their people in the past 45 years and require special regionally and locally based measures.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the measurement of disadvantage for the purpose of Objective One status. The average <i>per capita</i> GDP of a region is not a totally satisfactory way of measuring poverty and disadvantage. It is true the income of individuals, families and local communities, rather than big regions, is the best measure, but it surely tells us something is amiss when there is a disparity of more than 50 per cent in the <i>per capita</i> GDP between the three disadvantaged regions and the Dublin region. In any case, the reality is that this is the method of measurement chosen by the EU and it is not about to be changed in advance of decision time on the regionalisation issue by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The choice before the Government, therefore, is clear. It may seek Objective One in transition for the entire State, or regionalisation, with the west, Border region and midlands retaining Objective One status while the rest of the State would be designated for Objective One in transition. It cannot be emphasised enough that under the regionalisation proposal, those regions not designated with Objective One status will not lose out. Whether or not regionalisation is adopted, they will have Objective One in transition. Once this reality is recognised, the argument of those opposed to regionalisation falls.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may misunderstand the regionalisation proposal and genuinely fear their region or the disadvantaged sections of society in general will lose out. I share that concern but believe the fear is a groundless one in this instance. Others may understand the regionalisation proposal quite well but may not be above using a bit of scaremongering for short-term electoral advantage. The latter category, if there are any such people, are doing their constituents and the country as a whole a disservice. From the tenor of the speech of the Minister for Finance, it seems the Government is leaning heavily towards the regionalisation proposal. I urge it to take that approach. I commend the efforts of the many campaigning groups and individuals throughout the disadvantaged regions which have taken up this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> I will briefly address two other key aspects of the regionalisation issue. The first relates to the need for an all-Ireland approach. Speaking on the Western Development Commission Bill, I urged that we consider the establishment of a cross-Border development commission which would focus on the disadvantaged areas west of the Bann which, in economic terms, are really at one with the Border counties, the west and the midlands. We need to recognise the reality of this east-west division on this island in economic terms and seek to redress it in a co-ordinated manner. The second matter relates to the need for decentralised democracy. The meaning of decentralisation in this State has been reduced to the relocation of Government Departments to towns outside Dublin. This is not true decentralisation. The disempowerment of local government continues and the proposals of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for local government reform fall far short of what is required. We need to restore local power as a democratic right.</P>
    <P>Truly democratic local and regional structures, in conjunction with central Government, are the best agencies to plan for the use of EU and State funding for the regions and their communities. We have a plethora of agencies, authorities, development boards and partnerships, some of them overlapping in purpose and territory and most of them doing very good work but testifying, through their very existence, to the lack of long-term planning by successive Governments and to the failure to streamline bureaucracy. Truly empowered local and regional government, properly funded and with genuine community participation is the proper vehicle to lead local and regional development. I reaffirm my wholehearted support for the proposal &mdash; and hopefully for the intent &mdash; of this Government to establish a regionalised approach to the need for Objective One status for the Border counties, the west and the midlands. Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the merits and demerits of regionalising the country for the purpose of Objective One funding. Despite the entire country having had Objective One status in recent years, some areas did not benefit to the same extent as others. When we entered the last round of Structural Fund negotiations, the entire <Col N="584" /> country qualified. The large urban areas and others which benefited from Structural Funds were granted Objective One status on the backs of urban and rural black spots. There are many areas outside of the 13 counties currently included for the purposes of regionalisation which require and deserve special attention. I refer particularly to my own area, Cork north-west and in particular, Duhallow, which has not seen any inward investment from the IDA over the past 25 years. I appreciate the difficulties in regard to attracting employment into rural areas but a concerted effort must be made, perhaps through Exchequer funding, to ensure these black spots in rural Ireland do not suffer further. It has been asserted by some that if Objective One status is retained for some regions, it will be the salvation of those regions in terms of population increase and the provision of services. Some areas suffered even when the entire country had Objective One Status and a targeted approach must be adopted towards those areas.</P>
      <P>While discussion and debate on Objective One is welcome and encouraging, it is important to state that nothing has yet been finalised and the details of any areas which may not retain Objective One status have not been provided. It is my understanding that none of the agricultural price supports will be affected by the withdrawal of Objective One funding. Price supports, including suckler cow and beef premia, come from the guaranteed side of European funding. These will continue as they are at present and from the end of the current tranche of European funding, I understand headage payments will also come from the guaranteed fund although they are currently administered under Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>REPS payments come from Structural Funds and are 75 per cent funded by the EU. My understanding from officials in the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food and EU offices is that these payments will continue at the current rate of £50 per acre. It is a legal entitlement that such payments be made at the same rate in both Objective One and Objective One in transition areas.</P>
      <P>The basis of regionalisation is to secure as much funding as possible from Europe in the next round. It is a foregone conclusion that Ireland as a whole will not qualify for Objective One status. If we insist on entering the next round as a a single entity, it will be as Objective One in transition. This will not serve us well as we would lose out on much of the funding which could be secured by regionalising the country. By accepting Objective One in transition status for some areas, those areas will maintain the same level of funding for the first few years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Periods of three and four years have been mentioned. There is a perception that funding will cease if we lose Objective One status. Looking ahead, once the next round <Col N="585" /> of funding ceases in 2006, agricultural payments, although they will be subjected to change under Agenda 2000, are set to remain the same and will not be affected by areas being included or excluded from Objective One status.</P>
      <P>Benefits which do not accrue to Objective One in transition areas include funding for industrial development, forestry payments and payments for research and development in agriculture. As most research and development payments are currently made to Teagasc, such funding will continue as in Objective One areas. The majority of funding for IDA and Enterprise Ireland comes from the Exchequer. One of the most serious issues which will affect areas moving into Objective One in transition status is the cap which will be put on the amount of funding paid by the Exchequer to groups such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to attract industry. It is essential that employment is encouraged in rural and black spot areas to secure their future. For far too long we have seen too many people leaving the countryside and moving to towns and cities. We have lost population and are now losing services which cannot be maintained due to the loss in population. The decision to bring industries to the regions is a welcome development and must continue. I understand ESF grants paid to students attending college will not be affected by moving to Objective One in transition status.</P>
      <P>I know there are difficult decisions ahead. People have spoken about dividing the country. Heretofore the country has been divided into disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged areas. It is logical to ask why the basis for that division was not used in the regionalisation of the country. I understand the figures used in dividing the country into disadvantaged areas for agricultural purposes were based on agricultural income while the division now is based on GDP of the entire region. I appreciate that regions like Duhallow and most of Cork north west are suffering because they are linked to the Cork-Kerry region where there are a number of very wealthy areas. I appeal to the Ministers and the Government to ensure something is put in place in these regions to stimulate economic growth.</P>

      <P>I wish to address the important points raised by many Deputies during this debate. Clearly, there are still many misconceptions about the implications of regionalisation and I hope I will be able to dispel many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of whether regionalisation means extra money for Ireland has been raised, particularly in reference to a leaked report of a recent discussion between the Taoiseach and Monika Wulf-Mathies. The Commissioner may have <Col N="586" /> given no guarantee that regionalisation would mean a greater overall take for Ireland and, frankly, one would hardly have expected her to do so. It is not for her to encourage or discourage us in this matter and quite properly the Commissioner refrained from doing either. As she made clear the issue is an internal one.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies and commentators to bear in mind that we are in the middle of negotiation on the next round of funding which involves not only the Commissioner but other member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not and the Deputy knows that well.</P>
      <P>We must be discriminating in our interpretations in the light of this and not over anticipate the end result. Nothing is absolutely guaranteed. We know from the new regulations which are still in draft form that an Objective One region does better in terms of transfers than a region which does not have such status or a region in transition. This is where the negotiations are at present. However, there is much more to the negotiations than the single issue of regionalisation and I appeal to everybody in their debates and deliberations, which are quite legitimate, not to forget this.</P>
      <P>Whoever is responsible for leaking official reports and papers does no service to the country or our negotiating position. There is sufficient significance in the regionalisation issue, quite apart from the amount of funding gained by it, for the deep and careful consideration being given it by the Government. Far from being some ploy to gain extra funding, how much or how little is received is not for debate at this point. It is a serious attempt to apply the existing ideas and policies on regional development and concentration which are arising in the context of the next round of Structural Funding.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies made the case for urban and rural black spots. Learned studies and analyses have been produced and quoted which show high levels of deprivation, unemployment and income shortfalls in certain areas. I do not intend to cast aspersions on these studies which are perfectly valid in their own right and have a legitimate part to play in the setting of our priorities for the next national plan. However, those who use these studies as an argument against regionalisation are extremely wide off the mark. They are mixing, for example, oranges and apples in a manner which I am sure the learned authors of the studies could not support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> We have no choice as to the criteria used for the designation of regions for Objective One status or any other purpose. GDP is the measure accepted across Europe and there is no way we would gain acceptance for a range of other statistics however compelling in their own way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa quoted more than 100 such black spots. Does anybody seriously believe we could gain acceptance for regional classification changes to give all of these areas Objective One status?  If we have 100, there will be 1,000 across Europe as the authors of the Drudy, Punch and Ross report readily accept.</P>
      <P>There is a valid case, and one readily accepted by the Government, for addressing the needs of urban black spots and nobody need be in doubt as to the Government's determination to do so. The important point is that irrespective of regionalisation, the difficulties which exist in urban black spots will and must be addressed in the national plan and the Government is centrally and publicly committed to that process. These black spots exist whether the country is treated as a single region or more than one region. Regionalisation is not in any sense counter-productive in relation to these problem areas. They will have to be addressed irrespective of whether regionalisation takes place and the Government intends doing this.</P>
      <P>I wish to briefly examine Objective One status for Northern Ireland. The same comments I have made on share out equally apply here. Here again comments attributed to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies are ascribed some kind of conclusive character relative to the eventual outcome of the negotiations. Of course we support Objective One status for the North. Commissioner Wulf-Mathies must speak against the background of ongoing negotiations. Regionalisation in the South would raise the question of the cross-Border county status and, if granted, could only support the efforts being made to secure a more generous deal on that side of the Border.</P>
      <P>There is nothing contradictory in an approach which aims to ensure that no region on this island, North or South, which deserves a better deal from Brussels in the next round than the current transition proposals give it should be sold short.</P>
      <P>I will address some of the interesting questions Deputy McDowell raised. I am glad he sees the validity in State aid. My officials will try to supply answers tomorrow to the specific questions relating to State aid grant levels. Obtaining a more favourable State aid regime for a region will allow us, if we choose, to offer higher levels of assistance in the promotion of job creation and industrial development. The Minister for Finance outlined clearly the reason the game is worth the candle, the phrase used by Deputy McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference to possible assistance from the EU after 2006. It is undoubtedly true that the <Col N="588" /> Commission will have changed by then but it is likely that the precedent set this round for transition treatments will be retained in the future for regions graduating from Objective One status. It is understandable that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies will not give a commitment on this. No Commissioner would wish to commit a future Commissioner to a particular view. This is the normal convention.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy, and Deputy De Rossa who made the same point, that the regionalisation proposal is a genuine effort to address the problem of the regions that are lagging behind. As the Minister explained, there is no basis for the allegations that this would be a divisive step. Regionalisation would not take one penny of EU funding away from the other region. That region will not be any worse off than if the whole country were in transition.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers suggested changing the eligibility criteria used for selecting Objective One regions. The room for manoeuvre is almost non-existent. We have pressed our case in Europe on these aspects including the GNP-GDP differential, the infrastructural backlogs and so on. It is simply not open to us to introduce special pleading in respect of income and other statistical data that may favour this or that region. The Commission simply would not and, in fairness, could not accept such criteria for us without accepting them for a host of other regions throughout Europe.</P>

      <P>GDP may have drawbacks, and we have pointed to those in the negotiations, but it is the only generalised criteria of regional prosperity which stands a chance of acceptance across all member states. We must be realistic about this. Some Deputies pointed to our growing prosperity as a reason for setting aside the begging bowl approach, and the Government fully accepts this. Regionalisation is not about the begging bowl but about a wholly respectable and important part of EU policy, namely, the development of the regions that is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not being present in the House on Thursday afternoon last for the Adjournment Debate. My absence was not intentional. <Col N="589" /> I left the House before the notification arrived.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue now because the country's finances are in a good state and it is time for us to consider people who do not enjoy the quality of life enjoyed by most of us. I am talking about people with a disability who need whatever benefits they can get to make life a little easier for them.</P>
      <P>The free telephone rental allowance should be given to people with a disability, particularly those who receive disability benefit. As far as I am aware, disability benefit is not means tested but there is a condition in respect of the free telephone rental allowance. A telephone is vitally important to a person with a disability because he or she must be able to contact a relative or friend in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The current position is that people with a disability who live with their spouses are entitled to the free telephone rental allowance, but if the spouse works outside the home they do not qualify. I am aware of a small family in which the recipient of the benefit has four children of school-going age. The mother has a part-time job which is necessary to bring in much needed income to help with household expenses. For that reason, the person with the disability is alone in the house from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. To all intents and purposes, that person is living alone and is in need of a telephone.</P>
      <P>Another case with which I am familiar concerns an adult son living with his widowed mother. The mother has a part-time job which is necessary to bring in much-needed income to the household. Again, that person has been denied the free telephone rental allowance.</P>
      <P>These cases are not widespread and we should show generosity when everybody else in the country is doing well. I ask the Minister to favourably consider these cases and extend the free telephone rental allowance to the category of people I have mentioned. We should show some generosity which is currently not being shown. We are rather stringent in respect of people who suffer from multiple sclerosis, spina bifida and other conditions. Some people were born with these conditions and they have struggled to make the most of their lives and contribute to their communities.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State's reply will be favourable to this request. It would be very much appreciated by me and many other people who are interested in this area.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is available to people living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment, and who are living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition. This condition is not applied in the case of <Col N="590" /> persons aged over 75 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment. This allowance is also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions. In addition, widows and widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>Persons under the age of 66 must be in receipt of one of the following qualifying payments from this Department: invalidity pension, blind person's pension, unemployability supplement or workmen's compensation with disablement pension for at least two months, disability allowance or a social security invalidity pension/benefit or equivalent payment for at least 12 months, from a country covered by EU regulations or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security arrangement.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions of the free telephone rental allowance is that the applicant must be living alone or with persons who would be incapable of obtaining help for them in an emergency. Those excepted under this condition include dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full-time education and/or a qualified adult under age 66 where the spouse/partner has a disability which is medically certified or a qualified adult aged 66 or over where the applicant or their spouse/partner has a disability which is medically certified and/or a person getting any of the above listed qualifying payments where the applicant or the person living with them has a disability which is medically certified and/or other disabled people who have a disability which is medically certified and/or a person providing the applicant, or another person living with them, with full-time care and attention where the applicant or the other person has a disability which is medically certified.</P>
      <P>An additional change announced in the 1998 budget allows for people who are in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind person's pension who transfer to certain other social welfare pensions &mdash; for example, widow's and widower's contributory pensions &mdash; to retain their entitlement to the free schemes. This measure extended the arrangement which allowed only invalidity pensioners who transferred either to retirement pension at age 65 or to widow's/widower's contributory pension at age 60 or over, to retain free schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 170,000 people in receipt of a free telephone rental allowance at an estimated cost of almost £30 million in 1998. Of this number, approximately 16,000 are in receipt of a disability type payment. The cost of extending this scheme to all people with disabilities, regardless of means and household composition, would involve a very large increase in expenditure. For example, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities estimate that there are 360,000 <Col N="591" /> people with a disability in the State. The estimated annual cost of paying a free telephone rental allowance for this number of people is in the region of £63 million. The free telephone rental allowance, as part of the free schemes, was originally designed to benefit mainly older people who were living alone and required additional assistance. The purpose of the allowance is to provide an element of protection and security in their homes for older people and people with disabilities to enable them to summon help in an emergency. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, the Minister will arrange to have it examined in my Department. Otherwise, the Deputy's proposal will be examined as part of the review process. The outcome of the review will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter to give the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation an opportunity to make a statement to the Dáil regarding the uncertainty surrounding the future of the National Conference Centre because of the European Union's reluctance to fund the docklands development. Since the worrying reports surfaced regarding problems with European Union funding, the National Conference Centre problem has worsened with further reports of divisions deepening between the company developing the conference centre and the State body charged with redeveloping Dublin docks and the fears that the project may not go ahead if the dispute is unresolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Business Post</i> reported on 8 November that the Spencer Dock Development Company may not proceed with the project unless a planning dispute with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is resolved quickly. Mr. Richard Barrett of the Spencer Dock Development Company was quoted as saying that he would be lodging complaints about the Dublin Dockland Development Authority's handling of the project with the Minister for Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor General, as well as the Committee for Public Accounts on Monday last. I understand that those complaints have been lodged. He is quoted as saying that the future of the centre was now in serious jeopardy because the Dublin Docklands Development Authority had refused to confirm that it will not object to the granting of planning permission for site preparation work, a permission granted by Dublin <Col N="592" /> Corporation last month. He described the situation as completely disastrous and gave the opinion that nobody could do business with the Authority. He also said that they were impeding development in the docklands when they are supposed to be promoting it.</P>
    <P>An allegation has been made by Spencer Dock Development Company that the Dublin Dockland Development Authority had asked for a £50 million payment in return for speedy planning permission for the conference centre. If the situation is not resolved and an objection is launched, a further four months delay could elapse before a decision on the site works appeal is given. If that delay occurs, the £25 million funding from the European Union may be lost and that would sound the death knell for the whole project as the centre must be completed by December 2000 to qualify for these funds.</P>
    <P>As I said, the dispute between the Spencer Dockland Development Company and the Dublin Dockland Development Authority is one issue but the threat that the European Commission will block tax concessions which were to benefit the site of the planned conference centre project is another issue. Allied to this are media suggestions that senior civil servants within the Department of Finance are unconvinced that the project is commercially viable.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is in the United States, but it is important that the Minister of State makes a statement of clarification assuring us that the Minister is adopting a hands on approach and that he has called together the different parties to ensure that no fatal delays arise in the development of the project.</P>

      <P>The current tender procedure for development, with financial assistance from the European Union, of a National Conference Centre announced by the Government in July of last year was organised by Bord Fáilte. Bord Fáilte conducted the procedure under the aegis of the independent management board for product development which adjudicates on applications for assistance under the cofunded tourism operational programme. The procedure was run under the terms of EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full tender submissions were received from five consortia and that submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited to develop the project at a site in Dublin docklands was recommended for forwarding by Government to Brussels. The Operational Programme requires that decisions on grant applications of this size must be made with the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost benefit analysis. The cost benefit analysis, undertaken by independent consultants, was favourable towards the project <Col N="593" /> and, on 16 September, the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ecu grant towards the cost of developing the project. This submission was forwarded to the Commission on 28 September where it is currently under examination. The Commission's response is now awaited. In relation to taxation matters, I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that he has indicated on several occasions recently that there have been difficulties in securing European Commission approval for various tax incentive schemes. The origin of our present problems with the EU Commission in this area goes back to May 1997 after a media report about the extension of the enterprise areas tax reliefs by the previous Government to Knock Airport in the 1997 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>As regards the Custom House docks area in Dublin, the State Aids Directorate of the EU Commission was formally notified in January of proposals to give the same tax reliefs to a 12 acre extension to this Dublin docklands area. The tax reliefs involved were accelerated capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of commercial buildings, double-rent relief for ten years for the lessees of these buildings and rates remission on a sliding scale for ten years. Despite several meetings since January between the Department of Finance and the relevant EU officials no EU approval has yet been received for these proposals.</P>
    <P>It transpired during the course of the year that the EU Commission was regarding the double rent relief and the rates remission as operating aids and contending that these two reliefs should, in general, no longer apply for new projects for ten years because Ireland has moved from a country coming under Article 92(3)(a) of the EU treaties to one coming under Article 92(3)(c) as a result of the recent significant improvement in the Irish economy. Article 92(3) states that the following may be considered to be compatible with the common market:</P>
    <P>(a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious under employment, and</P>
    <P>(c) aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.</P>
    <P>The State Aids Directorate interprets these provisions in accordance with its own guidelines and with European court decisions and in the context of recent relevant economic data for the areas involved. More favourable State aid rules apply to a 92(3)(a) area than to a 92(3)(c) area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The booming economy in Ireland affords us a unique opportunity to provide adequate funding for primary education. The capitation grant of £50, payable to primary schools, is derisory. It is £127 less than the capitation grant for post-primary schools, which is considered inadequate. Primary education has been the poor relation since the foundation of the State. This is exemplified in Bryan McMahon's book, <i>The Master</i>, in which he describes the teaching conditions which he experienced in the early years of the State. Many years of underfunding has led to the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Europe, a chronically under-funded remedial teaching system and third world facilities in some schools.</P>
      <P>The INTO survey carried out in 1997 revealed some startling statistics. There are still about 35 schools without outside toilets; 130 schools did not have a telephone; 17 per cent had classes in prefabs, many of which were dilapidated; over 30 per cent could not afford a daily cleaning service; almost half did not have a general purpose room for physical education, concerts, parent meetings and so on; 59 per cent did not have a principal's office and 76 per cent did not have hot water for the children's wash hand basins.</P>
      <P>The latest OECD figures show Ireland spends less per primary student than any other country in western Europe, North America or Australia. Our primary pupil-teacher ratio is the worst among 12 comparable European countries. It seems incredible that all this is happening at a time of such unprecedented economic growth. Because of the inadequate capitation grant of £50, parents have to fund raise to ensure, in many cases, the basic needs of heating, light and cleaning are provided. It is not uncommon for teachers to pay for essential materials to ensure their class can take part in art, music or other activities.</P>
      <P>The 1997 INTO survey showed parents and school communities are subsidising education to the tune of over £10 million each year. The Department of Education and Science contributes approximately £22 million towards the running costs of primary schools. The survey also showed that almost half of all schools cannot pay for the basics out of the £50 per pupil provided by the Department. Over 80 per cent of schools fund-raise and 62 per cent of these use the money to supplement their running costs; 77 per cent need to fund-raise to provide teaching materials for the school and 45 per cent use the money raised locally to provide sports equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many instances teachers have become semi-professional fund-raisers. Parents and teachers in less well off areas and small rural communities <Col N="595" /> are finding it increasingly difficult to fund-raise given the decline in the rural economy and urban unemployment. This results in unfair treatment of children in those schools. They are placed at a disadvantage from the beginning and find it difficult to catch up when they enter the post primary system. Apart from the normal costs, primary schools have to pay refuse charges, TV licences, cable link fees, computer maintenance and software, photocopying costs and so on.</P>
    <P>I recently visited what would be regarded as one of the top primary schools in Kerry for a meeting with the board of management and the principal teacher. They pointed out it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain services in the school, that they are weary of fund-raising and that the parents are becoming increasingly disillusioned with fund-raising activities. They need financial help which can only be provided by at least a 100 per cent increase in the capitation grant in 1999 and a gradual increase in the grant until it is on a par with the post-primary capitation grant.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to remind his Minister of the commitment he made in Opposition that primary education would be a priority. He now has the opportunity to make improvements and he must do so in a substantial fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have put primary education at the centre of the Government's agenda and this is explicitly included in the programme for Government. This has been delivered upon and, while the Deputy would obviously not wish me to pre-empt the announcement of the Abridged Estimates tomorrow, I have no doubt we will continue our unmatched commitment to primary education in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Since coming to office last year we have made a number of changes which have improved funding in schools. The 1998 Estimates provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure in primary education over the 1997 budget allocation. In this context, we succeeded in securing an increase in the standard rate of capitation grant, payable at primary level, for 1998 of 11 per cent after it had been frozen by the previous Government. This brought the total standard <i>per capita</i> grant rate to £50 per pupil or a minimum grant of £3,000 to schools with an enrolment of fewer than 60 pupils. Schools which have disadvantaged area status receive supplementary capitation payments at a rate of £30 per pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures represent an important step forward in the process of improving the funding of the primary sector. It is important to note that the difference in grant level between primary and post primary levels reflects the fact that maintenance costs for second level schools are much <Col N="596" /> greater, on a unit cost basis, than those in primary schools &mdash; any reasonably minded citizen will accept that. The second level capitation payment is required to cover a different range of additional expenditures. These include a requirement to pay a portion of every teacher's salary. We will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the capitation grant to primary schools.</P>
    <P>On the provision of caretaking and clerical assistance, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional capitation grants with a view to expanding the provision of caretaking and clerical services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more. The priority has been to extend the scheme to include schools which have no provision for these services rather than increase the <i>per capita</i> grant rate of £30 per pupil &mdash; £15 per pupil in respect of each service. In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment figure to 195 pupils.</P>
    <P>We are committed to further improvements in this programme until such time as all national schools of 100 or over will ultimately be grant assisted towards the cost of clerical and caretaking services. The Government has approved the first ever automatic right to educational support for many children with special needs and especially children with autism. Costing roughly £4 million next year, the employment of resource teachers and child care assistants represents a radical improvement in primary education, which should have been addressed many years ago. I have no doubt this Government will be remembered for having shown a commitment to providing resources to primary schools, unmatched by any other Government in the history of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this matter was tabled by Deputy Pat Carey and I, Deputy Carey decided to leave it to me to speak on the matter because it is of such importance and it would not be possible for two speakers to do justice to it with only two minutes each.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation established the College of Music in 1890. Responsibility for it was transferred to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee in 1930. In 1978 it became one of the six constituent colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology and it remained so after the Dublin Institute of Technology Act was passed in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of this college was always to charge moderate fees to make music education available to the widest spectrum of the population, particularly the less well off. Expansion in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s to cope with a growing demand for music education saw a thriving college <Col N="597" /> with 2,000 students, 90 teachers, six orchestras, three bands, four choirs and opera, chamber, drama and percussion groups. Weekly, monthly and annual concerts of extraordinary standard gave voice to all this talent. These concerts no longer take place. An active parents' association, with representation on college council, gave protection to the students and provided a solid support system for students suffering hardship, as well as providing bursaries and loans of instruments which were financially inaccessible to many students.</P>
    <P>This has all changed since 1993, most of all in 1998. The parents' association was the first to be disbanded. Dramatic annual increases in fees culminated in a massive 42 per cent increase in 1998. This increase is excessive, disproportionate, aggressive, ill informed and poorly researched as to its fallout. It is immoral and counter productive in educational terms. It is also 30 per cent more than fees in the Cork College of Music.</P>
    <P>A consequent reduction in student numbers caused vacancies which were allocated to new students. However, an arbitrary decision to introduce a quota on new entrants meant that although new students were informed they were allocated places, when they turned up for classes in September and October they were told there were no classes for them.</P>
    <P>Another consequence is loss of staff. Never in the 100 year history of the college has there been staff redundancies, lay offs or even reduction of working hours until now. Now, not only have teachers been laid off, but for the second year in a row part-time teachers have not been paid or paid only a percentage of their salaries.</P>
    <P>There are 300 fewer less places in the College of Music in 1998 as a result of these decisions. Professional studies in applied arts can only thrive if supported by a stable infrastructure. One needs a broad base of part-time students to supply the third level. The Dublin Institute of Technology is running down its comprehensive music education service at the expense of its own feeder system.</P>
    <P>The Government has an obligation to preserve this infrastructure in the schools of music because the general school system cannot supply it. There is a demand for music education and a willingness to pay a reasonable fee for it. The current situation within the College of Music has destabilised the operation of the college and is sapping the morale of staff and students.</P>
    <P>The intentions of Dr. Brendan Goldsmith to phase out lower levels of music education within this institution is no longer covert. It is manifest in the massive 42 per cent increase in fees and the culling of enrolments when the fee strategy proved insufficient to achieve its aims. There is a crisis in the College of Music which needs to be solved before this prized institution is totally destroyed. If action is not taken, this strategy <Col N="598" /> could be implemented throughout the country by other agencies not sufficiently informed of the problems of music education. What action does the Minister propose to take to address this appalling situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Briscoe and Pat Carey for raising this important matter and I acknowledge their ongoing commitment to the provision of music education in Dublin; in particular, I thank Deputy Briscoe for his contribution to this debate. I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to music education in the Dublin Institute of Technology this evening.</P>
      <P>Under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, the principal function of the institute is to provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State. It is clear from the legislation that the control and management of the day to day activities of the institute are matters for the management of the institute.</P>
      <P>My Department asked the Dublin Institute of Technology for information on the issue raised by the Deputies. The response which has been received is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is committed to the provision of education in the arts and has created a Faculty of Applied Arts in its new faculty structure.</P>
      <P>The Conservatory of Music and Drama is centred in this faculty and continues to offer music education at all levels. The conservatory has offered places this year to more students than were enrolled last year.</P>
      <P>The recent PCW pay agreement provides for a special working group, with representatives from all parties, to be set up to make recommendations on the most suitable arrangement for the future delivery of music education and we await its deliberations.</P>
      <P>As indicated, under the recently agreed PCW pay agreement, a special working group with representation from all the relevant parties is to be set up to make recommendations on the most suitable arrangements for the future delivery of programmes in Cork, Dublin and Waterford Institutes of Technology, which includes the provision of music education over a range of age and proficiency levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, we are very concerned about the information the Deputy has provided to the House tonight. We would be very concerned if it were the case that in anticipation of the working group the institute were to take any action which might cause significant numbers of students to be unable to attend courses. We are asking Department officials to contact the institute again with <Col N="599" /> the information supplied by the Deputy. I can assure both Deputies they will be kept fully informed of all developments, and that we will do all we can to ensure that as many students as <Col N="600" /> possible continue to benefit from this excellent facility in the city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>My Department has not carried out or commissioned any study of the kind referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>However, in 1996, the Energy Advisory Board, which is chaired by a principal officer in my Department, commissioned a study on the relationship between energy efficiency and employment in Ireland. The study found that there are direct employment effects arising from the installation of energy efficiency technology. There are also non-direct employment effects, such as manufacturing and supplying the goods and services used in the energy efficiency installations.</P>
      <P>The overall conclusion of the study was that the benefits from energy efficiency are very high in Ireland. The report states that a net employment potential of 10,000 is possible, based on an overall reduction of final enegy consumption on 15 per cent over a ten year period.</P>
      <P>In addition, I understand that two Irish organisations are currently involved in an in-depth multinational project for the European Commissioner under the SAVE II programme into employment effects of energy conservation across Europe. Dutch, Greek and UK agencies are also involved in the project.</P>

      <P>To ensure that the development of the expanded Luas network proceeds without delay, I have established a light rail advisory action group. The group will oversee the planning and implementation of the expanded LUAS system and report directly to me. Its reports will be published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 40, 72, 75 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The major traffic problems in Dublin are being tackled as a matter of urgency and the strategy recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative provides an appropriate policy framework.</P>
      <P>A high quality public transport system which is safe, efficient, competitive and cost effective has a key role to play in solving the present transport difficulties. It is this Government's policy to promote the provision of such a service and its commitment has been clearly shown by the swift and very positive response to the short-term action plan recently published and prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office in response to the unanticipated growth in traffic. A copy of the DTO short-term action plan has been provided.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the public transport recommendations of the DTO action plan have already been given the go ahead for implementation. The bus service will continue to be the backbone of Dublin's public transport network. In the short term, the principal means of providing additional public transport supply is to increase the capacity of the bus network to carry substantially more passengers. The DTO action plan recommended the acquisition by Bus Átha Cliath of a further 150 buses to expand peak hour services.</P>
      <P>As part of the reallocation of EU aid for the Luas project, approval was given to Bus Átha Cliath to acquire 50 additional buses at a total cost of £8.5 million. This is the first time that the EU has agreed to fund the purchase of buses in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> I expect to be in a position shortly to make an announcement on funding for the remaining 100 buses recommended in the action plan. Together, these 150 extra buses will provide an additional 9,500 bus trips in the peak hour, an increase of over 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The network of quality bus corridors will continue to be developed in order to further enhance the priority, speed, reliability and overall quality of service that buses can provide on key routes in the greater Dublin area. A total of 12 corridors will be in place by end 2000 and substantial progress is already evident on the ground. The necessary additional funding for this work was also provided as part of the Luas reallocation.</P>
    <P>The plan also made proposals which Bus Átha Cliath intends to act upon. The company is committed to replacing 70 single deck and 50 double deck buses with 120 modern double deckers over the next two years. This will increase peak hour capacity by 2,450. Bus Átha Cliath is still in negotiations with its unions about sub-contracting school bus services and this would release additional bus capacity to meet peak demand.</P>
    <P>All but one of the rail measures, DART signalling, proposed by the action plan have been included in the reallocation of the Luas funding. These include the upgrading of the Maynooth rail service, the purchase of 16 additional DART units and 20 suburban railcars and platform lengthening. They will be put in place by the end of 2000 and involve a total investment of £63 million.</P>
    <P>Implementation of all the rail measures will increase morning peak hour capacity by 11,300. This is about a 60 per cent increase in total rail trips or a 17 per cent increase in total public transport trips in the morning peak.</P>
    <P>In a major departure from existing practice, this investment will be part financed by the Exchequer. Up to now, CIE has had to finance the balance of the cost of any EU assisted project from its own resources.</P>
    <P>As well as significantly increasing the quantity and quality of the bus and rail network, the action plan aims to accelerate the provision of safe high quality cycling facilities and extra funding is being provided through the DTO for this also.</P>
    <P>With regard to safety standards, both Iarnród Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath assured me that safety is their main priority and is of paramount importance in all aspects of the companies' operations.</P>

      <P>However, as referred to in previous replies to questions tabled by the Deputy, it is my intention that the Bill currently being drafted will include a provision entitling electricity consumers to purchase electricity which is produced using a renewable or alternative form of energy as its primary source.</P>
      <P>I envisage that this provision will be brought into effect once the detailed practical arrangements, including trading arrangements, for the opening of the market in accordance with the EU electricity directive, have been developed and implemented.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 42, 57 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that my colleagues and I fully recognise the implications the proposed abolition of duty free facilities would have for Ireland and we are making every effort to have these facilities retained. As the Deputies are aware, Ireland has brought the proposed abolition onto the agenda of the European Council, it is now firmly on the table and I intend to continue to press for reconsideration of the position by the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission proposed to prepare a report on the possible mechanisms and aids to counter the negative economic effects of such an abolition. It is expected that this report <Col N="606" /> will be tabled at a future ECOFIN meeting and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will then have an opportunity to put forward the Irish case for deferral of the decision.</P>
    <P>Following my discussions with the French Minister for Transport on 28 September last, the Taoiseach wrote to the Prime Minister of France, Mr. Lionel Jospin, suggesting that the Capet report could provide a basis for a series of options for action on the duty free issue. Mr. Jospin is considering the matter and his response is awaited.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain the pressure, I wrote to my Danish and German counterparts, Mrs. Sonja Mikkelsen and Mr. Franz Muntefering, as recently as 28 October, with a view to widening support for a deferral option. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance wrote to the Belgian, German, Portuguese and Finnish Ministers for Finance on 4 November seeking their assistance on the issue.</P>
    <P>Rest assured my colleagues and I will maintain contacts at European level in order to continue in our campaign to have the matter reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 43 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposed MOX plant for Sellafield, I would refer the Deputies to the response which I gave earlier today to Priority Question No. 33 from Deputy Austin Currie on this same subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as radioactive discharges, including discharges of technetium-99, from Sellafield are concerned, I very much regret the UK Environment Agency's recent proposed decision for a variation in the Sellafield discharge authorisations. The proposed decision, while it will involved a reduction in the permitted levels of technetium-99 discharges, is totally unacceptable to the Irish Government. Furthermore, I regard the proposed decision as effectively a breach of the undertaking entered into by UK Ministers at <Col N="607" /> the OSPAR ministerial meeting in Portugal in July. At that meeting, the OSPAR Ministers adopted a strategy on radioactive substances incorporating a commitment to achieve close to zero radioactive discharges into the marine environment by the year 2020. Additionally, UK Ministers promised to take account of concerns raised by Ireland and other countries about technetium-99 discharges.</P>
    <P>The agency's proposed decision in regard to Sellafield discharges has been referred by the agency to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for their consideration as to whether they wish to direct the agency to make a different decision or to issue further policy guidance to the agency.</P>
    <P>In the light of the agency's proposed decision, I have written to the relevant UK Ministers emphasising the Government's strong objection to the proposed decision and the fact that the proposed decision, particularly as regards technetium, is not in keeping with the commitments at OSPAR. I can assure the House, that I will be doing everything possible to ensure that the agency's proposed decision is modified consistent with the commitments at OSPAR.</P>

      <P>My Department has hosted a number of competitions &mdash; commonly referred to as &ldquo;AER&rdquo; competitions &mdash; to supply electricity to the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, from various renewable energy sources including waste. A number of waste-to-energy applications have been successful in the qualitative analysis stage of the competitions. In order to qualify for a power purchase agreement these projects require evidence of access to the necessary fuel source on a continuing basis over the life of the contract with the ESB. It is a matter for the successful applicants and any nominated fuel source provider to conclude an agreement on access to the fuel source. The current round of &ldquo;AER&rdquo; competitions has now concluded and future plans for waste-to-energy plant will be addressed in the &ldquo;Green Paper on Sustainable Energy&rdquo; which I will publish later this year.</P>
      <P>A report on the renewable energy resources in Ireland &ldquo;Total Renewable Energy Resource in Ireland (1997)&rdquo;, prepared by ESB International and ETSU under the EU's ALTENER programme, identified practicable electric power, up to the year 2000, of the order of 44.4 MWe from the incineration of municipal waste and up to 18.3 MWe from landfill gas, depending on the underlying assumptions applied.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposed waste-to-energy plant at Goddamendy, the decision of the European Commission to refuse European Regional Development Fund aid for the project has been communicated to the project promoters who have since submitted their response. My Department expects to conclude its consideration of the response shortly.</P>

      <P>The ESB has estimated that domestic customers are currently being underchanged while commercial and industrial users are being overcharged. As the ESB faces competition in the future, it is necessary that tariffs adequately reflect underlying costs in order to ensure that there is a level playing field for all industry players.</P>
      <P>In 1996 and 1997, the ESB implemented price increases averaging 2 per cent and 1½ per cent respectively. The implementation of those increases was used to initiate the process of rebalancing of tariffs. Accordingly, some customers faced minimal increases, no increases at all, or actual reductions in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> The ESB is now returning profits which exceed by a significant margin the profits projected at the time the CCR was agreed and the price increases for 1996 and 1997 were approved by the Government. The question of effecting further re-balancing of tariffs from within its own resources is a matter for the ESB to consider.</P>
    <P>The question of tariff rebalancing in the future will be one of the matters falling within the remit of the new commission for electricity regulation to be established under legislation which I propose to introduce in the House shortly. This will be the first phase of implementation of the EU electricity directive on the introduction of competition in the electricity market.</P>
    <P>A second piece of legislation, to be introduced in 1999, will provide for the licensing by the commission of the monopoly public electricity supply as well as the activities of transmission and distribution. These licences will incorporate pricing controls which will be determined by the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Emissions from ESB power plants fall into two broad categories, namely, greenhouse gases such as CO 2 (carbon dioxide), and acidification pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx).</P>
      <P>Greenhouse gases are dealt with under the Kyoto Protocol. The European Community as a whole has agreed to reduce emissions of six main greenhouse gases by 8 per cent below 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012. Within this overall EU reduction target, Ireland's target is to limit the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the same period. The Kyoto obligations as they relate to electricity refer primarily to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).</P>
      <P>My Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government jointly commissioned a report on The Limitation and Reduction of CO 2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland in the course of developing a national strategy to meet Ireland's target under the Kyoto protocol. The report was published in June and consultations with all interested parties were invited. A one day discussion forum on the development of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy for Government approval is now progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In finalising a national strategy, the Government will seek to ensure that the burden of meeting <Col N="612" /> Ireland's Kyoto commitments are shared equitably across all economic sectors, including transport, agriculture, industry and energy. Emissions of SO 2 and NOx from large scale industrial plants are dealt with under the EU Large Combustion Plant Directive 88/609/EC.</P>
    <P>National commitments also apply, however, under protocols to the UN-ECE Geneva Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution and informal arrangements entered into between the ESB and Government in this regard are more stringent than the large combustion plant directive limits.</P>
    <P>Under the Geneva Convention Protocols, Ireland must limit national NOx emissions to their 1987 levels from 1994 onwards and reduce national SO 2 emissions by 30 per cent on their 1980 level from 2000 onwards. Applied on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to the power generaion sector, a NOx emission limit of 42,000 tonnes per annum has been agreed between the ESB and Government. An SO 2 limit of 82,000 tonnes will apply from the year 2000.</P>
    <P>ESB reports on its emissions on an annual basis to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and to the Environment Protection Agency. The ESB has met its commitments in the past and has plans in place to ensure compliance in the future. These plans include the additional use of gas, low sulphur oil and coal and the installation of low NOx burners at power stations in addition to those already installed.</P>
    <P>The agreement between the ESB and Government regarding limitations on SO 2 and NOx is informal but binding and my Department is kept apprised of the ESB's performance in meeting those voluntary obligations.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming measures necessary to implement the EU electricity directive are likely to result in the present agreement with the ESB being superseded by industry-wide arrangements to take account of new entrants to the market in order to ensure that SO 2 and NOx reduction commitments continue to be met.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 69, 85 and 127 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appointed independent consultants to carry out a strategic review of railway safety earlier this year. The review was undertaken by a consortium of consultants led by International Risk Management Services. It is a comprehensive report and it addresses all relevant aspects of rail safety. The consultants' brief required them to consider the adequacy of Iarnród Éireann's existing safety policy, systems, rules and procedures and the company's arrangements for implementing safety rules and procedures on the ground. They also considered the adequacy, from a safety viewpoint, of the existing railway infrastructure and facilities, including track, signalling systems, rolling <Col N="614" /> stock and level crossings. I have just received the report and have made copies available to all Members of the House. The report has also been published.</P>
    <P>The consultants concluded that the condition of much of the track, signalling and other infrastructure was poor, while the condition of the rolling stock was, on the whole, satisfactory. The most serious deficiency highlighted in the report is a lack of a systematic approach to identifying safety hazards and prioritising and implementing remedial action. The consultants found that an encouraging start had been made at senior management level on implementing a systematic approach to addressing safety on the railway. However, they stressed the importance of improving the approach to safety management on the railway and of creating a safety culture that reaches every facet of the company's activities. The consultants emphasised that safety related investment in the railway infrastructure, while necessary, will not be enough. The company also needs to tackle the management aspects of safety.</P>
    <P>The consultants estimate that a 15 year safety investment programme costing of the broad order of £590 million will be required. About £23 million of this needs to be spent immediately. The overall expenditure requirement includes about £230 million for a programme of improvements to rectify safety deficiencies in the railway infrastructure, that includes track, signalling, bridges and level crossings, about £60 million to improve safety management systems and £20 million per annum over the 15 year period for ongoing renewal of the permanent way.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to immediately establish a high level task force comprised of officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and CIE to prioritise recommendations on necessary rail safety expenditure requirements. The task force report will be completed by the end of January 1999. In the meantime, CIE is to begin implementation of the report's recommendations giving particular attention to the immediate safety needs identified by the consultants. Pending consideration by Government of the task force report, CIE will be authorised to undertake borrowings to finance the implementation of safety measures. I will also immediately begin the process of recruiting two additional railway inspecting officers for my Department.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, CIE commissioned A. D. Little to carry out a review of railway infrastructure covering only jointed track, signalling and telecommunications. Following the submission of the A. D. Little report to my Department, I asked the CIE board to prepare a railway safety investment plan. That plan will assist Iarnród Éireann itself and the high level task force in the consideration of safety investment priorities. However, the primary focus will be on the recommendations of the IRMS review which considered all aspects of railway safety. I should explain that the EU has not deemed sections of our national railway system to be substandard, nor has it any <Col N="615" /> function in determining safety standards on the railways.</P>

      <P>Since the liberalisation of the market for the provision of telecommunications infrastructure in July of last year, investment in telecommunications infrastructure has risen at a rapid rate.

    </Speaker>
    <P>While investment projects being carried out in the market are a matter for the operators involved, I understand that a number of companies, most particularly Telecom Éireann, Ocean, NTL and Esat Telecom; have plans for significant investment in the Border region. In addition, earlier this year I announced the provision of 22.5 MECU in EU funding, under the EIOP and INTERREG programmes, for investment in telecommunications infrastructure and the development of the information society. The Deputy will be aware that the INTERREG programme is designed specifically to support cross-Border investment.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 59 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>At my request, CIE prepared a number of public transport investment reviews, covering all their main areas of activity, mainline rail, Dublin suburban rail, bus, provincial cities and rail freight. These were submitted to my Department at various times over the past year or so and identified total medium term investment requirements of over £1 billion in the period to end 2006. This figure does not include the cost of the first phase of the Dublin light rail system which I announced in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full cost of this programme could not be met from a combination of Exchequer support, reducing levels of EU assistance post 1999 and CIE's own existing internal financial resources. I therefore had to look at alternative funding options. It was against this background that I have, with Government approval, asked CIE to dispose of all property which is surplus to public transport requirements so as to part-finance the medium-term investment programme. I have also <Col N="617" /> made it clear that what I am proposing is disposal at full commercial value and that existing contractually binding commitments will be honoured.</P>
    <P>I have asked the CIE board to submit a report to me by the end of November and I will then bring it to the attention of the Government. I have already told the CIE unions that I am available for discussions with them on how best we can generate cash for CIE's property portfolio with a view to part-financing urgent public transport investment requirements in years immediately ahead.</P>

      <P>Under the Transport Acts, the question of assessing and meeting demand for public transport services is a matter for Córas Iompair Éireann and its operating subsidiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to our unprecedented economic growth traffic has grown more rapidly than was anticipated particularly in urban areas. This has had a significant impact on the circumstances in which the CIE group provides its services.

    <P>In relation to the development of public transport in the Greater Dublin area, I wish to refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 40, 72, 75 and 86 given earlier today. At my request, CIE prepared a number of public transport investment reviews, covering all their main areas of activity, mainline rail, Dublin suburban rail, bus, provincial cities and rail freight. These were submitted to my Department at various times over the past year or so.</P>
    <P>All of these reviews were taken into account in the initial submission made by my Department to the Department of Finance in June 1998 in the context of EU funding requirements post 1999.</P>

      <P>I am aware, as are many Members of the House, of the difficult situation in which many people referred to in the Deputy's question find themselves.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a wide range of issues in his question, affecting a number of areas, some of which are outside my area of responsibility. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs administers a national fuel scheme to assist low income households and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has responsibility for insulation and other energy efficiency measures contained in building regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> In relation to my own Department and the specific issue of fuel poverty, grant aid has been provided to the Energy Action organisation since its foundation in 1988 to combat the problem of fuel poverty. It also receives funding from a number of other public and private sources for its invaluable work. The objectives of the organisation are to combat cold in the homes of the elderly and those on low incomes thereby preventing unnecessary cold related illness and death; create ecologically sound work opportunities for the unemployed; educate the public on the need for energy conservation; and increase energy efficiency in the homes of the elderly and needy thereby reducing their fuel costs and atmospheric pollution.</P>
    <P>The services it provides include attic insulation, draught proofing and the supply and fitting of both lagging jackets and smoke alarms to the needy and the elderly, free of charge. To date, Energy Action has insulated over 12,000 homes free of charge.</P>
    <P>Through Energy Action, approximately 360 long-term unemployed people have been trained to certification standard in home insulation and the delivery of energy advice to householders. The jobs placement rate of over 60 per cent is also extremely high.</P>
    <P>In 1998, a grant of £110,000 is being provided through the Irish Energy Centre to Energy Action. This will assist in the provision of: draft proofing for 1,580 homes, attic insulation for 395 homes, lagging jackets for 675 homes and energy efficient lighting for 790 homes.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department will also be providing £100,000 to Energy Action for the purchase of its own premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Questions Nos. 96, 119 and 265 on the 30 September 1998.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the County Louth residents have accepted the terms of the Government's offer of assistance towards the cost of research activities being undertaken by them in their legal proceedings against BNFL and a number of payments have been made to date.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 the Government approved a further package of assistance relating to defined areas of work by the residents' legal team arising from these research activities. These proposals were outlined in my letter to the residents' solicitor dated 12 December 1997. The residents have yet to confirm that they are in a position to accept this offer.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the provision of legal costs other than those arising from research work, it must be borne in mind that the State is still a co-defendant in this action despite numerous requests that it be removed from the case. The October 1997 Dáil motion committed the Government to support the action against British Nuclear Fuels &mdash; it did not commit the Government to support an action against itself. Moreover, I have to be careful to avoid the risk of payments to another body to carry on a legal action being regarded as the tort of maintenance or as an abuse of process of the courts. The terms of my letter of 12 December were designed, with the assistance and advice of the Attorney General, to minimise that risk.</P>
      <P>In relation to membership of the Ministerial Committee on Nuclear Safety, as Chairman of the Committee I am satisfied that the existing membership of the group, which includes representation at ministerial and official level from the various Departments and State agencies which are involved in developing and implementing nuclear safety and radiological protection policy, can effectively implement the committee's work programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that previous efforts by Ireland at EU level in seeking the establishment of an EU inspection force within the competencies of the health and safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty have not been successful. A considerable number of EU member states were opposed to the idea and some nuclear member states insisted that an independent inspection force to inspect the safety of nuclear plants on their territory would be an unacceptable undermining of national sovereignty. The widely diverging member state views about nuclear power and the fact that amendments to the Euratom Treaty require unanimity prevented progress on the matter. Nonetheless, it will continue to be Irish policy to favour an inspectorate.</P>
      <P>While the concept of a nuclear inspectorate has not received acceptance in the EU, there have been some positive developments elsewhere. Provision has been made in the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Convention on Nuclear Safety for a peer review process. Under this process, each state will be able to review the legislative and regulatory framework that governs the safety of nuclear installations of other contracting parties which would include all member states of the EU. It also provides for a review of the operational and safety procedures for nuclear installations and emergency preparedness. A similar peer review process has been provided for under the IAEA Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and Radioactive Waste management.</P>
      <P>I will continue to seek the best way forward on this issue taking account of developments under the two new IAEA conventions mentioned above.</P>

      <P>In the context of developing proposals for inclusion in Ireland's application for post-1999 EU funding, Iarnród Éireann submitted a mainline rail investments needs review. This discussion paper set out the company's proposals for capital investment. I understand that the company is currently preparing an economic and financial appraisal on its investment proposals which they hope to have completed by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June this year my Department made an initial submission to the Department of Finance on EU funding for public transport projects in the <Col N="626" /> post-1999 period. This submission takes account of reviews submitted by the CIE Group setting out their investment needs for bus and rail.</P>
    <P>The question of matching Exchequer funding for rail or indeed any other projects will be addressed by Government when it is considering Ireland's national development plan for the post-1999 period, prior to its submission to the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>I should explain that as a general rule matching Exchequer funding has not been provided for mainline rail projects which are in receipt of EU aid under the 1994 to 1999 programme. The balance of the funding required is provided by CIE from its own resources.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that for the first time the Government in 1999 and 2000 will be providing £37 million to meet the balance of the cost in the case of the mainline and suburban rail projects approved for funding under the Luas reallocation in June of this year.</P>

      <P>The dispute to which the Deputy refers is a matter for the companies concerned and, if necessary, the appropriate regulatory or competition authorities to resolve. While my Department did encourage the companies to try to find a solution which would be acceptable to both parties and meet competition rules, obviously this has not proved possible to date. The Director of Telecommunications Regulation has offered to meet both companies with a view to achieving a suitable resolution.</P>
      <P>I should stress, however, that I do not perceive the dispute in an entirely negative light. It does demonstrate that there is real and healthy competition between the companies and, ultimately, this is in the best interests of consumers.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to talk about the imposition of penalties by the EU at this stage and, in any event, this is an area in which, self evidently, I have no statutory function. Nevertheless, if any such costs do arise they would have to be met by the company concerned.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer makes an annual subvention available to CIE to help defray the cost of socially necessary transport services which cannot be provided on a commercial basis. The allocation <Col N="628" /> of the subvention to the individual companies &mdash; Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann &mdash; is currently a matter for the board of CIE.</P>
      <P>It is planned to replace these arrangements with a number of multi-annual public service transport contracts to be agreed with the individual CIE companies. The contracts will specify the quantity and quality of services to be provided by the company concerned in return for direct payment by the State.</P>
      <P>The public service contract approach should act as a spur to the identification of the specific costs associated with the non-commercial services and should also create the conditions for the companies to operate with more commercial freedom in those parts of their business where the contracts do not apply. In addition, by linking Exchequer payments to performance, the contracts shold provide for a more efficient customer approach to the provision of public transport services.</P>

The detailed compliance with the price cap is a day to day matter for Telecom Éireann, but is subject to verification by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. However, I am pleased to record that Telecom Éireann has introduced a single long distance rate for Ireland with effect from 21 October which reduces charges in some cases by up to 33 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>when her attention was drawn to the possible demise of Tarkett Ireland Limited, Mullingar, County Westmeath; if she contacted the parent company to discuss the proposed closure of this plant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Empoyment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed of the decision by the board of Tarkett Sommer AG to close the Mullingar plant during a meeting I had with the management of Tarkett (Ireland) Limited on 21 October 1998. The closure is to start with 50 redundancies on 20 November. A further 40 workers will be made redundant before Christmas, with the remainder being made redundant before the end of January 1999. I asked the Irish company to maintain the plant in operation for a longer period to assist the IDA in its efforts to attract a new project to the area. The company did not give any commitment on this point, but it is co-operating with IDA Ireland in marketing the site and attracting potential purchasers.</P>
      <P>The management of Tarkett (Ireland) Limited has made it clear to me that the decision to close was the inevitable and irreversible consequence of the loss of market outlets in Russia and eastern Europe. Once those markets collapsed, they did not have the work to keep the plant open. I have not, therefore, gone on to discuss the matter further with other representatives of Tarkett.</P>
      <P>On 21 October 1998 I also requested IDA Ireland to establish an interagency group to formulate an adequate response to the Tarkett closure. I met the members of that group on 29 October 1998.</P>
      <P>The fact that Tarkett was such a valued employer in the Mullingar area for over 20 years makes the loss of the company more regrettable. I realise that the loss is much more than the 130 jobs involved and that many local companies which provided services to Tarkett are badly affected also. I consider that the establishment of the Mullingar interagency group is the most effective means of seeking to replace the jobs which will be lost in Tarkett and to assist the workers involved.</P>

      <P>It is a statutory function of IDA Ireland under the Industrial Development Acts and section 8(a) of the 1993 Act in particular, to promote the establishment and development, in the State, of industrial undertakings from outside the State.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the IDA Ireland annual report of 1997, copies of which are in the Dáil Library, pages 4 and 5, which set out the 1997 details of the origins of IDA supported companies and their respective employment levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also refer the Deputy to the chief executive's <Col N="635" /> report, pages 9 and 10, which deals with Ireland's market for foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy in response to questions on 3 November 1998, the changing patterns of competition for mobile international investment projects are reviewed on a regular basis. Ireland's main competitors for foreign direct investment are other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>Policies are being pursued to maximise the attractiveness of Ireland as a continuing desirable location for foreign and indigenous investment and to ensure that existing industry is competitive. In this context, particular emphasis with appropriate initiatives is being placed on addressing key competitiveness factors such as skills, costs, telecommunications and the information society.</P>
    <P>In addition, the recently concluded agreement between the Government and the European Commission which safeguards Ireland's low tax regime beyond the year 2010 will contribute substantially to maintaining Ireland's competitiveness for investment moving into Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 99 and 100 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> Business expenditure on research and development (BERD) in Ireland amounted to £400 million in 1995 &mdash; the latest year for which figures are available. This is equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP in 1995 and compares with an EU average of 1.15 per cent and an OECD average of 1.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The current rate represents a doubling of expenditure since the late 1980s or an average increase of around 20 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The rate of growth has been similar for both indigenous firms and multinational firms. However, multinational firms account for the substantial proportion of R&amp;D spend. Of the total expenditure of £400 million in 1995, foreign-owned multinationals account for two thirds or £256 million.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that one quarter of manufacturing firms in Ireland perform R&amp;D &mdash; approximately 1000 firms. The top 50 R&amp;D spenders in the country account for over half of the R&amp;D spend, although this is not unusual by international standards. Around 300 indigenous companies and around 180 foreign-owned companies spend over £1000,000 per annum on R&amp;D on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Policy in this area, therefore, has concentrated on increasing the number of firms doing R&amp;D and increasing the scale of R&amp;D undertaken by firms.</P>
    <P>The main vehicle to encourage the business sector's R&amp;D activity has been the in-company R&amp;D scheme, operated by Enterprise Ireland. This scheme &mdash; which was originally allocated £105 million for the period 1994-1999 &mdash; assists industry with the costs of in-company R&amp;D. In 1997, in recognition of the success of this scheme in increasing the level of R&amp;D within companies, an additional £28 million was provided to the scheme which was further refined to focus on introducing more first time R&amp;D performing companies, particularly SMEs. Since 1994, grants totalling £116.2 million have been approved, which when coupled with the industry input will result in an overall increase of £320 million in business R&amp;D expenditure. A total of £74.6 million of the grants were approved to Irish companies while the remaining £41.6 million grants were approved for multinational companies.</P>
    <P>In addition to assisting with the direct costs of the development of new products and processes, I am also concerned with the need to develop the innovative culture at the level of the firm. This is the rationale for the R&amp;D management scheme. This scheme, which is also managed by Enterprise Ireland, is designed to enhance the capability of companies to increase their competitiveness through the effective management of their R&amp;D activities.</P>
    <P>In summary, it is clear from the foregoing that the Government is committed to increasing the amount spent by firms on research and development. <Col N="637" /> I will be making every effort to enhance that commitment.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I received a copy of the development plan prepared by Kinsale Harbour Commissioners in May 1998 and that I am fully aware of the proposals contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that I have recently commissioned a major independent review of the State's regional ports and harbours, including Kinsale Harbour, in fulfilment of the commitments given under the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium and Partnership 2000. The 16 State ports <Col N="638" /> and harbours covered by the review range from those with busy commercial traffic to others which cater for a mix of uses including sea fishing and marine leisure.</P>
    <P>The review will develop a general strategic framwork for these ports and harbours which will aim to maximise their financial sustainability, their contribution to strategic maritime policy objectives and socio-economic impacts. The final report will recommend generic and port/harbour related models and options which will best deliver the objectives of the strategic framework. Consultation with the relevant port/harbour authorities, including Kinsale Harbour Commissioners, is provided for in the consultant's terms of reference and will include assessment of the Commissioner's development plans which will be taken into account fully.</P>
    <P>At the outset I do not wish to pre-empt in any way the deliberations and work of the independent consultants appointed. It is, however, my intention to publish the study findings and I expect the consultants to report back by February next.</P>
    <P>I view the Regional Ports Study as a timely and valuable opportunity to take a critical look at all the ports and harbours still operating under the statutory remit laid down by the Harbours Act, 1946. My intention is to put in place long-term coherent and sustainable development plans for all the regional ports, including Kinsale, to maximise the benefit of the valuable State port assests to the local economies and coastal communities.</P>
    <P>The study does not rule out or commit to any future sustainable development or ownership option and will together with a recently completed national seaport capacity study inform future investment decisions particularly in the context of the new national plan and the next round of EU Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The Foreshore Acts, 1933 and 1992, enable me to take action in relation to the illegal disturbance or removal of beach material from specified areas of seashore or State-owned foreshore by way of the issue of prohibitory notices or the making of prohibitory orders, a breach of which would be an offence punishable by a substantial fine and/or term of imprisonment. The 1992 Act moreover specifically empowers the courts to order the mitigation or remedy of the effects of any illegal removal or disturbance in such manner and within such period as they may specify. Action is normally taken following consultation and in co-operation with the appropriate local authority, the gardaí and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries regarding the area mentioned by the Deputy and am not aware of any difficulties that have arisen at that location. I can assure the Deputy that any complaint would be investigated and arrangements made for appropriate action.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Harbours Act, 1996, a port company is responsible for funding the payment of pension entitlements, including the entitlements relating to pre-vesting day service with the predecessor harbour authority. Separate trustee-administered funds are required for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Following extensive discussions with port companies and an examination by independent consultants, my Department is satisfied that pensions provisions, under the relevant supporting superannuation schemes, are sufficient to meet the requirements of Part IV of the Pensions Act, 1990, in respect of all of the ports, with the exception of Dublin Port Company and Shannon Estuary Ports Company. It is the intention of both port companies that over time the schemes should be fully funded and that they should meet the funding requirements set by section 41(3) of the Harbours Act, 1996 by 30 April 2008 at the latest.</P>
      <P>Such a derogation from the requirements of the Pensions Act, 1990, requires the agreement of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance to the making of a regulation under section 52 of that Act to effectively exclude the superannuation schemes of Dublin Port Company and Shannon Estuary Ports Company from the statutory requirement of Part IV of that Act until 30 April 2008. In this regard consultations at official level are at an advanced stage and the relevant port companies have been so advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the pension funds of both port companies are fully funded, the responsibility for discharging obligations in relation to the pension entitlements of pre or post vesting day staff members falls to <Col N="642" /> the companies concerned. The Deputy can be assured that the pensions of all employees are fully secured and will remain so.</P>

      <P>Following the 1993 Middle East Peace Agreement, Ireland joined with other international donors in providing practical assistance to underpin the peace process.  Ireland pledged annual contributions of $1 million over the five-year period 1994-1998.  In 1996, this pledge was renewed and increased to $2 million.  When contributions to UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) are taken into account, Ireland's annual expenditure in favour of Palestine has in fact exceeded that figure.</P>
      <P>The Irish Aid programme in Palestine focuses on the poorer sections of the Palestinian populations of the West Bank and Gaza.  Assistance is provided through a mix of channels (e. g. Palestinian Ministries, Bethlehem University, NGOs) which has allowed the programme to operate effectively despite the often difficult political and security situation on the ground Assistance is being provided through these various channels to the education, agriculture and energy sectors and, through our contribution to UNRWA, to health care and social services.</P>
      <P>Arising from the signature of the Wye Agreement between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority in October, an international donors conference for Palestine is planned for Washington on 30 November 1998.  Irish aid to the Palestinian Authority will be considered in the context of the forthcoming donors' conference. Ireland will play a full and active role in the conference, and future levels of assistance will be determined in light of concrete needs and local capacity, as well as the availability of resources.</P>

      <P>I met with a delegation from the Retired Civil and Public Servant's Association last week, which also represents the pensioners of Telecom Éireann, to discuss and clarify a number of recent developments in Telecom Éireann of interest to the company's pensioners, including <Col N="645" /> the matter of the payment of the 2.5 per cent increase under Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>At that meeting I was able to indicate that the pensioners in Telecom Éireann can expect to receive their 2.5 per cent increase, fully backdated to 1 November, 1997, in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, pension indexation policy in the public sector generally is to link increases in pensions to general increases in the pay scales of serving staff.  When increases are paid to serving staff, they are also paid to the pensioners.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement between the management and unions at the Joint Conciliation Council in Telecom Éireann, payment of the 2.5 per cent increase under Partnership 2000 due with effect from 1 November 1997 is being deferred for employees until the terms of the employee share ownership plan (ESOP) have been finalised and implemented.</P>
      <P>However, as I pointed out in my reply to Question No. 130 of 4 November 1998 Telecom Éireann is now making arrangements to implement the Partnership 2000 increases for its pensioners.</P>

      <P>At my request, CIE prepared a number of public transport investment reviews, covering mainline rail, Dublin suburban rail, Bus Éireann, provincial cities and rail freight.  These identified investment requirements over the period to 2006, of just over £1 billion.  In the case of Dublin Bus, proposals for investment in the region of £45 million have been received.  The mainline rail review identified an investment requirement of £218 million, while the Dublin suburban rail figure was £95 million.  A significant proportion of the railway investment figures would have safety related benefits which overlap with the 15 year safety related investment requirements identified by the IRMS study.</P>
      <P>CIE has not submitted any estimate of the cost for the revised light rail project, though I expect to shortly receive an updated budget estimate for the Tallaght line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparations for the formulation of the National Development Plan for the period 2000 to 2006 are well under way.  In June last, my Department made an initial submission to the Department of Finance for EU funding for public <Col N="646" /> transport projects for this period.  This submission in turn took account of submissions made by the CIE Group which set out their proposed investment plans for bus and rail transport projects.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance will engage in a series of consultations with all relevant parties with a view to finalising a submission to Government. That submission will be considered in the spring of 1999 in the context of formulating the National Development Plan.  When completed, the plan will form the basis for Ireland's application to the EU Commission for funding in the post 1999 period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 133 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>Day-to-day responsibility for all matters relating to rail safety is a matter for Iarnród Éireann. I have been assured that rail safety is the company's main priority and is of paramount importance in all aspects of the company's operations.</P>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann receives an annual subvention from the Exchequer for the provision of socially necessary services which cannot be provided on a fully commercial basis.  The allocation of the subvention to the individual companies is currently a matter for the board of CIE.  Approximately 90 per cent of the annual subvention goes to support the rail network.  The total subvention for 1998 is £107 million.</P>
      <P>Our unprecedented economic growth has generated a dramatic increase in the use of all forms of transport including our railway services.  I am very much aware of the discomfort and delays which passengers have experienced in recent times on the western suburban train service.  I wish to confirm that my Department's railway inspecting officer has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann regarding the potential safety implications of overcrowding.</P>
      <P>However, I expect that the additional investment package, funded by the EU and the Exchequer, which I announced on 25 June of this year will alleviate the current difficulties being experienced by passengers.  As part of the reallocation of the Luas EU aid additional investment of £63 million has been provided for Dublin suburban rail.  The measures being funded on the section of the line from Mullingar to Dublin include the provision of extra suburban railcars which will allow for additional services on this corridor; an additional £3 million for track upgrading; the doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth and resignalling of the Maynooth line which will facilitate additional train services in the morning and evening peak; station platform lengthening to accommodate longer trains which will increase the passenger carrying capacity of the line.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has advised me that a comprehensive engineering assessment of the line between Maynooth and the city centre has been completed.  Design work has commenced and drawings are being prepared for the station improvements and the necessary trackwork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rail services between Enfield and Dublin are benefiting from an EU assisted investment package in the Dublin-Sligo line which is focused on the Dublin to Mullingar section of the line. This includes a major upgrading of track and signalling currently being undertaken with assistance from the Cohesion Fund.  In addition, an <Col N="648" /> allocation of Structural Fund assistance under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 enabled a new station at Kilcock to be opened.</P>
    <P>In relation to current proposals for enhancement of services, the specific requirements of this line were evaluated as part of CIE's review of Dublin's suburban rail investment requirements. In June last, my Department made an initial submission to the Department of Finance for EU funding for public transport projects for the post 1999 period.  This submission in turn took account of the investment review prepared by CIE.</P>
    <P>Consultations between the Department of Finance and all relevant parties, including my Department, are on-going in relation to the formulation of the National Development Plan which will form the basis for Ireland's application to the EU Commission for funding in the post 1999 period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there has been substantial growth in the population of the catchment area along the Maynooth corridor and that it is a rapidly growing commuter route.  The investment needs for the route including track renewal, doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth and the provision of additional rolling stock were identified and costed during 1997.</P>
      <P>The investment package of £63 million in combined EU and Exchequer funding which I announced in June 1998 following the reallocation of the Luas funding includes financing for the provision of extra suburban railcars on the Maynooth line; station platform lengthening to accommodate longer trains which will increase the passenger carrying capacity of the line; the doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth and resignalling of the Maynooth line.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has advised me that a comprehensive engineering assessment of the line between Maynooth and the city centre has been completed.  Design work has commenced and drawings are being prepared for the station improvements and the necessary trackwork.</P>
      <P>The investment will facilitate the provision of additional services.  However, I have no statutory responsibility in respect of the day to day services and timetables which are operational matters for Córas Iompair Éireann and its subsidiary company Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>The recommendation contained in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan in relation to the reorganisation of the Army took effect from 1 November 1998.  This means that the Army is now organised as follows: three brigades; Defence Forces Training Centre; and two logistic bases.</P>
      <P>Each brigade consists of three infantry battalions, a field artillery regiment, a cavalry squadron, a field engineer company, a field communications and information services company, a military police company, a logistics battalion and a brigade training centre.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking the areas of the three brigades correspond to the areas of the former Eastern, Southern and Western Commands with the exception that the area of the former Curragh Command now forms part of the areas of the Eastern, Southern and Western Brigades.  The area of the Defence Forces training centres corresponds to the area of the Curragh Camp and the Glen of Imaal.</P>

      <P>Civil Defence operates under the Air Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946, and the Local Government Acts, 1941, 1955, 1960, 1963 and 1976.  Responsibility for the co-ordination of policy, planning and organisation for Civil Defence is delegated by the Minister for Defence to the Minister of State at the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the organisation are the Civil Defence Branch of the Department of Defence, which includes the Civil Defence School, and 32 local authority units under the managment of the county-city manager.  The day to day operation of civil defence at local level is carried out by the Civil Defence officer.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Civil Defence branch include control of expenditure and the provision of Civil Defence equipment for use by local authorities. The Civil Defence school provides technical advice on civil defence matters and provides training for the qualification and validation of instructors.</P>
      <P>The Civil Defence organisation was established initially to protect the civilian population from the hazards of war, in particular atomic-nuclear war, but is now principally involved in a community support role.  It is organised on a county basis with volunteers recruited locally for the following services, warden, rescue, casualty, welfare and auxiliary fire service.  The tendency nowadays is for a multi-disciplined service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> There are approximately 6,000 active volunteers in the organisation with a further 3,000-4,000 trained persons not active but available in a major emergency situation.  The volunteers are under the control and management of 23 full-time and eight part-time Civil Defence officers assisted by ten assistant Civil Defence officers, all of whom are employees of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>As I have stated in my previous reply, in this case one of the objectives of the scheme of early retirement from farming is to improve the economic viability of holdings.  To this end, holdings surrendered under the scheme to younger farmers must be enlarged.  In this case, each of two applicants involved leased land to the other applicant's son to fulfill the obligation in relation to enlargement.  As a result, the total area farmed following transfers of the lands was no greater than that originally farmed by the retiring farmers. This situation clearly does not meet the enlargement requirements of the scheme.  As the person referred to in the question had been accepted into the scheme before this situation came to light, payment of his pension has been suspended.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  In effect, the regulations required that a comparison be carried out betweeen the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualfying under the 1996 schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms and conditions of the regulation, only money recouped from farmers who had fewer animals qualifying for premium under the 1996 suckler cow and 1996 special beef premium schemes could be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  As the number of eligible animals qualifying for premium under the 1996 schemes exceeded the number qualifying under the 1995 schemes, the rates for payment on the additional animals had to be adjusted downwards accordingly.  The person named had 15 additional eligible animals for payment <Col N="662" /> under the 1996 suckler cow scheme and 12 additional animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 special beef premium scheme.  He was paid top-up amounting to £108.60 &mdash; 15 × £7.24; and £119.76 &mdash; 12 × £9.98 respectively on these animals.  The person concerned has, therefore, received his full entitlement under EU regeulations.</P>

For the average existing REPS 80 acre farmer in an NHA, this will mean an increse in the annual payment from £4,960 to £6,400.  The maximum NHA payment increases from £6,200 per annum to £9,400.</P>

      <P>The disadvantaged areas appeals panel examined all areas from which appeals for reclassification were received.  In the case of Monaghan, the panel recommended some 38,000 hectares for reclassification, and this was accepted by the EU Commission in October 1995.</P>
      <P>As a result of representations received in 1996, the data relating to Monaghan was re-examined, and a number of additional areas were identified which satisfied the criteria for reclassification.  A submission was sent to the EU Commission in April 1997 requesting that these additional areas of Monaghan be reclassified as more severely handicapped.</P>
      <P>However, the Commission was, at that time, involved in discussions with my Department about overgrazing and environmental protection issues, and was unable to consider submissions relating to less favoured areas until these had been concluded.  As discussions on these issues have now largely been concluded, I will be contacting the Commission with a view to reactivating the proposal relating to additional areas in Monaghan, and I hope to bring the matter to a speedy conclusion.</P>

      <P>The applicant's REPS application includes grazing rights in a natural heritage area, the entitlement to which has recently been established. The new revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for commonage land and land on which grazing rights exist. The preparation of the framework plan will be carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  A sufficient number of planners have already been trained to prepare these plans.  It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages-grazing rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of an interim national framework plan have been drawn up to enable farmers with commonage <Col N="668" /> and or grazing rights to participate in REPS pending the implementation of commonage framework plans.  Under these new arrangements this application can now be processed with a view to making an early payment.</P>
    <P>The new payment rates in REPS are as follows: £80 per acre for the first 100 acres; £8 per acre between 101 and 200 acres; and £6 per acre between 201 and 300 acres.  For the average existing REPS 80 acre farmer in an NHA, this will mean an increase in the annual payment from £4,960 to £6,400.  The maximum NHA payment increases from £6,200 per annum to £9,400.</P>

      <P>The fodder scheme is directed at all sheep farmers with mountain grazings and suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons in district electoral divisions in the worst affected areas based on a Teagasc survey published in September. The scheme is intended for farmers with significant fodder problems.  Failure to qualify for headage payments will not automatically rule out qualification for the fodder scheme.</P>

      <P>It has been brought to my attention that some civil engineering contractors involved in public tendering have expressed a preference for an open tendering procedure rather than a two stage selective tendering process.  It is a basic principle of Government procurement that a procedure based on competitive tendering should always be used.  Government guidelines on public procurement, most recently revised and published in 1994, have always allowed for the use of two stage selective tendering as an alternative to open tendering. Similarly, the EU public procurement directives have been in existence since 1971 -93/37/EEC is a consolidation of earlier works directives &mdash; and also make provisions for such a method of tendering.  The guidelines and directives have served both the contracting authorities and the industry well and have ensured openness and fairness in the placing of public contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic review of the construction industry, which was established by the then Minister for the Environment in March 1996 and reported in June 1997, made recommedations concerning <Col N="679" /> two stage selective tendering.  These recommendations are being considered by a task force of the forum for the construction industry, which has construction industry federation representation.  I understand that the views of those contractors with reservations about two stage selective tendering have been brought to the attention of the task force.</P>

Section 368 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for accelerated capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of industrial buildings.  The allowances consist of an initial allowance of 50 per cent and accelerated annual allowances up to 100 per cent.  Section 369 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for accelerated capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of commercial premises. The allowances are similar to those for industrial buildings.  However, there is a provision to reduce them to a half in any case where a ministerial order designating an area as a qualifying area so specifies.  Section 370 provides for double rent relief for the first ten years to lessees of such commercial or industrial buildings in qualifying areas. Section 371 provides for tax relief in respect of expenditure incurred by owner-occupiers on the construction or refurbishment of certain residential dwellings in qualifying areas.  The relief consists of an annual allowance of 5 per cent for ten years in respect of construction expenditure and 10 per cent for ten years in respect of refurbishment expenditure.</P>
      <P>However, section 30 of the 1998 Finance Act inserted as section 409A into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, limits the amount of capital allowances on industrial or commercial buildings that an individual passive investor can set off against non-rental income to £25,000 in any one year.  This provision does not apply to owner-operators and corporate investors.</P>

      <P>The proposed tax incentives for the Custom House Docks area extension are accelerated capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of commecial buildings, double rent allowance for the lessees of these buildings for ten years and rates remission on a sliding scale for ten years.  All new tax incentives for commercial and industrial development in particular areas must be notified to the EU Commission for consideration in the context of State Aids.  Consequently my Department formally notified the EU Commission of the tax incentives for the Custom House Docks area extension last January.  A meeting took place with the EU Commission in Brussels in February to discuss this proposal.  Apart from delays, the first indication from the Commission that there was a problem from its point of view was given at a meeting in Dublin in mid-April.  This was confirmed at a follow up meeting in Brussels in May 1998.</P>
      <P>The Commission's view now is that it is opposed on state aid grounds to the granting of double rent relief and rates remission except for small scale activities or locally based services in areas where physical degradation is associated with social disadvantage or high unemployment. A detailed reply was sent in October to the EU Commission in response to its most recent letter of mid-September.  The timescale for approval of this and other schemes is a matter for the EU Commission and its response is now awaited.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the Contingency Fund which is a non-statutory fund of £20,000 which may be utilised in very limited circumstances, formed by a grant-in-aid voted by the Dáil in 1923-24 (the vote was confirmed in the Appropriation Act, 1923) for the purpose of defraying urgent or unforeseen expenditure which: is not covered by ordinary Vote; cannot immediately, but will subsequently be brought to the notice of the Dáil; the Dáil may reasonably be expected to approve; and is subject to the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>All advances from the fund are repaid either by (a) a new or additional Vote if the advance is for a completely new service or (b) by way of Supplementary Estimate, if the service is related to an existing Vote.</P>
      <P>By agreement with the Committee of Public Accounts the use of the fund is precluded when the Dáil is sittiing and for new services of a controversial nature.</P>
      <P>The account of the fund is published each year with the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also have in mind the contingency provision in the budgetary arithmetic for the second and third year of the three year multi-annual budgetary system.  This represents a prudent provision in the overall budgetary projections against possible adverse factors outside the control of Government which may impact on the budget position but which cannot be foreseen at the time of a budget.  Examples are variability in tax buoyancy and exceptional costs arising in areas of public expenditure.  There is no provision made in the first year of any budget as all factors relating to the initial year are more clearly known.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 250 together.</P>
      <P>Incentives for investment by Irish firms in research and development are provided mainly in the form of direct grant aid and currently over £25 million per annum is provided for research and development under the science and technology development programme, which is funded by the Exchequer and the EU.</P>
      <P>Tax incentives have a limited role to play in promoting investment in research and development though there are a number of specific schemes in place, such as BES relief for commercial research and development and enhanced allowances for research and development expenditure under section 766 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government plans to introduce a single 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate for trading income which represents a major incentive for all businesses in the State. This will help to ensure that there are adequate after-tax profits for investment by firms in research and development.</P>
      <P>Agreement has been reached with the EU Commission on the timetable for phasing out the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing and certain internationally traded services.  This will require substantial reductions over the coming years in the standard corporation tax rate, currently 32 per cent rate, so as to facilitate the introduction of the 12.5 per cent rate by 1 January, 2003.  Given the significant Exchequer cost associated with this, a much more restrictive approach will be required not only in relation to the maintenance and scope of existing tax incentives but more especially in the provision of any new ones.  In this context, therefore, I would not see tax credits as an appropriate vehicle for encouraging investment in research and development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 265 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services <Col N="685" /> for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  It should also be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision previous Governments did not feel it was justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review the medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families.  My Department is continuing to have discussions with the health board chief executive officers regarding their views on these issues.  I hope to be in a position soon to come to a view about what ought to be done arising out of this review.</P>

    <P>In 1998, I allocated the sum of £1 million between the eight health boards to address the issue of waiting lists for community ophthalmic services. This initiative has seen a reduction of over 72 per cent in the numbers on waiting lists and a reduction in mean waiting time over the course of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> There is significant variation in waiting time between the eight health boards and different schemes for the provision of sight-testing operate in each health board.  In early 1998, a working group of representatives of the health boards and the Association of Optometrists Ireland was established to discuss the provision of an adult sight-testing scheme to replace the existing <i>ad-hoc</i> schemes and which would be similar in its application in each health board.  I am informed that these discussions are now close to conclusion and I look forward to studying its recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a major redevelopment plan for St. Vincent's Hospital has been approved by my Department at a cost in excess of £50 million.  The first phase of this project involves the provision of new or refurbished accommodation in the following five major departments at the hospital: ambulatory day care; accident and emergency; intensive care unit; pathology; radiology and nuclear medicine.</P>
      <P>I am aware that detailed plans for the development have been submitted by the hospital to the planning authority, Dublin Corporation.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for Dublin Corporation to assess and decide on the planning application.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the commencement of the development, it is considered necessary that the nurses home, which is located on the hospital site, be removed.  This 13 storey building, built around 1970, was designed as a residence for student nurses but is no longer required by the hospital for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project team charged with overseeing the hospital development, which includes senior professional and administrative officials from my Department, considered possible uses for the building through a number of option appraisals. However, no suitable hospital use was found.  In addition, the construction cost of refurbishing this building to current acceptable standards at in <Col N="687" /> excess of £5 million, excluding equipping and alteration costs, was estimated.</P>
    <P>If the Nurses' Home were to be developed for residential purposes, outside of the hospital's needs, additional spaces would be required for parking and ancillary facilities associated with the development.</P>
    <P>The St. Vincent's Hospital site is somewhat restricted in terms of available space and this would present a scenario whereby there would be insufficient area left for parking and ancillary facilities associated with the hospital development.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and the legal responsibility, under the Health Act, 1970, for the determination of eligibility for medical cards is with the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>I, as Minister for Health and Children, do not have a function in the issue of medical cards to individuals.  However, as the determination of eligibility of the person concerned is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board I have asked him to have the matter investigated and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main focus in the treatment of drug addiction is the provision of treatment facilities to respond to the problem posed by heroin addiction in the Dublin area.  The aim is to develop a multifaceted integrated approach which will range from education and prevention through treatment, both in-patient and out-patient, to after care and rehabilitation.  The ultimate objective is to return the drug user to a drug-free lifestyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> In so far as treatment is concerned, the rationale behind the provision of such treatment is to attempt to reduce the damage caused by heroin misuse to the individual drug misuser, to his or her immediate circle of family and friends and to society generally.  In this regard it is worth noting that the percentage of HIV positive cases attributable to intravenous drug use has fallen since the introduction of harm reduction measures such as needle exchange and methadone maintenance programmes for opiate misusers.  In addition, I understand that the reduction in crime figures recently reported by the Garda Síochána is partly attributable to the increase in the number of treatment places for drug misusers.  During 1997 the Eastern Health Board provided treatment for an additional 900 drug misusers.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board's drug treatment services were evaluated by two international experts in the drug field in 1996.  The overall conclusion was that the board was following best international practice in developing its drug services and that it should continue with such development.  These experts also noted that there is reasonable evidence internationally that treatment interventions provide a high level of return immediately for money spent.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the approach being pursued in response to the drug problem is the correct one and that it is in line with best international practice.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259, 284, 285, 288 and 289 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, set out the requirements for the development of these services over a five-year period and estimated the cost at £50 million over the period.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of 1997, the previous Government made available an additional £3.688 million revenue for the maintenance and development of the services.  After taking office, this Government provided £10 million by way of additional funding before the end of 1997.  This was allocated to agencies in the voluntary sector providing services to people with physicial and sensory disabilities for the provision of aids and appliances, to assist capital projects and for the elimination of accumulated funding deficits.  This year, £5.4 million revenue has been provided, as well as £3 million for capital projects.  In addition, I have made £0.812 million available for other capital items.  Therefore, I have allocated over £19 million for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities over the last 12 months or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.  With regard to the provision of health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, this commitment comprehends the implementation of the recommendations set out in Towards an Independent Future.  I am satisfied that the additional money made available to date by this Government represents a major step towards implementing the recommendations of the report. <Col N="690" /></P>

It would not be appropriate for me to issue directions to the board in relation to consultation with local communities about the location of treatment centres.</P>
      <P>In any event, I understand from the board that, as a matter of policy, it engages in consultation with community representatives.  I further understand that, in the case of the location referred to by the Deputy, the board met with local public representatives and a large group of representatives of local traders and residents on 19 October 1998.  Since that date the board has been in constant communications with resident associations in the area and has agreed to make itself available at all times for meetings.  In addition the board has agreed to keep local resident associations appraised of all developments relating to its proposals for the development of services at the location in question.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the board is behaving in a reasonable manner in its dealings with representatives of the local community.

      <P>These are figures extracted from the board's annual financial statements.

    <P>There may be some instances where women are waiting somewhat longer than the average waiting time but the great majority of women are seen within the average stated.  Where a woman is concerned at the length of time she has to wait for a mammogram, she can ask her general practitioner to discuss her case with a consultant radiologist, who decides upon the priority of cases.</P>

The estimated capital cost of this new development will be in the order of £15 million.</P>
      <P>As part of the final process of commissioning the new development, I have this year provided a sum of £600,000 to the hospital to enable it to proceed with the staffing of the development with a view to bringing the new facility into operation. Formal approval has been granted to the hospital for the employment of an extra 92 staff.  An additional sum of £400,000 was also provided for the fitting out of the shelled-out space on level five of the new development.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that preparations for the opening of the new development are almost complete and I have recently accepted an invitation from the hospital to open the new development on 7 December 1998.  With the completion of the new development, the Mercy Hospital will have an even more important role in the provision of health care in Cork.

      <P>A joint waste management board, representative of my Department and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, has appointed contractors to provide the service of collection, transport, treatment and disposal of the clinicial and health care risk waste which arises in hospitals throughout the island of Ireland.  The treatment process will consist of shredding and decontamination.  The contract includes a significant element of recycling in that metals and plastics will be recovered for conversion to useful products and the combustible residue will be converted to refuse-derived fuel.</P>
      <P>The programme envisages the first treatment plant, located in Dublin, commencing operation early in 1999.  The recycling plant will follow in 2000 and in the interim the treated waste will go to landfill.  The non-risk waste arising in hospitals in Dublin and throughout the country will continue to follow the municipal waste route, which at present is to landfill.</P>

      <P>Each year, hospitals are notified of their noncapital allocation and a service plan is drawn up by them and agreed with the Department.  This plan sets down parameters for activity for the year and hospitals are required to maintain activity levels within the hospital's agreed parameters. Detailed decisions in relation to hospital spending are a matter for the hospital management. In this regard, my Department has been advised that the hospital's management has decided to take one of its CT machines out of operation until the end of this year as part of its plan to live within budget.  The hospital has informed my Department that this measure allows it to deal with all emergency and prioritised elective cases in a satisfactory manner.</P>

However, the World Health Organisation estimates a rate of the severer degrees of dementia, which would include Alzheimer's disease at 5 to 8 per cent among those aged 65 years of age and over.  Applying these rates to the present population of older people in Ireland suggests that between 20,000 and 33,000 people are suffering from dementia.  Of these between 60 per cent-70 per cent are suffering from Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>The services available for those suffering from dementia include a range of community services such as general practitioner services, public health nurses, access to community ward teams, care attendants available for long-term domicillary support, home helps and meals on wheels. People with dementia have access to acute medical and psychiatric assessment services when the need arises as the treatment of medical and psychiatric problems improves the quality of life for both sufferers and carers.</P>
      <P>Specialist medical services for older people, geriatric medicine services, include services for those with dementia who predominantly suffer from medical problems.  These services provide essential medical assessment in a day hospital linked to a department of medicine for older people in an acute general hospital.</P>
      <P>In addition to the dedicated services for dementia-Alzheimer's disease, it should be noted that people with these conditions who do not exhibit aggressive-disruptive behaviour are and will continue to be cared for in health board extended care hospitals-homes including day care units.  Private nursing homes also provide a substantial bed resource for Alzheimer's patients who receive assistance towards the cost of their care <i>via</i> the subvention scheme operated under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The Alzheimer's Society of Ireland was formed by dedicated relatives and friends of persons with Alzheimer's disease to create maximum awareness of the illness and to supply information and help including day care to affected families.  In 1998, my Department allocated £180,000 funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for poeple with dementia throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The need to develop speicalist psychiatry of old age services, including services for people with Alzheimer's disease who require psychiatric treatment, has been identified as a priority.  An additional £1 million has been allocated to health boards in 1998 to develop such a service and I intend to continue this programme of development next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283, 286 and 287 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Service needs vary from one area to another. The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, recommended the establishment of regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  The functions of these committees are, <i>inter alia,</i> to advise <Col N="700" /> the chief executive officers of the health boards in relation to the identification and prioritising of service needs locally and on the priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.</P>
    <P>The agreement of standard criteria to be used by health boards in assessing applications for services is a matter which will continue to be pursued with the health boards by officials of my Department as part of the implementation of the recommendations of the review group.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296, 302, 303 and 304 together.</P>
      <P>I have set out the details requested in the following tables.  The table providing information on the public in-patient waiting list numbers relates to figures available at the end of June 1998.</P>
      <P>In relation to the information on vacant approved consultant posts, this has been supplied by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  The information supplied contains a breakdown of these posts by health board area rather than by hospital due to the number of joint appointments between geographically close hospitals.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal was established in 1970 to regulate the number and type of consultant and senior registrar appointments and to specify qualifications for these levels.  The procedures in filling a consultant post involve, in the first instance, the submission of an application form to the Department of Health and Children from the relevant agency which identifies the financial and service implications of the post.  The Department assesses this application and if considered appropriate from the financial and policy perspectives, would furnish approval to the agency.  The agency then submits the post for clearance to comhairle.  It should be noted that comhairle can only consider an application for a consultant post on foot of departmental approval.</P>
      <P>A critical consideration by this Department in approving consultant posts is the equitable provision of acute hospital specialities throughout the country.  In this regard, a number of policy documents, such as the health strategy, the cancer strategy and the emerging cardiovascular strategy, serve as guiding principles towards ensuring that each region is self-sufficient in the main acute hospital specialties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A post approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal is classified as vacant until an appointee takes up duty on a permanent basis.  The selection and appointment process to be undergone following comhairle approval can take some time.  This involves preparing the necessary documentation, advertising the post, constituting an interview <Col N="703" /> board, making a recommendation and ultimately agreeing a starting date between the employer and appointee.  Therefore, as many factors can <Col N="704" /> impinge on the time taken to complete this process, the Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible to give a precise indication as to when consultant posts would be approved and filled.</P>

      <P>The important role played by home helps in the care of older people is widely recognised and there is growing demand for the home help service to be better organised and developed.  In this regard, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation of the home help service in Ireland by the policy research centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  It is expected that this report will be submitted to me and published shortly.  It is my intention that the recommendations of the report will be fully <Col N="727" /> considered with a view to early implementation. The issue of funding for the service will be considered in the context of the recommendations of the report and the availability of resources.  The difficulties referred to by the Deputy in the Eastern Health Board area will be examined as part of this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities regarding this matter and I have been informed that the breast screening clinic at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital is booked up until the end of December but that appointments for January are available.  I understand that patients who are considered urgent will be given an earlier appointment.  I have been advised that patients are not required to see a consultant prior to referral to the clinic.  However, the consultant radiologist in the hospital's breast screening clinic is responsible for the referral of patients to the surgical out-patients' department if they are in need of surgical intervention.</P>
      <P>I am committed to developing mammography services in line with the principles of the national cancer strategy.  In the Eastern Health Board area, the regional directors of cancer services are preparing proposals for the further development of services for the treatment of cancer, including breast cancer.</P>
      <P>In addition to the provision of mammography services, work is continuing on the introduction of a formal breast screening programme aimed at detecting breast cancer in assymptomatic women. Phase 1 of the programme comprises the Eastern, Midland and North-Eastern Health Board areas. I am committed to starting the screening programme as soon as possible.  To this end I have approved funding to date of £2 million to cover the start-up costs and minor capital equipment needs of the programme.  In addition I recently approved a capital allocation of £1,035,000 towards the refurbishment of 36 Eccles Street, Mater Hospital, as a screening and assessment unit and also as headquarters of the programme, and a capital allocation of £897,750 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key determinant regarding the start-up date for the breast screening programme will be the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff, advertisements for which were recently placed in the national press.  Once the relevant <Col N="728" /> staff are ready to take up their appointments we should be in a position to start the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 1,350 hospital consultant posts in the public sector.  It is difficult to compare the work of hospital consultants across EU countries because of the different functions performed and the degree of accessability to public and private patients.  In Ireland the present consultant population ratio is approximately one consultant per 2,660 people while in Scotland and Northern Ireland, areas which would be similar, the ratio in 1996 was approximately one per 1,990 of population and one per 1,930 of population respectively.</P>
      <P>I have established the forum on medical manpower to review in a fundamental way the medical staffing in public hospitals.  The focus of the medical manpower initiative concerns addressing the imbalance between career posts and training posts; the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in this country, and the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals.</P>
      <P>There are approximately two junior doctors for every consultant employed.  Non-consultant hospital doctors regard career prospects as poor and a large number emigrate.  Young doctors tend to leave at the point where they have just acquired the skills and expertise and are ready to make a real contribution to Irish hospitals. Women doctors also leave the system and we need to examine the reasons why this is happening so that solutions can be found to facilitate the optimum use of their skills and develop training structures to accommodate their needs.</P>
      <P>Other areas which require attention are the different needs of larger and smaller hospitals, combining other disciplines with medical staffing, e.g. general practitioners and nurses, and coping with the demographic changes which have occurred in Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum, which has met three times, is examining areas such as the adequacy of medical cover in the hospital system and the ratio of doctors in Ireland compared with other EU states and I do not want to pre-empt the deliberations of the forum by commenting on these specific issues at this time.  I hope, however, that what emerges begins to resolve the medical manpower problems in the Irish context and will take into account the special needs of our public hospital system. <Col N="729" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the composition of industrial waste arisings varies widely.  In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, it is a matter for each industrial concern to make appropriate arrangements for the recovery or disposal of its waste arisings.  In this regard, waste brokerage services are available, which can arrange for the treatment of hazardous wastes, either in Irish facilities or abroad.  The treatment of problematic wastes can be costly, and it is obviously in the interest of a waste producer to minimise the volume and harmfulness of waste arisings.</P>
      <P>Agricultural, commercial and industrial activities are subject to legal obligations with regard to waste minimisation.  Under section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, a person engaged in such activity is required to take such reasonable steps as are necessary for the purpose of preventing or minimising the production of waste from that activity.  In the case of activities which are subject to integrated pollution control licensing under Part IV of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, the EPA may not grant a licence for an activity unless it is satisfied that the best available technology not entailing excessive costs will be used to prevent or eliminate or, where that is not practicable, to limit or reduce emissions from the activity.</P>
      <P>The EPA is engaged in the preparation of a national hazardous waste management plan which, among other things, will identify facilities currently available for the collection, recovery or disposal of hazardous wastes, and make recommendations regarding waste facilities and other physical resources considered to be necessary for the management of hazardous wastes.  It is expected that a draft national plan will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>Sketch design and cost plan proposals for a new branch library in Gorey, County Wexford were received by the Department in February 1997 and are being considered.  Having regard to the high level of demand for funding for public library proposals generally, it has not been possible to indicate when the proposals may be approved. However, I have recently received the public library policy review report and will be arranging for a review of applications for funding generally, in the light of the report's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Dublin taxi forum, August 1998, made a number of recommendations relevant to wheelchair access to taxis.  These include recommendations for all new taxi licences to be for wheelchair accessible taxis, VRT on such vehicles to be zero rated, and a consumer focus panel to be established by Dublin taxi interests.  These recommendations have been addressed to, and are being considered by, the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>Figures for 1996, prepared by the EPA based on official Government data such as national energy statistics and other activity data, show that the net increase for the greenhouse gas emissions, covered by the Kyoto Protocol, from 1990 was 3.9 per cent. Official data also show that the increase in CO 2 emissions alone from 1990 was 13.3 per cent. Data on emissions trends and projections are included in Ireland's second national communication under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and in the consultancy study, Limitation and Reduction of CO 2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland.  Copies of both publications are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 334, 335, 336 and 337 together.</P>
      <P>I fully support the aims of Rural Resettlement Ireland Ltd., RRI.  Since 1992 my Department has approved grants totalling £347,000 towards the administrative and general expenses of RRI in respect of their housing related activities, including £67,000 this year.</P>
      <P>Recognising the contribution that rural resettlement can make to meeting social housing needs my Department has agreed that housing authorities may make a grant of £1,000 to RRI in respect of each dwelling returned to the authority by a tenant moving to a rural area under the RRI programme.</P>
      <P>RRI has been granted approved body status for the purposes of the voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes.  Households moving under the RRI programme may also be elibible for local authority house purchase loans or the shared ownership scheme, and the deposit requirement under the latter scheme has been eased in these cases at the request of RRI. In addition the mortgage allowance and improvement works-in-lieu schemes can be used to assist families wishing to resettle in a rural area.</P>
      <P>A resettlement mortgage jointly funded through the local authority, by the housing finance agency, Bank of Ireland and RRI was introduced in July 1996.  This mortgage assists qualifying families to resettle permanently by purchasing and restoring, where necessary, existing houses.</P>
      <P>A pilot rural resettlement scheme providing for the building or acquisition by local authorities of 40 houses in Counties Clare, Galway, Kerry, Mayo and Roscommon was notified to the county councils in May 1997.  An additional 40 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; were allocated in 1998 and the scheme was extended to include Cork (North), Donegal, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Offaly, Sligo and Tipperary (North) county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that RRI has resettled approximately 350 families using the various measures available to them to assist their resettlement programme. Information on the number of families seeking resettlement is not available in my <Col N="739" /> Department as the programme is administered by RRI.</P>
    <P>A working group involving my Department, RRI and local authorities has been established recently to assess the potential of a joint RRI/Irish Farmers Association resettlement proposal that my Department would fund a pilot programme of special grants aimed at restoring derelict houses owned by farmers for occupation by families resettling under the RRI programme.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing the new house grant scheme normally preclude payment of a grant where a person, or the spouse of such person, had previously purchased or built, individually or with each other, another house for his/her own occupation.  However, a grant may be allowed where:</P>
      <P>(a) the marriage of the person has been dissolved or annulled by court order, or the person is separated under a court order or deed of separtion; and</P>
      <P>(b) the person and any dependants are in need of housing; and refusal to pay the grant would cause undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Each such application is considered on its merits. In this particular case, having regard to the applicant's income, it has not been possible to authorise payment of a grant.

The application of the restriction on a zonal or other basis would be a matter for the local authority concerned. <Col N="741" /></P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This applies to long-term payments such as pensions; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>Similarly, certain social welfare secondary benefits, comprising the christmas bonus, butter vouchers and the free fuel allowance, are payable only in conjunction with long-term social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on longterm payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in Child Benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is <Col N="742" /> more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the availability of child dependant allowances to short-term welfare claimants would have to be considered in this context and since any changes would also carry cost implications, they would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of the resources available and of other competing priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to dental and optical benefits under the treatment benefits scheme is conditional on having sufficient PRSI contributions paid or credited to qualify.  Under EU regulations, which provide for the protection of the social security rights of migrant workers, account can be taken of periods of insurance completed in other member states to satisfy these contribution conditions, provided that the person was last insured under Irish legislation before the date of claim.</P>
      <P>The EU regulations provide that normally the legislation of one member state is applicable at any one time and that is the legislation of the country of employment or last employment.  Irish legislation, therefore, would not be applicable under the EU regulations in the case of pensioners who were last insured under the legislation of another member state.  There is, accordingly, no legal basis in such cases to take account of their periods of insurance completed in other states for the purposes of claims to treatment benefits.</P>
      <P>If, as the Deputy suggests, provision was made in Irish legislation to go beyond the EU regulations and take account of periods of insurance completed in other member states to qualify for treatment benefits, then pensioners with insurance in those states could come to Ireland to obtain these benefits without ever having been insured here, with the cost to be fully borne by Irish PRSI contributors and taxpayers.  It would also mean that they would in many cases retain entitlement to corresponding benefits under the legislation of the country where they were last insured.</P>
      <P>Under the EU regulations pensioners resident in Ireland who are in receipt of a pension from one or more other member states are entitled to the full range of health services free of charge, the cost of which is financed by the competent state, the state to whose legislation the pensioner has been subject for the longest period or the state of last insurance.  The provision of such services is arranged through the issue of medical cards to the persons concerned, irrespective of their level of income.  The health services provided include dental and optical benefits under the appropriate health board schemes.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that an extension of the scheme on the lines proposed by the Deputy would be warranted and I have no plans at present to do so.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to SWA rent supplement is determined by the health boards. Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.  Applicants are also required to furnish evidence of residence and of the rent level from time to time.</P>
      <P>Rent supplement cases are reviewed regularly. The rent review form issues directly to the tenant who approaches the landlord to complete the form.  The form is then returned to the health board by the tenant.</P>
      <P>All social welfare payments, including rent supplement payments, are recorded and processed using the RSI number as the unique identifier, supplemented by personal details.  Putting the RSI number on the SWA review form facilitates the speedy processing of claims and payments relating to rent supplement.</P>
      <P>This use of the RSI number is in keeping with practice governing the processing of all welfare payments and it is not considered to be an unnecessary intrusion upon the individual.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Question Nos. 349, 350 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the back to work allowance scheme is to assist long-term unemployed people and lone parents to take up jobs as either employees or self-employed persons by providing them with some financial security during the initial years of their return to work.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the back to work allowance, applicants must be at least 12 months unemployed and have an entitlement to unemployment assistance or be in receipt of the one parent family payment.  The carer's allowance is not a qualifying payment for the purposes of the back to work allowance.  A condition for the receipt of that allowance requires the carer to provide full-time care and attention to the person being cared for.</P>
      <P>The notification of the decision to disallow the claim issued to the person concerned on 24 October 1998 and was signed and dated by the deciding officer.  The form also contains the Department's address and a contact telephone number.  It informed the person concerned that his application was not successful because he was not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment at the time of application.  It is my Department's policy, as enunciated in its customer action plan, to provide clear and accurate information to customers and to simplify forms and leaflets. In this connection all forms issued in connection with the back to work allowance are being reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the Department's customer service standards and the Deputy's comments will be taken on board in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to a strong social welfare pension based on social insurance, including the achievement of an old age pension rate of £100 per week by 2002.</P>
      <P>An important step towards achieving this objective was taken through the £5 per week increase granted in the 1998 budget and the Government will continue its work in this area in the forthcoming budget.  The level of increase in social welfare pensions in the 1998 budget was ahead both of the expected increase in the consumer price index and the increase in average earnings.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board recommended that social welfare pensions should be increased in line with prices at a minimum and that it would be desirable to aim, over the medium term, to increase social welfare pensions in real terms in line with the growth of earnings in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Participants in the back to work allowance scheme may retain their entitlement to a rent supplement, subject to certain conditions.  Participants must make a minimum contribution, usually £8.10, towards their accommodation costs, their gross household income must not exceed £250 per week and their rent supplementation is subject to a maximum payment of £250 per month.  Recipients are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to rent supplement is reviewed yearly in these cases.  A rent supplement review form is issued for completion requesting details of any change in address or circumstances.  Documentary evidence that gross weekly income is less than £250 must also be provided to ensure there is continued entitlement to a rent supplement.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, the person concerned failed to comply with one of the conditions in that he did not provide the information requested by the local community welfare officer.  Furthermore, the community welfare officer was unable to interview him at the address in respect of which the rent supplement had been in payment, despite making several attempts to do so over a three month period from 12 December 1997 to 24 February 1998.  In the circumstances, the community welfare officer had no option but to suspend payment of rent supplement in this case on 24 February 1998.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has not contacted the health board in connection with the suspension of the rent supplement since that date.</P>

      <P>There was a delay in forwarding the necessary documentation to the social welfare appeals office for consideration.

      <P>I should initially draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that the REP scheme is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>The Rural Environment Protection Scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; is designed to reward farmers for carrying out their activities in an environmentally friendly manner.  Under the scheme, protection is afforded to hedgerows under measures 4, 5 and Supplementary Measure 1.  The relevant provisions are as follows: Measure 4 &mdash; Retain Wildlife Habitats: the objective of this measure is to retain wildlife habitats such as hedgerows.  Any interference with specified habitats such as the hedgerow, can only be carried out as part of an agreed plan under REPS.  Measure 5 &mdash;Maintain Farm and Field Boundaries: the objective of this measure is to maintain boundary and road-side fences and stone walls and to manage hedgerows in the interests of stock control, wildlife and scenic appearance of the area.  Farmers and land-owners are required to prepare a five year management and maintenance plan for existing hedgerows on their farms.  Where the upkeep of the hedgerows and stonewalls is required over the period of the plan, the work should be carried out in proportionate stages and on a phased basis.  Supplementary Measure 1 &mdash; the objective of this measure is to conserve environmentally sensitive NHAs of national as well as international significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clear objective of REPS is to, <i>inter alia</i>, contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, and the scheme includes specific measures such as those mentioned which are intended to deliver this.  In addition to REPS, there are a number of <Col N="748" /> other measures which provide for the conservation of hedgerows.  The Deputy will be aware that hedgerows are currently afforded protection by means of section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and regulation 26 of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, which transposed Article 10 of the EU habitats directive.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also be aware that the issue of hedgerow conservation, including any further possible legal or other measures which might be required, if any, is presently being considered by me in the context of the forthcoming amendment of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the development of a national biodiversity plan.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a subsidised passenger ferry service was introduced by my Department earlier this year on a pilot basis for the islands of Inishturk, Inishboffin and Clare Island.  Subsequently in August last tenders were sought by my Department for the provision of suitable passenger ferry services between these three islands and the mainland for the period 1 October 1998 to 30 June 1999.  I have already approved a subsidy for the Inishturk service which I understand is now in operation.</P>
      <P>With regard to Clare Island and Inishboffin, discussions are currently taking place with relevant parties in this regard.  I am, therefore, not in a postion to sanction the payment of subsidies for these islands at this time.  However, I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on this matter in the near future.</P>

    <P>The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, amended the law so that the three-year limitation period runs from the date on which the injured person discovers, or could reasonably have discovered, that the injury occurred, if this <Col N="751" /> date is later than the act or omission leading to the injury.  I understand that this Act substantially implemented the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report on the Statute of Limitations &mdash; claims in respect of latent personal injuries, LRC 21-1987, and that it removed constitutional doubts that had emerged regarding the law in this area.</P>
    <P>While I have no proposals for change of the specific type outlined in the Deputy's question, the law is kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>Prisoners Week was launched in Canada over a decade ago by various religious groups.  The objective is to raise awareness of wider issues surrounding imprisonment.  The focus of Prisoners Week is holistic and embraces victims, prisoners, prison officers, their families and the community. There is an emphasis on healing the hurt done rather than on vengeance or retribution.  It is <Col N="753" /> also known as Restorative Justice Week and is marked throughout the world to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
      <P>In Ireland it is organised by a group comprising members of prison chaplains, Pax Christi, Amnesty International, Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas and others.  The group have put in place a three year project to bring greater awareness of this issue.  At present they are in year one of this project which involved the supply of basic resource material to parishes-schools in Dublin.  In 1999 a comprehensive resource pack will be prepared for parishes, primary and secondary schools, youth clubs and resource centres in the Dublin area and in 2000 it is planned to ensure that Prisoners Sunday and Restorative Justice Week will be marked throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My Department will co-operate with these groups as best it can and, where possible, assist them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 374 to 376, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958 provides for the designation of investments in which trust funds, including money under the control or subject to the order of any court, may be invested.  Section 2 of the Act of 1958 provides <Col N="756" /> that the Minister for Finance may by order vary by addition or deletion the investments in which trust funds may be invested.  I understand that an order was made by the Minister for Finance under that provision on 9 February 1998 entitled the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1998.  The order came into operation on 9 March 1998.  The order replaces the previous list of investments in which trust funds may be invested with a new extended list.  The new list contains general categories of securities, deposits, collective investment schemes, life assurance contracts and equities.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for a court to decide, within the provisions of the Act of 1958 and any order made thereunder by the Minister for Finance, the appropriate investment in respect of any money under its control.  I have no function in the matter. I understand, however, that while courts seek to get the best possible return on investments, they are also very conscious of the need for making safe investments.</P>
    <P>As to seeking the views of the Courts Commission and the Courts Service Board, the working group on a courts commission, in its third report, recommended that the Courts Service should establish a comprehensive financial structure for management of all financial affairs of the courts which would include an investment function. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has responded positively to the recommendations in this report and recently put in place legislative provisions to facilitate the setting up of the Courts Service when enacting the Courts Service Act, 1998.  I expect that the Courts Service will be formally established in 1999.  I note that investment management is one of the issues the Commission recommends for attention by the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>As the establishment of the Courts Service is envisaged shortly, I will draw to the attention of the Courts Service Board this recommendation of the commission and consider any views which the board adopts in relation to this issue.</P>

      <P>Proceedings brought by the first person named by the Deputy against Ireland and the Attorney General were settled on 28 October by agreement. My predecessor, following receipt of legal advice, had previously agreed in principle to settle this action.  The terms of the settlement included a contribution by the State of £12,000 towards the plaintiff's legal costs.  As the State's costs have not been finalised in these proceedings, it is not possible to indicate the total cost to the Exchequer at this time.  In 1996, the High Court awarded the first person named his legal costs in respect of an unsuccessful action to be taken by him joined as a third party to proceedings brought against Ireland and the Attorney General by the second person named by the Deputy.  These costs amounted to £2,268.75.</P>
      <P>With regard to proceedings brought by the second person, the total amount paid by the State to him was £134,948.30. I have asked the office of the Chief State Solicitor to indicate the total of the State's costs in these proceedings and will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997.  This section allows gardaí, in respect of arrests other than those executed under a warrant, to give evidence by certificate of certain procedural matters, including evidence relating to arrest, charge and caution with the purpose of relieving them from the obligation of attending in person in court to give such evidence orally.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that section 6 currently operates in all Garda districts outside the Dublin <Col N="761" /> metropolitan area and the following Dublin metropolitan districts: Store Street, in relation to Dublin District Court; &ldquo;A&rdquo; (Kevin Street), &ldquo;L&rdquo; (Ballyfermot) and &ldquo;Q&rdquo; (Lucan) Districts, in relation to Kilmainham District Court, and &ldquo;N&rdquo; (Bray) District, in relation to Bray District Court. At present, the Garda authorities have no plans to expand its use pending a review.  It is too early to evaluate the effects that the legislation &mdash;including section 6 &mdash; is having on the amount of time that gardaí spend in court.</P>

The enrolment at Scoil Naomh Mhuire on 30 September 1997 was 117 pupils, which warrants a staffing of a principal and three assistant teachers for the 1998-99 school year.  These arrangements may be deviated from if a school is in breach of maximum class sizes guidelines, which are as follows: 35 in the case of a single-grade class group; 34 in the case of a class-group with two consecutive grades; and 31 in the case of a multi-grade class group.</P>

      <P>There is no team of specialised examiners as such who correct the work of candidates with specific learning difficulties.  For any one subject a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject regardless of whether the candidate has a specific learning difficulty or physical impairment which might cause difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination.  The key issue which arises in relation to marking work presented by candidates with specific learning difficulties is to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner to give the candidate full credit for all work done.  To that end in the event of the initial examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answer-book to his or her supervising examiner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the situation with regard to the schools mentioned by the Deputies.  My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  There were 60 remedial teacher posts and 26 resource teacher posts allocated to national schools in 1998.  Unfortunately, the number of schools seeking the appointment of a remedial teacher considerably exceeded the number of posts available for allocation.  There were no remedial or resource teacher posts allocated <Col N="766" /> to County Waterford in 1998.  An additional 15 psychologists took up duty in 1998 as part of a development project to expand the service to primary schools.  They are employed under this project for a period of three years, and the project will be evaluated.  There are currently no educational psychologists allocated to national schools in County Waterford.</P>
    <P>At present there are 1,302 ex-quota remedial teacher posts allocated to primary schools and 350 ex-quota remedial teacher posts allocated to second-level schools.  The report of the Special Education Review Committee recommended that one teacher should be appointed for every forty pupils in need of remedial teaching.  On this basis, approximately 105 remedial teacher posts are required at primary level and 130 remedial teacher posts are required at second level.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious problems that exist at St. Enda's national school, Carraroe, County Sligo, where the pupil-teacher ratio is high; his views on whether the method of calculating this ratio is accurate; his further views on the removal of the remedial and resource teacher; the plans, if any, he has to deal with this problem; when a decision will be made in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment at St. Enda's national school on 30 September 1997 was 338 pupils, which warrants a staffing of a principal and 11 teachers for the 1998-99 school year.  The school also has the services of a remedial teacher and a resource teacher for travellers. The above arrangements may be deviated from if a school is in breach of maximum class sizes guidelines, which are as follows: 35 in the case of a single-grade class group; 34 in the case of a class-group with two consecutive grades; and 31 in the case of a multi-grade class group.</P>
      <P>Where there is a breach of the above guidelines, the board of management is obliged to contact my Department early in the school year, and in any event not later than 1 November.  Since no such correspondence has been received from the board of management of St. Enda's, I regret that there is no basis for sanctioning an extra teacher. On the Deputy's reference to the removal of the posts of remedial and resource teacher for travellers from this school, I am happy to confirm that my Department has not withdrawn either of these posts.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner.  However, in the event of an examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner. This is to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
      <P>For any one subject a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject regardless of whether the candidate has a specific learning difficulty or physical impairment which might cause difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination.</P>
      <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.  The intention is to ensure that problems with readability whether or not brought to the attention of the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.  The change is operational in nature and as I have already explained does not involve any change in the actual marking of examination material submitted by students with specific learning difficulties. Every effort will continue to be made to ensure that full credit is given for work presented and in 1999 examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates in order to ensure equity and fairness.</P>

      <P>The ESF-aided middle level technician programme consists of one and two year courses up to national certificate level and the higher technical/business skills programme consists of three year national diploma and one year &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; diploma level courses.

    <P>The European Social Fund-aided maintenance grants scheme applies to eligible students attending such courses.

I understand from County Kilkenny VEC that on 14 October 1998 the student in question was incorrectly advised that she would qualify for grant assistance from the second year of her diploma course in 1999-2000.  Following discussions with officials of my Department on 15 October, a letter issued from the VEC advising the student of the correct situation in accordance with the terms of the ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post-primary schools.  PE halls are also provided when a major extension to a school which does not have such a facility is being built.  In addition, my Department has a programme for providing PE halls as stand-alone projects at post-primary schools which do not already have this facility and a number of such projects will proceed to construction in the current year.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a physical education hall at Loreto secondary school, Kilkenny, can only be considered in the context of capital available for post-primary building purposes generally and priority has to be given to the provision of essential classroom accommodation.  As a result it is not possible in present circumstances to provide grant aid for this project.  However, the application will continue to be considered in light of available resources and competing priorities.</P>

The Deputy will recall that the 1998 Estimates provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per <Col N="771" /> cent in expenditure on primary education over the 1997 budget allocation.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level represented an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to continue to effect significant improvements in the level of funding at primary level, and this commitment will be further reflected in the 1999 Estimates.</P>

      <P>The teacher referred to by the Deputy applied for a disability pension and also, without prejudice to this application, applied for a pension under strand 1 of the early retirement scheme for teachers.</P>
      <P>A disability pension is payable only where the chief medical officer for the Civil Service is satisfied, on the basis of the medical evidence, that the applicant is unfit to teach by reason of ill health and that the incapacity is likely to be permanent. In this case, the chief medical officer was unable to make a decision on the basis of the evidence submitted and requested that the teacher be examined by a specialist.</P>

    <P>In the meantime, the teacher was notified that her application under strand 1 was successful.  The <Col N="773" /> teacher stated that she would accept payment of pension under strand 1 pending a decision on her application for a disability pension.  She retired from teaching with effect from 1 January 1998.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the specialist's report, the chief medical officer was unable to recommend payment of a disability pension.  The teacher was notified of this decision and was also advised that an appeal could be made in the event of new medical evidence coming to hand.</P>
    <P>The teacher appealed and submitted further medical evidence directly to the chief medical officer.  Following consideration of all medical evidence, the CMO expressed the opinion that the teacher was not permanently unfit to teach by reason of ill health.</P>
    <P>Following her retirement, the teacher was in communication with the Department on many occasions regarding the outcome of her application for a disability pension and, later, regarding the outcome of her appeal.  It was made clear to her at all times that the decision would be based on the recommendation of the chief medical officer.  She was at no stage informed that her application had succeeded.</P>

      <P>For some time, my Department has considered that Ballinasloe is a suitable centre for a single school development, given its size and the need to provide new and upgraded accommodation in two of the schools.

      <Col N="774" /> My predecessor commissioned an independent report on the situation in 1996.

Under the new arrangements special classes will be established to cater for children with autism, either within a special school setting or in an ordinary primary school. The pupil teacher ratio applicable is 6:1.  Each class will also have the support of a child care assistant and receive capitation grant of £426 per pupil.</P>
      <P>There are currently 34 special classes for children with autism, 19 located in special schools and 15 in ordinary primary schools.  There are 34 teachers and 34 childcare assistants employed in these classes which have the capacity to cater for 204 children with autism.  My Department does not have details of the exact numbers enrolled in these classes at present.</P>

      <P>In the organisation of school transport services, all routes are planned so that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service, while at the same time ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to both primary and post-primary schools. This means that pupils are often required to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for some time in the evenings.</P>
      <P>Post-primary school transport services are planned so that, as far as possible, travelling and waiting times do not exceed three hours daily. However, every effort is made to keep waiting times to a minimum.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day-to-day running costs of primary schools.  These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which would include heating, <Col N="782" /> lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges.</P>
      <P>Local authority service and other charges are imposed by the various local authorities and do not come within the remit of my Department.  It would be a matter for the local authorities to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges and whether any provision is made for hardship cases.</P>

      <P>Among the objects set out for universities in the Unversities Act, 1997, is &ldquo;to support and contribute to the realisation of national economic and social development&rdquo;.  Also included among their functions is to &ldquo;promote and facilitate research&rdquo; and to &ldquo;collaborate with educational, business, professional, trade union, Irish language, cultural, artistic, community and other interests, both inside and outside the State, to further the objects of the university&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All institutes of technology are required in their legislation to provide vocational and technical training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State.</P>
      <P>The annual block grant to the universities is paid to and distributed by the Higher Education Authority.  This grant constitutes the unified teaching and research budget for the universities and, therefore, provides the basic level of research funding.</P>
      <P>A new allocation of £5 million was included in the 1998 Estimates for my Department for recurrent funding of research and development projects. This is the first time, that substantial dedicated funding for research and development, will be available, through my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scientific and technological aspect of the new programme is being administered, by the Higher Education Authority.  The arrangements are as follows: £4 million for proposals which demonstrate a link with the strategic development of the institution from which they come. This is the core of the programme and has involved putting in place a system of competitive biding between third-level institutions for submitted research programmes based on, and consistent with, the stated research policies and strategies of the individual institutions, including direct support for doctoral and post-doctoral students.  These institutional research proposals have been evaluated by an international assessment <Col N="783" /> panel which decided on the allocations; £0.5 million to enable the Higher Education Authority to fund projects approved by the National Research Support Fund Board during 1998.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the programme are: to promote a strategic and planned approach by third-level institutions to the long-term development of their research capabilities in the areas of science and technology, consistent with their existing and developing research strengths and capabilities; to promote the development of high quality research capabilities in third-level institutions, so as to enhance the quality and relevance of graduate output and skills; within the framework of these objectives, to provide support for outstandingly talended individual researchers and teams within the institutions and the encouragement of co-operation between researchers both within the institutions and between institutions, having particular regard to the desirability of encouraging inter-institutional co-operation within the two parts of the binary system and within Ireland, the EU and internationally.</P>
    <P>Further recognition of the importance this Government attaches to the development of the research and development activities undertaken by the third level institutions can be seen in the provision of £30 million from the Scientific and Technological Education Investment Fund to support a comprehensive programme of equipment renewal in the institutions.  In 1998, my Department is providing £10 million to the institutions in this regard.  A further £15 million is being provided in the Scientific and Technological Education Investment Fund for the provision of substantial new research facilities to focus particularly on the transfer of advanced technology into production.</P>
    <P>My Department also operates a scheme of post-doctoral fellowships whereby fellows undertaking scientific research receive an annual grant of £20,000 for two years.  The fellowships are administered by the Higher Education Authority. Nine fellowships were awarded in 1997 and a further seven have been awarded in 1998.</P>
    <P>These wide ranging measures complement the programmes operated by the Office for Science and Technology in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through the National Research Support Fund Board, which provides direct funding for indvidual researchers.</P>

      <P>Educational provision for children in <Col N="784" /> hospital settings is currently provided by my Department to hospitals which cater for children with varying degrees of illness and disability. There are a total of five special schools in hospital settings.  A number of hospitals are also in receipt of part-time teaching hours.  The level of provision depends on the number of children involved, the nature of the illness or disability and the length of time a child has to stay in hospital.</P>
      <P>All applications for support are considered on the basis of assessed level of need and in some instances the provision of part-time teaching hours is considered to be adequate.  The provision of a full-time teacher has also been provided in areas where such a need has been identified.  My Department welcomes applications from hospital authorities for educational provision for children who are patients and is currently considering a number of such applications.</P>
      <P>I intend to keep the educational needs of children in hospitals and the issue of how best to address these needs within available resources under regular review.</P>

      <P>The fee structure already provides for reduced fees in the case of external candidates who wish to take only one subject.  A fee of £23 for one subject rather than the standard fee of £50 applies where the student did not previously sit the examination and a fee of £50 for one subject applies rather than £147 where the student is repeating the examination.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the number of subjects involved, applicants who hold a current medical card or are dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card are no longer liable for examination fees.</P>

      <P>The dates on which the results of the certificate examinations are issued are a function of the timing of the actual examinations and the time required for the marking of scripts and processing of the results.  Schools are notified well in advance of the likely date of issue of the junior certificate results.</P>
      <P>While my Department will continue to make every effort to issue results as early as possible, it must be recognised that there are real constraints on making any significant improvement in respect of the junior certificate if the issue date in the case of the leaving certificate is not to be affected. Given that there is a finite pool of suitably qualified examiners, my Department ensures that the number of examiners engaged in the leaving certificate marking process is adequate to enable the result deadlines to be met.  This is possible because the later issue of junior certificate results provides some latitude in relation to providing additional time where necessary to the pool of examiners available for junior certificate marking. Ultimately, the time required for the proper execution of the marking process is a direct function of the number of available examiners and the number of scripts to be examined.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that priority must be given to the issue of the leaving certificate results so as to ensure that the CAO college entry process executes in a timely manner.</P>

      <P>I am currently considering future policy development in the area of early childhood education.

The question of an expansion of the scheme is being examined in the light of the take-up of places achieved to date and an overall review of the scheme.  In the interim, a number of enhancements have been introduced.  These include an equalisation of allowances with those payable under the back to education allowance scheme, the removal of the 10 per cent quota which limited participation of lone parents, those with disabilities and dependent spouses and the introduction of a new childcare measure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently announced a major initiative in respect of education services for children with special needs.  The measures involved are aimed at ensuring that all children with a special educational need, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures will deliver extra teaching and childcare services to all special needs children, whether in groups or in individual isolated settings. Under the arrangements, there will be a formalised system of special teaching support for all children attending schools on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special <Col N="787" /> educational needs.  A formalised system of childcare support will be introduced for all children with special needs, including those in special schools, special classes and ordinary schools, who have been assessed as requiring such support.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures will provide children with special needs attending mainstream schools with an automatic access to special teaching support and, if necessary, the childcare support that they require to enable them to reach their potential within the educational system.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, my Department allocates resource teacher for traveller posts at primary level on the basis that traveller children are taught in an integrated setting, either within the classroom with the resource teacher working in partnership with the classroom teacher or withdrawn in groups for intensive tuition according to their ages and perceived needs by the resource teacher for travellers.</P>
    <P>My Department has allocated a total of 363 resource teacher for traveller posts to cater for the educational needs of approximately 4,300 traveller children integrated into mainstream education.  In addition, my Department provides grant aid towards tuition and transport costs for a total of 55 pre-schools for traveller children.  There are also a total of 20 visiting teachers working with the families of the traveller community.  One of the primary functions of the visiting teacher service is to identify suitable educational facilities for traveller children and to encourage participation in mainstream education.  My Department has also allocated resources to second-level schools where traveller children are enrolled.</P>
    <P>I intend to keep the needs of all children with disabilities and children of the travelling community under ongoing review as part of my commitment to ensuring that my goal of full participation by the children in question is realised.</P>
