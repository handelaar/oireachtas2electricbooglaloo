      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the recent announcement of the Attorney General, he will state when legislation will be introduced concerning the law of nullity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In August last a discussion paper on the law of nullity, prepared in the office of the Attorney General, was published and the views of interested members of the public were invited on the proposals for reform contained therein.  I am not in a position to give any indication, at this stage, when amending legislation will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that because of the unsatisfactory situation at present there is an urgency with regard to the immediate production of legislation on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is not new, I regret to say.  I am aware that it is a serious situation and it is to meet that situation that the Attorney General prepared the draft paper which was published and the views of the public were invited.  As soon as those views have been received the matter will be dealt with urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister or the Attorney General any time <Col N="1192" /> scale in mind for the limitation on public representation so that the Government will have a fixed programme to introduce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is some time now since the paper was published and I do not want to anticipate what time limit may be placed on receiving submissions, but the Deputy may take it that a terminal date will probably be announced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister let us know whether or not we might expect this legislation before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that the legislation will not be ready before Christmas.  The views of interested members of the public are being sought; when those views come in they will have to be examined and there might have to be further discussions with interested parties on those views. There is certainly no possibility of legislation before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that there is no resident garda in Kilsheelin, Clonmel, County Tipperary; and if he will ensure that this situation is rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 8th August, when the garda then in charge of Kilsheelin station retired, the station has been manned each day by a garda from Clonmel.  Arrangements have now been completed for the formal allocation of a member to the station in a few weeks' time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what he means by saying that the station is manned by a garda from Clonmel?  How many hours a day is the station opened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the extent of the increase in crime in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary; and if, in view of this, he will provide extra gardaí for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1193" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner informs me that, while there has been an increase in the incidence of crime in the Carrick-on-Suir area, he considers that the present strength and patrolling arrangements there are reasonable having regard to other demands on Garda resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Commissioner indicate that this increase in the pattern of crime in that area is repeated on a national basis in other towns of comparable size throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we cannot have an extension of this question.  It would not be in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got information on other comparable towns but the information available to me with regard to Carrick-on-Suir is that there was a large number of disorderly incidents during the St. Patrick's weekend and this led to an increase in the crime statistics for Carrick-on-Suir.  Hopefully that was a single occurrence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice his Department's policy regarding deployment of gardaí on the beat; and the measures being taken to ensure that this policy is implemented in each Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Operational decisions in regard to the deployment of resources are taken by the Garda authorities, the precise arrangements made for policing particular areas being made by or in consultation with the local Garda officers.  As already announced, management consultants are carrying out an examination of systems of review and control of Garda strength with a view to facilitating the most efficient deployment of the available resources.  The consultants are expected to report shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what the comparison is between the number of gardaí on the beat at present <Col N="1194" /> and the number of gardaí on the beat about ten years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible to make a global comparison because the situation could vary from station to station and from district to district, depending on the demands on the Garda for other duties from time to time in different stations.  As a matter of policy it is the Government's belief that the beat system is possibly the most important measure in the prevention of crime and we are anxious to see it restored to as full a degree as possible.  Having regard to the inordinate demands on manpower at the moment it has not been possible to have as heavy a beat deployment as desirable but hopefully extra recruitment which has been announced will improve the position in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that it is the Government's belief that the man on the beat is by far the best method of crime prevention and crime detection, surely the Minister is aware that the man on the beat is a very rare thing now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware, and that is an incorrect statement of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that words to this effect have been repeated more than once by the <i>Garda Review</i> editorial over the last six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Words to that effect have not been repeated.  Words to the effect that a higher incidence of beat patrolling would be desirable have been uttered, but to say that the man on the beat is a rare occurrence does not represent the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting that that is the view of the Garda and in view of what the Minister has said, irrespective of the outcome of this consultancy report would the Minister guarantee to the House that the Government will take steps immediately to ensure that there will be an adequate number of men on the beat in view of the grave concern there is throughout the country about the increase in the pattern of crime?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Government have concern in this regard and as a measure of their concern have announced the recruitment of an extra 500 gardaí.  The overall manpower level of the police is under continuous review and should the number not be adequate I have no doubt the Government will act accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the present Garda strength in Sundrive Road Garda station; how this force is deployed; and the population it serves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the growing vandalism in the Drimnagh area of Dublin; if he is satisfied that the Garda strength in the Sundrive Road Garda station is adequate to cope with it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The present strength of Sundrive Road Garda station is 42 and the population of the Garda sub-district is estimated at 49,000.  Having regard to other demands on Garda resources, the Commissioner does not propose to increase the Garda strength in the sub-district.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to established practice to give details of the arrangements made by the Garda authorities for the deployment of strength in the area.  I might mention, however, that special patrols are being introduced to deal with the problem of vandalism in the Drimnagh area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate if any examination of the serious situation in the Drimnagh <Col N="1196" /> area has been undertaken by the Garda on the question of vandalism and crime in that area and in Dublin as a whole?  I am alarmed to hear that no attempt has been made to increase the Garda force in the area.  Is the Minister aware that in Dublin alone, 10,000 street lamps were broken last year at a cost of £20,000, and 3,000 telephone kiosks, 100 lifebuoys and over 25,000 trees were broken in the past couple of years?  Surely this is a very serious situation in Dublin city. We demand an increase in the Garda force in this area where there is a high rate of vandalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a long question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that vandalism is a problem in parts of Dublin and I have answered questions on this subject before.  I have indicated that essentially vandalism is a social problem and the Garda by themselves cannot cure vandalism.  With regard to the problem of Drimnagh, which is the subject matter of the question, as I indicated in my reply, special patrols are being introduced to deal with the problem of vandalism in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the strength of the Garda station in this area is 42 officers and men and that the population is 49,000.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the Garda normally work three eight-hour shifts.  That would mean there are 13 people, including officers and men, available for police work for 49,000 people.  Since there is a complete cutback in overtime for Garda on duty such as this, is the Minister aware that the number of people available for beat work, where we would all like to see them, is practically negligible?  The whole thing is a bit farcical if we expect proper police patrolling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having new matter injected into the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked the number of Garda and the population and I gave the figures.  It is not a relativity which, of itself, means anything. <Col N="1197" /> What is important is the level of policing in the area, having regard to the needs of the area.  I should like to see many more Garda in parts of the city, and so would the Government. We are conscious that there is a need to increase the numbers and it is for that reason that the overall strength of the force is being increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are only 13 people per week available to look after an area in which 49,000 people live? That would mean about eight or nine people on duty per day.  At least one or two are required for station work and the number of Garda actually out communicating with the people is practically nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not follow that the breakdown of the deployment of the force in this station is as the Deputy says.  The force will be deploying according to the needs of the station by the officer in charge from time to time.  You cannot divide it and get an answer and say this is the way the men are deployed.  The men will be deployed in accordance with the needs of the station, subject to the overall limitations of manpower.  I concede there are limitations there and it is to end those limitations that we are increasing the strength of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any indication of what would be regarded as a desirable ratio of Garda to population?  Has any such figure been recommended by his Department or by the Commissioner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any objective ratio because the ratio would depend on the needs of the area and on the level of crime, vandalism, and so on.  It would not be possible to say there should be an overall average ratio of Garda to population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area in question, I have noticed similar characteristics.  Could the Minister indicate whether he or the Commissioner has any views on what a desirable ratio there would be, or what <Col N="1198" /> Garda strength is needed to police this area effectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give a figure which would be a constant figure because the ratio we might decide was adequate for this day in 1976 might be found to be too high or too low in three months' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned only with the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get on to another question.  We have dwelt a long time on this question.  A final and brief supplementary from Deputy Dowling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate the number of Garda on administrative duty who are not on the beat?  Has he taken into consideration the question of sick leave and the amount of time spent in court by the Garda?  Are any of the Garda in this station on call for duty outside the area on the Border or in Portlaoise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The number on administrative duty could vary from time to time.  Administrative duty might also involve outdoor duty.  For example, there are two inspectors with supervisory duties and their duties would be outside.  There are sergeants on office duty but, from time to time, they may also go on outside duty.  It is impossible to say that in any station so many men are on this job and so many men on that.  The superintendent in charge will deploy his men to meet the exigencies of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>What about men called outside the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The present authorised strength of the Garda force is 8,502 and the present actual strength is 8,475&mdash;the difference of 27 being due to retirements and other casual vacancies.  The Government have decided to increase the strength of the force by 500 but recruitment of the extra members cannot take place until an entrance competition has been held.  The necessary preliminary consultations in relation to the holding of the competition are nearing completion and I expect that details of the competition will be announced shortly.</P>
      <P>No decision has been taken in regard to the allocation of the extra gardaí but it can be taken that a proportion of them will be allocated to Dublin.</P>

If that is what he feels, I share his anxiety about this because I have been urging that this recruitment should take place as quickly as possible.  There was a very large number of applications and the terms of recruitment have to be settled to ensure that the method of recruitment is as fair as possible.  The matter is complicated to some extent, by the question of what are to be the educational requirements for entry.  In the past, leaving certificate holders were exempt from the preliminary examination.  The question had to be decided whether such exemption was to be continued or not.  I decided it is not to be continued and that all entrants will have to do an entrance examination.  It will be for the Civil Service Commissioners to arrange for the holding of the competition.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, while we are now living in a supposed emergency situation, this might not be the time to change the terms for recruitment for admission as trainee garda?  Would he further agree that he has had something in the region of 2,500 to 3,000 applications from young people who are unemployed throughout the country, the majority of whom are leaving certificate holders?  They believed that the terms of recruitment to the Garda would be no different this time from last time.  Surely the Minister and the Government are open to a grave charge of dragging their feet in not doing something about the recruitment of the extra 500 gardaí in the present situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain for the information of the House that, in the past, recruitment to the Garda was by way of entrance examination only.  Some time ago, a number of competitions ago, it was decided in order to increase the numbers and to encourage more applicants that exemptions would be given from the preliminary examination to leaving certificate holders.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the pending competition is that there are very large numbers inquiring, many of whom have the leaving certificate but a substantial number of whom have not the leaving certificate.  They would be entitled to assume that the conditions for this examination would more or less be the same as the last one and that those without leaving certificate would not find themselves excluded.  I think it would be unfair to exclude them.</P>

He is now changing the rules midstream&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not changing the rules.  The position is that the traditional method of recruitment was by way of entrance examination.  A change in that was made some years ago to exempt the leaving certificate holders from the entrance examination.  I want to restore the original situation for this forthcoming competition to make an entrance examination obligatory for all applicants.</P>

      <P>If, as the Minister says, the terms of recruitment as they have been up to the present, that is, acceptance of the leaving certificate as a standard for entrance, are to be changed, what will the new standard be?  Would the Minister agree that a change of such magnitude at this particular time will throw the recruitment of badly needed young gardaí back months?  Are the Minister and the Government serious that they want 500 gardaí, and, if they do, can they pay for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need have no worry about the Government's desire to recruit the 500 gardaí and about the ability to pay for them; the Deputy himself has said he would welcome extra taxation in the security area.  I am anxious, as are the Garda authorities, to ensure that recruitment is as fair as possible and that the best possible applicants will come through the recruitment process. It is with those aims in mind that the competition is being devised, and slight changes have had to be made to go back to the original method of recruitment to ensure this. There is nothing more in it than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the urgent need to provide comprehensive surgical facilities in County Cavan; and when such services will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the need to provide improved surgical facilities in Cavan Hospital.</P>
      <P>The general hospital development plan provides for the development of a general hospital at Cavan and agreement has been reached with the North-Eastern Health Board that this should be the priority project for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A project team has been established and is at present engaged in the preparation of a planning brief.  This means that the planning of the hospital, <Col N="1209" /> including the surgical department, is proceeding as quickly as possible, and this accords fully with my wishes.</P>
    <P>The date of building the new hospital will be determined when planning is completed but the date will, of course, be dependent on economic circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the terms of his answer are the same as those he gave to me six months ago?  Would he now state when he thinks building will start on the new general hospital in Cavan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not deceived the Deputy in any way in relation to his previous question.  It is necessary to go through certain processes before one can have a plan.  A project team has been established and it held its first meeting on 28th July, 1976.  The project team consists of representatives from the health board, including consultants, nurses and administrative staff, and is under the chairmanship of the chief executive officer.  It is expected that the planning brief will be completed in March or April next year.  I am informed that the project team meets every fortnight as distinct from other hospitals engaged in a similar process.  The health board and I are pleased that such progress has been made.  The planning brief will not be ready until March or April of next year when it will be handed over to consultants, who will take some time to finalise the matter.  Agreement has been reached in regard to the number of beds and so on.  Reasonably good progress has been made.  The Deputy will understand that it takes quite an amount of work before the final stage is reached.  The process in regard to a large hospital in Cork took three-and-a-half years.  Perhaps that was unusual and there may be quicker ways of completing the planning, but the health board and my officials are satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board regard it as their priority.  Since it has been accepted by the Minister for Health, and the objectives of the committee are known, does he not think that the <Col N="1210" /> whole process could be expedited and that the report could be sent to the consultants before the end of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be able to dictate the speed at which the project team work.  They meet more often than other health boards who have been given permission to plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Cavan is a priority within the health board concerned.  I do not think the Deputy would envisage that we would engage in building all the hospitals at the same time because such capital money would not be available.  As far as Cavan is concerned, I visited the hospital twice and the surgical unit is in a pretty bad way.  The previous administration will have to take some responsibility for this problem.  There was a delay in providing proper surgical facilities in Cavan Hospital when one remembers that it was condemned in 1934.  That is a reflection on all of us.  Only in 1954 was money spent on Cavan and I think the amount spent was £1,100.  When I came into this Department we had the Fitzgerald Plan which apparently did not satisfy anyone.  After consultation with the health boards and agencies, I introduced a plan which does not satisfy anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be provision in the 1977 budget for the building of the hospital?  Could I have an assurance on that because people are very worried about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the Deputy an assurance because the consultants' work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point in providing moneys for a project which everybody knows involves lay and <Col N="1211" /> technical people and which could not be commenced in 1977?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was mentioned while I was unavoidably out of the House for a moment. Could the Minister give us an assurance in regard to the planning of this hospital and its ultimate construction that only Irish professional people will be employed?  The Minister knows that I raised the same point with him in regard to St. James's Hospital.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Healy</b>asked the Minister for Health the reason for the very large increase, amounting to 25 per cent, in the number of experiments performed during 1975 under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the number of experiments performed during 1975 under licences granted in accordance with the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 over the number carried out during 1974 was mainly due to&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  increased work on cancer research performed by the Medical Research Council, which involved an additional 7,193 inoculations of mice, <Col N="1213" /> (2)  increased research carried out by the Agricultural Institute for the purpose of control and eradication of brucellosis in cattle, which involved an additional 3,346 inoculations of cattle, and</P>
    <P>(3)  increased work in connection with pyrogen testing and toxicity testing of drugs which was carried out by the Wellcome Research Laboratories at Trinity College, Dublin and which involved an additional 5,563 inoculations of rodents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government are giving money for medical research involving live animals, do they write in the condition that such animals must be given an anaesthetic before they are actually experimented on, particularly small animals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of most of the operations the Deputy will appreciate and agree that very little pain is caused anyway in the inoculation of mice and cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean cattle so much.  I mean smaller animals and experiments carried out on them.  In the experimentation on small animals could they not be given an anaesthetic so that they might be saved any pain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any alternative source to the experimentation on mice, cattle and rodents?  For instance, what is the end result in the case of mice?  Do they die as a result of the inoculation?  Is there any alternative to the use of mice in experiments for cancer research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no alternative to the work being done and the usage of living animals at present. One must bear in mind the invaluable results of this research for both humans and animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am not getting away from the point that I am totally opposed to the idea of using animals in this form of research. What I am asking is if, in the <Col N="1214" /> meantime, there are any alternatives to the experimentation on animals? For instance, are dogs used in this form of experimentation?  What other types of animals are used in addition to the three categories mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is growing public disquiet over the number of experiments on living animals in this country.  The fact is that the vast bulk of the experiments consist of simple injections in rodents which do not cause significant pain. They do not involve surgical operations. There is no practicable alternative way of doing this work which is of vital significance in the prevention and treatment of disease in humans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My medical advisers keep themselves <Col N="1215" /> fully informed on developments elsewhere in this field.</P>
    <P>I do not, therefore, consider it necessary or desirable to devote any of the available funds to research designed to seek alternative methods and techniques.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that he does not intend making money available to seek alternative techniques?  As a matter of information&mdash;and without being contentious about the matter&mdash;is it really true that these experiments are confined to mice, rodents and cattle only?  Do dogs or other animals come into these experiments or are they confined to the three categories already mentioned?</P>

He is not, therefore, entitled to any unemployment assistance.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the measure is to modernise and consolidate the law relating to building societies.  It has been examined in a critical but constructive manner by Seanad Éireann.  In the course of the discussions in that House, a number of amendments of the text of the Bill as introduced were considered and the great majority were accepted.  In consequence, the <Col N="1234" /> document which has been circulated to Deputies should, I hope, prove to be a generally acceptable set of legislative proposals, designed to govern the operations of one of the principal investment repositories and the most important source of mortgage finance for the private housing sector.</P>
    <P>The existing statute law controlling the operations of building societies in this country dates back just over a century.  The principal Acts were enacted in 1874 and 1894.  It will be obvious, therefore, that there must be scope for a radical updating and reconsideration of the law.  This is the purpose of the Bill which I am glad to present to the Dáil.  I hope that the House will give it an objective and positive examination, such as it received in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The operations of building societies have expanded enormously since the State was founded, but particularly in recent years.  In 1922 we had 23 societies with total assets of little more than £500,000.  By 1941 these assets had trebled and amounted to £1.5 million.  Since then there has been a constant acceleration in growth.  By 1961 the assets of building societies had increased to £18.7 million.  In the short space of the four following years, their assets doubled to £36 million in 1965; by the end of June last they were over £350 million&mdash;a phenomenal rate of growth.</P>
    <P>This scale of operations is a measure of the confidence which the investing public and house purchasers alike have in the building society movement.  In the five years ended 31st December, 1975 the societies advanced £215 million in loans for house purchase, which gives a clear indication of their importance in connection with the financing of private housing.  The societies have made an invaluable contribution towards improving housing conditions generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The inflow of funds to the societies and their rate of loan approvals have been at record levels during the past year.  The value of loans approved in 1975 was the highest in any year ever.</P>
    <P>This expansion of activities and the importance of the position which the <Col N="1235" /> societies now hold as custodians of the savings of so many people make it essential that the legislation under which they operate, and which was designed so long ago to suit much smaller institutions, be reviewed and reconsidered.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the outcome of such a review and one of its primary objectives is to reinforce the confidence of the investing public in building societies with the backing of suitable statutory provisions.  A person investing with a building society should know that his money is no less secure than if it were placed with a licensed bank.</P>
    <P>This Bill, while re-enacting and updating all the relevant provisions of the existing building society legislation, contains a number of new provisions. Some of these are similar to provisions in the Companies Act, 1963, the Central Bank Act, 1971, and the Credit Union Act, 1966, adapted, as appropriate, to deal with the conditions peculiar to building societies.  In scope, the Bill is intended to deal comprehensively with all the operations of building societies from their initial establishment to their eventual winding up.  Special care has been taken to protect the rights of the members, depositors and mortgagors, and the security of investments, through controls and supervision considered appropriate to one of the most important forms of financial institution in the State.  In preparing the Bill I have had regard to the dual function of the societies, first as the repository of an appreciable proportion of national savings and, secondly, as the largest single source of mortgage finance for private housing.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Bill will help to increase public confidence in the societies. In this context I want to emphasise that none of its provisions will, in any way, disturb the present confidentiality regarding the business dealings of the societies and their members, and which is so important in attracting investment funds to the societies.  I want to give a similar assurance in relation to the orders and regulations to be made in due course, and the directions to be given, under the Bill.  Indeed, some of the amendments which I moved during <Col N="1236" /> the Committee Stage debate on the Bill in the Seanad were designed to reinforce this element of confidentiality and were accepted in this spirit by Senators.</P>
    <P>A basic feature of building society finance is that the societies must borrow short and lend long.  Money vested with them is generally on call at three to six months' notice while the money which they lend is usually repayable over 15 to 25 years.  This is a problem for which the present Bill&mdash;or, indeed, any conceivable legislation&mdash; could hardly produce a solution. Another area of difficulty with which it cannot concern itself is the fluctuating mortgage interest rate which borrowers have to pay on their loans.  It does not contain provisions relating to trustee status.  However, the provisions in the Bill ease the way for the Minister for Finance in conferring trustee status on approved societies.</P>
    <P>This is a long and rather complex Bill.  It is based, I might say, on a century's experience of previous building society legislation.  Because of its importance and complexity I had a particularly detailed explanatory memorandum prepared which sets out the background to the measure, states its objectives and explains its provisions in considerable detail.  As Deputies have had an opportunity to study both the Bill and the explanatory memorandum, I do not propose, at this juncture, to go at length into the provisions of the Bill. The measure is essentially a Committee Stage one and when the House moves on to that Stage we can consider each section which Deputies may wish to discuss.  However, there are some provisions which call for special comment and I ask the Dáil to bear with me while I refer briefly to these aspects.</P>
    <P>Under section 8, ten or more persons may establish a society by agreeing on rules and submitting copies to the Registrar of Building Societies. Heretofore a society could be established by any number of persons, provided the draft rules were signed by three persons and the intended secretary. A further provision in section <Col N="1237" /> 18 will require each founder member to invest a specified minimum amount in cash in the society and to retain the investment with the society for at least five years.  At no time during that period can the interest rate on his investment be more favourable than that paid by the society to any other shareholder of a similar class. The amount of the investment will be prescribed by regulations.  The purpose of these provisions will be readily appreciated.  Where funds are solicited from the public it is right that investors should have security. One way to achieve this is to require the founders of a society to have a substantial and continuing personal stake in its funds.</P>
    <P>In the case of a society incorporated after 5th December, 1975, which was the date of publication of the Bill, or a society incorporated before that date but which had not then commenced business, section 18 stipulates that it may not raise funds unless the requirements relating to the founders' shares, to which I have just referred, have been complied with.  In addition there is a further requirement, under section 20, that such a society must have lodged a deposit with the Central Bank.  If a society fails to comply with these requirements within specified periods, the registrar can have its registration cancelled or have the society wound up.  Quite a number of societies have been formed and registered but have then been allowed to lie dormant, sometimes for years. There is no purpose in having inactive societies on the records and for this reason the registrar will be empowered to have them struck off.</P>
    <P>Section 19 will apply to a society incorporated after the date of publication of the Bill, or a society incorporated before that date but which had not then assets of at least £1 million. Any such society must obtain the written permission of the registrar before soliciting deposits or subscriptions for shares&mdash;an expression that is defined in section 2 of the Bill on the lines of a similar provision in section 27 of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  The intention is that the registrar will not allow a society to advertise for funds <Col N="1238" /> unless he is satisfied on a number of matters relating to the society, including the manner in which it has conducted its business, its liquidity, its ability to meet its obligations to creditors and its compliance with the requirements regarding founders' shares and the deposit at the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Some small societies will be affected by this section, but I do not envisage that the provisions will prevent them from continuing.  On the other hand, societies whose activities appear more appropriate to commercial lending companies will have to satisfy the registrar that they are <i>bona fide</i> building societies, as defined in the Bill, and that they carry on their business in accordance with its requirements.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the requirement in section 20 to make a deposit with the Central Bank.  All societies will have to lodge an amount varying, according to the size of the society, from a minimum of £20,000 to a maximum of £500,000.  Existing societies will be given time in which to comply with the requirement.  A similar requirement applies to licensed banks under the Central Bank Act, 1971.  It is appropriate that the statutory provision governing financial institutions of the size and importance of building societies should be similar in such regard to those for banks.  The deposit will earn interest; it will rank in assessing a society's liquidity, and will provide security for investors.</P>
    <P>Section 37 will enable the Minister for Finance to require a society to maintain a ratio between its assets and its liabilities.  At present, apart from the limitation on the amount which a society may accept on deposit, there is no statutory requirement in regard to the relationship between the assets and liabilities of a society.  It is considered appropriate that that type of control in this vital area which applies to the banks should apply also to the societies.  The powers in the section will not be used as a method of monetary control&mdash;the ratio will be merely a basic requirement to ensure the stability of the society and the security of the investor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> Different ratios may be prescribed for different classes of societies.  Reference is made throughout the Bill to different classes of societies.  The intention is to enable requirements to be tailored to fit the specific needs or circumstances of the different types of societies.  What may be appropriate for a society with assets of £50 million may not be relevant at all to a society with assets of £100,000.</P>
    <P>There are two other areas in which direct control is proposed over certain aspects of the societies' operations. Section 76 will enable regulations to be made, on the recommendation of the registrar, to secure the proper and efficient management of societies and to promote the orderly and proper regulation of their business.  These regulations may lay down limits on the management expenses of a society and may also provide for a code of practice. We have all been aware, from time to time, of the criticism of societies on the grounds that their management and advertising expenses have been unduly high, especially with regard to the expenses of comparable societies in Britain.  I want to put on record that my own experience has satisfied me that such criticisms cannot reasonably be sustained against the five societies represented on the Irish Building Societies' Association.  These member societies control about 98 per cent of the assets of all societies.  The past few years have seen an enormous expansion in the activities of the societies&mdash;circumstances in which, combined with the effects of inflation, a substantial rise in management expenses might well have been expected. In fact, the accounts of the largest societies show that management expenses were maintained at very reasonable levels.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been directed also at the extent of the competitive advertising by the societies.  It is only right to remember, however, that advertising is essential to secure a continued inflow of funds in a very competitive market. Indeed, the level of expenditure in 1974 and 1975 of the five principal societies on advertising had fallen when compared with the figure for <Col N="1240" /> 1973, a situation which would not indicate extravagance.  While I am satisfied that the major societies keep a reasonable balance in these matters, I still feel that there is need to have the reserve power which this section provides.</P>
    <P>In due course I would envisage the drawing up, with the advisory committee proposed by the Bill, of a code of practice which would contain provisions relating to matters such as the standards for incidental fees, charges for the redemption of loans, payments to accredited agents of societies and so on.</P>
    <P>Direct control is also proposed in section 77 which empowers the Minister for Local Government, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the registrar, to make regulations prescribing the maximum amount of a loan that a society may make and the purpose for which a loan may be made.  The regulations may also control the amount that a society may lend to a corporate body.</P>
    <P>Sections 41 and 42 incorporate two important provisions, adapted from the Companies Act, 1963.  These relate to the disclosure of interest by a director of a society in any contract with the society and the disclosure in the annual returns and the annual accounts of the society of loans made to directors, certain members of their families and some corporate bodies with which officers of a society may be directly associated.  These are new requirements in the building society code.  They are not as restrictive as the provisions in the Companies Act relating to loans to company directors because the making of loans is the ordinary business of a building society and the rules adequately govern them. However, I suggest to the Dáil that the provisions of these sections strike the right kind of balance.</P>
    <P>Another point of criticism of the societies has been the giving and receiving of commission in connection with loans.  This arose, for instance, in cases in which some societies were paid commission by builders in consideration of an undertaking that loans would be available from the <Col N="1241" /> society for the purchase of houses from the builder; this was known as commission for a block loan arrangement. It was an undesirable development in many ways, although I can see that it had legitimate attractions for both the building societies and builders.  The system however, favoured the big builder and tended to leave the small builder or the individual seeking a loan at a disadvantage. It goes without saying that the cost of the commission was passed on to the purchaser, thus increasing the cost of the house.  The societies agreed in 1973 to end any such arrangement by which commission was paid.  This form of commission will be prohibited under section 75 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been disquieted by complaints which I have received from persons who claimed that they have been offered loans on payment of quite a substantial fee.  I have looked into these complaints but have found no evidence that societies are involved in these offers.  I feel strongly that the public should be protected from the activities of persons obtaining easy money by the offer of a service which a house purchaser could get directly by himself without extra cost.</P>
    <P>Section 75 also prohibits a director of a society from receiving any commission, other than that authorised by the rules, for introducing mortgage business, or undertaking to introduce such business.  There is also a prohibition on the acceptance of commission on the effecting of certain types of insurance.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a long and rather involved Bill, but one which, I hope, will provide an adequate, modern, legal framework for building societies.  On the general subject of controls contained in the Bill, may I say that any Bill of this kind must seem to contain wide powers of control by the central authority.  If only the existing body of building societies legislation were to be simply restated in the Bill, this would still seem to comprise a formidable array of controls. The proposals that have been added to the existing provisions have, in the main, been adopted from controls <Col N="1242" /> already exercised over banks, credit unions and public companies.  I can appreciate that, reading the Bill in isolation, it could strike Deputies as being unduly restrictive and possibly conveying an impression of distrust of the societies.  However, the Bill contains few, if any, more restrictive provisions than those seen by the Oireachtas in recent years to be necessary for the control of banks, credit unions and companies.  The building societies are major financial institutions with assets in excess of £350 million and the State would be failing in its duty to its citizens who invest with and borrow from the societies if it did not provide an adequate legislative framework for controlling institutions of this magnitude.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that the Bill proposes to give four different authorities specific areas of control over activities of the societies&mdash;the Ministers for Finance and Local Government, the Central Bank and the Registrar of Building Societies.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being discussed in the Seanad, considerable pressure was brought to bear on me to delete all forms of ministerial controls and to place the responsibility of overseeing the societies on the Central Bank and on the registrar, who would then be an independent, almost judicial functionary. This proposition could not be accepted in the Seanad and it cannot be accepted in Dáil Éireann.  Responsibility for questions of policy and for subordinate legislation, in the form of statutory rules and regulations, must be vested in a Minister responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas and able to explain&mdash;and defend, if necessary&mdash; his policies and regulations in the Dáil and Seanad.  The executive functions of day-to-day supervision of societies properly rests with the registrar who, I may say, will be given no less independence in the discharge of these functions than his counterpart in the United Kingdom&mdash;who was held up in the Seanad as an example to be copied here.  To the limited extent that the societies are part of the second level banking system and custodians of more than £350 million of our people's savings, it is proper that the Central Bank should have directive and sanctioning <Col N="1243" /> powers over certain of their financial arrangements.</P>
    <P>My attitude in the matter is supported by the report, &ldquo;Building Societies in Ireland&rdquo;, prepared in February, 1974, for the National Prices Commission by Mr. E.J. Cleary of Swanson University, an acknowledged expert in the history, development and constitution of building societies.  At paragraphs 123 and 124 of his report Mr. Cleary makes the point that, while it is necessary to give the registrar power to regulate societies, it is important that there should be safeguards for societies.  He says, and I quote:</P>
    <P>This can be done by making the Registrar's powers in these matters subject to the consent of an appropriate Minister.  The resulting regulations would appear as Ministerial orders made under the Building Societies Act.  This could be drawn so that they were subject to annulment by resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Such an approach would enable building societies and others to challenge the regulations through the political process. Societies would, of course, look for legal redress through the Courts if the regulations made were not in their view in conformity with the Act.</P>
    <P>124.  Apart from the public interest in the good and legal conduct of building society activities there is also a public interest in the manner in which societies adapt themselves to the overall housing programme. This interest is currently overseen by the Department of Local Government.  While it has a certain logic to combine these two functions in a single Ministry, it is better practice to separate them.  The Ministry's strong interest in the achievement of its own programme can conflict with the proper supervision of the interest of investors and borrowers in building societies. It could be tempting to reward a society compliant in responding to the needs of the Ministry's programme, by not exercising regulatory supervision with the keenness <Col N="1244" /> that the interest of members demands.</P>
    <P>There we have a succinct and objective explanation of the reasons why the exercise of various functions under the Bill is divided between different appropriate authorities and, in particular, why certain powers in connection with the societies are being given to the Ministers for Finance and Local Government.  I would like to make it clear that I am not prepared to agree to any departure from the general framework of the Bill in so far as the distribution of these functions is concerned.</P>
    <P>While I must stand firm on these basic principles, I would like to assure Deputies that in any other respects I will be glad to consider carefully any suggestions which they may put forward with the aim of improving the measure.  Over a century has elapsed since the present basic statutory structure governing building societies was enacted.  I would like to think that the present Bill will stand the test of time as well as did the Acts of 1874 and 1894.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Dáil and I look forward to a constructive debate on its contents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Reading of the Building Societies Bill has come at an opportune time, when the building societies are very much in the public mind because of the recent high increase of over 2 per cent in their mortgage interest rates.  The new level of mortgage interest rates stands at 13.95 per cent and this interest rate to those holding mortgages from the societies is extremely heavy and beyond the capacity of many to bear.  I appeal to the Minister to make a subsidy available to the societies to ease the burden.</P>
      <P>I would also suggest to the building societies that they look again at the new rates to see if it was necessary to increase them to their present level. I fully appreciate the problem of the societies in view of the increased bank charges but, nevertheless.  I should like to be certain that the level of increase decided on by the societies was absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> Mortgage holders who are presently out of work, or who have not received any increase in their incomes over the past year because of the circumstances of their employment, will find it virtually impossible to meet the monthly repayments. Many of those also who are contemplating taking out loans will be inhibited from doing so because of the increase, and this will have an effect on the building industry itself.  Now that the Minister has stated there will be fewer local authority houses built in this year, and that he is relying on the private sector of the building industry to make up the shortfall, the importance of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on any aspect of the building societies.  The building societies now assume a role which is even more important in the social field than it ever was before.</P>
      <P>On the Bill, the Fianna Fáil Party welcome in principle what might be termed this modernising legislation. Building societies, as they are now are entirely different institutions from those envisaged when the original legislation was passed.  Some abuses have also been apparent and reform of the law is therefore necessary, and this Bill proposes many of the right measures to regulate the building society movement.  However, we on this side of the House have some serious reservations on some of the controls proposed in this Bill.  I will go into detail later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also feel that the approach to the Bill is rather confined.  Building societies have changed very rapidly in the past decade.  The Bill seems to confine the movement within its present role and it restricts, to a very considerable extent, any further <Col N="1246" /> radical changes.  I had hoped the Minister would have produced in his Bill some proposals to ensure a greater and more regular flow of funds to the societies, so that we should not have to continue with the stop-go situation to which we have been only too accustomed.  The fact that societies were relatively well-off in cash terms in recent times is no assurance as to what the future may bring.  We all recall vividly that only a relatively short time ago the inflow of money to the societies was so poor that it was a cause of very considerable concern and, indeed, the cause of cutbacks in the building industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill also lacks, in my view, any proposals which would encourage the societies to vary the types of mortgages they offer, or to cater for a wider clientele.  My primary concern with this Bill is that it confers too much power on Ministers, which could result in their interference with the day-to-day running of the societies.  I fully accept that a considerable degree of control must be exercised in the national interest, and in the interests of borrowers and investors.  I am not happy with the involvement by the State in commercial transactions for which it has not got the expertise. It is vital for the future of the whole house building industry that the commercial management of the building societies is sound.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is possible for two of the Ministers named in the Bill to have objectives opposed to one another, or to the interests of the societies themselves.  The sole interest of the Minister for Local Government might be in the building of X,000 houses per annum.  The Minister for Finance might be concerned about the success of a national loan.  Either could be tempted, for immediate short-term interests, to regulate the societies with powers conferred in this Bill in a manner which would not be in the interests of the societies or in the interests of their members&mdash;in which I include borrowers&mdash;or in the interests of the construction industry. I fear that the Ministers could bind the societies too tightly with rules and regulations.  As a result, the societies could cease to grow, and fail to make <Col N="1247" /> the contribution we expect from them in helping to house our people.</P>
    <P>A bureaucratic approach to the Bill is a worrying feature.  The controls proposed are so great as to put the societies into a strait jacket.  Under this Bill the societies will have four masters: the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in so far as an official of his Department will be the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and the Central Bank.  Each of these masters will have his own objectives. However well they may consult with each other, an atmosphere of uncertainty cannot but prevail.  This uncertainty and the possibility of political control, and control by those who have not got commercial experience, could hinder the growth of the societies, and could result in many people failing to get loans to purchase their houses.</P>
    <P>Our general approach in Fianna Fáil to this problem of control is to give wide powers to the Registrar of Building Societies who will become an expert in the affairs of building societies. All controls will be exercised by him.  Where statutory controls were required, that is regulations and so on, the Minister concerned would make regulations on the initiative of the registrar.  In this way, we could eliminate the unnecessary and bureaucratic consultations envisaged in this Bill for which, in my view, there is no necessity.  We propose to put forward amendments which we believe will strengthen the powers of the registrar and reduce those of the Ministers while, at the same time, preserving the right of Deputies or Senators to question the regulations.</P>
    <P>If I might digress slightly at this point, I should like to repeat that we are anxious to have a registrar who will play an active and positive role. We would wish him to play a much more important role than is envisaged for him in the Bill.  We should like to see him with a professional staff and in a position to have the best advice available before he makes decisions. It would appear to me that the section in the Friendly Societies Bill <Col N="1248" /> which permits the Minister for Industry and Commerce to remove the registrar from office, if passed in its present form, would be a retrograde step and would do nothing to enhance the position of the registrar.  This is the same registrar who will operate in the context of the Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has the sole right to remove the registrar from office without reference to the Oireachtas, the registrar's independence of action will be severely curtailed.  We proposed in the Seanad that the registrar should be removed only on foot of a motion passed by a two-third majority of each House of the Oireachtas. and our aim in putting forward that proposal again was to maintain the independence of the registrar in what could be regarded as a politically sensitive area. I would hope the Minister would reconsider some of the points he has made in the final paragraphs of the speech which he has now made and that he would also prevail on his colleague to make the necessary changes in the Friendly Societies Bill in order to ensure that the registrar will be independent.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, building societies are governed primarily by two Acts passed in 1874 and 1894 and, therefore, there was an obvious need to consolidate, amend and extend the laws governing them. As I said earlier, this Bill has many good features.  It tackles some of the problems thrown up such as societies which are not genuine building societies but what might be described as crypto-commercial banks or investment groups hoping to avoid taxation.  Societies could be formed too easily and some societies failed.  This caused considerable worry and concern to borrowers and depositors, even though it is true that no depositor actually lost money. These problem societies lowered the general respect in which building societies are held, and I feel that the policing measures in this Bill will deal with these cases, and therefore I welcome them.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is a mixture of three Irish Acts and of the British Building Society Act of 1962.  It does not incorporate <Col N="1249" /> any new thinking and does not reflect enough of the developments which have taken place in recent years. There is no reference to the EEC in the Bill, and I am anxious to know if building society operations will in any way be affected by EEC directives.  We are told nothing about this in the Bill nor in the Minister's speech and perhaps he might refer to it in his reply. There is no encouragement to Irish societies to operate in other parts of the Community or no indication whether societies incorporated in other member states are subject to the provisions of the Bill.  Could, for example, a large British building society open up here and what controls would be exercised on it?</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that there is no section in the Bill which deals with trustee status.  Nor is there any mention in the Bill of any method which will help the societies to attract funds in a regular and systematic way. No power is given to societies to carry out their own building developments so as to provide cheaper housing.</P>
    <P>As I see it in this Bill, the building societies are viewed essentially by the Minister as carrying out their present middleman role in the money market, a rather staid existence within the present narrow framework, and the Bill is purely regulatory in that context.  The development possibilities are ignored.</P>
    <P>I do not wish by any means to disparage the present role of the building societies.  There have been enormous developments in the past ten years.  The growth of the societies has been phenomenal, their contribution to the economy equally so.  The expertise and enterprise which generated this growth might wish to develop in other directions.  The building societies are now very largely bankers.  Originally they were thought of as housing co-operatives are thought of nowadays.  They could fulfil other roles in housing than that of borrower and lender, but again the Bill does not envisage this.  I am concerned, of course, that the funds of the building societies should be utilised for housing.  Building societies have fulfilled a very valuable role over many years in providing money for those who wished to build and to <Col N="1250" /> own their own houses.  When one remembers that the majority of the houses built over the years were privately built and that a considerable proportion of these houses were financed by building societies, one gets a clearer picture of the contribution the building societies have made.</P>
    <P>As the level of wages and salaries rose rapidly with high inflation and the qualifying income limits for SDA loans remained static, more and more people were forced to turn to the societies if they wished to buy or to build their own houses.  Therefore in this way the societies have to a considerable extent in recent years taken over a large part of the function which had been carried out by public authorities.  Any change which will help to modernise the administration and policies of societies and enable them to do their job better will contribute to economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Where problems and dissatisfaction do arise with building societies it is primarily in the matter of interest rates.  To attract deposits a building society must pay competitive rates of interest.  If the rate of interest is too low income drops and the society is unable to fulfil its function.  If interest rates are increased to attract more deposits, a higher rate must be charged to borrowers, creating in many cases serious financial problems. Few borrowers, when taking out a mortgage, understand the vagaries of the financial system.  They are concerned only with their ability to repay the loan and the rate of interest in force at the time.  If rates rise later on and their outgoings on housing increase there is a feeling of frustration and injustice created which does not help the development of building societies.  These rate increases often coincide with increases in other outgoings and the strain and tension created disturb the harmony of family life.</P>
    <P>The societies, therefore, might, in their own interests, provide a greater variety of loan options to the public so that the borrower can choose the mortgage that suits his family and financial circumstances.  I have in <Col N="1251" /> mind index-linked loans which would have a low basic interest rate but whose repayment would vary directly with inflation.  Alternatively, societies could offer fixed repayment loans or loans at low rates of interest which would facilitate particularly lower income families while perhaps retaining part of the equity of the property. These are some general suggestions for consideration.  Any new schemes would undoubtedly create problems, perhaps increase administrative costs in these societies.</P>
    <P>Because of the advantage building societies have in interest rates arising partly from tax concessions, building societies have in recent years attracted an increasing flow of funds which are therefore available for house purchase. This is particularly so in periods of stable interest rates.  However, they are at some disadvantage in periods of stability.  It is a major administrative task for a society to work out the new repayments to be made by borrowers. Because of the understandable resistance of borrowers to any increase in rates there is a natural reluctance to adjust rates.  In these circumstances societies could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, with a considerably reduced inflow of cash and with a consequent lack of finance for housing.</P>
    <P>An unstable cash flow can be a major problem.  I noted in a report that was issued some time ago in respect of British building societies that, when deposits slowed down, activity in the building industry also slowed down. When money began to flow again there were not sufficient houses available.  At that time the extra inflow of cash simply increased the price of houses.  In due course the new price level became attractive for developers, but by the time new houses were completed deposits had slowed down and a building slump developed.  Confidence cannot be maintained in such an industry unless every effort is made to ensure an even flow of funds and the steady development of the house building industry.  The example I have quoted has become all too prevalent in Ireland. In recent times the societies had a large inflow of cash, but the building <Col N="1252" /> industry had already lost confidence. Recent auction results indicate that the spare cash is resulting in inflated house prices.  Perhaps some form of stabilisation fund is necessary to ensure the steady development of societies and to help them to overcome any disadvantages they may suffer in periods of instability.</P>
    <P>At present building societies have the edge on other popular types of investment in regard to interest rates. I did a survey at the end of last June and at that time the associated banks paid 6.75 per cent on deposits of less than £5,000 with the first £70 of interest free of tax.  The non-associated banks paid between 7 per cent and 11¼ per cent, tax payable.  The Post Office paid between 7 per cent and 9½ per cent on different types of accounts.  At that time the building societies paid 7½ per cent tax free.  This gave them the edge and helped their inflow.  At that time I said I was sorry to note the Government's decision to remove the 1 per cent interest subsidy from the societies.  The excuse given was that the Government did not wish building society borrowers to enjoy better terms than the SDA borrowers.  As a direct result of Government action, in increasing SDA loan interest rates, building society borrowers did enjoy better terms.  The position has now, because of circumstances, been reversed.  The removal of the 1 per cent subsidy caused hardship for building society borrowers, many of whom were unemployed or on short time, and many more had not got the previous year's national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>The building societies play an important role in the economy today, one that has been developing over the last ten years.  Our net savings with the various financial institutions in 1969 was £124 million.  During that year the level of deposits and shares in building societies rose by £8.4 million, or 7 per cent of the total savings.  In 1975 savings were almost £600 million and building societies' deposits and shares rose to almost 12 per cent of the total savings.  In 1969 deposits with the societies were 16 per cent above the previous year's level and in 1975 the figure was 35 per cent.  In recent years the number of <Col N="1253" /> investors has increased but I feel it can increase more.  Only 3 per cent of the adult population have accounts with building societies.  With this growth in the power, strength and enterprise of the building societies and the constructive role they can play in society, I believe that legislation which takes account of these developments should be considered in this House.  Building society members should have more power and responsibility and there should be greater communication between the investors and those who administer them. Therefore I am glad this Bill gives special attention to the calling of meetings, particularly annual general meetings, in order that the views of shareholders and depositors can be made known and that they can share in policy making.</P>
    <P>I have seen copies of the annual accounts of several societies and I must admit I had difficulty in finding the information I required.  Few people could understand the present accounting format of the societies.  It may be that the societies are obliged by law to present their accounts in this way.  The societies should present their accounts in a more readily understandable form, particularly for the small investor.  The small investor is the backbone of the society and provides it with much needed stability. The small investor is not likely to move his money elsewhere for a quick profit and he should, therefore, be given special consideration.  I note that the building societies' association are anxious to have representation on any council relating to their function which the Minister decides to set up. I agree with this but I believe that once a society has complied with the regulations and instructions of the registrar it should be automatically admitted to membership of the building societies' association which should be open to all <i>bona fide</i> societies.  In the event of the association being granted seats on the council, the smaller societies must have their voices heard.</P>
    <P>I come now to the controversial question of advertising.  The amount spent by all of the societies on advertising <Col N="1254" /> seems very large indeed, particularly when related to the relatively small number of investors.  From the Minister's speech I gather he does not regard it as too high.  I take it that he has had the matter thoroughly investigated. If that is his opinion, having had the matter thoroughly examined, I accept what he says.  However in view of the fact that building societies are non-profit making bodies and mostly charge the same interest rates I wonder whether they could not pool their advertising resources.  I do not propose to push this point because it would amount to administrative interference in the financial affairs of the societies, to which I object.</P>
    <P>I shall revert to our main objections to the Bill.  Some years ago the overall control of the building societies lay with the Minister for Finance.  Now it is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  Under this Bill the societies will have four masters.  I believe that is undesirable; the possibilities of conflict relating to proper management and to financial policies are too great.  I should like the registrar to have an independent status, his own staff and the necessary expertise.  At present the Minister can dictate to a society to achieve his immediate objectives.  For example, over the years, societies made money available for house purchase in the proportion of approximately 50 : 50 between new and secondhand houses. That was a sensible arrangement because few people sell a house without buying or building another.  Some people, because of a transfer of job from one area to another, have no option but to sell their house and build or buy another.  Others, perhaps, cannot afford to buy a new house.</P>
    <P>In my view the traditional division of funds catered fairly for all types of purchasers.  In 1974&mdash;and this is confirmed in the mortgage accounts of the societies&mdash;a considerable change took place, when approximately twice as much money was advanced for the purchase and building of new houses as for secondhand ones.  I am led to believe that that change took place because of pressure by the Minister. <Col N="1255" /> Those people forced to change house because of a change of job and those who could not afford new houses were victimised by that regulation while many others, who owned houses and who wished to change, could not sell their houses.  The result of all this was that the demand for new houses fell. Those people were victims of what I would regard as the Minister's need for housing statistics.  As soon as the result of this interference became obvious the Minister was forced to abandon his control and the societies returned to their traditional pattern of lending.</P>
    <P>That recent example supports my contention that the activities of the building societies should be controlled only by the registrar who will be guided by legislation passed in this House.  While the overall control could be in his hands, rather than in the Minister's, the registrar&mdash;while independent of politics&mdash;should not be either the creature of the societies or a bureaucrat.  He should continually examine the operation and administration of societies to bring about improvements and make more money readily available for house purchase. He should also examine the way in which the societies in other countries are administered, the activities in which they engage and how relevant their activities might be here.</P>
    <P>For example, in Germany, societies are builders as well as financiers.  In other countries societies are permitted to invest a small percentage of their assets in the construction of houses for letting purposes, the idea being that some investors might not be in a position initially to buy their own homes.  They rent a house or flat from a society and, when their circumstances improve, they buy it. Profits accruing to the societies from these activities are ploughed back for the provision of more moneys for mortgages and reducing interest rates. All of this could be examined by the registrar to ascertain whether or not some of the methods used by building societies in other countries could not be utilised here to our advantage. In Ireland, when a society wishes to advance a loan higher than 75 per <Col N="1256" /> cent of the cost of a house, it seeks a guarantee from a bank or some other financial institution.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to know whether the societies could not improve on that situation.  House prices are now so high that societies must lend a higher percentage of the cost than they did heretofore.  It is essential that they lend up to 90 per cent or 95 per cent because a householder, particularly a first time purchaser, has many other commitments to meet such as furnishing the house, paying legal fees and so on.  If building societies could take on some of the risk themselves, it would reduce the cost of mortgages.  Similarly, if societies could amalgamate their legal departments so that there would not be so much red tape involved in the transfer of a house from one mortgagee to another, I believe costs could be reduced also.  I have known of cases where up to five different solicitors were involved in a simple sale&mdash;the seller's, the ground landlord's, the seller's building society, the buyer's and the buyer's building society.</P>
    <P>I believe also that the societies have a role to play in housing standards. Buying a house is the largest financial transaction undertaken by any family, the effects of which will be felt for anything from 30 to 35 years.  The life expectancy of a house is at least twice that.  Yet the guarantee provided by builders is between six months and two years.  A person buying a car which will last from five to seven years gets a year's guarantee or 12,000 miles and he can have that guarantee renewed on the payment of a small fee.  As the average householder buys a house only once in a lifetime and will not be making a repeat purchase, he is not in a position to influence the type of guarantee provided.</P>
    <P>I believe that building societies, which are involved in the financing of the bulk of private housing, have a role to play in ensuring that high standards are maintained not only in their own interests but also that of their members.  There is a serious lack of consistency in construction methods and, in some instances, poor site supervision.  Some building contracts <Col N="1257" /> modify the common law rights of house purchasers.  Inspections by building society architects and those of public authorities very often are relatively limited and relate to specific matters only.  Building societies, in view of their co-operative nature and as a service to their customers ought to be more involved in this field.  In Britain there is a national house builders' registration council, an independent, non-profit making body which includes all of those involved in house building, including the societies.  They promote better standards. They are concerned with construction, design and layout.  They lay down standards and will remedy defects in houses if their builder member does not do so.  Some parts of their guarantees last for ten years. Here societies have tended&mdash;presumably because inflation has guarded the value of their investment&mdash;to ignore the question of house quality.  I would recommend that they become involved in it here.  The guarantees provided here by the construction federation industry are not widely known and are limited to defects occurring within two years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have wandered slightly from the point, which is that we should have a broader view of the possible activities of the societies. This Bill ensures the continuation of the whole movement in its present role and provides for no new developments.</P>
    <P>I should like very briefly to return to the question of deposits and shares. In the ordinary usage of those terms a depositor with an institution is not a member of it and has prior claim on its assets if it collapses.  On the other hand, a shareholder is a member of the institution, bearing higher risks, and in good times he gets a better return for his money.  However, in building society usage the terms appear to be interchangeable in this Bill.  There appears to be no difference in practice although in relation to one particular society, according to the Prices Commission report, 22 per cent of the liabilities were held in the form of shares.  However, in another there were different rates of <Col N="1258" /> interest for depositors and shareholders. The average member of the public, even the average shareholder and depositor, is unaware of the exact position or of different options open to him.  Unless there is some specific reason for maintaining the distinction between deposits and shares, the different names should be abolished and either the word share or the word deposit used.</P>
    <P>The Prices Commission report contains very useful data which will be of assistance to the registrar in his policing of societies.  I welcome this Bill.  I believe it is a necessary piece of legislation but I would like to see it improved in two major respects. As I said earlier, we want to eliminate some of the bureaucracy which will inevitably follow from the implementation of the Bill in its present form, which includes the four masters of the building societies. We also want to broaden the outlook of the Bill so that it can provide for future development of the societies. Although I have been to a degree somewhat critical of the operations of building societies I want again to stress that we are very conscious of the outstanding contribution they have made through the years and we are anxious that the Bill should help their further progress.  We favour the Bill in principle apart from the few important points I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how much this side of the House welcomes the Bill which the Minister introduced into this House today which has gone through what is coyly referred to as &ldquo;the other House&rdquo; but which we know as the Seanad.  It was welcomed there and was given a very thorough investigation by all sides of that chamber.  I listened with interest to Deputy Faulkner's remarks, who, on the whole, has been very fair to the Bill and has welcomed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on this very fascinating building society movement, which the Bill is endeavouring to help.  It was started in England nearly 200 years ago in a very simple way.  Men paid in a few pennies a week honestly and regularly <Col N="1259" /> and when sufficient money was gathered a draw was held.  The names were probably put in a hat and the winner bought his house.  The system has not changed fundamentally since then.  Nowadays people put money into a society and then the society&mdash; it does not hold a draw now&mdash;lends money to people who want to buy houses.  The enormous movement we know today has been built up from that simple beginning.  The building society movement is a non-profit making one.  It does not want to make profits.  It must not make a loss or it would endanger the whole movement. The Government did not enter into this in the old days.  Now they are entering into building societies with an ever-increasing fervour.</P>
    <P>I am connected with the building society movement.  The people who are interested in running building societies welcome many aspects of this Bill.  We have reservations on a few points which the Minister is well aware of.  We have not any fundamental objections to the Bill which skilfully endeavours to make the running of building societies, between themselves, their depositors and borrowers, smoother, which makes it more certain that the depositors will get their interest and that the borrowers will get their houses and continue to live in them without fear of being dispossessed.</P>
    <P>A fairly complex code of legislation has been built up over the years.  We are now getting what we always wanted: a registrar with considerable powers.  In the past he had not the legal power to enable him to deal with societies which in his opinion were not conducting their affairs properly. Fortunately those societies have been very few and far between in the whole history of the movement.  This movement has been so successful financially and in its management that there have been very few societies who have lost money for either their depositors or their borrowers.  The registrar now will have increasing powers if he thinks the ratio of borrowing and lending and so on has been superseded.</P>
    <P>States all over the world have welcomed building societies and <Col N="1260" /> many newer countries have sent over to ask people from Britain and the Continent to look into the systems which prevail in various countries in order that they could start societies in those countries, because no other financial institutions have been able, in quite the same way or quite as simply and with a minimum of legal fuss, to borrow short and lend long, to the extent that the building societies have been able to do that. I think I am correct in saying that the world-wide £30,000 or £40,000 million of assets and business generally is a huge sum even in global terms.  We are only a small country and not being a highly industrialised State our growth in the movement has been smaller than in some of the other countries.  Nevertheless our growth in the last few years has been quite phenomenal and in the building society movement there are tens, probably hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland who are, who should be, and who would not be housed were it not for the societies, because even banks have not found it possible to borrow short and lend long.  That is what the building societies have done and are doing.</P>
    <P>Another thing they have been able to do, and perhaps one of the reasons why they have had this tremendous success, is to be readily available to the people concerned.  I will return to another aspect of that in a moment. They are readily available; people can walk into them easily, and when they walk in people can be given and do get eventually a house with a minimum deposit.  In the past there have been cases of lots of people who got it with practically no deposit at all.  The deposit, in other words, is only a token of the goodwill of the person concerned.  What bank would you be able to go into and get a loan just on character, on the fact that you are in some sort of job where you are able to pay it back at so many pounds a week or a month?  That is one of the great things the building societies have done and the Minister and his Department have recognised that again and again in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I, who have not had acquaintance <Col N="1261" /> with the building society movement until late in life am constantly amazed at this service which is given, and expected by the public, namely that they can get a house with a minimum of recommendation.  In some continental countries you have to be paying in money for years and years before you can attempt to get a house.  In these islands you can go in and you can get it if in the opinion of the society you are a fit and proper person so to do. That has grown and grown to the extent that in Britain the building societies have bigger assets than the joint stock banks.  They are colossal and they get bigger and bigger in this country.</P>
    <P>Before I develop that I want to mention again ease of access.  We sometimes hear people saying that the building societies have too many branches.  That is not so.  They are in what you might call the high street of every town and many of the large villages of this country and people do not have to go searching for the financial sector of a city or of a town to find a place where they can deposit their money if they are depositors and get a loan if they are borrowing.  So that cry that building societies should not have so many branches is a foolish one.  Without that number of branches and ease of access the movement would not get the money in.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the building societies&mdash;and it is not fully understood&mdash;is the relationship between the deposit rate and the mortgage rate, the rate which people pay when they borrow money to get a house.  There has to be a direct relationship between the two because if money is not attracted in from depositors there will be nothing to lend out.  That is a simple and fundamental fact.  The societies have to develop, and have developed over the years, immense expertise in that way, that they can readily gauge the price which they can afford to give to depositors in order to have the maximum amount of money to lend to their borrowers.  It is very simple but it is not always recognised that without a figure which can <Col N="1262" /> attract the depositor there would be nothing in the coffers to lend out, or very little.</P>
    <P>I can understand the wish of the Minister&mdash;by this I mean the Minister, the Department and the Government &mdash;to have power in regard to fixing both mortgage and deposit rates because not only is he anxious to get the money into the societies he is also anxious to see as many houses as possible built.  Ministers change and sometimes policies change.  I issue a warning to the present Minister and to future Ministers that it is very advisable to encourage the building of houses.  My whole life has been connected with house building in this country and I know a little about that side of the building society movement and of building itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister is always anxious that the maximum number of houses be built, but building societies are primarily financial institutions.  Nobody is more interested than they are in the number of houses built, but their fundamental job is taking in money and lending it to borrowers to buy houses. I will not say that the two points of view are sometimes in conflict but they may not be exactly <i>ad idem</i>, as the lawyers say.</P>
    <P>The wisdom of the Minister in this Bill is that he has seen the necessity to reconcile the two points of view. He has taken powers to deal with the situation, if it should arise, that the building societies were following a course which would not help building; but he does not want to take unnecessary powers to deal with such a situation.  I want to get it down in black and white here that the building societies must never for one second lose sight of the fact that they must make the lending of money to them attractive or else they will not get it. People take out their money as quickly as the wind blows if they think they are not getting good value, and then young people are left wondering how they will get a roof over their heads.  I urge that there be a realisation here of the fundamental purpose of building societies, while bearing in mind that the Government cannot <Col N="1263" /> give them a free for all.  They do not want that, they have never demanded it and the Minister has recognised that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a Bill of the 1870s and of the 1890s&mdash;both of those were a long time ago&mdash;and said he hoped this Bill would regulate the affairs of the societies for an equally long period.  In this rapidly-changing world that would be almost too much to hope for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All of us welcome it and realise the great effort that he and his Department have made to introduce a Bill that will continue to regulate the affairs of this great movement in the interests of the public and of the country in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I join with the two previous speakers in welcoming the Bill.  It contains many sections that we consider desirable and we welcome them but our spokesman has pointed out certain reservations we have with regard to other sections.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Dockrell outline the background of building societies as established in England in the 17th century.  I got the impression that it was then more of a co-operative society, where the people who invested money were the same people who withdrew it.  Building societies have expanded considerably since then and we have a situation here&mdash; and I am sure it applies throughout the world&mdash;where a considerable number of people invest funds in these societies and do not apply for loans to build houses.  On the other hand, there are those people who invest in the societies with a view to getting a loan to build a house at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> As the Minister stated, building societies have expanded considerably during the years.  They have played a major part in the economic and social development of this country.  Were it not for the funds made available by them thousands of people would not have the luxury of their own homes.  Where an individual has a stake in a society in my opinion&mdash;and this is shared by many people&mdash;it tends to be a better society.  If we encourage people to purchase their own homes it is a contributory factor in the strengthening of our society. For that reason the Bill the Minister has introduced is of vital importance and deserves all the attention this House can give it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out the assets of the building societies since 1961 have increased and they are now in the region of £300 million.  This flow of funds into the building societies from people who are investing purely for investment reasons is very welcome.  As Deputy Dockrell stated, if the building societies are to have a sufficient flow of funds they must ensure a good return on investments.  I would not be misled about the additional flow of funds into any financial institutions over the past two or three years.  It is a well-known trend, not alone in this country but in the United Kingdom, that in times of depression people have a tendency to save more.  This pattern has been established not only in this recession but in other recessions.  People build up reserves of savings to serve in the event of emergency.  Some of the additional inflow of capital to the building societies can be attributed to that trend.  Not alone must building societies create a climate to encourage investment but a climate must be created so that sufficient people are in a position to get loans from building societies.  The building societies cannot do this on their own.</P>
    <P>The building societies are fortunate in having this flow of revenue into their associations.  The demand for loans is reasonably good in the private sector.  The associated banks have quite a build-up of reserves within their organisations.  Many bank <Col N="1265" /> managers would tell you that if they could get proper clients they would be only too willing to lend money.  This situation could develop in relation to the building societies.  If the price of houses escalates out of proportion to the ability of the average individual purchaser, a situation could develop where the average individual would not be able to borrow from the building societies.  The Minister and everyone in this Houses are perfectly well aware that we are reaching that saturation point.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the possibility of that situation arising at some future date, if it has not already arisen.</P>
    <P>A man who started to save with the building society four or five years ago will find at this stage that his capital has been eroded.  In the normal course of events his capital would have been eroded, but now it would be eroded to a greater extent, in view of the purchasing price of a house now. I have spoken to many people who have saved over a number of years with a view to purchasing a house. They now find that their savings have been completely eroded and, on the other hand, inflation is driving the price of the house completely out of proportion to their increase in wages. In the next two or three years building societies could very well have a substantial flow of money into their funds, but if inflation is not checked and the price of private houses is not checked we will reach a stage where a big proportion of our wage earners, who have made every effort to try and have deposits built up with the societies, will not be able to afford the substantial loan they will need to purchase a house and they will eventually turn to local authority housing.  If the present scale of increases in the price of houses continues, that will be the outcome. I have great sympathy for the young married couples who must borrow huge loans when trying to set up house at the present time, when I compare it to those of us who have purchased our houses over the past eight or ten years.  As Deputy Dockrell mentioned, building societies have obligations on both sides.  They must give a reasonable return, otherwise <Col N="1266" /> they will not have funds.</P>
    <P>The movement of money within the United Kingdom and this country is very easy and people are getting more and more sophisticated with regard to their return on deposits.  Therefore I can see the dilemma of the building societies.  But at what stage will the people in this country say, because of these huge loans, that they cannot carry this burden any longer.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a huge responsibility is placed on a man when he is faced with the possibility of having to pay in the region of 50 per cent of his salary for repayments on his home.  This is not an unusual situation.  I know one man whose repayments were nearly 60 per cent of his salary.  He and his wife persevered and their house is now worth far more than they paid for it at that time, due of course to inflation. This is a very difficult undertaking for married people and the State must take some action.  Prices of private houses are escalating by as much as 20 per cent and it is very difficult for young married people to be in a position to approach a building society.  I have the highest of praise for the building societies and the work they have done.  They have their problems in competing with other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Minister with regard to the restrictions on the formation of new societies.  The major societies have made a great contribution but there are some who probably never intended to make a contribution and had ulterior motives.  I am quite in agreement with that section in the Bill which states that certain deposits would have to be placed by each shareholder. The Minister mentioned a figure in the region of £10,000.  I see nothing at all wrong with this.  I would ask the Minister to review the figure from time to time and increase it in line with inflation.  This is a very serious business and we must not allow any individual to set up an organisation. Some innocent people have been caught in the past, and it is only right and proper that the interests of both borrowers and investors should be protected.  In my opinion, some provision should be written into the Bill to <Col N="1267" /> ensure that people who wish to establish these societies have the proper expertise to develop and run them.</P>
    <P>There is also a section in the Bill providing for the lodgment of a certain amount of money with the Central Bank.  I can see the merit of this. I know this is common practice with the associated banks.  As Deputy Faulkner has mentioned, this section was drawn up in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government.  I am not altogether sure whether, at the moment, any moneys have to be lodged with the Central Bank or with any other financial institutions.  The figure the Minister mentioned is something in the region of £20,000 to £½ million.</P>
    <P>We know that 98 per cent of the business today is dealt with by the Irish Building Societies' Association. There are still some small genuine companies.  That is quite obvious. What type of burden will it place on small companies if they have to find £20,000?  Will it be accepted by way of debenture, or transfer of deeds which all building societies hold instead of a transfer of cash?  The associated banks transfer a certain amount of cash, but they can transfer some gilt edge securities too. Building societies have no such securities. They have the security of the deeds of the thousands and thousands of houses they hold within their companies.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister's intention that the transfer of £20,000 from small companies and £½ million from the larger companies should be by the way of cash or some type of securities. The normal rate for any money lent to the Central Bank by the associated banks is 1 per cent over borrowing rates.  I should not like to see the building societies being deprived of cash.  If at any time in the future there was a diminution of funds into the building societies, I do not know what effect this would have. Would it impede the number of loans they would be able to make?  These matters deserve consideration.  I am <Col N="1268" /> sure the Minister has gone into them with the building societies.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer in the independence and autonomy of business organisations.  The organisations we are dealing with operate in a competitive world.  Certain restrictions must be placed on them because they deal with public funds and public deposits.  We should try to remove their day-to-day running from bureaucracy and State Departments.  Deputy Faulkner said we should give more autonomy and more power to the registrar.  Under this Bill the Minister for Local Government can lay down his terms of reference.  The building societies have to make quick decisions from time to time and, if they are slowed down or impeded in any way by direct interference from a Department, expansion will be hindered.  Whether we like it or not, there is this danger when too many Departments are involved, the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government.  If we appoint a registrar with a proper secretariat, and expertise, and give him proper status and complete independence, subject to his terms of reference, we will be doing a good day's job.  He will keep the continuity going.  He will know what is happening.</P>
    <P>Let us take the other side of the coin.  I have the highest respect for the officials of the Departments of Local Government and Finance.  I am sure they are experts in their own field.  We must remember that today within the civil service, especially since the evolvement of the EEC, many of our top civil servants often have to transfer to Brussels or to the Commission. Perhaps an official within the Department who has been dealing for the past six months with the building societies is transferred to Europe.  This would to some degree impede the work of the registrar.  For that reason I believe the registrar should be given more independence, and the absence of interference from the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government would, I believe, lead to far greater efficiency within the building societies.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is divesting himself of a very onerous <Col N="1269" /> duty from 1st January next, namely, planning appeals, which will be the responsibility of an independent body. That is how it should be.  I am not sure that the Minister will help the building societies by involving himself here.  To all financial institutions confidentiality is of vital importance. I am not suggesting for a moment that it is the intention of the Minister of Local Government or the Minister for Finance to delve into the various financial aspects of the building societies.  If it was, I believe it would be disastrous.  However, if investors took that view, it would weaken the structures which have been built up over the years.  The intrusion of too many Departments cannot be a help to the building societies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has drawn attention to the provisions in the Bill relating to the ratio of assets to liabilities, and says this could be varied from company to company.  It is right to maintain a certain ratio and to retain a certain amount of the funds for cash flow.  All these regulations are welcome.  I am sure the details can be worked out at a later stage between the Department and the building societies.  But I would certainly much prefer to see the Central Bank working out the ratio of assets to liabilities and advising building societies how their surplus assets should be invested.  The Central Bank has expertise in this field.  There has been a relationship down through the years between the associated banks and the Central Bank which, I believe, could be extended to the building societies.  This would create a better structure and generate more confidence in the public generally.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to advertising and the opening of various offices throughout the country.  Building societies must compete for finance and it is important that a certain amount of advertising be done and that a certain number of branches be opened.  However, whether building societies should compete with one another is a question I have often asked myself.  Many of our banks have amalgamated, and I believe that as time goes on we shall see a great reduction in the number of outlets <Col N="1270" /> for the various associated banks.  I can see the point in a building society moving into a town and opening an outlet, but I cannot see any sense in another building society moving into the same town and opening another outlet two doors up at a cost of £10,000 or £20,000.  I believe the time will come when there will be a rethink on that whole aspect of the building societies because the question of staffing, capital expenditure, and overheads are aspects that are worth considering.  One sees groups vying with one another in advertising on television, radio and so on, and while advertising is necessary, it should not be done to such an extent as to diminish unduly the profits of the societies.</P>
    <P>There are many excellent sections in the Bill, and many of the details can be dealt with at Committee Stage.  These are sections which are necessary for the safeguarding of investment.  These provisions we welcome, but others we have mentioned are unnecessary and will impede the expansion and strengthening of the building societies.  Generally, the provisions are satisfactory.  You will always find weaknesses in any expanding organisation.  These have been criticised in the past, and this Bill provides a remedy for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner referred to the soaring of interest rates, at the moment standing at 13.5 per cent. People trying to finance loans for houses costing £9,000 or £10,000 have my sympathy.  I know what a great effort many of them who have taken on housing loans have to make.  An increase of 2 per cent can be a substantial amount for a person who was on a very tight budget before this increase was ever introduced.  Many of these people are in the most vulnerable section of our society as regards health and hospital services.  There is no way that payments can be reduced.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Faulkner in asking the Minister to consider giving some subsidy to offset the differential between the additional charges and the old charge.  These high charges will not last forever.  I believe that the interest rates will be reduced, probably in the not-too-distant future.  In <Col N="1271" /> the interim, there are people who may not be able to carry these increases. I welcome the Bill with the exception of those sections about which we have expressed our reservations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for introducing this Bill which I welcome.  It has already been debated in the Seanad when certain desirable changes were made to it.  When the Bill has been passed it will meet the needs of the people and of the building societies.</P>
      <P>We owe a great deal to the building societies.  They have given a tremendous service and have helped many people to purchase houses.  All legislation should be updated from time to time and the updating of this legislation does not reflect on the building societies.  The building societies are happy with this Bill.  Deputy Fitzpatrick baffled me for a short time. I did not know whether he was in favour of investing in building societies. He seemed to find it difficult to understand that large amounts of money were being invested in the building societies.  Money is being invested in the building societies because people have confidence in them and in the development of this country. The records show that the Government have helped the construction industry.</P>
      <P>The last speaker said that the building societies should have autonomy. He then talked about advertising and the duplicating of offices.  If the building societies want to compete by advertising and by opening up new offices that is their business.  I am a great believer in competition.  Indeed, competition is the spice of life.  The banks thought it was a good idea to amalgamate and to structure their advertising accordingly.  Deputy Faulkner said that the rate of investment is very low.  If that is so the building societies must try to attract more investors.  They will have to adopt a hard line and be more commercial. Obviously they want to make a profit but they also have a social obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> One way in which the building societies could sell the idea of investing with them is by having savings deducted at source in various industries. I should also like to see building societies involving themselves with young people.  They should devote funds and energy in trying to attract younger investors.  The Government should consider giving incentives for saving in this manner.  At present there are too many people on local authority housing lists.  If we tackled the situation by encouraging people to invest in building societies we would not have long waiting lists for local authority housing.  A sensible approach would be to attract young people to invest in building societies so that they would be able to get loans when they decide to purchase a home.</P>
    <P>The building societies' rate of interest is high.  When a loan is granted the interest rate is high because it is the going rate.  The building societies can do nothing about that.  They have to compete for money.  I wonder if they could not devise some system under which, for the first five years of repayment of a loan&mdash;when a person's salary is lower and while inflation continues to rise&mdash;they might lend at a lower rate to be escalated as the salary is augmented.  In that way people would be paying only what they could afford.</P>
    <P>Deputies were saying here this evening there will come a time when people will not be able to borrow because of the high cost of housing and inflation rising.  I inquired about a constituent of mine who was looking for a loan. She has no money invested.  I was told: &ldquo;No, there is no way, our books are closed, come back in three or four months' time.&rdquo;  Remember we are talking of a time when building societies this year will lend possibly £90 million.  That constitutes progress. Therefore, we should not be in doubt as to how building societies will proceed with their activities.  The fact that that kind of money will be loaned this year reflects well on our society. It reflects a growing confidence in our society and in the house building and ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>This Bill affords building societies a <Col N="1273" /> greater degree of autonomy.  There has been talk about the registrar being slotted in and being the sole arbiter. There may be an argument to be made for that but, in terms of the vast sums of money invested by the public, one must have stringent controls.  There is no point in our being concerned after the horse has bolted.  We must ensure that when we introduce legislation it protects the investor.  The building societies would also regard this as a desirable thing.</P>
    <P>In cases where new building societies are being set up the registrar should act quickly to ensure that there is no sharp practice operating at an early stage.  Also when there is to be a change in a company or in a building society, such as a change of directors, of personnel or, indeed, of attitude the registrar must be careful at all times to ensure that there is nothing in such change that will affect investors' money.  People have confidence in building societies, which is what we want.  This Bill aims at giving a greater degree of confidence to the public to invest their money in their future.</P>
    <P>What concerns me somewhat is the question of commission paid by builders, which is being stopped.  There is also what I might call the middleman, the insurance company agent who will tell you he will obtain a loan provided you take out some sort of policy with him.  I dislike that type of sharp practice.  Insurance companies should operate in their own right.  Building societies do insist that a mortgagee has an insurance policy but that policy should not be initiated by an insurance company solely as a means of attracting lending business. Perhaps the Minister would examine that aspect because I do know of people who have gone to building societies who in turn have said: &ldquo;Sorry, we are closed for business; you can go to an insurance company or one of their agents&rdquo;.  In turn he will say that you can borrow the money but, of course, there is the stipulation that you buy his policy. That is the kind of practice this Bill seeks to eliminate.  We are concerned about the investor, about the young <Col N="1274" /> married couple trying to purchase a house.  There should be no middlemen or exploitation.</P>
    <P>The type of investment that has taken place in building societies since the foundation of this State up to date, and particularly during the last five years, has been tremendous.  Given the confidence of the House, this Bill will encourage building societies to examine the whole aspect of attracting investors.  They have a little edge in the sense that they can pay a little more in interest rates.  I would ask them to exploit that edge as far as possible.  People feel that rates of interest should be subsidised.  I think that is a wrong approach.  By and large, subsidies are not a good idea.  They may appeal but, in the long run, one is channelling money out of the Exchequer which could be more productively used because even people who can well afford to pay reap the benefit of subsidies.  There may be certain areas in which they are essential but, as a rule, they are wrong because too many people who can afford to pay also reap the reward.</P>
    <P>Then there is inflation and the state of the £ sterling.  Many things account for the current high interest charges over which we have very little control. We can only hope that in coming years&mdash;and I say years, not months&mdash; inflation and the £ sterling will be controlled with a resultant fall in interest rates.  That is the way the problem should be tackled rather than expending moneys from the Exchequer in order to prop things up.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been welcomed by all of us.  The building societies discharge a tremendous social function in our society and rarely get the kudos for it.  They are doing it very well and this Bill will help them in that activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill reminds me of a man setting out on a journey who, half way loses sight of the woods for the trees.  The Minister has introduced the Building Societies Bill, 1975. I suggest that it constitutes the trees. The woods are the problems of young couples attempting to buy homes, anxious to do so at a low interest rate over a certain number of years with, <Col N="1275" /> more important still, a fixed interest rate so that when they sign their contract they know that will be the rate they will pay over the years ahead and not a variable one as we have under present building society regulations.</P>
      <P>The provision of finance for house loans and mortgages should be the prime consideration.  The Minister should not have lost this opportunity to discuss the overall provision for private housing.  He should have considered the role of the banks and their provision of finance for loans for private houses.  He should have discussed the role of insurance companies or if they are doing enough in relation to providing money for private housing.  He should have discussed the SDA loan situation in regard to the infinitesimal level of loans and grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just introduced a Building Societies Bill which is looking at a small section of an overall problem.  The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The building societies are major financial institutions with assets in excess of £350 million and the State would be failing in its duty to its citizens who invest with and borrow from the societies if it did not provide an adequate legislative framework for controlling institutions of this magnitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is fair comment.  We would be failing in our duty in controlling institutions that have seen a rise since 1921 when they had assets of £500,000, to £0.8 million in 1931, £1.5 million in 1941, £10.4 million in 1951, £18.7 million in 1961, £181 million in 1973 and today over £300 million if we did not review the controls under which they operate.  Are the institutions operating in the best interest of the borrowing public, the potential house buyer?  I doubt it.  The best interest of a potential house buyer is a building society or an organisation which can provide to that person a loan over X number of years at £X interest rate which <Col N="1276" /> would remain constant throughout the period of the loan.</P>
    <P>The main problem I come across in my constituency is the variation in building society interest rates.  A man buys a house today and pays a 9 per cent interest rate.  He works out his family budget on that.  Six months later the interest rate has gone up to 10 per cent, 11 per cent, 12 per cent or 13 per cent.  How can a man working on the basis of a certain income organise an annual family budget if the principal item in which he is involved, that of putting a roof over his family's head, keeps costing him more?  He cannot calculate accurately from one month to the next the amount he will have to pay to his building society.  All the Bills under the sun, like this Building Societies Bill, will fail in what should be their goal if the Minister or some other Minister does not tackle the problem of fixed interest rates over a fixed number of years.</P>
    <P>There should be a modernisation of any institution which has £350 million of the people's money invested in it. I am sorry the Minister did not take this opportunity to look at the problem of finance for people anxious to buy their own homes.  He has merely looked at an institution with £350 million of the people's money invested in it.  He has not looked at the effect on the people who borrow money from the building societies.  The building societies get their money on one basis, to which the Minister referred, short term money given out on a long term basis.  Building societies are there to provide money for people anxious to build their own homes.  A young couple wishing to buy a home start out at a disadvantage because of the economic situation we are facing today which by anybody's reckoning, including the Minister for Finance, is in an appalling state; it must be, when we have a Minister for Finance suggesting that children's allowance and free travel for school children be cut out.</P>

      <P>The Minister has conveniently forgotten about the main problem facing young people in the country who are anxious to buy their own homes.  They must know out of a fixed salary, when there are wage freezes and so on, how much they can spend every week.  Those people are unable to bend to the major financial houses in London or Dublin without breaking.  They are unable to meet the high interest rates charged at the moment.  I come across more young people in my constituency every day who got married a few years ago and now have one or two children.  They bought their houses under building society mortgages but the interest rates have risen so much that now, because the jobs they were in have closed up or because they can no longer get overtime or there is a wage freeze, they cannot pay the excessive mortgage interest rates.  They are giving up their owner-occupied houses and going on the local authority waiting list.  I can give the Minister at least a dozen cases in my constituency where this problem arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will.  This morning I had a case in Portmarnock, an SDA building society situation where he can no longer pay the mortgage repayment because of financial strains, because of where he was working and the downturn in the economy. He finds himself in an appalling situation. He is moving out from his own home which he had been buying and is now thrown on the county council housing list hoping to get a county council house.  This is not good for the economy, for society or the family.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill as it is.  There are defects, and major defects, but my difficulty is that it is merely the tip of the iceberg.  It is the tip of the major problem of the funding and financing of mortgages and home loans generally for prospective house buyers.  The main aim should be the provision of loans from whatever source for a fixed number of years and at the fixed interest rate.  There is nothing in this Bill that will achieve that aim.</P>
      <P>One thing not in this Bill that should be there and should be written into any building society legislation is that all money invested with building societies should be used, other than that taken up for staff and management expenses, for private loans for housing and housing only.  In the past charges were made, rightly or wrongly, of investment by the building societies in hotels, office blocks and in other sectors of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be written into this Bill as a section that all money invested in building societies should be reinvested in house purchase loans only.  There should be no investment in office blocks, in hotels or pubs, or in flat development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to a point that caused the Association of Combined Residents' Associations to call a major mortgage strike in 1972-73.  This association represents 40 or 50 residents' associations around this city and the country. They have a seven-point demand.  I would like to go over the seven points and then consider how many of them are covered by the legislation we have <Col N="1279" /> before us.  The people in the ACRA are mainly mortgage holders with building societies and their point of view and their attitude to the operations of building societies are relevant because they themselves are repaying loans over varying numbers of years and at varying interest rates.</P>
    <P>Point one of the seven-point demand was that all building societies making money available to home purchasers should amalgamate into one society with a fixed rationalisation of offices and expenses; failing that the Government should act in the public interest and take over the building societies and use funds invested in the post office or the vast profits of the banks to provide low-cost loans to home seekers.  Here we were calling for rationalisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Rationalisation&mdash; a fixed rationalisation of office and other expenses.  It is outrageous to see their expansion.  Admittedly, it has slowed up because of the downturn in the economy but there was a time up to two years ago where we had this proliferation of offices almost reaching the stage of the news-agent at every street corner.  We had one and two branches of the nationally known building societies at every street corner.  They were, in my view, using up money invested with them which was intended to be reinvested in house purchase loans only.  They were using it up in offices for their own aggrandisement.  They were opening up like Allied Irish Banks, the Bank of Ireland and other banks. They were meeting a situation in which domestic banking facilities were being provided at every street corner.  That was never what was intended and I am glad to see that there is something in this Bill about that behaviour.  I hope the Minister will be very strict in regard to the idea of opening offices at will and <i>ad nauseam</i>.  Every village and town in this country has two or three building societies competing with <Col N="1280" /> one another at branch and street corner level.</P>
      <P>The second item in the seven-point demand was that it should be made illegal for societies to provide loans other than for <i>bona fide</i> house purchases.  I have made the point already that the role of the building societies should be restricted firmly and by legal controls written into this Bill.  It should be written in that no society will be in a position to give loans other than for the provision of homes for the people of this country. They should not be in a position to provide money for the purchase of pubs, office blocks, hotels and so forth at the whim of the directors of the building societies.  They should be restricted solely to loans for private house purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item three of the demand said that accounts, particularly regarding the advertising expenditure of societies, should be made subject to examination each year by the Registrar of Friendly Societies or an auditor especially charged with this function.  The Minister has written in a registrar here. I question the powers that the Minister is giving to the registrar in this Bill. I am afraid that the registrar will not be given strong enough powers.  He should be completely independent of Government, of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for the Public Service.  He should be a man who would have strong individual power over the building societies. However, the main emphasis of point three was on advertising expenditure. The situation is ludicrous when you are talking about certain limited funds available for house loans being used up in advertisements in slot after slot on television and in the newspapers, very expensive slots I understand, asking the public to please invest their money with society X or stating that society Y will give so much nett return which really equals very much more in gross terms.  It is ludicrous to see and hear all this advertising.  We are told about society X, the first building on O'Connell Street and about the society that has been in existence since the last century.  This is all wasteful advertising because the societies <Col N="1281" /> are competing with each other and the only people getting anything out of it are the newspapers and RTE. The unfortunate prospective house buyers are getting nothing out of it because they have to pay for this very expensive advertising in the interest rates charged to them.  I object strongly to this.  There is a section in the Bill dealing with advertising but it is not firm enough and I shall deal with this aspect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the seven-point demand, item four speaks about a legal requirement on the societies to publish payments to directors as a separate item in their annual accounts.  This is obvious and I do not intend to deal with the matter in detail.  The next item refers to an upper limit to be fixed for directors' fees and a limit by law on the number of directors.  Again, this is an obvious matter and the Minister referred to it in his speech.  Item six refers to an ethical code and the Minister also mentioned it.</P>
    <P>Item seven states that the figure negotiated originally by borrowers for home loans be reverted to.  This is the nub of building society legislation and of any discussion of the operations of such societies.  This nettle must be grasped.  When a person buys a house on a mortgage of 20 or 25 years he should know on the first day what he will be paying on the last day.  He should know the interest rate he will be charged.  A person who gets an SDA loan knows what he will pay and there is a fixed interest rate for insurance loans.  That is what the people want and until the Minister tackles the problem he will have failed in his attempt to reorganise the entire building society movement.  I accept he has gone a long way but the core of the problem for house buyers and the unfortunate, over-burdened ratepayers is that they have not got a fixed mortgage interest rate from the building societies.</P>
    <P>I understand there are problems in that the building societies take money in on a short-term basis and loan it out on a long-term basis.  However, it is not beyond the inventiveness of some Minister to devise a system for building societies where they would have a fixed mortgage interest rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> If the Minister cannot do it under the building society legislation, I suggest that he might introduce a section allowing for the establishment of a national home loan board to provide this kind of finance, to provide it by an extension of the SDA loan system we have at the moment.  That is falling apart because the Minister will not increase the loans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Minister should have taken the opportunity to write trustee status into the Bill.  It would provide the building societies with enormous sums of money, with the potential investment that is there but which they <Col N="1283" /> cannot take advantage of because they have not got trustee status.  The Minister has said it is not necessary to write it into the Bill, that it can be done under another system and that the Minister for Finance can take advantage of some other scheme.  We have not had very much legislation with regard to building societies&mdash; there was reference in the Minister's speech to a Bill in 1834 and in 1874&mdash;and it is my opinion that the Minister should have used this opportunity to have a specific section granting trustee status to the building societies. That would have been the end of the debate and discussion on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister very carefully limited the conferring of trustee status.  He spoke of the Minister for Finance conferring trustee status on approved societies.  It should have been written in as a section here so that there would not be any misunderstanding, and nobody would be under any illusion but that the building societies could take advantage of the moneys available in pension funds throughout the country.  In my view it should be written in as a section of this Bill.</P>
    <P>What have we got here?  We have a Bill that is merely codifying the present legislation with some extensions, the main one being the extension of the powers of the registrar.  I do not think he should be under the controls written into this Bill where he is merely a civil servant &mdash;no disrespect to civil servants&mdash; under the thumb of the Minister.  He will take his instructions from the Minister, do what he is told and that will be that.  He should be completely independent of the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance or the Central Bank.  He should be responsible to the investors in building societies for protecting their interest. I do not see him being given that independence in this Bill.  I will come back to that in greater length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is one big disappointment in this Bill.  The Minister did not tackle the major problem facing mortgage holders, potential and prospective mortgage holders in building societies, <Col N="1284" /> that is, providing a mortgage for a certain number of years at a fixed interest rate.  Until some Minister tackles this main problem house purchasers will be facing increasing mortgage rates as well as increases in the cost of living and local authority rates. These difficulties will eventually cripple them.  In my view the increase in mortgage rates and local authority rates this year can best be described as the straw that broke the camel's back.</P>
    <P>As I said the Minister when introducing this Bill lost sight of the wood for the trees.  He tried to codify existing legislation for building societies&mdash; that was the trees&mdash;but he lost sight of the wood&mdash;that was to introduce provisions to ensure that mortgages would be given for a fixed number of years at a fixed interest rate.</P>

      <P>In his brief the Minister states:</P>
      <P>This is a long and rather complex Bill.  It is based, I might say, on a century's experience of previous building society legislation. Because of its importance and complexity I had a particularly detailed explanatory memorandum prepared which sets out the background to the measure...</P>
      <P>No one could dispute those remarks.</P>
      <P>As a model of drafting this Bill is very good.  All the i's have been dotted and all the t's crossed.  It will ensure as far as a Bill can that building societies will be solvent and no building society will go bankrupt if they keep to this legislation.  I wonder has the Bill any soul?  Does it offer any hope to young people who want a loan from a building society to buy a house?</P>
      <P>In his brief the Minister went back to the start of building societies.  I realise the idealism of the men and women who founded them well over 100 years ago, almost as far back as the industrial revolution.  At that time those people saw the social problems that existed and tried to organise societies to solve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us a very detailed explanatory memorandum which made very interesting reading.  It showed that we were consolidating legislation <Col N="1285" /> already in existence.  In my opinion this Bill should be more than that.  It should have been an instrument to give building societies greater scope than they have at the moment.  It should have done one big thing, that is, introduce a fixed rate of interest. I realise this is not easy.  Building societies borrow for short periods but lend on the long term.  There must be a financial genius somewhere, perhaps, in the Department of Finance or the Department of Local Government, who could have looked at this Bill and said that building societies could lend money at a fixed interest rate.  The reason for the existence of a building society should be to lend money to buy houses.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing to give young people hope that if they borrow from building societies they will ever be like their neighbour who was fortunate enough to obtain a loan from the local authority under the SDA Acts which give loans at fixed rates.  I think the insurance companies work the same way.  Despite some very excellent provisions in this Bill, it loses out on the very important and compelling aspect that it does not offer borrowers a chance to borrow at a fixed interest rate.</P>
    <P>I am not a financial genius but I always thought there could be a tie up with the Central Bank, who have control over the societies, and the local authorities and building societies should be more concerned about lending money than lending structures. They should help couples buy houses for £8,000 or £9,000.  I am not concerned with the people who want to buy the £25,000 houses.  The Fianna Fáil Party proposed a new home loans fund.  A couple could go to these people and borrow at a fixed rate. Alternatively, the building societies could be encouraged to expand their services.  When a young boy or girl starts his or her first job, a bond could be issued to them saying: &ldquo;If you save with us now we guarantee you a housing loan which will enable you to make a good start in married life.&rdquo; All legislation must have a social aspect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider for the Committee Stage some provision <Col N="1286" /> whereby the local authorities, the building societies, the banks and the Government would be complementary to one another with the backing of appropriate legislation. What people want are loans they can afford.  Very often there is cause for social unrest where the man in No. 1 has an SDA loan from a local authority whilst his next door neighbour did not qualify for such a loan because he could not afford the deposit demanded by the local authority and was compelled to go to a building society.  ACRA on occasion call for a mortgage strike.  I do not agree with that but they call the strike because many of their members are finding it difficult to meet their commitments. This is true in both the case of SDA loans and loans from building societies, though the rate of interest in the former is much lower.</P>
    <P>We should, as I suggest, concentrate on introducing a lending agency. Great effort has been put into the preparation of this Bill and the very helpful explanatory memorandum.  But this Bill will not achieve what should be the real aim, and that aim will not be achieved until we put some soul into our legislation.  Ours is a private enterprise economy and it is almost impossible to control increases in interest rates.  Our institutions must keep parity because, if they do not, there will be a flow of money out of the country and less money still for housing and everything else.  There is a prime need for a subsidy of some sort to help borrowers.  One must pay tribute to building societies for filling a void.  Very often they are criticised for too much advertising or for building palatial offices.  They must advertise like any other commercial firm. If they did not do so they would not get the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister might encourage the amalgamation of building societies.  A few years ago we had a great many commercial banks.  Now we have two or three large groups.  Amalgamation might help building societies.  Not so many years back I remember one society being absorbed into another. This is an age of rationalisation and amalgamation.  I do not see anything <Col N="1287" /> in the Bill to encourage building societies to amalgamate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad.  That is a forward step.  On Committee Stage I shall acknowledge the Minister's foresight.  Building societies will be empowered under this Bill to acquire premises or to build premises.  It might be very good business to build an office block, use one floor for the society's purposes and let the remainder; but this money would be invested in an office block and not in housing loans.  We must think of the young couples and the families who want housing loans and cannot get them because the societies say they have no money.  A few weeks ago a society said it would not accept any more applications.  Why are applications being refused?  The banks boast regularly of the amount of money they have for lending.  It is the people's money and it cannot be confiscated but it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the banks to lend some of this money to building societies to enable them to continue giving housing loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We must consider preparing a different system and realise that people looking for houses come first.  We should use our money to build a better society and not simply permit a number of people to make a lot of profit.  Governments in the <Col N="1288" /> free world can act in a tough fashion towards financial institutions when they want to and as long as we have thousands of people looking for houses and young couples living in squalid surroundings or paying exorbitant rents which they cannot afford we must try to devise a system whereby they can obtain house loans at rates of interest they can afford.  I do not wish to over-simplify this matter because I know it is a difficult problem but one of the shortcomings of the Bill is that it will not mean more loans being made available.  It is possible that as a result of this legislation more money will be attracted into the societies and that it will be safeguarded but it will not ease the loan situation.</P>
      <P>It should be possible to ensure that at some stage in the life of a borrower from a society the interest rate on the money he borrowed would be made static.  In my view that would attract more business into the societies.  More thought should be given to the bringing about of a fixed interest rate on housing loans.  I am glad the Bill provides control over the amount which may be issued for a specific thing.  I believe that those who founded these societies did not think in terms of profit but I realise that societies today must think on profit lines.  I am not one of those people who thinks the word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; is a dirty word and a reasonable profit by the societies would not be begrudged by anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but I have a lot more to say on this Stage.  In the Bill there is no shortage of control over the conduct of societies and that is necessary.  I am sure the Minister went to some pains to ensure he had good guidelines and that those involved in the building societies were consulted.  As a piece of cold legislation it is probably a good Bill but I am disappointed in the purpose it is supposed to achieve.  Deputy Burke has made the House aware of the demands of ACRA and one cannot ignore the requests of an organisation which has hundreds of branches and performs an important role for urban society.  This organisation represents thousands of families who have bought their houses by availing of loans.  They want all building societies who make money available for home purchase to amalgamate into one society.  I would hardly go that far with them because we cannot coerce any of them to amalgamate and I do not think it would be a good thing if that happened. However, there is some need for rationalisation so that societies can play a more important part than they have to date.  I accept that the societies have played an important part in helping people to buy houses, and I hope they will continue to do this.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's failure to provide employment opportunities for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion I must express my surprise that it is the Minister for Education who is taking it because when this matter was discussed previously it was dealt with, and rightly so, by the Minister for Labour.  The Minister for Labour is supposed to be responsible for the chaotic unemployment situation that exists here at <Col N="1290" /> present.  In the past weekend it would appear that at least some members of the Government had begun to realise that there are crises in the country apart from those they had tried to project in the previous few months. The Dáil was recalled to consider a motion declaring an emergency, in the most part created, and during the debate on it and subsequently we pointed out that the real problems were economic ones, particularly that of unemployment, with special reference to youth and the hopeless situation that exists for school leavers. After the debate on the emergency motion, legislation was left on the Order Paper, important in itself, but not dealing with the really urgent problems that should be faced up to by a Government that accepted responsibility.</P>
    <P>This motion deplores the failure of the Government to take any positive steps, any worth-while action, to try to provide opportunities for our young people.  We had a similar motion in May last and I should like at this stage to point out the lack of progress since then and the failure of the Government even to realise that such problems exist.  Speaking on that motion on 4th May, the Minister for Labour replied to the case I had made and said:</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Minister for Finance will shortly issue what he hopes will be the beginning of a review of all procedures, of our entire approach as it operated in the past, towards the workings of our economy.</P>
    <P>I suppose he was referring to the Green Paper that had been promised by the Minister for Finance, because that was the only forecast that Minister could make at that time.  I do not intend to refer to that document now because the Assistant Whip to the Government has covered it for me.  All I will say is that the hopes of the Minister for Labour must have been shattered by the opinion offered by his colleague, Deputy Desmond. He pointed to one area, the Community Youth Project, being financed by the EEC Social Fund, so ably <Col N="1291" /> looked after by our President-elect, Dr. Hillery, and it is appropriate that his alleged successor sits in the House tonight: I hope that even in a small way he will emulate the feats of Dr. Hillery when he was there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government appear to think this problem will disappear, that some miracle will happen whereby these young people and their employment problems will go away.  We must realise that one of the most serious by-products of the recent recession is the dramatic growth in the number of young people out of work.  We concede that the problem is not confined to Ireland, that it exists, but to a far lesser degree, in most other European countries. However, our out-of-work population under the age of 25 years is far in excess of our fellow EEC countries and for that reason a greater effort is needed by our Government to tackle this major problem.  We estimate that the number of under-25s who are out of work is 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>It can be said that our education system is directed towards white collar jobs rather than technological ones and that this has contributed to our present problem, because many school leavers and their parents are hoping for employment in that area.  In the present year it matters little which kind of work they look for because there is not any anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of growing concern that due to lack of Government initiative and action unemployment among school leavers will be worse before it improves.  Whether it improves in the long term will depend on our ability to implement long term solutions and on the leadership given by those temporarily in power.  We are due to receive from the EEC Social Fund £25 million between 1975 and 1977. We heard the Minister for Labour telling us about the increased moneys being made available by his Department to AnCO as the training authority, and one would have thought it was because of his activities <Col N="1292" /> or those of the Government.  The reality is that the money has been made available by the EEC Social Fund where we were so fortunate as to have had such a brilliant Irishman as Dr. Hillery in the past four years. That is why there is so much money available for training in the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>If we are to see full employment by 1980 we have a lot of hard work to do.  We have heard it said that there is no real problem as far as young people getting their first jobs are concerned. That is completely untrue.  We have two different problems.  The first is that there are not any, or very few, opportunities.  The other is that the educational standards of those applying for the few jobs there are are far in excess of those needed for the jobs.</P>
    <P>We had a report of a National Manpower survey on last year's school leavers.  Some figures are available from it.  Some of them, with good justification, are being questioned very critically as to their accuracy.  According to this survey 27,979 young people out of a total of 53,019 got their first job last year.  This figure represents a very serious situation because in addition to those left to seek employment from 1974, there were approximately 28,000 young people looking for employment or alternatively returning to school.  Many of the 27,979 mentioned are in stop-gap jobs to which they would not aspire and which are probably disappointing in view of the sacrifices made by their parents and by themselves to achieve a certain standard of education.  A good example of this was the recent chaotic situation that existed in regard to the bank applications when about 20,000 young people applied for a very small number of jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government should be concerning themselves with the realities of that and the effects of the few opportunities these people have.  This problem of people looking for work in these circumstances has become a major political issue.  I am not here to make a political football of it, I am here to highlight it for this Government and to appeal to them to be positive.  At a later stage I will suggest a positive approach which we in <Col N="1293" /> Fianna Fáil would take to improve the situation and it would certainly be much better than the little that is being done a present.  This situation could become a veritable time bomb in the future because of the frustration and disappointment of these young people and the activities to which this Government are driving them.  Many of those 20,000 young people seeking bank jobs will be really disappointed as they will not be successful.  They cannot be successful, only a small percentage of them can be employed.</P>
    <P>Many young people are marking time in jobs which are frustrating, where their true potential is not exploited and where unfortunately they are often exploited because there is a queue waiting to take their jobs should they complain.  These are the realities of the situation.  We are told by the National Manpower survey that 7 per cent of school leavers have not made a start to their working lives. Like many of the learned people who have already questioned this figure I would question it very critically and from my experience in my area I would say the figure of 7 per cent is very small and absolutely incorrect. As well as that we have a sizeable number who have returned to school not to continue an education programme but simply to kill time or hopefully to advance studies further, with no aim in view but merely because they cannot get employment. The approach to the reschooling of these young people should be entirely different; it should be constructively designed to teach them disciplines of working life.  In other words, these should be an extension of all our training programmes.  The Government must make some realistic attempt to provide jobs for these young people. If they are, as they claim, committed to a welfare state&mdash;although that seems to have changed this weekend when one of the Ministers was thinking out loud-they must extend unemployment assistance to all people over the age of 15 years who are not going to school and who are unemployed. This is not feasible or practicable because already we are paying out £1 million or more a week on <Col N="1294" /> unemployment assistance and benefits. The only solution is a realistic attempt to provide jobs for these young people. It has not yet come home to us fully that we have this problem.  It certainly has not come home to the Government.</P>
    <P>Our young people want to work and live at home.  This is the aim of the majority and any job creation programme must be seen in the context of decentralisation.  Anyone who doubts my statement need only drive on any of the roads on a Friday evening to see numbers of young people who work in Dublin hitch-hiking their way home.  They work here for a week but their interests and their wish is to return home.  Dublin has become a big impersonal city, a lonely place which creates serious social problems for many of them, therefore decentralisation of jobs is important.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the problem of people returning to school for an extra year.  They return at two levels mainly. We are given a figure of 8 per cent by this manpower survey of last year but one must doubt very seriously that survey in addition to doubting that 8 per cent.  We have a reluctance by this Government to have any statistical information available. Statistical information is vital if we are to tackle this problem.  We did not have a census, it was postponed, and only God knows when we will have a census, but we had a national manpower survey that gives us certain figures, more than a year later, in relation to the previous year's school leavers.  That is not enough.  If we are serious in getting such a survey we must accept that we alone of the European countries are in this category.</P>
    <P>I said before that in a survey of the ECC countries we were shown to have 1 per cent unemployment under 25 years.  We were not shown at all in the next survey, simply because everybody realised there was no serious effort by the Government to get a correct survey.  The figure of 1 per cent was so nonsensical that it would have been stupid to include an Irish figure so far from the truth. If a problem is not analysed, it cannot <Col N="1295" /> be solved.  We have often heard in the past from some Ministers opposite that to solve any problem you must first identify that problem. At the moment the basic problem is that we have no idea of the up-to-date situation regarding our school leavers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the return to school for an extra year, young people go back at intermediate certificate or group certificate level because they have failed to get an apprenticeship. They go back at leaving certificate level because they fail to get a job and they cannot, for financial or other reasons, go on to a third level course.  The structure of that school year should be arranged to include some sort of work experience programme where the students would learn the disciplines I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>There are several levels on which we must face our unemployment problems.  There is, in fact, an EEC requirement that each member country should keep figures of employment in the 15 to 25 age group.  We are failing to fulfil that requirement.  I have instanced already the totally incorrect figures given last year.  The National Manpower Service should be extended to compile the up-to-date information we need.  It would serve two purposes. It would give us the statistics we need as a nation.  There is no point in Ministers going to Europe, to the new Commissioner or to somebody else, without proper statistics.  It is like going to a bank manager and telling him you want money and having no idea why you want it.  We have no business going to Europe without an up-to-date survey of young people needing employment and the different levels of employment reached.  The money is there and I hope we will be able to get as much money from the new Commissioner for Social Affairs as we have over the past four years.  Unless our case is prepared, we certainly will not.</P>
    <P>The second benefit would be the creation of extra jobs in the Manpower Service.  At a time when there are so many young people unemployed, <Col N="1296" /> would it not be wonderful to give these articulate school leavers the opportunity of employment, even on a temporary basis, in compiling the necessary statistics?  I referred earlier to the census.  This Government have absolutely no interest in giving statistical information even to Members of the House.</P>
    <P>I was treated with contempt in this House last week, and I resent it.  My subsequent efforts to get figures omitted from a reply by the Minister for Labour have not yet been successful. I refer to Question No. 35 on 3rd November, 1976.  In his reply the Minister promised to give me information in a tabular statement.  According to the heading above the table, that statement should have contained two lists of figures, one for 1st October, 1976, and one for 3rd October, 1975. It did not do so.  Is it that the Minister was ashamed to have those figures announced, or did he want to withhold them from me, the spokesman appointed for the time being to shadow him in this House?  That conduct by any Minister is a disgrace and it is in contempt of the House.  Those figures are important because they refer to the number of people registered on 3rd October last year and 1st October this year in the various manpower offices.  I agree they could not be related to unemployment because there would be job changers in that group, as well, but at least they would give an indication of the impossible task facing the manpower service.</P>
    <P>I see the solution in the short term and in the long term.  As a short term measure to alleviate immediate hardship we must devise practical ways by which young people can be helped over the winter months.  These initiatives must be under several headings. We must make incentives available to companies to provide productive employment for young people in proportion to the size of their work force.  At the moment many employers are under-employed.  There is a growing tendency to reallocate work when a job becomes vacant.  This is particularly true in many office type jobs. From the employer's point of view it can be argued that present legislation <Col N="1297" /> is anti-employment.  There are heavy welfare payments, pay-related contributions. AnCO levies, redundancy payments, employers liability, insurance premiums, all necessary in themselves, but they are loaded at this stage against the employment of young persons in particular.</P>
    <P>We should launch a national campaign to give jobs to youths, or something of that nature.  Let us launch it on a national basis.  Let us encourage the employer in a choice of ways.  Let us assist him by reducing the cost of the social welfare stamp.  Let us extend the scope of the premium employment programme.  It has been proved after 18 months in operation that the narrow guidelines laid down by the Minister for that scheme in summer, 1975, were so confined that his initial target of 10,000 jobs in 12 months has not been reached, or anywhere near it. Even after 18 months we are still short by more than 4,000 jobs of the target set.  We could hope to reach that target if the scheme were extended to assist school leavers.  The subject is so vast that I could speak about it all night.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the short term in a moment.  In the longer term the first essential is to survey the problem as it exists.  At the moment, there is no organisation which can forecast what the trends in employment will be.  It is time for the IDA and AnCO to get together and to issue some broad directives as to how employment trends will develop.  Perhaps we need a new IDA on a more regional basis with more power given to the different regional groups.  I am not reflecting in any way on the IDA.  They have done a lot of good.  I should like to see a more regional approach to the IDA with very close co-operation and liaison with AnCO and the National Manpower Service, with the National Manpower Service feeding in the information necessary and AnCO and the IDA combining to project the employment pattern or the employment trends.</P>
    <P>I am afraid our educational system is becoming more and more geared to the minority under this Government. The opportunities are probably becoming more available for the third <Col N="1298" /> level student, but only for a very small number of them.  The masses are being neglected; the minority alone are being catered for.  If the Government are serious, it is long time past for action.  They must act now or it will be too late.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Labour is not here, because I want to draw attention to another of his schemes or targets which is not being realised by him.  Referring to the Community Youth Projects, which had been initiated in Europe as long ago as early 1975, again under the sponsorship of the Commissioner for Social Affairs, the Minister said at column 598, Volume 290, of the Official Report of 4th May last:</P>
    <P>About 50 projects have been proposed and it is our objective to get 1,000 young people into employment as a result of the community youth training programme.</P>
    <P>At column 599 he said:</P>
    <P>I hope to see something like 1,000 young people employed by means of this programme during the year.</P>
    <P>In this House last week he told us the figure was 332; we can accept that it is between 300 and 330.  In other words, he has achieved only about 30 per cent of a target set by himself in May.  That is another proof of absolute failure by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Our party, responsible as always, when this Government were creating national emergencies that did not exist at all, were positive enough to still have their sights set on the real emergency that exists and did exist on 31 August and the subsequent weeks. As a result, an economic document was produced, a document that contained&mdash;and I am referring only to young persons' employment&mdash;a proposal that £20 million of the £100 million being allocated for job creation would be set aside to provide at least 5,000 new jobs in the under-25 age group.</P>
    <P>If any impact is to be made in stimulating employment the lead must be given by the State, by the semi-State bodies, by the local authorities <Col N="1299" /> and by large public companies.  What do we see in any areas we examine? We see all the temporary officers in the civil service being laid off, or very many of them.  We see local authorities having redundancies, despite the tremendous amount of work to be done by them.  We have these redundancies because of the major cutback in our Road Fund grant allocations. In every county you see major road works started and not completed.  I worked for the county council as a young clerk in an engineer's office and I can tell the House a good story.  In 1956, during the time of the last Coalition Government, a particular road job was opened, and the allocations we got for continuing work on that road improvement job were enough to keep the lamps lighting during the following winter.  There is the same situation now.</P>
    <P>In the present climate of high unemployment, a policy of non-recruitment by the State bodies should not be tolerated.  At the same time as an overall emergency employment policy is being pursued, a special aid programme to help the young people must be undertaken, and, as I said, we would propose direct incentive to companies in the private sector.  As well as that, there is no reason why the scheme which has been 30 per cent successful under the aegis of the Minister for Labour should not be 100 per cent or almost 100 per cent successful through the development of community task forces.  Furthermore, there should be an extension of the AnCO apprenticeship scheme to coincide with the industrial expansion outlined in the economic policy document of our party, so that a trained work force will be available in the occupations in which they will be needed.</P>
    <P>I do not always rely on Press reports, but I saw one recently&mdash;and I am sorry I cannot quote the newspaper &mdash;about the concern among the management of NET regarding adequate staff with sufficient expertise not being available for the new project at Marina Point.  I cannot say whether that is true or not, but I would hate to think that we could not recruit enough staff within our own country.  It is still a <Col N="1300" /> year or two away and in that time there is no reason why many of our people could not be trained to take their places at management level in that concern.</P>
    <P>We have also suggested the encouragement of early retirement on a voluntary basis and subsidising that early retirement in order to make room at the lower levels.  If half our population are under 25, the consequences are alarming if we have not the courage and the leadership to take this kind of positive action.  I also referred to the introduction of the transitional year in schools, the year in which young people can be made fit for the work pace.  As well as that, young workers starting on a new career, should also be encouraged by his or her employer to continue to study.  It is essential for the personal development of the individual, that an attitude of striving to improve his position be created in the work force. In the long term the aim should be to encourage mobility, the rotation of duties and so on.</P>
    <P>At this point mobility is important, the decentralisation, the creation of industry and the creation of jobs as near as possible to the home base. Career guidance is also essential.</P>
    <P>The failure of this Government in all these aspects is something they can never get away from.  The projects they have initiated have not been well thought out.  There is room for improvement in them and many others on which they could embark if they were only led by somebody who would tell them to do it.  Unless we do this, we are facing the type of Ireland that maybe some of these people would like to see, where there are discontented young people.  In my opinion our young Irish people are the best people in the world and are deserving of the best support from any Government.  I do not want such tripe as was dished up by some of the Ministers here last week on the economic debate about emigration. Fianna Fáil's positive approach through the 'sixties stopped emigration.</P>

      <P>First, I want to <Col N="1301" /> clarify a matter about who was in these benches because the motion, which is in extremely general terms, was put down by four Opposition Deputies led by the Opposition spokesman for Education, followed by the Opposition spokesman for Industry and Commerce, then the Opposition spokesman for Labour and a fourth Deputy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald said that to solve any problem we must first set out what it is.  He talked about levels of unemployment without discussing levels of emigration.  The figures for unemployment through the 'fifties and 'sixties fluctuated between a low of 52,000 and a high of 72,000. That was the range of fluctuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in trying to make facts go away by contradictions. What is interesting is that the <Col N="1302" /> present excess of unemployment is a matter of 40,000 or 50,000 people.  In the 20 years from 1951 to 1971 the number of people who left the country was more than half-a-million&mdash;it was 543,000.  Of those 20 years two years and nine months were Coalition and the remainder government by the people in opposition.  In the period 1961 to 1971 the figure is 134,000.  If for any of those years you add the figure of unemployment and the figure of emigration&mdash;let us take the period from the late 'fifties to 1961&mdash;you will find a figure which is very close to the present indigenous figure of unemployment. We are faced with a serious debate that forgets that the problem was solved for decades by the emigrant ship, that forgets suddenly and conveniently that not alone is emigration over but that there is a net inflow, that forgets that the population is growing but expects to be taken seriously on the basis of saying that to solve any problem you must first sort out what it is.  Indeed.  To solve this problem it is necessary to affirm that those figures reflect in our time in Government the ending of emigration, a dramatic rise in population and substantial demographic shifts which have been available to people&mdash;for example, the works of Brendan Walsh.  All those things are summed up in the type of figures we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to talk about the responsibilities of other Ministers who will participate in the debate. Therefore the specific responsibility of the Minister for Labour, or the creation of employment schemes in other ministerial areas are not things I want to touch on.  It is necessary to see the problem of unemployment in general and the problem of unemployment of the young not in terms of the general blanket denunciations of frightfulness or incompetence, not in terms of euphoria or of sweeping it under the carpet, but as it is.  In that context it is valid to look at our pattern of unemployment and how we have been behaving.  We are obviously not dramatically better.  If we are dramatically worse, then there is room for the charges of incompetence and inefficiency, indolence and so on.  If we are somewhere within the spectrum of the <Col N="1303" /> performance of other comparable countries, particularly EEC countries, then there is reason for describing that situation and describing what can be done. Indeed, since the solutions to problems are not alone matters for Government but for national consensus, if there can be a national consensus, then we can do it together.  A Government alone cannot do it.  A Government that cannot convince significant sectors of the population of the real situation cannot bring those sectors with it.</P>
    <P>We hear about the rise in unemployment levels and the blanket denunciations, but there are many ways to measure unemployment.  I am not suggesting that the way I am about to give is the only way or the most important way, but I am suggesting that it is another valid way to look at it when you are making comparisons. The comparison I want to make is a comparison in time between the first quarter of 1974 and the first quarter of 1976, a two-year span.  In the first quarter of 1974 we began to see the beginnings of the influence of the dramatic rise in oil prices but there is always a short time lag with actual loss of jobs.  If you say there was a certain amount of unemployment in each country at the beginning of a period and over, for example, the two years I am offering in this comparison, how much did it go up by in each country?  That is another valid way to look at it.  I quote from the principal economic indicators of the OECD, October, 1976.  In that period it went up in Belgium by 126 per cent, in Denmark by 286 per cent, in France by 112 per cent, in Germany by 115 per cent, in the UK by 104 per cent, in Italy, which was out of phase with the other countries and which was in a recovery phase for some of that time, by 14 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that with Italy pecularily low, Ireland had an increase of 63 per cent, which was <Col N="1304" /> almost identical with the Netherlands and which is at the bottom of the spectrum of increase, apart from Italy.  By that yardstick our performance on increase of unemployment was rather good, not frightful, not out of the general spectrum, but towards the bottom end of the general spectrum.  I talked the last time we debated this sort of subject, which was only a few days ago, about what seemed to me the awful danger of excessive pessimism, an excessively negative sort of approach to what are our real problems.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go into figures for the extent of financial aid from the State to industry.  I gave some figures for that the last time.  I shall not repeat them now but I noted that Deputy Fitzgerald talked about the extra £100 million we heard of recently. Remember it is extra; it is not a £100 million; it is £100 million on top of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am using it because it is an extra.  There is more than £100 million State aid already. What we are asked for is an extra £100 million.  I will be making the argument in a minute as to whether it is prudent to raise the sort of taxation necessary to do that.  I want to talk about the strategy for getting, not just for the young but for everybody, rising employment and jobs for as many people as are employable.  In a sense the young are a separate problem.  In another sense if you do not have a generally healthy economy all that you can do for any particular sector will be at the expense of some other.  I do not have any sectoral responsibility for the young as perhaps a Minister for Education or Minister for Labour might have but I participate in a general responsibility for the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to spend the rest of my time talking about what I see as the strategy for general improvement because, if we can get a national consensus about that, we can do it.  If we do not get it, we cannot.  Before going on to that I want to reiterate one other thought, which is not to express complacency <Col N="1305" /> or satisfaction, because I can assure Deputies there is neither in the Government, but to express a certain sense of pride that the Irish economy has come through such a desperate time so well.  I know people hate figures.  I also know, in fairness, that it is very easy to pick figures in a distorted way and give bogus impressions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The record of the House is available to people and the way in which I use statistics is open to analysis.  If Deputies on the other side would analyse the way in which I have misused or distorted them they would have the proceedings of the Parliament, the plaudits of their party, indeed the pens of the pundits in the newspapers praising them for doing it.  But, until they do that, they do not have the right to the sort of sneer of an imprecise kind they have just made. Let them take me apart logically on the record of the House, if they are able.  I await it because it has not happened up to now, and I use plenty of statistics and will go on doing so.</P>
      <P>The point about which I want to remind people is that in the last year, from the second quarter of 1975 to the second quarter of 1976, we were joint fifth in the OECD league table for percentage increase of industrial production; over the two years 1974 to 1976 we were joint third; and over the years since this Government came into office we were joint fourth out of the OECD countries, not just the Community. That is not shameful.  That is not a bad performance.  It is a good performance.  If we remember the good with the bad we may actually see things as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great thing to be solved to get a satisfactory growth of employment here in the short, medium and long term is the question of inflation.  Inflation is caused by different things at different times.  There are external causes about which this or any other Government can do nothing.  Devaluation of the £ was something to do with the whole of sterling and with an economy much larger than ours&mdash;the <Col N="1306" /> rise in interest rates in London, the rise in world prices, the approximation of EEC food prices to world food prices and the rise in our food prices when we came up to EEC levels.  The latter had some good effects for us. Those were all external&mdash;indeed the food one was beneficial&mdash;but nothing about which we could do anything if we took our decision, as we did, with more than 80 per cent of our people to be part of the Community.</P>
    <P>There are two internal things we can do something about.  One of those is wages and the other is the level of public expenditure.  Those are things within our control.  Those are things through which we can go on creating a better and better environment for industrial investment, or where we can fail to do so.  When I say: &ldquo;Go on creating a better and better environment&rdquo; our record of creating environment for industrial investment and of attracting overseas investment will bear comparison with any country in the world.  It is possible, of course, to sneer but it is not possible to analyse that away. Our record for that is very good.</P>

I said I did not have a sectoral responsibility for youth but, since youth were a part of the general problem for which I had <Col N="1307" /> part responsibility, I was talking about the things which influence the general level of employment here.  Obviously that has a bearing on the young; it is the only bit of bearing on the young that I have a departmental responsibility to talk about.  But it is also obviously fundamental to the question of whether or not there are jobs for young people.  There is no question of irrelevance.</P>

      <P>We have an economy here which is not a <i>laissez faire</i> one. It is not a totally planned economy; it is something in between; it is a mixed economy.  In those circumstances of the mixed economy I seem to find over and over that when people demand things in a simplistic way the immediate satisfaction of those demands would produce the opposite result to the thing they purport to want.  Indeed I think there were evidences of that in what the last speaker, Deputy Fitzgerald, said because precisely by doing the list of things which he said, we would create an environment in regard to a level of taxation, both private and corporate taxation, and we would commit a percentage of the GNP of the country to be gathered and expended by the State which would be profoundly disincentive. For the sake of trying to solve sectoral problems of the young, we would be breaking up the environment in which people want to invest and to create jobs because it has to be reiterated that in our mixed economy the majority of the jobs are created by the private sector.  The most important single influence on job creation <Col N="1308" /> for the young or anybody else is whether you have an environment where people want to invest and where the entrepreneur can flourish.  If you take so much of the gross national product in taxes for redistribution for purposes however laudable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the circumstances of the European Economic Community, which is not just of free trade but of the free movement of goods, of capital and of labour, it is extremely easy not just to produce the absence of growth in industry but to produce a disindustrialisation.  There is some evidence of this happening, for example in the United Kingdom, with a shrinking of the industrial sector. If you get to that stage by creating a taxation environment the industry simply goes elsewhere to a place within the Community where it is more welcome.  Then you have a shrinking number of jobs, shrinking consumption and, of course, a shrinking tax base and less to spend on all the laudable schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to get into a confused situation about what is productive and <Col N="1309" /> what is non-productive.  A music teacher or a home assistance officer is obviously productive in any human sense.  We have to remember that the environment which produces products that can be exported and sold in competition with the products of other countries is the key to jobs for the young or jobs for anybody else.  That is the core of it.  The distinction between home and overseas markets is now meaningless because if we cannot export we cannot defend the home market.  What we are talking about, if we are really concerned with the young, is not more percentage of GNP taken by the State to be given back in more or less efficient ways, but of less percentage of GNP being taken by the State, less taxation, private and corporate, and creating an environment where people, indigenously or from other parts of the world, will come because it is a good place to invest and produce things.</P>
    <P>That is the key to solving the problem of the young, not by saying: &ldquo;Another £100 million&rdquo;.  What is so funny about the Opposition in their economic policy is when we were deep in recession and the curve was going down and we were saying: &ldquo;Now is the time to go into deficit, to borrow to cushion people against the destruction of their ordinary life&rdquo; then we were wrong to borrow.  It turned around in a world scale and then we said: &ldquo;Now you cannot go on borrowing, now you have to toughen because now we have the export lead growth that will really create the jobs&rdquo;, and suddenly the Opposition said: &ldquo;No, we were wrong to criticise you before.  Now we think you should spend another £100 million&rdquo;. They were wrong the first time when the curve was going down.  Then they got their timing wrong when the curve turned around and started to rise.</P>

      <P>The key is the creation of an environment.  If the people say, through the whole economy, that they want it now, that is the guarantee that we will not have it now.  In fact, <Col N="1310" /> we will not have it at all.  Why is it suddenly automatic that every year people must have more?  The people in 1800 were no better off in terms of real consumption than the people in 2000 BC.  They had enough to keep body and soul together and keep the cold out, but no more.  It was not much better in the year 1900.  Twenty years ago, when people were out of work, their families broke up, their children could not go to school.  They were cold and were actually less nourished in brain and body because there was not enough food.  That is not happening any more.  We have to convince people &mdash;the &ldquo;we&rdquo; are Government and Opposition and those we have to convince are the different sections of the community, the different social partners &mdash;that we can only get richer by producing more.  We all want the same things because none of us really wants to see the young out of work.  We are programmed as human beings, whether we are straight or crooked, whether we are clever or stupid, as parents and as members of the human race to wish well to the young.  We may differ about the best way to do that.</P>
      <P>The best way to do it for the young is to get growth in the economy. Growth solves everything.  If we get growth we will have more to give to every section, more for education, more for people to stay longer without working if they do not wish to work, more for training for work.  The crucial thing is to create the conditions of growth, not instantly because there is no way to do it instantly, where this is a place where all sorts of jobs, but primarily industrial jobs, can be found because you cannot carry more service jobs, which we want, without productive employment in industry and agriculture. The crucial thing is not to say &ldquo;another £100 million&rdquo;.  I will not go through the list of things which Deputy Fitzgerald said.  He said plenty of things that would cost a lot more money.  Where does that come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was right to go on increasing the percentage of GNP and to go on increasing the deficit when we were going down in the slump.  It is not right to go on doing it when the world is coming out and when our exports are <Col N="1311" /> performing very well.  Now we have to do the opposite.  We have to say to people: &ldquo;Do not ask for it in the title of the book &lsquo;I Want it Now&rsquo;.  Do not say we all want it.  Do not say we want more and more social consumption&rdquo;. I am sure there is consensus in the House about more for education, social welfare and health.  We all want that but we differ about how you get it.  If you insist on having it now you do not get it at all because you deindustrialise and because the industries go to other places.</P>
    <P>There are policies appropriate for the time and what was appropriate for two years ago is not appropriate for now. There is a different environment.  Our industrial exports are doing very well. We have to go on making this a more and more attractive place.  We will have jobs for everybody.  We will not solve the problem of jobs for the young separately.  We will not solve them by transfers from other sections of the community.  That does not do it.  You solve the problems of employment as a whole by creating the sort of environment I have spoken about. If I am finding any consensus then I believe the community ought to do certain things.  Sometimes the Opposition are serious and sometimes they are not.  I hope they are in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I hope, first, that the Opposition will admit that the genuine use of honest figures shows that the situation is neither brilliant nor terrible but is something in between, with some things to be ashamed of and some things to be proud of.  It is in the middle.  That is the way it is.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was not here earlier.  I suggest the Deputy reads the text in the Official Report.  We ought to agree what the dangers are now.  I list among the dangers now the following.  First, there is undue pessimism, because it is self-fulfilling prophesy.  Secondly, labour unrest.  If people want a bigger and bigger share of the cake that is self-destructive. Thirdly, that wage rises in both the <Col N="1312" /> public and private sectors go up by more than production and productivity. Fourthly, that increasing public expenditure in the areas of public consumption takes a larger and larger percentage of GNP.  Fifthly, that this inevitably increases taxation, both in the public and private sectors, direct and indirect taxation.  That is disincentive for individuals and for companies. Finally, inflation due to wage rises and to levels of public expenditure we cannot control.  Those seem to me to be the dangers.  If we can agree on those dangers, if we can get some consensus inside the House and then some consensus inside the country of all the people who listen to us we can deal with every one of them.  If we deal with every one of them we can look after the unemployment of the young as well as among every other section.  If we cannot deal with them we cannot solve unemployment, good or bad, for young or old.</P>

I agree, but I wonder what our hundreds of thousands of young people who will read the Minister's remarks in the daily papers tomorrow will think.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to create a condition of growth?&rdquo; That is the question young people will be asking the Minister tomorrow morning.  In my contribution to the budget debate on 12th February this year, I said, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 287 column 1976:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, and I suppose to many other Irish people, this budget has projected a vivid picture of a Government in complete disarray. The measures introduced were in a panic situation.  No proper assessment was made of the present situation of our economy.  The <Col N="1313" /> approach made to rectify the state of our economy was disastrous.</P>
    <P>The announcement made over the weekend by the Minister for Finance proves my point in this matter.  We can now see the fruits of that and the previous budget introduced by this Government.  One of the most disappointing aspects of the Government is their failure to provide employment for our young people.  The Minister was quoting statistics and I would like him to look at one statistic published by the president of the University Students' Union.  He was talking about a figure of something in the region of 160,000 to 180,000 young people.  I would ask the Minister, because statistical information is not available to anyone now because we had no census, to look at the thousands of young people who over the past three years completed their leaving certificate, came on the labour field, found there was no employment for them and then rushed back into school both day and night school.  It would be interesting to know, because they are not registered at labour exchanges and so forth, the number of young people between the ages of 18 and 25 who are unemployed and presently sitting in classrooms who would love to be in employment.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to examine the areas where the potential of employment lies must be deplored. I mentioned here last year one area where definite potential lies, and that is in the development of the Cork regional development harbour plan. Here is a definite prospect of employment for at least 200 people at the outset of that development with the further definite prospect of at least 20,000 new jobs by 1990, and that would cost the State about £9 million. When we see the money that is being vested in non-productive purposes it is time to hang our heads in shame. This is a regional development with tremendous job opportunities for our young people, and that applies to all harbours throughout the country.  I am sure I do not have to inform the Minister that port-related industries are the fastest-growing industry sectors in the world.  Surely then it should <Col N="1314" /> be the concern of the Government to attract such industry.</P>
    <P>I can say without fear of contradiction that the Government have completely failed in their obligations towards the welfare of our young people.  A directive was issued to health boards and local authorities and to the civil service to stall the recruitment of personnel.  This was a severe blow to thousands of school leavers who were seeking employment with them.  I do not think that any Members of the House who are members of local authorities and health boards will deny this.  Here again this was a tremendous area of employment for our young people.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Fitzgerald dealt with some aspects of AnCO, and for very good reasons.  The Government have failed to give the necessary consideration in the area of AnCO development. Here great potential lies in the training of our young people, especially in the technological field.  The main objective of AnCO, which was set up by a Fianna Fáil Government, is to help individuals to develop themselves and to improve their job prospects and to provide trained workers for expanding industries.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is sitting in tonight for the Minister for Labour, to give, with the Minister for Labour, very serious consideration to AnCO.  The money invested in AnCO was worthwhile but unfortunately not sufficient money was given to develop all the potential that existed there.  I make a very special appeal again to the Minister and to his colleague the Minister for Labour to examine all the potential of this great organisation.</P>
    <P>One great industry which has been allowed to run down is the building industry.  It is one of our greatest areas of employment and caters for a large number of apprentices.  Here again the Government have failed in this potential.  I am trying to be as constructive as possible because we should be looking at the areas where employment lies.  It is sad that this has been neglected.  Young people all over the country are talking of the areas that I am talking about.  What <Col N="1315" /> is the answer?  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce quoting statistics of things of that kind and yet not talking of one potential of areas of employment.  The Government cannot continue to ignore the great resource a nation has in its young people.  Surely a Government must be aware of the tremendous frustrations building up in our young people because of the appalling lack of job opportunities which leads them to get involved in many anti-social activities.  On behalf of young people I appeal to the Government to introduce immediately a crash programme to provide employment for them.  We can introduce crash programmes for many sectors but this is the most urgent one.</P>
    <P>I recall in 1973 that Government spokesmen went round the country urging people to mobilise all their resources and to prepare for new industries in an effort to anticipate the improved economic conditions in the European markets in the next few years.  Two years ago statements of that kind were made by Ministers of this Government.</P>
    <P>What has been done?  Can we see any expansion in any of our industries at the moment?  If one contacts an employer in an effort to obtain employment for a young person more than likely he will tell one that the firm is considering redundancy rather than recruitment.  Ask any young people outside the doors of this House and they will tell one the reply they are getting.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is fully aware that in the Southern Health Board where there were approximately 40 vacancies for trainee nurses about 5,000 girls from all over the country applied for the posts.  It is difficult to have to tell young people that they must just hope for the best and that prospects may improve.  Above all, they must be told not to do anything that may jeopardise their future.  I have said that on many occasions because I know we are on the threshold of something that may be considered later a terrible tragedy in Irish history.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see Irish Minister going <Col N="1316" /> round the world with their hats in their hands begging for money to pay our unemployed.  We should be creating incentives for young people, we should be developing our resources and providing the necessary facilities to attract industrialists but, at all times, we should be in a position to dictate the terms to those wishing to set up industries.  That should be the aim of any Irish Government.  It must be admitted we have failed in the area of employment.</P>
    <P>Independence is a great thing but what kind of independence have young people?  In order to offset the lack of employment the Government introduced the dole.  It would be interesting to know how many young people are getting unemployment assistance and it would also be interesting to know how many of them have had to undergo a means test. What kind of independence have young girls?  What return can they give to their parents and families who have made tremendous sacrifices to educate them?  I hope that before the term of office of this Government comes to an end at least they will try to tell the young people what they were attempting to do.  A Minister spoke here tonight but he did not deal with one area that could create one single job.  Instead, he tried to confuse the public with statistical information that could be very easily twisted.  All of us know that this kind of data can be twisted anyway to suit the occasion and personally I do not believe in all the statistics that have been quoted.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with what our spokesman on Labour said about the private sector.  All the time the Government are issuing statements and sending out feelers to the public.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary is smiling at that. I smiled last Sunday also but my conclusion and that of many people is this: How far removed must the Government be from the people that they have to go on radio and make certain statements in the hope of getting a feedback from the public?  It is a reflection on the Minister concerned, on every member of the Government and on every member of the back benches when this has to happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> One could become very emotional when dealing with young people.  Unless the Government are prepared to introduce a crash programme to give some confidence to our youth they will <Col N="1318" /> have to take full responsibility for what happens.</P>

      <P>The claim for retirement pension by the person concerned was not rejected at any time on any grounds.  The circumstances are that on 4th June, 1976, a letter was received in my Department from the person concerned, indicating that he was receiving invalidity pension, that he had reached age 65 and that he qualified for retirement pension. He had not, however, at the time submitted a claim for retirement pension but a claim form to enable him to do so was then issued to him.  The claim form was received back, unsigned, on 2nd July, 1976, and was returned to the claimant for his signature.  He was asked at the same time to forward a birth certificate in respect of his wife. This is a normal requirement in retirement pension claims as, unlike invalidity pension, the rate of increase of retirement pension payable in respect of a wife is determined by her age.  The claim form was again received back on 27th July, 1976, together with a letter from the claimant in which he stated that his wife's birth certificate had been mislaid but that inquiries were being made with a view to getting another one and that he would forward it as soon as he received it.  The certificate has not been received to date.  The claimant, however, has been awarded retirement pension from 6th May, 1976, including increase of pension in respect of his wife and his two qualified children. The increase awarded in respect of his wife is at the rate payable in the case of a wife who has not reached age 67.  Payment of invalidity pension to him will terminate on 10th November and payment of retirement pension will commence on 11th November, 1976.</P>

These include an undertaking not to disclose information regarding a grant approval until the publication of the annual report of the year in which the first grant payment is made.  I regret, therefore, that I cannot provide the information requested at this time.</P>
