    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O.J. Flanagan) Oliver J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O. J. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of this most desirable and very necessary legislation being debated in the House, it gives Deputies an opportunity to express their appreciation and profound admiration for the outstanding work undertaken by the Army and by the Garda Síochána.  This country would be in a very sad plight today were it not for the sincerity and devotion to duty of members of the Garda Síochána. It is noteworthy that recently the Minister for Justice has very wisely undertaken to have the strength of the Garda force increased and the Minister for Defence has increased substantially the Army personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any citizen could not show a greater sense of duty or loyalty to the State than to become a member of our Defence Forces.  Every single member of the Garda Síochána and the Army has rendered outstanding service to our country and this service has been given unselfishly to every Government <Col N="548" /> since the foundation of the State.  In particular, the Army have been inspired by the devotion and loyalty of their founder to our country and both they and the Garda Síochána have displayed outstanding qualities.  It is right in the case of an emergency such as we now have that we should solicit the active co-operation and the fullest support of our well-trained Army.</P>
    <P>The people of the country are indebted to the Minister for Justice for the steps he has taken to increase the Garda force.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity for the proper implementation of the provisions of the measure now before the House.  He should mention in consultation with the Garda Commissioner the necessity in urban and rural areas of reintroducing foot patrols by members of the Garda Síochána.  He might also discuss with the Minister for Defence the possibility of having night duty undertaken by members of the Army where this might be considered desirable.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, at a time when we could be enjoying economic recovery as well as enjoying and availing of the many facilities available here, that the time of this House should have to be taken up in dealing with measures of this kind.  It is even more regrettable that a figure in the region of £160 million has to be spent on efforts to maintain the security of the State when we consider what could be done with that money in the matter of hospitals, housing, tourism and in the building up and strengthening of our economy.  Those who know of the vast amounts that must be spent on the security of the State have a deep sense of regret because they realise that in other circumstances this money could be used to develop our economy.</P>
    <P>We owe a debt of gratitude to the much criticised personnel in our prison service.  Many of these people live in my constituency; I know them to be conscientious, extremely reasonable people, who are highly trained in the discharge of their duties.  All of us here have a duty to express our thanks and appreciation to those who have given loyal service in the Army, the Garda Síochána and in the prison and other services.  We should express our appreciation for their efforts to maintain <Col N="549" /> law, order and the proper rules of society.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, there is no need for any section to fear the provisions of this Bill.  As a result of the debate yesterday the press must be reinforced in the knowledge that they have nothing to fear in this Bill so far as curbing their activities are concerned provided that they use sound judgment, discretion and common sense. Our journalists have an abundance of intelligence.  They are highly competent.</P>
    <P>Regarding the questions that have been raised in relation to a restriction of the activities of the press, there is no need for any responsible press to fear the provisions of this Bill but in the circumstances in which we live it is necessary that caution be exercised so as to ensure that no action on the part of the press is contrary to the wishes of this House.  This House is the supreme authority.  If ever we should allow organisations, movements or assemblies to attempt to undermine this authority, we should be permitting a serious blow to democracy.</P>
    <P>Among the various provisions of the Bill is one giving extended powers to the Garda in investigation of the types of offences described by the Minister for Justice.  What objection can the Opposition or can any sane citizen have to such provision?  The power to search persons and vehicles will be given to gardaí on foot of a warrant issued by a superintendent.  This in itself is a safeguard.  The Opposition might have grounds for complaint if a warrant of this kind could be issued by any member of the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A warrant could be issued by a sergeant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  A sergeant could direct the execution of a search but the warrant would have to be issued by a superintendent.  However, as there is some confusion in this regard I shall deal with the matter when I am replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I interpret the Bill correctly I understand that the warrant for a search of persons or vehicles must be issued by a superintendent.  We are all aware of <Col N="550" /> the very high calibre of superintendents in our police force.  These are men of wide experience and of the highest standard of integrity who will not issue warrants recklessly for the searching of persons or vehicles. We make take it that they will issue such warrants only where they have grounds for so doing.  Extended powers are being given, too, to the Garda in respect of persons in custody.  This is a most desirable provision.  In the interest not only of the security of the State but of the preservation of life and limb and also of property it is right that persons suspected of offences in these areas be detained and questioned. Consequently I see no reason for any Member of the House questioning this provision.</P>
      <P>Another very important provision is that which relates to the establishing of identity.  The legislation will instil much confidence in the ordinary peace-loving and peaceful people who wish to go about their daily business without fear or hindrance.  The Government have not taken these powers lightly.  It must go out loud and clear from this House that every Member here wishes for peace, co-operation and a speedy return to normal conditions. We are all dedicated to the principle of the preservation of peace and of respect for lawful authority.  By our example individually we should set a very high standard in relation to respect for the authority of the State. Laws enacted by a majority should have the support of every Member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to increase substantially the penalties in respect of various offences under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It is wise and right that there is special reference to kidnapping in this regard.  Every citizen, be he rich or poor, has a right to freedom.  No group, be they organised or disorganised have any right to deprive others of their freedom.  Another offence included in the same section is the hijacking of vehicles&mdash;an activity which can cause much inconvenience to citizens.  There have been many cases in which cars <Col N="551" /> were taken from law-abiding citizens leaving them stranded on the roadside. We must ensure that hijacking and false imprisonment is as far as possible eliminated from our society. These offences are foreign to us.  I trust that people who engage in such crimes will think again about what they are doing and will realise the disservice they are rendering to the community.  I wonder if they would be prepared to put themselves in the position of their victims so that they might realise the seriousness of their crimes.  The penalties in this area are not unreasonable when one considers the seriousness of the crimes.</P>
    <P>Steps must be taken to ensure that anyone who obstructs any branch of the State in the discharge of its functions is dealt with.  This legislation fulfils that purpose.</P>
    <P>We deplore all those who are associated with violence in any form and we shall ensure that the perpetrators of these acts are dealt with adequately by our courts.  The many Deputies who have spoken during this debate have endeavoured to plug any gaps there may be in the range of activities which constitutes very serious offences.  This legislation is welcomed by almost 100 per cent of the public.</P>
    <P>Deputies have already referred to the recruiting of persons into unlawful organisations, to the giving of assistance to an escaped prisoner to evade recapture, injuring persons or damaging property in prisons, smuggling material in and out of prisons and the unauthorised possession by prisoners of photographs, maps, sketches of prisons, Garda stations, courthouses and so on.  No law-abiding citizen need fear legislation of this kind.  The vast majority of citizens are law abiding and appreciate the steps the Minister for Justice and the Government are taking in their interests.</P>
    <P>Section 3, which creates a new offence, has been a source of worry and anxiety to those engaged in the printing and newspaper business. The section is intended to deal with the situation where a person expressly or by implication, directly <Col N="552" /> or through another person or persons, or by advertisement, propaganda or by any other means incites or invites another person or persons to join an unlawful organisation.  This provision is necessary to ensure that those in high places will not act recklessly. From our own experience both outside and as Members of this House, we know that many people in high places, particularly in editorial chairs, have acted recklessly in the past.  We hope that with the passing of this Bill there will be more caution and care exercised.  I do not say they have acted in an irresponsible manner deliberately. It may have been from lack of thought, from the lack of proper advice or from lack of full understanding of all the facts, but nevertheless they have conveyed to the reading public a different impression perhaps than that which was their intention.  I hope that as a result of thorough investigation, proper inquiries and the seeking of proper legal advice and with the use of this measure as a guideline, those involved will be enabled to bring healthy reading material to the public, food for thought that can in no way be described as leading to disorder, revolution or violence.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed that this section is too widely drawn. I do not think so.  I believe the Minister for Justice has sound reasons for introducing this provision, as Members of this House who take note and keep records of news items and articles in the newspapers can testify.  I must have tens of thousands of Press cuttings over the past 30 years; I specialise in them.  I believe there is every justification for this provision and that the fears expressed about this section must be completely rejected in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Naturally enough, no support whatever can be given to the activities of any unlawful organisation or splinter groups of any of the existing organisations, that is to say, any organisations that seeks to bring about alterations in our Constitution or to achieve any other aim by force.  The only lawful <Col N="553" /> way in which alterations of the Constitution can be implemented is by the votes of the people.  May that be long so.  It is the duty of this House to preserve and strengthen the respect of the people for the ballot box and for majority rule.</P>
    <P>Again many of our leading writers express anxiety about section 15, which proposes to confer on the Defence Forces power of arrest and search.  There would be no need at all for this section in normal times, but it is necessary in present circumstances. It gives power to members of the Defence Forces to arrest and search in carefully defined circumstances. Members of this House and the general public should take note of &ldquo;carefully defined circumstances&rdquo;, because it is not in every case we are going to have the Army, only in cases in which it is necessary for the preservation of the institutions of the State.  Again it should be noted that there is no intention to alter the basic role of the Defence Forces in security.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Defence Forces, who have been there since the foundation of the State, is to maintain security.  During the 1939-45 emergency they defended this State against possible invaders from abroad, no matter from which sources.  Today their duty is to safeguard our citizens, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, from the enemy within our shores.  There is now a serious threat to our way of life, to the Government and our State institutions, a threat against the maintenance of majority rule through the ballot box, and it has become necessary to call in the Army to defend these.  We had a threat to the maintenance of our neutrality in 1939 and now we have a similar threat to our institutions and the Defence Forces have a very important role to play.  Already we have seen them guarding our post offices and now they are to be available to co-operate with the Garda to guard against serious crime.  They will not be called in except at the request of a senior Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent.  They will act only <Col N="554" /> when on duty and in uniform, which is a most important consideration. They will have power to arrest and to detain for not longer than six hours.  Surely, it is logical that if a person has not been cleared of suspicion after that period, the cap of suspicion fits him?</P>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation is not only to arrest and detain but also to prevent serious crime.  Henceforth the Army and Garda will be playing a greater role in the prevention of crime. During the reign of the past Government a number of small Garda stations throughout the country were shut down and they have been replaced by patrol cars.  They have not the same effect in crime prevention as a resident garda would and I submit that there is more crime in rural Ireland as a consequence.  Most of it has no political significance.  Raiders come in and beat up old people in the hope of getting a few pounds on a shelf of the dresser.  I suggest most of this would have been prevented if our rural Garda stations had been kept open.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach, inside and outside the House, and the Minister for Justice have explained that the purpose of this legislation is to make the maximum use of our security forces in the control of the activities of those who disrespect the law.  These powers can be particularly useful in the detection or the prevention of major crime such as murder, and from that point of view all Members of the House should be ready to welcome it.  Murder is the most serious of offences.  Murder deprives a wife of her husband, a family of their father, a father of the mother of his family, parents of a son or daughter.  God is the giver and the taker of life.  Murder is a capital crime in respect of which every citizen has a duty to give the fullest co-operation to the security forces.  Here we are providing that the full resources of the State will be used to prevent and to detect any form of terrorism by any section of terrorists.</P>
    <P>There is no cause for any fear of this legislation because it is aimed at safeguarding our citizens and eliminating fear from our society.  It is impossible completely to eliminate crime <Col N="555" /> from society.  We must educate our people to ways of peace and try to change what is in the hearts of those engaged in terrorism and violence. Unless this is done violence cannot be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The women of this and other cities who have organised peace marches deserve the congratulations of everybody in this House.  They have displayed unity in their demands for peace and justice so that we can all live together in peace.  This is a small country but there is room for everyone. Instead of being prepared to die in the name of Ireland, would it not be better to work for Ireland and try to help our neighbours and those in need?</P>
    <P>I do not understand why those engaged in planning or encouraging violence do not stop to realise that they are on this earth for a very short time. When they die they are facing eternity &mdash;a period the mind cannot imagine. Instead of devoting their talents and energies to destruction, violence and crime, it would be better if those people turned their undoubted talents towards building up this country. Many of them have their parts to play in building up this country if they could only realise the foolish dream world in which they are living.  Every body must be willing to play his part in this competitive world.  It is regrettable that this cannot be done cheerfully.</P>
    <P>I join with the other appeals to those engaged in violence to make a constructive contribution towards building up this country and towards strengthening Parliament and the Government at national and local levels.  There is no room for division or violence.  Under the Taoiseach's Government let there be no doubt in anybody's mind that the preservation of the security of this State is dear to the members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  The only way this can be changed is through the ballot box and from the benches of this House.</P>
    <P>This Government are pledged to ensure that every citizen will have the protection of the State, that his property and way of life will be safeguarded. <Col N="556" /> The measures sought in this Bill are an encouragement to all the people that the laws will be maintained. I hope the important features of this Bill will encourage those at whom this legislation is directed to reconsider their attitudes.</P>
    <P>In my contribution I have tried to show the importance of this legislation and to assure everybody that the Government are determined that every citizen can go about his business without fear or hindrance and that the full force of the authority of the State will be behind him to ensure that this will and can be done.  If that cannot be done it means we are living in a state of fear and chaos.  The forces of the country should be mobilised to ensure that the laws of the land are obeyed by every citizen no matter who he may be.  That is the purpose of this legislation which the Minister is asking this House to adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that this Bill, if our amendments are not accepted, will continue as part of our permanent legislation.  It contains some points that were already covered in common law.  At the same time, it has been conceived in a climate of emergency which we are tending to create.  If it does not exist we are doing our best to create an atmosphere of panic and emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker yesterday said that 99.9 per cent of the people will welcome this legislation.  Repeating himself today he said that it would be acceptable to almost 100 per cent. I wonder for whom we are legislating? Is it the ½ per cent who would not welcome it?  So far as this package of legislation is concerned, it is a question of deciding what does the most damage to democracy.  What does the most damage to the image of this country and what is most likely to have the desired effect?  I do not think that anybody has come near to proving that this legislation will in any way improve the situation in regard to the detection of criminals.  It is all very well to say&mdash;and I have said it from the other side of the House&mdash; that if you keep the law you need not fear it.  There are provisions in this legislation which can interfere with <Col N="557" /> people who are not criminals.  Many people can have their liberty seriously interfered with.  We must preserve the code of being innocent until proved guilty.  This legislation is in contravention of the high principles enshrined in democratic law.</P>
    <P>As we have pointed out during the course of the debate, the Criminal Law Bill has some provisions which could help towards the improvement of the security situation which is very much in need of improvement. There are provisions in it which are anathema to the highest principles of those who hold the administration of law and equity and we are seeking to amend these provisions.  When we brought in the amendment to the Emergency Powers Act in 1970 the tone of the argument from this side of the House was that we had sufficient legislation.  The direct accusation by many people was that Fianna Fáil had not got the will to enforce the legislation which was available to them.  For that reason, the new broom which took over shortly afterwards sought to damage the law and order principles.  Not only have they got the legislation which they told us was sufficient but they have the additional amendments to the Special Powers Act.  They have made a great effort to put across the image of a law and order Government. After three-and-a-half years we find total failure.  They now have to seek powers which were unthinkable on that occasion.  The people who accused us of not having the will to operate the law are now seeking this emergency legislation.  It is an admission of failure.  One thing that has clearly emerged from this debate is the sham image of the law and order Government.</P>
    <P>The last speaker talked about the Government ensuring that the rights of the individual would be protected. That is not being done.  It is not the fault of the Garda and Army.  People are afraid and this type of legislation tends to create panic.  We have been dealing with this as a package, forgetting that we are directly discussing the Criminal Law Bill at <Col N="558" /> present.  Other speakers have covered the grounds for Fianna Fáil's attitude towards this Bill.  I think it is a responsible attitude.  We have tried to avoid sham and pretence as far as possible and whether we are credited with that motive does not matter to us.  It is important to the people who are watching and listening that we behave in a manner which would make this House a responsible institution. The behaviour here could very often give the lie to that statement. Fianna Fáil is not just a few people sitting on this side of the House. We represent at least half the electorate.  If the people were asked to voice their opinion now you might find that we would represent considerably more than half of the electorate.  However, that opportunity will soon be given to people. The day of reckoning must come no matter how long it is put off although it is argued that under this legislation the Government could extend the lifetime of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The argument that you have nothing to fear if you do not infringe the law is a plausible one but it is no justification for legislation which infringes the liberty of the individual and puts him in a position where he cannot feel secure or immune from the drastic powers which may be operated. Yesterday the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that neither he nor the Minister for Justice will direct prosecutions. He said that legislation is entrusted to the courts.  That can be said about any legislation going through this House.  He also made it quite clear that legislation of this kind required those who administered the laws to do certain things.  It is very clear that we are forging a weapon which, as circumstances and attitudes change, may be used in the wrong way.  The only safeguard against misuse would be not to have it on the statute book.  We have definite reservations about certain sections of the Criminal Law Bill.  We have reservations about it remaining permanently on the statute book.  We will seek to remedy some of its drastic provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 3 has come in for a good deal of discussion and speculation <Col N="559" /> here.  We all listened carefully yesterday to some of the speeches and particularly that of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who was seeking to interpret what would happen under the section and giving assurances that nobody need worry or fear.  At times he was almost seeking to convey that it would not lead to censorship, but he left no doubt in the minds of people that it could.  The safeguard he saw was that any newspaper editor, in his wisdom, would consult his legal adviser before publishing any matter, which is tantamount to saying: &ldquo;You have to be very careful about what you publish under the provisions of this legislation.&rdquo; He said editors of newspapers should be dedicated people.  Dedicated to whom?  To the Government?  I would say they should be free and impartial and not motivated by any personal spleen.  Above all, they should be free.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Forcible Entry Bill was going through this House its progress was considerably impeded by Deputy O'Brien as he then was, now Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. He waxed eloquent about the freedom of the press being sacrosanct, and the rights of the individual.  In that debate if I remember correctly, without quoting him directly, he went so far as to say the editor of the <i>United Irishman</i> should have the same right as any other citizens and should be free to voice his opinions.  Why is there a complete change of attitude when people move from this side of the House to that side?  Is the love of power more important than the love of freedom and liberty?  Are people to be motivated by the idea that, as long as they do not offend the Government, the Government will not interfere with them?</P>
    <P>Speaking on the provisions of the Emergency Powers Bill I referred to the importance of co-operation.  At the risk of being accused of repeating myself I should like to elaborate on that. In the interests of efficiency and economy we took steps to reduce the numbers of gardaí in country stations and in some cases we closed stations.  In ordinary circumstances that was considered the right thing to do.  It has <Col N="560" /> many advantages, but it strikes a serious blow at the activities of the local policeman stationed in the area who knows everybody in the area, knows their background and all their idiosyncracies and is in a position virtually to put his hand on the person who commits a crime.</P>
    <P>When stations were closed, patrol cars were provided which swept around at irregular intervals.  The argument against that at the time was that we struck a blow, to a great extent, at that type of intimate police activity.  The police were integrated in society and taking part in all the local organisations and sporting events and development committees.  They played an important role in society generally as good citizens who were looked up to in their own towns and villages.  The greater mobility of the force which we created struck a blow at that type of police activity which can be very useful in the circumstances.  It would be better for us to get back to that position, for the time being, and open many of the stations again, and strengthen the numbers in others.  They will be playing football with the local clubs and taking part in the various functions organised for the improvement of the social life and they will again become more integrated into society.</P>
    <P>People will learn to respect them and co-operate with them, and give them the necessary assistance without which an unarmed police force cannot be a success.  That is one of the points I was seeking to make, and that is the point I want to emphasise when I refer to co-operation.  We should have co-operation with everybody respecting it, not pretentious security.  Above all, that is dangerous. It is dangerous to have this perfunctory effort at security.  People come to know the half-hearted way in which detection work is carried out, with the result that they can find loopholes without any difficulty whatever.  We should either do it well, or not at all.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives the Garda authorities greater powers to search cars, and so on.  I did not think they needed those powers.  I thought they had them. I never objected to giving the Garda any assistance I could.  I find them most courteous.  When they know you, <Col N="561" /> they do not create any difficulties and delays in questioning or searching.  I would have no objection to that.  They expect us to be responsible people and to try to ensure that, even unknown to us, our cars do not carry any contraband or anything dangerous to the lives of the people.  Unfortunately, as we know only too well, cars have been used for planting explosives. I would hope that mutual understanding, respect and co-operation would exist between the large majority of our people who desire to see the law obeyed, and the Garda.  This will have an immense effect on the general administration of law and order throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Those people who are inclined to co-operate with the powers that be, with the forces generally in the maintenance of law and order, are not encouraged to do so by the obvious panic measures adopted to declare a state of emergency.  That does not do anything to improve the mutual understanding and respect which should grow between the people and the Defence Forces.  I say that with all sincerity.  I believe that is the situation. From one's ordinary empirical experience one can find a good deal of detestation and condemnation in the minds of the people who say: &ldquo;Is this really necessary?  This is frightening.  Must it be?  Have we lost control of the situation?  Are we unable to control the situation?&rdquo; That is on the home front.  Looking at it from abroad it must seem extraordinary and frightening to people to read of the Irish Parliament being summoned to declare a state of emergency.  Those people must feel that the situation is a serious one.  We try to tell foreigners that everything is under control, that they need not be frightened to visit this country but, on the other hand, we tell them that the situation here is so serious that we must declare a state of emergency.</P>
    <P>On section 3 the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs undertook to cover many points and made an act of contrition in respect of anything he may have been accused of in relation to <Col N="562" /> Fianna Fáil.  He then went on to point out that Fianna Fáil policy in relation to Northern Ireland was wrong.  I listened to him and noted his references. It is a pity that those who talk about our policy in relation to Northern Ireland batten on one sentence and misinterpret that sentence.  It is even given a different meaning.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said we were perfectly entitled to have our own policy on Northern Ireland but he did not agree with it.  We reissued our policy document on Northern Ireland for the purpose of setting the record straight because many people were attributing to us all sorts of policies, policies which did not exist.  They were imputing motives to Fianna Fáil which in no way belong to that party.  One thing that is clear in Fianna Fáil policy to date is our attitude to those six counties which we failed to secure when the Treaty was signed.  No one should have any doubt about that and there is no equivocation or ambiguity about that statement.</P>
    <P>At the outset of our statement on Northern Ireland it is made clear that the central aim of Fianna Fáil policy is to secure, by peaceful means, the unity and independence of Ireland as a democratic Republic.  We totally reject the use of force as a means of achieving this aim.  That policy document goes on to state:</P>
    <P>2.  Fianna Fáil calls on the British Government to:</P>
    <P>A.  Encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement, in independence and in a harmonious relationship between the two islands and to this end to declare Britain's commitment to implement an ordered withdrawal from her involvement in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>B.  Enter into an agreement guaranteeing appropriate financial support for a specified period to enable the transition to take place smoothly in stable economic conditions.</P>
    <P>Those who accuse us of asking the British to get out and leave a mess behind them, as happened in so many other small countries, do not know, or <Col N="563" /> pretend not to know, what our policy is in this regard.  Our policy statement continues:</P>
    <P>C. Promote in the interim the development of political institutions which will ensure civil rights and equality for all the people of the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and to ensure that security in the area operates impartially through acceptable structures.</P>
    <P Just="Center">and</P>
    <P>D.  Support the development of social, cultural and economic links between North and South through appropriate structures and institutions.</P>
    <P>3.  Following upon such declaration by the British Government, Fianna Fáil would propose:</P>
    <P>A.  Discussions with elected representatives in the North to resolve constitutional, legal, social and economic differences with goodwill and understanding.</P>
    <P>B.  In agreement between the Irish Government and elected representatives of the North, the establishment of an All Ireland court with appropriate machinery, to uphold the fundamental rights of all the people of Ireland and to ensure the maintenance of peace and security.</P>
    <P>4.  Fianna Fáil will seek support for these proposals by diplomatic and political endeavour at the United Nations, through, the European Institutions and appropriate International Bodies.</P>
    <P>If we are to replace the attempts to procure unity by violence we must show our determination and sincerity to seek support for political institutions. The Government should spell out clearly where they stand on this and what their ultimate outlook is in respect of the North.</P>

      <P>When accusations are made that the British should make some declaration that they do not intend to spend their lifetime in Northern Ireland, that they must make a declaration of intent to get out at an appropriate time, the Government should state if they go so far as to believe that they do not want the British ever to leave.  This is fundamental in the minds of all our people.  Many of them do not know where we are going and what will replace the violence when it ceases and, please God, it will cease soon.  Where do we go then?  We must be clear on this issue.  There must be no ambiguity about it.  To be saying that such a thing is meant but is not said because no good would be done by saying it, is wrong. It would be better for the Government to speak their mind on their attitude in relation to these matters.</P>
      <P>Section 3, which will be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage, gives undefined and unlimited powers which may be used properly, or may be abused.  No one can deny that those powers can be used in many ways to do many things.  I am sure that the Government in checking the draft of this legislation could not fail to see the open-endedness of that section, the vast potential it has in relation to incitement or invitation, and the wide area it can cover. I will not deal specifically with it at the moment but on Committee Stage the Minister will no doubt give us a lot of information on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I did not like in the rather reasoned speech yesterday of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, was that after seeking to give assurance that nobody need fear this, that <Col N="565" /> or the other thing being done, he proceeded to interpret the law as if he were a High Court judge administering it and he gave what might be regarded as instructions as to what was likely to happen under it.  At the same time he said the execution of this legislation is left to the courts. Naturally that applies to all legislation. Indeed, regarding any Bill that could be brought into this House, one could say: &ldquo;Well, you need not fear it if you do not break the law.&rdquo; But as the law becomes more constricting and the area of one's activities becomes more restricted you feel a tightening in.  We have to deal with all sections and types in our society.  This must be looked on as another blow at democracy, at that liberalised atmosphere, at the freedom we should give to people, and which we did to a large extent when in Government. But this encroachment at a time when the general situation does not warrant it does and is bound to create feelings of unrest, no matter how we may look at it, and even if this legislation were proven to be necessary.  I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that at the earliest possible date this legislation will be suspended.  He will get it through the lobbies because he has a majority to do so.</P>
    <P>After his speech and those of other members of the present Government in this House in 1970, the Minister advocated support for the Coalition. I wonder if they had told them that they were prepared to declare a national emergency after three-and-a-half years use of the legislation he said was unnecessary, would he be sitting there now?  I am sure they would not. I do not think anybody would have any doubt about that.  In other words, have they a mandate?  There will be other occasions for dealing in detail with those things.  If something like this was hinted at in the 14 points where would they be now.  In their preamble they accused Fianna Fáil of being so preoccupied with Northern Ireland that they had not time to look after the disastrous economic situation. After three-and-a-half years the law and order Government, which had <Col N="566" /> condemned the steps taken by Fianna Fáil in 1970, still find they have not enough legislation.  The situation has got out of hand and has reached the stage where they must get a grip on the press, the media and the people and have a national emergency.  They are going to control everything.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Government will talk themselves out of it.  May be we will be accused of not being a good enough Opposition.  They are let away with it. No matter what we do or say here, no matter how we may pinpoint what we think is the seriousness of the legislation, they will troop through the lobby, will get support and will steam-roll the legislation through.  But there will be a day of reckoning, and I would like that the Government speakers instead of entirely concentrating on blackening and attacking Fianna Fáil would make a more serious effort to justify two things: why the legislation is really necessary and in what way it will improve the situation.  Could anybody give any instance of how some of the occurences in the past could have been avoided if we had had the type of legislation we are meeting now to put through?  Nobody has made any attempt.  The Taoiseach devoted his winding up speech entirely to an attack on the Fianna Fáil Party which had no relevance whatever to the Emergency Powers Bill.  If we cannot weed them out, breed them out.  What has that got to do with the action the Government are taking now?  How is it in any way justifying it?  Those of us who are in this House for a number of years&mdash; and I have had experience of generations of Deputies&mdash;cannot in our hearts feel happy about the situation. I listened to Deputy O. J. Flanagan, the Parliamentary Secretary, speaking here for an hour yesterday and today. Having listened to that harangue, one is tempted to say: &ldquo;Is this House the important bastion of democracy we make it out to be or is it just a place where people talk a lot of nonsense?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have a lot to do.  I do not know if Deputies feel they are improving the image of this House in the country. We all come in for criticism time and again.  Anybody in public life would be very foolish if he was not prepared to <Col N="567" /> take it.  If it is justified, all the better; but one has to whether it is justified or not.  Politicians are not thin-skinned, but all of them have deep down a profound sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone on either side of this House can find justification in his heart for what we have been doing here for the past two weeks.  We can see in the Criminal Law Bill certain provisions that can be helpful, but they seem to be nullified by the extreme nature of some of the sections.  The best we can do is to seek to amend these and help if necessary to improve the others.  Everybody made reference to hoax calls about bombs and anything that can be done to bring these people to justice should be done.  The difficulty is detection.  They are doing much more damage than what somebody referred to here as upsetting business, because when a genuine alert comes in it could possibly go unnoticed.  Anything that can be done to deal with this type of thing will get every support here.  Our speakers have covered section 15 fairly adequately.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill is an effort by the Government to save money on the Garda force by having the Army dispersed on police duties.  That is an aspect which has not been discussed very much.  The Army are not trained for this type of work.  They could be within a very short time with fairly good personnel, but that would bring the whole scene much akin to that which has been experienced by those of us who have been in the North pretty frequently, where a car is approached at the point of a gun and various questions are asked.  I hoped that we could have avoided this situation. Apart from this Bill the Garda have the right to call out the Army in support of their activities, and it is much less warlike and it does not generate the same atmosphere as this military approach will.  This Bill is going a bit too far.  We thought that as the debate progressed members of the Government who are in a position to have information which is not available to others might be able to allay our fears or give us some information which would justify the action <Col N="568" /> we are taking.  The position has not improved during the course of the debate.  The only emergency that one can sense is in this House when we listen to the horrible pictures that are being painted of what could or would happen.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan after dealing with the desperate situation we are trying to deal with pointed out that 99.9 per cent of the people welcomed this legislation.  We are in favour of some of the provisions of the Criminal Law Bill which is now before the House.  We will seek to curtail the powers which are sought in some of the sections, particularly sections 3 and 15 and we will seek to ensure that it will not be made permanent legislation.  We all look to a better day, after the next election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that perturbs me in the Opposition's reaction to this Bill which is an extremely serious piece of legislation is the comment repeatedly made by Deputy Collins that the Bill is merely a propaganda exercise by the Government, that it is merely a piece of window dressing.  Deputy Collins said this on radio and television and in his contributions to this debate.  If it were only a piece of political window dressing for the next general election, presumably to be held not later than 12 months' time, I would not be unduly perturbed because Governments come and go and windows are dressed on each occasion.  This legislation is very widespread and all-embracing in its import and in its effects on the rights and duties of ordinary citizens throughout the State. I would have hoped that the Fianna Fáil Party would have treated this Bill as an Opposition, to even more rigorous scrutiny than many of us might be wont to do in Government with the constraints of supporting a Government.  It is no harm to remind the House that in relation to the security situation this Bill vitally effects the 23,000 men and women in the security forces on whom will devolve the responsibility of implementing the Bill at ground level.  At the moment we are spending about £100 million a year on security.  For an economy the size of Ireland and <Col N="569" /> for a working population of less than one million people that is a very considerable sum and it has generally been estimated that we are now spending at least £35 million a year in excess of normal security requirements.</P>
      <P>I would remind the perpetrators of violence, the Opposition and ourselves as legislators that if we had £35 million to build the best part of 3,000 houses a year for people in dire need of houses.  We would be able to build some 30 or 40 new schools throughout the country, or a couple of hospitals every year to meet urgent national needs if we had the opportunity of using that money instead of burning it up in petrol around the Border trying to preserve normal living conditions for people there so that they will not be prey to the murder, assassination, incendiary devices and random bombing of those who are doing it in the name of some perversion of republicanism&mdash;that is all I can say as a republican and socialist.  That is the cost in money but the full cost to the Irish people has been incalculable.  In a very subtle and insidious way it has hardened legislators both in Opposition and in Government.  There are people in Ireland who are sick and tired of the godfathers who financially support the violence and the lesser fathers who sit in armchairs and plan the operations and those foolish enough to engage in them and have themselves, perhaps, shot or captured in the process.  The coarsening of the Irish people North and South in terms of their attitudes to civilised living and civil liberties&mdash;and I do not share the views or the moral tone of my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly: I think he has been up on his hind legs a bit too often of late&mdash;the general effect on the people and on our children is incalculable and in the decades ahead it will yield a terrible harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party has decided to support the Bill.  I want to make quite clear to the Minister&mdash;I do not know what influence I may have on him&mdash; that I do not think that means that we are precluded from suggesting <Col N="570" /> amendments to the Bill or expressing concern about certain aspects of it. Lest there be abroad some view that because legislation has been drafted and presumably vetted by the Cabinet and finally decided on by them, Government Deputies should troop in behind the Government and support it unreservedly since Fianna Fáil are so generally incapable of Opposition and not worthy of getting any sop&mdash;that attitude might prevail; I do not share it&mdash;I take a broader view of political democracy.  There are some sections of the Bill that as a lay politician with no legal training I want to query very strongly.  I want to suggest that certain sections should be re-examined and that there are sections that I think the Minister could quite easily amend. I shall leave section 3 until last, the section that caused so much furore in the media.</P>
    <P>I want to deal particularly with sections 7, 9 and 15.  I would be very perturbed if there was no reaction to this legislation and, by and large, there has not been a great deal of reaction.  The level of &ldquo;protest&rdquo; has been very subdued.  Many people are rather worried but the overwhelming bulk of the population appreciate that it is necessary to do certain things in regard to this form of legislation.  I think there is overwhelming support, for example, for such sections of the Bill as that prohibiting unauthorised military exercises and increasing the maximum penalty from two years to 15 years.  I do not think anybody will baulk at that.  If people want to parade around the bogs, mountains or streets of the country in unauthorised military exercises and if they get something in excess of two years' imprisonment they will not have much sympathy from me. These are maximum sentences.  Likewise, if people are convicted of membership of the IRA and get a maximum sentence of two years and if they want to persist in membership having incurred the first penalty and are repeatedly caught, I have no great objection to a seven-year maximum sentence being imposed.  I stress that these are maxima.  Judging from the comments made on this legislation, one might think that on every occasion the <Col N="571" /> maximum sentence is applied.  This has not been so.</P>
    <P>There are sections in this Bill which any objective analysis would fully support but there are others which one must question very strongly. Section 7 deals with the power of the Garda Síochána in regard to certain arrested persons and I think the House is entitled to a fuller explanation and fuller assurances in relation to that section than we have so far had.  I do not want random situations to develop in which members of the Garda would be given power outside what I would regard as security exigencies to keep in custody and question persons and have them photographed, finger- and palm-printed and have a series of tests done on their possessions.  Section 7 states: &ldquo;where a person is in custody under the provisions of any enactment for the time being in force...&rdquo;.  That is a very broad concept as has been pointed out and I think it requires certain limitations.  I am fully aware that there are individuals about whom the Garda may hold entirely legitimate suspicion in regard, say, to possession of explosives and outwardly these people are as clean as a whistle but forensic tests or other tests of their clothes and so on could show that they have handled explosives in the recent past, perhaps, within hours.  There is a valid case to be made where that suspicion has to be verified or checked.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should be beyond the capacity of the parliamentary draftsman or the Minister to specify the circumstances more clearly in which an individual up to his tonsils in subversion would be subjected to such tests.  I do not want a situation to develop in which a circular is issued which says that, if someone is in custody, those holding that person can do X, Y or Z.  That would be a free-for-all situation.  The success of the 23,000 men and women in the Garda and the Army depends on the goodwill, support and respect which the ordinary citizen has for the security forces.  If there is any diminution in that respect and if innocent people question as to what might happen to them if they are brought in&mdash;will their fingerprints be taken, will they be <Col N="572" /> photographed and will files be opened on them&mdash;we might have the opposite of what we hope to achieve.  Will files be opened on people even if they are held for only 20 minutes?  We are entitled to put these points to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have another look at this section.  It will have to be tightened up so that only those who are engaged in subversive activity will be brought within the custodial net. The counter argument is, of course, that one must cast one's net widely to catch the big fish.  The trouble is that many little fish may be caught as well and they may be dead long before the big fellow is taken out and processed. There are these dangers in the section.</P>
    <P>This morning on my way to Leinster House I listened to the president of the Incorporated Law Society being interviewed by Mr. Rice on RTE.  He made a point about the definitions. Last week we had the phrase about being held in custody &ldquo;at a convenient place&rdquo; and, in the light of the discussion last week, I doubt if the parliamentary draftsman would use that phrase now unless, of course, he was directed to do so.  In section 9 it is specifically provided:</P>
    <P>Where in the course of any search (whether carried out in the exercise of powers conferred by this Act or otherwise) or in the course of exercising his powers under this Act, a member of the Garda Síochána, a prison officer or a member of the Defence Forces finds or comes into possession of anything which he believes to be evidence of any offence or suspected offence, it may be seized and retained for use as evidence in any criminal proceedings,...</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society are constituted of responsible legal practitioners and they object to the use of the word &ldquo;anything&rdquo;.  The Minister says that as far as he and the prison governors are concerned this provision will not impinge on private and confidential documents being exchanged between a solicitor and his prisoner client.  Verbal assurances do not convince me because this will be <Col N="573" /> written into our legislation for all time.  The Minister's assurance is one thing.  The interpretation by the court is another thing.  This is the nub of the matter.  I think this should be amended.  There may be some justification for it because of attempts to breach security through prison visiting and so on but I think the word &ldquo;anything&rdquo; is really going too far.</P>
    <P>Suppose a solicitor hands a prisoner client an opinion by counsel that he is guilty and that he should plead guilty, and that document is taken by the authorities, then the privilege that should attach to such a document is not preserved.  Good intentions on the part of the Minister and scrupulous respect by the prison governor are not enough.  There could be an unscrupulous Minister for Justice.  In such circumstances counsel's opinion would ensure that criminal proceedings would be brought to a successful conclusion.  That must be borne in mind.  I urge the Minister to have second thoughts about this. I gather the Incorporated Law Society are meeting again on Thursday and the problem is that the Bill may be passed and, if we then have to make these amendments in the Seanad, this House will have to be recalled once more to confirm those amendments. Let the Minister consult the Incorporated Law Society now and make the appropriate amendment to section 9.</P>
    <P>In section 15 the problem arises, which I mentioned in relation to previous legislation, of the need to convince the Government that in a situation where an ordinary citizen is apprehended by a member of the Defence Forces there should be&mdash; and there is not in this legislation&mdash; provision for what I would regard as a civil investigation into such apprehension if it is proved to be improper, illegal, or simply that the person concerned wishes to make a complaint. For example, I would not want to chase any Army officer from the Border down to the Curragh or back to Dublin to contact his commanding officer and inform him that I was stopped and held for five or six hours simply because somebody mistook the <Col N="574" /> number of my car.  That can happen. These situations are not beyond human failing.  It applies particularly when power is being given to a member of the Defence Forces to use reasonable force to compel a person to comply with the requirement to stop a vehicle.  One must point out that the person so involved is an armed soldier.  While this House shares overwhelming respect and regard for our soldiers, who have an appalling job to do in very difficult circumstances, particularly in Border areas, and while many of us would be very complimentary to the Minister for Defence for the tremendous work he has done in building up the morale of the Army, providing them with additional equipment and getting additional moneys for them from the Department of Finance&mdash;all very laudable&mdash;nevertheless where there are many thousands of men involved there can always be an individual who may lose his nerve.  A person can be killed accidentally at a roadblock leaving a wife and family behind him.</P>
    <P>There is provision at present whereby the Defence Forces can conduct their own investigation into such incidents. What I am concerned about is that under the Criminal Law Bill where such powers devolve on the armed forces, there should be a rigorous, clear, statutory form of investigatory machinery in relation to any such incident. Such should be laid down.  It may well be that since such a matter is rather complex the Ministers for Defence and Justice would have difficulty in having it incorporated in this Bill.  Were this House to receive an assurance that in regard to complaints arising in relation to activities of the Defence Forces in support of the Garda Síochána, in the context of this Bill, that at least the Ministers were preparing to set up a public system of complaints reception, then many of the fears felt in relation to this section would be mollified.  Such fears might not be removed entirely but at least many of us might feel that to be a better situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister may feel I am laying it on a bit thick, that I am raising fears <Col N="575" /> about which he can assure us there is no need to worry.  However, I merely make a general point: some of the speeches made about legislation of this kind may create a climate in which the Director of Public Prosecutions, a member of the Garda Síochána, a superintendent or an Army officer may feel that that is what the Executive or the Legislature want and that is the way the security forces will implement it.  Interpretations become very rigid; people adopt attitudes arising out of debates of this nature, particularly when such new powers devolve on them.  Therefore, it is necessary that there be certain constraints and I hope those that I have put forward will be of some help.</P>
    <P>In my view section 3 will pose very considerable difficulties for the proprietors of newspapers and for their staffs.  It is appropriate that tribute be paid in this House to those members of the press who, in the most appalling circumstances, and very often at considerable danger to their own lives, report the truth of situations, particularly in Northern Ireland and in some Border counties.  Some of these men are deserving of our thanks, at least of our respect and admiration.  I know of at least half a dozen such reporters in Northern Ireland&mdash;I do not propose to give names&mdash;who have had their lives threatened by one side or the other in the performance of their duties.  That point is not very often made and I feel it should be.  By and large politicians are neurotic about the press and a number of reporters, in turn, tend to become a little neurotic about some politicians.  That arises in the interplay of political life and is part of a healthy democracy but it would be unfortunate were that healthy interplay allowed to become excessively obsessive.</P>
    <P>Having made that comment I want to draw another distinction.  In this House, for example, we enjoy the benefit of privilege and the constraints on newspapers are quite substantial. There are the existing laws against incitement which I understand are fairly substantial.  There are the existing laws also against libel which are equally substantial and to which politicians <Col N="576" /> have had recourse from time to time, usually getting their proverbial shilling; some might get even more.  Of course, there are also the stringent laws relating to contempt of court.  Those constraints are inevitable in any society which wants to have a free Press and operates within the normal constraints of democracy.  Perhaps we politicians are very often unaware of the constraints that operate in the editorial rooms of newspapers.  Very often also we become very thin-skinned about some of the criticism made by newspapers of political developments from time to time.  Of course, one has to place the words &ldquo;freedom of the Press&rdquo; in inverted commas because I suppose there is no such thing as an entirely free Press, not even in the Republic of Ireland.  Here I draw a distinction between proprietors of newspapers and the staff who work for them.  One should point out that at least three of the four major newspaper groups in this country are owned by individual families, if not by individuals. In debating this legislation one newspaper group has come in for a good deal of slagging, that being <i>The Irish Press</i> group.  Of course that paper is owned and controlled by a Member of this House and that irony should not be lost in the context of the debate.  Indeed one might ask for whom is one legislating&mdash;one might almost say an incestuous piece of legislation&mdash; because the editorial policy of such a paper, presumably, is the responsibility of such a managing editor.  The staff are hired by the board, in so far as the board exists, or by the managing editor of such a paper.  Inevitably legislation of this nature&mdash;in respect of which the said Member has been silent&mdash;impinges on the work of such a newspaper. Therefore, how free is free and how free has been free in some of the workings of that paper over the years? There is the other major grouping, the Independent group, owned and controlled by&mdash;I do not know how one would describe him&mdash;an expatriate, rugby, multi-national Irishman.  Who appointed the editors of those newspapers? How free is free in that setting? Staff may feel that they are being harried by the Minister for Justice but some of the harrying that may take <Col N="577" /> place on the fourth floor of such an Independent group is something about which the public never hears.  There are enormous pressures and restraints. As one who grew up under the rather protective mantle of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in Cork I was acutely aware for 20 years when I read that newspaper each morning that it was owned and controlled by one family.  How free was free in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>? I do not know who owns <i>The Irish Times.</i> I presume by this stage the banks probably have it but irrespective of whatever group may have it there are enormous constraints though perhaps <i>The Irish Times</i> suffers less in this way than the other papers.</P>
    <P>Some of those who are howling blue murder about the appalling imposition this Bill will put on the freedom of the press might do some internal analysis on the pressures that shareholders, directors and advertisers exert on the policies and articles of such newspapers.  Therefore, freedom of the press in Ireland is a relative term depending on one's interpretation and the same applies in many respects to the provincial newspapers. Some of these have become the subsidiaries of the national groups; most provincial newspapers are either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael orientated. One could extend the list to some of the lesser fringe periodicals such as <i>Hibernia.</i> Who owns that periodical? Sole proprietorship, sole determination of policy and sole determination of editorial content of a newspaper or journal have to be put in proper prospective and this is something many of us often fail to do.</P>
    <P>I come to the central argument in relation to section 3, namely, that the section is extremely broad and covers practically everything, that it is more a statement of principle than a piece of legislation.  This I accept.  But I do not accept the view which has been expressed very honestly by the Minister for Justice that he will have nothing to do with the measure once it is passed.  Likewise, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has said that anything in relation to this matter will be exclusively the prerogative of the Director of Public Prosecutions. <Col N="578" /> Under the Act relating to the office of Director of Public Prosecutions, any person making representations to him to prevent proceedings being developed is committing a criminal act.  But, of course, that is also not the issue.  But anyone may report to the DPP.</P>
    <P>The issue is that once this broad measure is passed it will be open to interpretation by the Director of Public Procsecutions in whatever way he or any member of the staff of his office so wish.  In my view there is a blank cheque here and we should be acutely aware in this House as to what precisely we are cashing in on this occasion.  I am very worried lest in view of some of the statements made in this House some people would regard it as a licence to go ahead and prosecute very widely.  I am glad the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has pointed out quite clearly that he is not the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Minister for Justice has likewise made the point.</P>
    <P>I do not know how one might attempt any amendment of section 3 because it is so broad.  I think the Minister for Justice in his reply should elaborate on the existing laws of incitement. This is a matter with which many Deputies are not conversant. We would like to contrast the existing laws of incitement and consider where these fall short in relation to section 3.  Much to my regret I have no legal training but I should like to contrast the extent to which section 3 embellishes the existing legislation in relation to incitement.  This would be of considerable concern to us on Committee Stage and we would wish to hear from the Minister on the matter.</P>
    <P>In view of the passing of section 3 in the next week or two it is even more necessary now to establish a Press Council.  Those who have been in favour of a Press Council throughout the years may now have to go back to the newspaper proprietors on the matter. We should tell them that so much is happening that is of direct concern to them, to their staffs and to the media generally, that there is so much happening in relation to their role and the Houses of the Oireachtas, that it is <Col N="579" /> time a Press Council was set up.  I think that generally the Government would be in favour of this.  I have not had any discussions in depth with individual members of the Government but I am certain that they are in favour.  This is an opportunity to establish such a council, perhaps this year, so that those who are gravely concerned about some aspects of legislation and those who are concerned about complaints with regard to newspaper articles may have an opportunity of availing of that machinery.</P>
    <P>I will resist the temptation to comment on the editorial policy of individual newspapers, particularly that of <i>The Irish Press.</i> The only distinction I would draw there is to separate the editorial content from the parliamentary reporting and from the political correspondentship of that paper.  One should say something good when it is possible.  I can say that that paper has the unique characteristic in my view of having perhaps the best political correspondent in the country.  I wish I could say the same about the editor but I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should consider a number of amendments. He indicated earlier in relation to the Bill that he would be open to reasonable amendments.  I do not know what Fianna Fáil have in mind in relation to amendments but the Minister should consider them, tease them out and put them through.  There is a school of thought that if that is done one is weakening the drive of the Government to ensure that legislation is effectively brought to the consciousness of the electorate but I do not think that danger exists.  Rather it proves that we can strengthen legislation and ensure that it is more effective in the long run.  It is necessary that we have very careful handling in putting this legislation through the Dáil and the Seanad.  As politicians I do not think many of us appreciate that there are thousands of young people between 18 and 21 years who are now on the electoral register for the first time. Many of them will require fuller explanations from some of the more hairy politicians such as ourselves on <Col N="580" /> what we are up to when we talk about preserving and strengthening the democratic institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>They are entitled to that elaboration. I do not think they are interested particularly in what one might refer to as moral exhortations but among the 18- and 19-year-olds and among my teenage children I find a total rejection of the murderous assassinations of people in the presence of their families. It is good that there is such strong repugnance of such acts among our young people but we should not erode that detestation or in any way create misgivings among the young that, perhaps, we on the other side as legislators are travelling some way along that repressive road in order to catch the wrongdoer at the far end.  This is the time to strengthen our democratic institutions.  The vast majority of the Irish people support totally our security forces.  They have no time at all for the 614 people who during the lifetime of this Government have been convicted by the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>This legislation must not diminish that great reservoir of detestation of violence within the community.  Of course it must be tough.  We must be honest with the members of the Garda and of the Army and tell them exactly what the law means.  Deputy Cooney is a good Minister for Justice.  There are not many who would be prepared to castigate some members of their own profession but the Minister has done so.  However, there could be a time in the future when we would have a bad or a lazy Minister for Justice or when we could have a vindictive departmental secretary.  We could have a Director of Public Prosecutions who was somewhat neurotic about certain issues or we could have a chief superintendent who was betwixt and between in these matters and who would be inclined to overcharge people under the wide scope of section 3.  We are legislating not for 1976 but for 1986 and for the future of this nation. Therefore, we have an obligation to be very careful about our legislation, to realise exactly what we are doing and to ensure that there is no infringement of civil rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> I know that I shall not be thanked in certain quarters for walking this plank but that is something which does not worry me.  I may be accused by some of trying to have a shilling each way so far as the Bill is concerned but I would remind the House that I have never abstained from voting on any issue before us.  My contention is that one votes either for or against an issue. If one votes against his own Government he must suffer the consequences &mdash;resign his Parliamentary Whip and so on but that is one's privilege.  It is hardly the function of the Oireachtas to include on such vital issues, in addition to tá and níl lobbies, an abstention lobby.</P>
    <P>When one abstains from voting one is taking a soft option, especially when the issues relate to the current situation. Deputies should not try to cash in on that soft option.  I support the legislation but I look forward to there being some substantial amendments to it.  I trust that the Government will be convinced of the need to accept such amendments.  When replying to Second Stage, I trust the Minister will reply to the points that are being made and that the legislation can be improved substantially as a result.  On Committee Stage of this and the other Bill I intend to speak again in relation to different facets of the legislation and to tease out some of its more objectionable features so that it will reflect fully the best traditions of democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal mainly with the provisions of section 15.  Some speakers have expressed the opinion that this section is explained in much detail but so far as I am aware nothing has been said in relation to its most important factors.  We have had a balanced policy as between security and defence but people are seriously alarmed by the change proposed in the role of the Defence Forces.  Up to now the Army have played a low profile in the balance between themselves and the security system but in the future they are to operate in a high profile role.  Such a change must cause serious concern to many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that members of the Defence Forces are being <Col N="582" /> given powers that are similar exactly to those of the Garda.  This is not so. Members of the Defence Forces will have the added obligation, under section 15, to obey under military law the lawful commands of their superior officers.  Unlike the police, the Army have very sophisticated weapons.  We should like to know exactly how these weapons will be used.  The public should be made aware of the changing situation.  Under the Defence Force regulation which relates to the maintenance and restoration of public peace there is set out clearly very definite guidelines in relation to the use of weapons in the event of the Defence Forces being called out to support the civil power.  In addition to the military being called out in circumstances provided for in this Bill, we should like to know whether in the future they are to be called out to perform another function or has that other function ceased to operate?  Will the Bill be the remedy for the entire situation in which we find ourselves?  It contains certain limitations in regard to the role of the Army in stopping and searching vehicles, in arresting without warrant and detaining without charge for a period of up to six hours.  The question of the restoration of public peace is another matter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the change in role of the Defence Forces and the anxiety that has been expressed by many people in this connection. We have this progressive development elsewhere that where one power is given it must be backed up by additional power.  We would like the Minister to clarify whether the total extent to which the Army can use force is laid down in section 15 (3) (b), which reads:</P>
      <P>A member of the Defence Forces may use reasonable force in order to compel a person to comply with a requirement to stop a vehicle, and such force may include the placing of a barrier or other device in the path of a vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister say if that is the sum <Col N="583" /> total of the force the member can use and if by &ldquo;force&rdquo; is meant the firing of ball ammunition?  Under Defence Force Regulation CS 1, which governs aid to the civil power, there is a more extensive range where members of the Defence Forces can use force or fire ball ammunition.  Would the Minister say if the new Defence Force regulations can be placed before the Dáil so that Members can see exactly the extent to which the military operation will take place?  I do not believe it is correct, as is stated in the Minister's brief, that the Defence Forces will be given exactly similar power&mdash; no more and no less&mdash;to that of the Garda.  I believe the Defence Forces have considerable additional power because they carry arms.  It is an armed police duty that is now being imposed here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the existing Defence Force regulations which govern the use of force&mdash;and I take the &ldquo;use of force&rdquo; to involve the firing conditions to be observed&mdash;it is necessary and desirable that citizens should know in exactly what circumstances the Army will operate, when they are empowered to fire ball ammunition. There is no card system here, and the decision is at the discretion of the officer in charge of the operation. There is no definition here in relation to the circumstances in which the Defence Forces will operate.  These are matters that are worrying many people, and I do not think their fears will be allayed until the details are spelt out.  The present Defence Force Regulation CS 1 states that when troops are called out in aid of the civil power the amount of force to be used by the officer commanding a military party should be guided by the following principles:</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>Justification:</i></P>
    <P>There must be justification for each separate act ordered by the Commanding Officer.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Prevention:</i></P>
    <P>Prevention must be the reason for using military force.  No more force to be used than is absolutely necessary <Col N="584" /> to achieve the immediate military aim.</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Minimum Force:</i></P>
    <P>No more force to be used than is absolutely necessary to achieve the immediate military aim.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>Legal requirements:</i></P>
    <P>Members of Óglaigh na hÉireann must comply with the law and act calmly and impartially in doing so.</P>
    <P>(2)  Firing may be justified only in the circumstances that no other course is possible for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the protection of a military party and its individual members;</P>
    <P>(b)  the saving of the lives of others;</P>
    <P>(c)  the prevention of a criminal outrage of a serious nature, such as the burning or destruction of any building or the commission of any crime likely to cause loss of life; or</P>
    <P>(d)  the breaking open of a prison.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the circumstances outlined in that Defence Force regulation are modified in the new legislation.  Various points have been put to me by people in the course of the last day or two and I would ask the Minister to indicate clearly whether the same conditions will apply or whether they are minimised as indicated in the Bill.  The provision in the Bill says a member of the Defence Forces may use reasonable force in order to compel a person to comply with a requirement to stop a vehicle and that such force may include the placing of a barrier or a device.  If my interpretation is correct, then in the pursuance of other activities such as searching, arresting or entering a building, military personnel may not use force. I would like to know what is in the mind of the Minister for Defence in regard to drawing up the new Defence Force regulations that will deal with that situation.  The other conditions to be observed when firing are:</P>
    <P>(3)  When an officer commanding a military party decides that fire must be resorted to in order to restore <Col N="585" /> a situation, as far as possible subsequent action will be as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  The crowd will be warned by all available means that effective fire will be opened unless it disperses at once;</P>
    <P>(b)  the order to fire will be given by the Officer Commanding of the military party himself.  He will indicate the target, the number of rounds to be fired. Fire shall be limited to the necessary minimum.  It shall be carefully controlled and should be directed at the leader or leaders of the riotous crowd or of any other individual engaged in a criminal outrage of such a nature.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will spell out in detail the situation in which the military will be permitted to use ball ammunition.  This is one of the factors that is of concern to many people.</P>
    <P>The military will now operate on their own.  In other words, it will be a complete military operation once they have a request from the Garda.  The military have their own code of rules. As distinct from the police, the military will have to operate under military command.  This matter has not been touched on so far.  This involves Defence Force regulations and involves instructions for the guidance of troops in these operations.  I am asking the Minister to give us in detail what this involves so that we will know the magnitude of the problem in relation to a military operation such as that provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Of vital importance in regard to the introduction of these new powers is that they will be of a permanent nature.  The Garda could make a request at any time, whether an emergency is in operation or not.  It is a complete change on a permanent basis of the Army role.  We know of the developments in other countries where the Army were given limited powers initially.  These powers developed into further powers involving ultimately military tribunals and <Col N="586" /> firing squads.  We hope that in our case the powers given to the military will be strictly limited in the way indicated in the legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Army are to play a part in our structure of law enforcement, will they receive special training?  Will they be sent to Templemore and instructed in relation to their new police duties?  The Minister for Defence said that Army personnel are competent to do this job, that they have had 12 months' training.  That is not so.  After passing out, recruits are immediately posted to particular areas.  On the other hand, Garda recruits do protracted training before reaching the degree of efficiency necessary for their work.  It is important that we be told what training the military have in relation to the techniques of search and arrest at checkpoints and elsewhere.  It is highly important that the public should be made aware of the instructions to be issued in the use of firearms and so on.  Military personnel have a responsibility of their own in relation to the operations necessary to protect their own and their comrades' lives.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Minister for Defence that Army personnel operating in security duties at the moment in aid of the civil power are brought into a room and given a three minute briefing.  Now that the occasions for such duties are being extended, I suggest three minute briefings are not enough.  They will now be operating on their own and it is a reasonable request that we be given details on the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the methods of investigation by military personnel who have not been trained in these matters.  The Gardiner Report in regard to the North recognised that the Army in such a role would require an independent system of investigation. The Minister for Defence said that ball ammunition has been fired on only four occasions in the last seven years. After the enactment of this legislation there may be additional pressures on them.  There may be combat situations in which the question of the firing of ball ammunition might arise.  Military personnel who are harassed and who <Col N="587" /> are armed may act on occasions in a manner in respect of which there will be doubts.  They will be coming in aid of the unarmed civic force and there will be the difference between the Garda investigation system and that of the Army.  We know all too well from cross-Border operations how military forces operate.  I do not want to compare our people with the military forces across the Border but we have seen in other countries that military operations are very different to that carried out by unarmed police.</P>
    <P>British politicians and the British Army have for some time being crying out to give our Army additional powers of search and arrest.  I wonder if this Government have yielded to these pressures which will give our Army almost the same type of power as the British Army in the North.  I hope this Government will not yield to this type of pressure. Is this a forerunner to the day when the forces will be parallel, as has been suggested?  It would appear that the common enemy will be pursued by forces on both sides of the Border but will we still act as an independent unit?  Independence is necessary and desirable and we should maintain that independence.  We have more problems to contend with than the British Army. We have to contend with intrusion into our territory by personnel of a foreign army in civilian clothes.  If there is any question of a military link-up because of the additional powers, that is another day's work for this House.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider section 15 which deals with a person arrested by the Army and states that he must be delivered to the Garda as soon as possible and turned over within six hours.  That is too long for military personnel to hold a person. The distance between any military outpost and a Garda barracks would be so short that a six-hour period is unreasonable.  In the North the Army have a four-hour period to hold suspects.  We want to go 50 per cent better.  In my view the turnover should be much less than six hours as suggested here.</P>
    <P>As I said, I see no reason why the Army with limited powers and doing <Col N="588" /> police duty should hold a person for six hours.  Where would they hold them?  They could not hold them in detention centres because they are quite close to military barracks. Where would they be if it took them six hours to get to a Garda barracks? I believe the due process of the law should take place within a much shorter time.  If six hours are added to 48 hours and the additional time given in the other Bill, we will realise that a suspect can be held for a very lengthy period.</P>
    <P>We do not want this democratic State to be labelled a jackboot democracy. We want to ensure that the deployment of the necessary forces to meet the evil created by evil men are made available.  Our speakers have consistently indicated their acceptance of most of this Bill.  Sections dealing with sentences and ways to relieve the terrible situation which is on our doorsteps will be supported by all reasonable people.  There are other sections which are objectionable.  The Minister for Justice was very reasonable when he indicated that he was prepared to listen to and accept reasonable amendments.  The Minister for Defence indicated otherwise: &ldquo;Not a single comma of the whole package will be changed by this Government&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister for Defence did not know or did not want to know the various problems which had been mentioned by Members of this House or how these problems would be dealt with.  I hope he is not the person with the final say in this legislation or we will have a jackboot democracy.</P>
    <P>Will equal pay for work of equal value apply to military personnel doing police work?  Pay has been very important.  The lack of overtime for the gardaí has reduced their efficiency. Now military personnel whose pay is much less than that of the gardaí are being asked to do a police job.  Will they get the same money for the same work?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give an indication how far the role of the Army will be extended and what will be the contents of the new Defence Force regulations.  Will Defence <Col N="589" /> Force Regulation CS I which deals with aid to civil powers be in operation in addition to the powers given under the new legislation?  So far as I am concerned, the powers under Defence Force Regulation CS I is very important.</P>

      <P>The general terms under which the military will operate should be made available as soon as possible.  This should be done before the Committee Stage so that we can ascertain the precise implications of the measure.  Defence Force Regulation CS 1 deals with the maintenance or restoration of public peace and the employment of troops in aid of the civil power.  They clearly state the circumstances in which troops will operate and, in a general way, deal with the requistion of troops, the disposition of troops, the principles to be considered in deciding action, firing and the conditions to be observed, reports and revocation.  I see no reason for giving additional powers because of the concern expressed about bank raids and prison breaks.  At present the Army have authority under the regulations to come out without requisition.  Paragraph (d) of Regulation CS 1 reads:</P>
      <P>It is, however, possible for extraordinary cases of immediate and pressing danger to arise when violent crimes are being or are likely to be committed which, in the opinion of a military commander, demand his immediate interference.  In these emergencies he should take such action as he thinks necessary while endeavouring to communicate with a Garda Officer responsible for order in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army have power to meet emergencies as they arise without the necessary requisition in cases of extreme emergency, as has been pointed out earlier in the debate on the motion.  I should be glad to have information in relation to the new demands upon the military as soon as possible.  I should also like the Minister for Justice to say whether it is the intention to call up the Reserve and what part the Reserve <Col N="590" /> will play in a national emergency situation.  Some members of the FCA have been called out and are serving on permanent duty.  Is it the intention on this occasion to reinforce the Army with the Reserve, as has been the general situation in an emergency, or does the Minister feel that he has sufficient troops at his disposal to meet the situation without calling out the firstline Reserve?  I should like to know the identical terms of the requisition that the Garda superintendent will communicate to the commanding officer? Will it be the same type of requisition that is indicated in Defence Force Regulation CS 1, which reads:</P>
    <P>(a)  Nature of the trouble, anticipated or in progress,</P>
    <P>(b)  Exact time and date on which military are required,</P>
    <P>(c)  Exact location to which it is desired the military should report,</P>
    <P>(d)  Any other information and suggestions as may be considered helpful to the military authorities.</P>
    <P>Will it be on a blanket basis or will it be for a positive period?  Is there a limitation to the period during which the troops can be called out?</P>
    <P>One or two items come to mind on section 3.  The House voted last week declaring an emergency situation.  The Irish people have a good sense of humour and understand that emergency. Immediately it was declared last Wednesday, we all went off on holiday again.  People were at hurling matches and football matches.  They could be seen on television.  They were at the race courses, or golf links and elsewhere in this manufactured emergency.  People abroad put a different interpretation on this emergency. Irreparable damage has been done to the economy and to the country in regard to tourism and other factors.</P>
    <P>We had an outburst by the Frankenstein of Irish politics, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, over the weekend.  Apparently he was taken to the Taoiseach's room, because he made an effort yesterday to whitewash what he was quoted in the press as saying to <i>The Washington Post.</i> He <Col N="591" /> may have got mixed up between the post here and <i>The Washington Post.</i> He got mixed up somewhere along the line because he tried to water down what he had said.  He has done irreparable harm.  People abroad know that a national emergency has been declared here, and they relate that to emergencies elsewhere.  When a national emergency is declared there is serious unrest in that country.</P>
    <P>Additional powers are being given to the police to hold people.  Additional powers are also being given to the Army.  This is very drastic and, in the eyes of people outside the country, it means we are on the verge of martial law, curfews, and so on. We will not have as many visitors next year as we have had in the past because of the concern about this national emergency which is reinforced by the interview given to <i>The Washington Post</i> by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who sealed the situation on an international basis.  Situations which are coloured as revoluntionary bring a new brand of tourist: the hit man, the mercenary, the revolutionary, and people who are concerned with revolutionary activities.  We will have this type of gangster coming to our shores instead of visitors.</P>
    <P>I hope this state of emergency will be kept under review by the Government and terminated at the earliest possible moment.  I hope the damage done by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be repaired in the near future, so that people will be attracted to our shores again.  State concerns like Aer Lingus, who have lost so much money on the North Atlantic route in the past year, will find their business will be down in the coming years after that outburst last week-end.  We cannot expect to entice people to come here with this national emergency which we understand. As I have said, we have a great sense of humour and we tolerate this type of thing.  An erroneous impression has gone out to the world.</P>
    <P>The Government should realise that Ministers have damaged the fabric of the nation with their hysterical <Col N="592" /> outbursts from time to time, not at home but elsewhere.  While we understand them, the Americans may not understand them, and the Europeans may not understand them.  We have seen the damage done in the cancellations which have taken place.  I hope the Minister responsible for such outbursts will be brought to his senses.  For far too long he has interfered in areas outside his control.  We know of his activities elsewhere with military forces and with personnel who are acquainted with revolutionary forces.</P>

      <P>I regard the Minister for Justice as a very responsible person.  He has indicated that he is prepared to meet reasonable amendments in order to ensure that the Bill is the best possible Bill and that it is acceptable to the House in the broadest possible terms.  We disagree with many aspects of the Bill.  We will endeavour to amend some sections of the Bill.  This may be possible or it may not.  The Minister may go some of the way or he may go all of the way.  I hope he goes a good distance to meet the general views of the membership of this House, and that he disregards the tainted approach of one of his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Two Minister differ in their approach to this Bill.  One Minister indicated that he would accept reasonable amendments, while the Minister for Defence indicated that not one single comma would be changed in this package.  I hope reason will prevail and we will all play our part in ensuring that the terror gangs, the bully boys, boot boys and gun boys are brought to book.  I hope justice will be done and they will be apprehended.  We agree with some of the measures the Government are seeking and I hope they will be a deterrent in the future to those people, that their operations will cease, and normality will be restored once again.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Dowling especially <Col N="593" /> before lunch when, as spokesman on Defence for the Opposition, he stuck to his brief.  After lunch he got back to his old stomping ground of throwing mud.  I suppose he is better at that that he is as spokesman on Defence.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say this legislation is the result of years and years of duplicity on the part of Fianna Fáil in their approach to the development of this State and the development of our relations with Northern Ireland.  There is ample evidence to prove that duplicity. The implicit, indirect support for subversives which emanated from that party is a cause of the divisions in Northern Ireland, the introduction of the state of emergency and the Criminal Law Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Bill before the House as I supported the declaration of the state of emergency and the Emergency Powers Bill.  In normal times I would be very slow to support the introduction of such hard legislation.  I voted against the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1972.  The Government have been forced to declare a state of emergency or, to redeclare a state of emergency.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach quite rightly said in the debate on the declaration of an emergency that nothing had changed and that ever since the second world war there was a state of emergency. He was right.  The Government have given the proper reason for the declaration of a state of emergency, that is, the existence of a threat to this State from subversive organisations. The Government have rightly spelt out why there is a state of emergency and, to be specific, this is why Fianna Fáil are so upset.  There has been such an unfortunate chain of events in Ireland that there is proper justification for the introduction of this legislation.  Since the National Coalition took office events have taken place which have given me, a representative of the people, cause for concern for our community, for the maintenance of law and order and the institutions of the State.  I deplore the murder of my colleague, Senator Billy Fox, a personal friend of mine.  He was murdered by the IRA in his own county.  We witnessed continuous attacks on our <Col N="594" /> financial institutions and two gardaí were murdered in the course of such attacks.  We all know of the serious bombings which took place in Dublin and Monaghan and that many people lost their lives in those bombings.  We are also aware of the kidnappings that have taken place, the kidnappings of Dr. Herrema and Lord and Lady Donoughmore.  We are aware of the damage caused by the explosion at Green Street courthouse but the final act, the straw which broke the camel's back, was the murder of the British Ambassador and the female civil servant.</P>
    <P>Those occurrences show the trend of events since the Government took office.  The Government have taken these measures because they have to ensure that people can go about their daily business in safety.  The events I have outlined have changed the attitude of our people towards law and order within the State and I believe that the declaration of the state of emergency, the Emergency Powers Bill and the Criminal Law Bill are acceptable to the vast majority of our people. They fully support the measures being taken to put down subversives and accept that what the Government are doing is necessary for the maintenance of law and order.  I have spoken to many people in my constituency and I heard very little criticism of the measures being taken.</P>
    <P>As a young politician I would prefer to see the resources of the State being used to improve our educational system, social welfare and health services and to improve the employment situation. Deputy Barry Desmond drew the attention of the House to the fact that £35 million extra is being spent every year on security over and above the figure that would be necessary in normal times and, like him, I would prefer to see that money being spent on the improvements I have outlined. Unfortunately, subversives caused this situation and the result is that the Government cannot go ahead with the improvements they think necessary because such a huge amount of money must be spent on security and ensuring that law and order are maintained.</P>
    <P>In my view, valid reasons have been <Col N="595" /> given by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice for the introduction of the state of emergency and the legislation before the House.  I was appalled to read in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Thursday, 2nd September, in an editorial headed: &ldquo;The Emergency, Act I&rdquo; the following:</P>
    <P>So we are in a state of emergency. It's official.  No one can see it or feel it except the Government which created it and steamrolled the necessary measures through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Those sentences are most irresponsible, misleading and damaging.  The person who wrote them is more irresponsible. That type of editorial is beneath the dignity of any national newspaper and it re-echoes the sentiments of the Opposition.  They do not see the emergency but I am satisfied that the sad events I have mentioned, added together, create a state of emergency.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us will not be abused by this Government; of that I am satisfied.  We have received assurances to that effect from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice.  They told us that the measures, when they become law, will not be subject to interpretation by any Government Minister but will be implemented by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and later, if necessary, by our courts. They will not be subject to political interpretation and administrative interpretation will be by independent people.</P>
    <P>The situation in Northern Ireland is sad and when one speaks about it in this House one must give serious consideration to it.  I believe that the Northern Ireland community is split and will be split for many years to come, and further that the unity to which we aspire and the reconciliation which we view with urgency will not be easily achieved.</P>
    <P>We in this country are now ensuring that we will do our bit to ensure that subversive elements in our society will find no cause of satisfaction to be living in the Republic and will be satisfied that there is no support for their action from this <Col N="596" /> Government or indeed from the people.</P>
    <P>We in this State have much to do to help the cause of reconciliation and reunification.  Since we became a State in the earlier part of this century we have done very little to reconcile our society, our community in the South with the community in Northern Ireland.  We have done very little to bring a closer understanding of the wishes, aspirations and way of life of Catholics both here and in the North with the way of life and aspirations of the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland.  That is the main reason why we have a split situation in Northern Ireland where one community so hates the other that the situation is one of complete intolerance.</P>
    <P>The history of this House must be better in the coming years than it has been in the past 50 odd years.  In the last 50 years or so we have not really extended the hand of friendship to the North.  There have been very few genuine attempts at cross-Border understanding or, indeed, at the possible implementation of cross-Border projects.  We have been far too narrow in our interpretation of our Statehood, far too narrow in our traditions, to allow of any real movement towards reconciliation.  That is one of the saddest things in Irish life today, and it will take a brave, solid and convinced move on the part of this Government and Parliament to find a way out of the present morass that is Northern Ireland towards reconciliation. We have a responsibility, nevertheless, to be constructive and to do something, however little, to try to bring about a reconciliation.  I look to this Government to keep trying to initiate common projects which will help towards the realisation of aspirations of reconciliation with fellow Irish people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Certainly this is tough legislation, and indeed a suspension of the Constitution in respect of search and arrest and holding in custody for seven days is an incursion into personal liberties, but I am satisfied with the reasons given by the Minister and <Col N="597" /> his advice that the seven days' detention in custody is necessary while police inquiries are being completed and in order to gain convictions against enemies of the State.  I am satisfied that that is not a major incursion into personal liberty and one which the Irish people are satisfied is necessary in the present situation.  In relation to that situation one must, in looking at the Constitution, see clearly that the protection of civil liberties and individual liberties is balanced against the protection of society, and Article 28 of the Constitution provides that where society is in danger the Government have a right to protect society.  This they are doing and are not shirking their duty in doing it.  I believe in doing so that they have the support of the people.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Bill not only imposes severe penalties for inciting or inviting people to join unlawful organisations but from a number of points of view increases severely the maximum penalties on conviction. For instance, for usurpation of functions of government, obstruction of government, unauthorised military exercises, membership of unlawful organisations, holding certain public meetings&mdash;the penalties for all of these have been increased substantially. The prohibition of membership of an unlawful organisation goes from a maximum of two years' to seven years' imprisonment.  That should act as a deterrent.  One of the new offences created by the Criminal Law Bill is incitement or invitation to join an unlawful organisation.  This section has been a matter of public debate over the weekend and the Opposition oppose it and feel that it is too wide.  I believe that the Minister's speech in the House on this matter was genuine and worthy of support.  Those armchair generals and godfathers, as they have been called, should properly be guilty of a serious offence when they go about influencing the young people of this nation.  The conviction which carries a maximum of ten years, is proper.</P>
    <P>One supports this State and its institutions, and if one does not do so one is against the State, against the <Col N="598" /> way of life and the institutions of the State and against everything we have fought for and tried to develop.  It is only proper that those who are against this State should be satisfied that the State will take appropriate action against them.</P>
    <P>The other section which has caused controversy is section 15 dealing with the power of the Defence Forces to arrest and search in certain circumstances.  Needless to say, in ordinary times the introduction of such a section would be looked upon very seriously by many politicians including myself, but unfortunately we are not living in normal times.  It is proper to point out that the Defence Forces, while being given extra powers not heretofore available to them are still acting in aid of the Garda Síochána.  The powers which are defined and quite narrow, are deemed necessary, because at any point in time where you need to mount a fairly widespread blockade after a serious offence or where a serious offence is about to be committed, which is also specified, the need for the Defence Forces to help the Garda is quite clear.  I hope that when normal times return these powers would be abolished or certainly not resorted to.</P>
    <P>The Bill is quite broad and covers a wide range of activity.  It strengthens the legal position in regard to prosecutions for activities for which heretofore we were not able to prosecute properly.  The power to seize and hold articles is one which is I see as necessary.  The provision in relation to giving false information is also necessary and if one is found guilty of such an offence there is a substantial sentence.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are prepared to face up to the sad realities of the situation.  Deputy Lynch, Leader of the Opposition, said last week that we were using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  I am afraid the situation is more serious than that, and Deputy Lynch knows full well that it is.  The Deputy also described the seven days' detention in custody as a form of internment.  I <Col N="599" /> reject that statement as being irresponsible.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that we enjoy wider civil liberties than are available in many countries even within Europe at present.  We intend to protect the democracy which we are proud of and which needs protection.  It does no good for the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to say that the power of the Garda to order the detention of a person for a sustained period may lead to prolonged questioning, intimidation and even brutality or encourage belief among the public that such is the aim of this provision thus alienating the public from the Garda.  That statement coming from what is supposed to be a responsible body is totally irresponsible and it casts a slur on the integrity of the Garda.  This Government have a high regard for the Garda and a high regard for the Defence Forces and it ill behoves the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to cast such aspersions on such a dedicated force.  This council is quite entitled to publish that document and to put the case for civil liberties but on this occasion the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has gone beyond the bounds of independent judgment and has taken sides with a political motive.  It will not be to the credit of this council if it continues to issue such statements.</P>
    <P>The whole machinery of this Government is dedicated to the preservation of the State and to the prosperity of the Irish people.  It has been frustrated in a serious way in the past few years by the activities of the IRA and by their front organisation, Sinn Féin.  They are a most destructive influence on the Irish way of life and on Irish thinking.  We are right to state quite clearly what we as a Government feel should be done and to do whatever is necessary to protect Irish society and to see that subversive elements are put down and are revealed openly for public judgement. We are making our judgement and we say that the good people of this nation will be protected.  We will not hesitate at any point in time to ensure that the democracy of which I and the Irish people are proud is not <Col N="600" /> destroyed and that the people of this country can go about freely to their daily work without subversives being in their midst doing great damage by their activities of murder and pillage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Official Report there is a national emergency.  I have been looking at the gallery this week and last week and judging by the lack of interest on the part of the public, either they are in ignorance of the situation or, more likely, the public are probably right and there is no emergency, hence their lack of interest.  There is noted lack of interest in the proceedings and the performance of this House last week and particularly this week. If one looks across at the Government benches during this week or even today, where is the evidence, by the interest or lack of it, so far as the Government are concerned?  The situation is the same from the Opposition benches.  They know, of course, and have been saying that there is no emergency despite the fact that one has been recorded in the Official Report so one might excuse them for their non-attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This performance would be laughable if it was not for the serious effect that these proceedings will have on the normal freedoms of our people.  We have been told that in addition to the window dressing, which I have no doubt is a part of this performance, the Government have been advised by the Garda that there was need for these measures.  For a moment I felt that, perhaps, the gardaí at the top levels had information that would help stiffen the situation and which made it imperative for the Government to accept their advice even though one is well aware that the general body of the Garda do not want any such measures as these nor do they want to be used as it is proposed to use them and as, indeed, they have been used up to now. The proof of all this falsehood&mdash;it is nothing short of that&mdash;regarding the alleged Garda advice to the Government can surely be concretely demonstrated when I tell the House that on my most recent return from my constituency in Donegal through the Six Counties and through Monaghan I did <Col N="601" /> not see one uniform of either a garda or member of the Defence Forces on the entire trip from the time I left the British Army at Aughnacloy, and there was no road check.  That was this week, almost a week after we declared a state of national emergency.  There is no need further to underline the spurious claims that have been made here as to why and how we are in a state of emergency and have measures such as that now before us.  The emergency does not exist.</P>
    <P>One can then only wonder why we have a Government, supported by a majority of the Members of this House, recalling the Dáil and declaring an emergency that does not exist and as a result of which we have side-effects which are damaging to our wellbeing as regards tourism, our business and industry.  It has already been demonstrated that our newly declared state of emergency has prevented people from coming here for industrial and holiday purposes.  What has motivated the Government?  It is unlikely that they merely go through all of this justifying process as a method of diverting public attention from the real emergency that we might say exists economically.  That is not sufficient reason for a Government no matter how bereft of any useful plans to cure present economic ills they may be.  Can it be that they are victims of their own propaganda, propaganda which no doubt has been prompted and sponsored by overwhelming British and unionist propaganda over the years into which circle this Government moved and added further to the propaganda screen that has been thrown up? Are they bemused by their own propaganda efforts and is their obsession with the IRA blinding them to the total tragedy of our partitioned country? In charity, one might think this should be the reason.</P>
    <P>Why has there been no proscription of the UVF, the UFF, the UDA and the National Front so far as we know and many others whose names I do not recall?  It is anything but honest to talk about the emergency that does not exist but which we have brought into being by a declaration of the Houses of the Oireachtas and <Col N="602" /> then follow it up with these measures &mdash;particularly the one we are now discussing&mdash;and have the whole emphasis on IRA violence and nothing else with an odd aside when they catch themselves on, such as &ldquo;and others&rdquo;. Can we, in truth, ignore other organisations apart from those I have mentioned, such as the discarded UDC and the British Army, their agents, the SAS and such people?  What are we going to do about these and their incursions here both in and out of uniform their armed incursions and their pleas that they did not know that they had crossed the Border? What are we doing with those we did take in on the Newry-Omeath border and to whom we then gave VIP treatment by flying them back to where they came from?  I suppose we shall fly them down when the time comes, if it ever does, to answer whatever charges there are or may be laid against them for crossing our Border, heavily armed at a point where even a blind man would not have mistaken the fact that he was crossing a border because there were physical obstacles there.  With an allegedly disciplined force such as the British Army whose primary job is to look after security in the Six Counties which includes all territory up to within the last inch of the Border with ourselves, it goes beyond a joke to hear the defence being made that they did not know they had crossed, that it was an error.</P>
    <P>This is happening every day&mdash;are we doing anything about it?  Are we legislating for that type of occurrence? If not, we should be.  No, the self-induced obsession is there from the pro-Unionist and pro-British propaganda of which we get our daily dose from all quarters on this side of the Border.  If we want to get even an inkling of what goes on in the Six Counties, so far as radio and television are concerned&mdash;no fault of the personnel who work there &mdash;we must tune in to the BBC, the television organ of the British themselves who have been mounting a propaganda campaign.  We see so little merit in having the truth known that we just black out everything.  We have <Col N="603" /> a mad scramble now and again when the cross-Channel television people show up something and we go scurrying off for the next bulletin to find pictures which may be supplied by the BBC of some event we have not screened, obviously under instructions from the Government through the board.  We try to make up for it then by screening what we have not got by borrowing from the BBC.</P>
    <P>What then is all this about?  Have we stopped to think of what we are doing in these phoney circumstances of an emergency situation that does not truly exist but which has been declared by the Houses of the Oireachtas to exist?  Have we asked ourselves how can we countenance the excesses of the British Army of occupation in the Six Counties, thinking only of some of the highlights of these excesses such as the Derry massacre?  Can we not ask ourselves what are we trying to do and to whom and in whose interest is this operation being mounted?  Can we think of the excesses of the British Army in the Six Counties, the Derry massacre, the shooting of young McElhone by the same army, the much more recent shooting of the child, O'Hare, and realise that in everything we are proposing and everything that has been said about what we are proposing by way of legislation is all beamed at persons other than the British Army and organisations such as the UDA, the UDR, the UVF and the National Front?  We do not even seem to be aware at all that the early effort at blowing up the hydro-electric station at Ballyshannon and Catherine Falls was attempted by a member or members of one of these Six-County based organisations.  Yet membership of any of these organisations is not in itself a crime on this side of the Border.  There is no operation such as we have here in our courts in regard to the IRA.  There is no such thing as a chief superintendent giving it as his opinion that any person is a member of any of these organisations which I have mentioned and several others that should be proscribed if we are, in fact, interested in protecting ourselves from those who would do us damage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> How can we expect the public in general to have any regard for any laws we pass here that ignore these sad effects of the excesses of the British Army and of the RUC?  They are still the same RUC that were denounced and described by various organs and people on both sides of the Border as other than an impartial police-keeping force, and that is being charitable as compared with some of the things that were said about them.  It is also charitable in view of the fact that at the hearing of our torture case in Europe the evidence given by that particular force was found to be blatantly untrue.  These are still members of this particular force and we are not only ignoring the fact that they exist but we are proposing in this legislation, as in other legislation that preceded it, to work hand in glove with them.  How can anybody square that as being in the interests of this country or acceptable to the people?  How can we be other than discredited, as these forces have been discredited, in the eyes of our own public when we propose to join forces with them?</P>
    <P>The RUC were around when the Bogside was on.  The RUC were around when Burntollet was on.  The B Specials were there.  They were much in evidence at Burntollet and in the Bogside.  Where are they now? They are in the UDR and the UDR are part and parcel of the security forces in the Six Counties today. These are the people with whom we propose to work by passing these Bills in order that we may the better collaborate with them.  Collaboration it is.  All three bodies, whether in the guise of the UDR or the B Specials and the British Army, including the notorious SAS, are the occupation forces of part of our country and any dealings by our Government and our security forces with these is collaboration. In other countries in other times those responsible for such collaboration were tried as war criminals, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>It makes sad and sorry reading to find that this is the situation in which we find ourselves, damaging our country's image outside, an image that has already been damaged <Col N="605" /> enough by a declaration of a national emergency in the circumstances I have described, purely and simply because of the Government's obsession with a violence emanating from no quarter except the IRA.  They are ignoring the reason why there is violence, ignoring the fact that it is the excesses and violence of the forces I have mentioned, supported in the earlier years by the Stormont Government and backed up and supported by the British Government now, which is where the root cause is.  It is in that direction we should be bending our energies and utilising the time of the House, whether by special recall or in normal sitting.  It is in that direction we should be using ourselves and this House in every way possible in an effort to find the way to eliminate the root cause and not just one of the side effects to the exclusion of all other side effects.</P>
    <P>Where is the support for this declaration of a state of emergency now?  It has been demonstrated by the absences from this House and the non-attendance of the public that there is no acceptance of the alleged emergency.  Where has there been any volume of public opinion supporting the declaration?  Why should we continue in session this week?  Should we not on the publication of the torture report have called a halt at that stage, taken a look at ourselves, transposed ourselves back to the days when we raised this case of torture by the Establishment and occupation forces in the Six Counties?  We have been pursuing the torture case for five years.  If publication of the report were not enough, then surely Mr. Rees's unwarranted and cheeky attack on this Government for having pursued the matter should have impelled us to pause, instead of coming back here to discuss these matters, until we had another look at what he meant.</P>
    <P>Far from taking any objection to what he had to say, what do we find &mdash;the most degrading performance of all time by an Irish Government, allegedly speaking on behalf of the Irish people, following Rees's unwarranted attack.  We find an apology, by <Col N="606" /> way of a statement, from the Irish Government and almost a plea that, disregarding what would have happened in regard to the torture case and its report, we would be no worse friends in the future.  That double operation last week, on the one hand, by Mr. Rees, representing Her Majesty's Government, and the statement made on behalf of our Government truly underlines that which I had fondly hoped and believed had begun to disappear in recent years: our traditional, but understandable, inferiority complex <i>vis-á-vis</i> Britain; when, on the other hand, the superiority complex of our conquerors and occupiers was beginning to disappear.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the publication of the findings of the torture report, which found heavily in favour of the charges made by this Government some years ago against the excesses of the British Army and the RUC in the Six Counties, to find a British Minister getting up and having the gall to criticise those who took that case is damn cheek.  It displays the traditional superiority complex the British have developed over the years of occupation of our country.  While we cannot be expected to change that superiority complex developed as a result of their long occupation and kicking around of our people, we are responsible for the abysmal, crawling statement of our Government accepting our inferior status <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain.  That statement was made in the aftermath of the publication of that report on our case, a case we won clearly on so many counts that the British have red faces all over the world.  The only place they can shove up their noses is on this island; they have not a nose or a head to lift in any other country in the world.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy is referring will doubtless be discussed in this House in due course.  This is not the time to go into detail on that report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into detail, as the Chair will understand. What I am referring to is the gall of a British Minister telling us we never should have taken that case, which having been taken and tortuously pursued <Col N="607" /> in Europe over the last five years, was well and truly proven, to the disgrace of the British and the British Government who are responsible for the actions of their own forces.  We had a member of that Government chiding us for having done so, saying: &ldquo;Let us forget about it now; it is untimely.&rdquo; I wonder does our Minister for Foreign Affairs not agree with most of what I am saying in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree that the showing of a superiority complex on one side is any reason for the Deputy to display his inferiority complex on the other, which I do not share in regard to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fairly typical of the gentleman who occupies the very important post of Foreign Minister. I suppose it is a further indication of our grovelling inferiority so long as the Minister for Foreign Affairs can cavort and mix with those whom he regards as his betters, although I do not so regard them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything is rosy in the garden; do not let us do anything to offend those who would trample us in the dust, as they have done, for centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event neither I nor the people of this country have any apology to make for the case taken to Europe and proven to the embarrassment of the British Government and their forces in the Six Counties. It was long past time they were caught out.  The only remaining question is: does their being caught out in this case give us any assurance that similar happenings are not now taking place, or will not in the future, judging by that recently departed, acrobatic Unionist of various views, for whom I have a great deal of admiration because of his political agility over the years?  From him we had the comment that he believed that what was done was necessary at the time and, on being pressed, he <Col N="608" /> added that he would do the same again.  However, I do not think he will ever have an opportunity of participating in anything like the same again but, if he should, I hope he will have learned sense.  Incidentally I am speaking about Mr. Brian Faulkner who was interviewed here on television and radio after the emergence of that report.</P>
    <P>Might we expect from the Minister, even at this late stage, a statement as to what is the real necessity for this declaration of emergency? We have listened to the waffle that has gone on here which is codding nobody.  The people who made the waffle did not believe it themselves&mdash; a hollow, empty-sounding waffle it is, trying to justify something that has been agreed already, with heads counted, before we were recalled and will now be put through by the majority in this House, commanded by the Whips of the two parties forming the Coalition despite the fact that we have had the stomach-upsetting spectacle of quite a number of those who have spoken from the Government benches.  Not only have they spoken to support that to which they are already committed&mdash;and will undoubtedly, to the last man, vote for&mdash;but they have taken time off to come in and criticise what is in this measure in a very authoritative and well-learned sort of manner.  It is a disgusting performance when one considers that the very critics of the measure are the people putting it through.  They are coming in having a bob each way, backing it and sticking with the Government; trying to delude their supporters who do not agree with the whole charade taking place here; trying to placate them by being able to point perhaps to yesterday's, today's, tomorrow's or next week's papers, or to the Official Report of this House if they do not succeed in getting themselves publicised through the media, in order to point out that they were against it.</P>
    <P>It is a rare situation, and this a national emergency, something about which there should be real concern, if not near panic.  This is as quiet a House as I have ever seen, as ill-attended <Col N="609" /> as I have ever witnessed and, as for the public interest in it, it is practically non-existent.  These are unnecessary and dangerous measures being put through this House, dangerous in addition to taking away the rights to which our people are entitled in any sort of near normal circumstances. We have those people shoving those measures through, things which can in themselves create a situation in the future that could be much nearer to a national emergency than any that has arisen so far.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister and the Government as well: what is the major difference between now and last year or the year before?  I would ask them particularly what is the major difference in circumstances today compared with November, 1972, when those who now comprise the Government parties attacked vigorously, strenuously and effectively the proposals of the then Fianna Fáil Government with regard to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act.  Their attack then was based effectively on their assertions about and quotations from the then existing laws available to our security forces.  From the Opposition benches which they then occupied they declared roundly and vehemently that the laws obtaining prior to enactment of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act were sufficient if operated by the Government through the agencies of the Garda and the Army.</P>
    <P>The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act went on the Statute Book as a result of the action of members of the Fine Gael Party.  With the rumblings of the bombs that were very conveniently planted down town at that time they turned tail and bolted from the stance they had taken which they could have carried against the Fianna Fáil Government that night.  In panic they fled, all but a very few of them, into the lobby with Fianna Fáil to put through a measure that one hour beforehand some of their front bench spokesmen had said was not necessary but was an infringement and an imposition on the rights of the public.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have added <Col N="610" /> further legislation that was not available to the Fianna Fáil Government in 1972.  We have the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act with all its trimmings and trappings.  That is a major addition to the weapons available to the Government and to the security forces to maintain law and order on our side of the Border.  I ask what major difference is there now in the circumstances obtaining here as against those obtaining prior to November, 1972?  I assert there is no major difference that would favour the introduction of any further legislation, not to mention the declaration of a national emergency.</P>
    <P>The situation in 1972 was more dangerous than can be seen to exist in 1976.  We must take into account the additional legislation passed since 1972, add it to what was considered by the then Opposition to be more than sufficient in 1972 and then consider the situation obtaining in the island as a whole in 1972 as against the much lower tempo in 1976.  Will we get some explanation why this extraordinary package has been presented to the House?</P>
    <P>It might fairly be asked what is the purpose in allowing a debate on this matter.  What is the purpose when it is evident that members on the Government benches will carry this measure through?  Regardless of what their heads or their hearts may say, their feet will go through the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; lobby in order to put these measures through. Why bother with the debate?  Why bother having Deputies recalled?  Why bother recalling staff from their holidays when a front bench member of the Government in my presence last night said that the Government would not change one iota so far as anything contained in the package was concerned? If that is the attitude, our being here is a greater farce by far than we might have realised.  If there is no chance of one iota of change being made as a result of any good arguments that may be put forward, why waste the time of the House, the staff and the time of the Seanad?  If that is the situation the Government might as well have presented us with the three pieces of legislation and told us to put them through <Col N="611" /> in an evening.  The emergency might have been more real if that had been done, it might have bamboozled and panicked people into believing that something existed that does not exist. But no: we go through this farcical operation of discussion and various Stages and the circulation of amendments but it is all summed up by the statement of the Minister for Defence yesterday that the Government would not change one iota of the package. That is the law and order Government. That is the democratic Government. That is the Government whose members laud themselves for their democratic ways, who make excuses and give such reasons as preserving democracy for introducing measures like this.</P>
    <P>I do not know how they can do this.  I cannot comprehend in the slightest degree how people such as the present occupant of the front bench&mdash;I instance him merely because he is here&mdash;can adopt such an attitude in view of his declared views two or three years ago.  Now they are going in the opposite direction in a mad stampede but by so doing they are not adding to our security.  In fact, they are hoping to provoke a situation that will be anything but secure.</P>
    <P>I challenged the Minister for Justice on other occasions on some of his other efforts.  Is he looking for trouble?  Is he trying to make trouble for all those who in any way display republican tendencies?  I put it as broadly and as widely as that.  Is this what this measure is intended for, when other efforts have failed to date?  Are the Minister for Justice and the Government seeking what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs asserted yesterday was the aim of the Provisionals, not just withdrawal but armed victory?  Are the Government seeking to provide a confrontation with all those who have republican sympathies and tendencies or who express themselves in that way?  Are they looking for a confrontation with all of those people so that the Government may have an armed victory? Is that their purpose in an effort to salvage their declining political chances in the future?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> It is difficult to credit that any Government would be so irresponsible even to contemplate any such operation for any motive no matter how high and especially for the base and low motive of preserving their own political chances in the future. That seems to be too far-fetched a supposition to be considered but because of the failure on the part of the Government to answer the question I and others have been asking, and which I have repeated today, because of their lack of effort to justify the declaration of a national emergency, we must see other reasons for their performance even if those other evils may appear far-fetched. But we must seek reasons that are far-fetched when we fail to get from the Government any plausable reason for the proposals contained in this measure.  Various speakers have asked repeatedly for such information but it has not been forthcoming.  Consequently, our worst fears are confirmed&mdash;that the Government are aware that there is no need for these measures, that the very operation of them can mean nothing but the forcing of our Garda and Army personnel into the role of collaborator with the occupiers in this country.  To be charitable that is the least one can deduct from the absence of any explanation but if one wished to be uncharitable one could go a long way in suggesting why the measures are being put through.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Desmond told us that his contribution would be brief we heard from him at some length. One of the few remarks from his speech that I considered worth remembering was his reference to an abnormal situation and his going on to talk of the incalculable loss to the country as a result of this declaration of a state of emergency.  He went on to talk about a normal situation&mdash; normal in the sence of getting rid of the IRA.  A Deputy for whom I have much regard, Deputy Eddie Collins, is obsessed, too, with this notion. Coming from Waterford he is far removed from the Border and its troubles.  No doubt, he has been brainwashed by the Government's <Col N="613" /> propaganda to the point where he can see none but IRA violence.</P>
    <P>Do the Government realise how the measures they are proposing here can constitute violence for those of us who are near the Border, how in the application of the extraordinary powers they are taking, those of us who already have had more than enough experience of the Establishment-type violence will be saddled, too, with the violence of this Establishment because to be interfered with in the manner proposed here is to be subjected to violence?  The majority of Deputies here are a considerable distance from the Border.  Consequently, they have no experience of the daily inconvenience that the Border has been and always will be regardless of whether there are British army checkpoints in operation. Do those Deputies have any appreciation of what it is like to live along a Border in one's own country in circumstances in which to cross the road leaves them allegedly in alien territory where there are customs checks, restrictions of various kinds and approved or unapproved roads? These are the daily operations that people in the Border area experience, regardless of whether they are north or south of that boundary.  Those Deputies to whom I refer can have no idea of how depressing it is for those people who, throughout their lives, must endure these inconveniences in their daily routine.  Yet these are the circumstances which Deputy Barry Desmond would regard as normal.  Apparently these are the times to which we are attempting to revert.</P>
    <P>The measures before us are directed solely towards bringing us back to what are regarded as normal times and to an acceptance of our inferior position as an occupied people.  While it is all very well for the unionists and the extremists to regard such circumstances as being normal it is nauseating to find the Government, acting on behalf of the people of the Twenty-six Counties, directing their energy towards a return to the situation that I have described.  Is it any wonder that many of us have long since given <Col N="614" /> up any hope of there being an appreciation by the general body of our people of the difficulties, of the repression and of the depression that have resulted from the partition of this country?  To those far removed from the Border the situation seems fine because it does not interfere with their happy little set up.  They do not want to know about it, but it is there and will continue to be there regardless of any of this sort of jazz here today, unless and until we put as much energy and enthusiasm as we are putting into this measure into finding measures whereby we can eradicate the cause by getting rid of the occupier and ultimately being able to live as Irish men and women at peace in our own land.  That should be our ultimate goal rather than trying, for whatever spurious reasons, to dampen down the volcano just for this year, just for our time, without regard to the fact that it will erupt again and that the harder it is dampened down the greater will be the effect when it erupts, that is, if it is capable of being dampened down at all which I doubt very much.</P>
    <P>In fairness to all concerned, however, let the Government go after the UVF, the UDA, the UFF, the National Front, the British Army, the SAS, the UDR, the old B Specials, the RUC and all those who would adhere to them and are fellow travellers with any of those organisations. Let the Government lump in all those organisations in their determination to wipe out violence.  If they ignore them, as they are doing, and concentrate solely on the IRA, where will it get them?  Their last state will be worse than their first.  Even if the Government recognise what they have been keeping at the back of their minds and ignoring, that violence has been part and parcel of Partition and the occupation of our country by the British Army, they could never go back to the norm, pre '69, or pre the outbreak of the present serious trouble.  Too many people who had not a notion of what went on there are aware now to a greater or lesser degree what has gone on, and whether they be Members of the <Col N="615" /> Government, Members of this House or merely people outside or people in influential positions, they will never again be able to ignore the situation and let it go back to what was regarded as normal.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Government that if they had any sence they would drop this package.  The dropping of it, even without an explanation, would be the best thing that could happen in this country so that we could switch over tomorrow morning to debating the real emergency situation, that is, our economic and financial situation.  There could be a full scale debate on that, not with a view to knocking the Government but with a view to gleaning ideas and suggestions from all sides of the House, from the back benches as well as the front, which might save us from the chaos and economic disaster we are undoubtedly heading for.  I think such a step would be accepted by the public as dealing with the real emergency that faces us.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs here yesterday trying to extricate himself from some of the troubles into which he has talked himself both in recent days and in days far gone.  During his extrication performance he had some strange things to say.  He quoted a letter from <i>The Irish Press</i> which was from a file of cuttings on which he was chiding that newspaper for taking him to task on keeping.  The comings and goings between himself and <i>The Irish Press</i> are of little consequence and concern to me, but through it all there emerged this gem of thought.  When at first I heard him giving this excerpt I thought gladly it was from an editorial, which would have restored some of my faith in the said newspaper, but no, it was a letter, but even for that much thanks, as an indication that they will occasionally publish such a letter, whether it is to try to hold on to some of their circulation that may have been leaving them or whether it is a genuine effort on the part of their editorial and management staff to display both sides of the coin, I do not know.  However, the <Col N="616" /> Minister for Posts and Telegraphs quoted this letter as the sort of thing that would not be on under the terms of this Bill that deals with incitement, propaganda, encouraging people to join illegal organisations and so on. He gave it as an extreme example and as something so extraordinarily far out that clamping down on such a thing would not be any difficulty at all for a normal news medium.  Nevertheless, he went on to say, in effect, that while it was an example of the sort of thing that should not and would not be allowed to be published without the penalties under the Bill being visited on the owners of the paper, the papers would not be liable for such punishment because they could not publish such letters because they would be afraid that the papers would not have the sentences and penalties of the section on incitement visited on them because they would not publish that sort of letter.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of logic we can expect from this Government.  We are assured that there is no need to fear the provisions of the Bill because people will not break the law because they will be afraid.  These are our assurances, and so everybody should be happy.  That is to be gathered from what the learned Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had to say yesterday during his apology, as it were, for his excess of some days ago and indeed some years ago.</P>
    <P>It was said here today that following his statement to <i>The Washington Post</i> the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs paid a compulsory visit to the Taoiseach in an effort to straighten the record, and I saw a Minister on the front bench smile and cover the evidence of his mirth with his hand.  It struck me as rather peculiar that that Minister should find this so amusing.  The Fianna Fáil speaker may have been correct in his assessment of events.  Statements which apparently do not conform with the Government's thinking on some vital matters and whose logic is rather questionable and open to misinterpretation are dangerous for any Government.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Minister for Posts and <Col N="617" /> Telegraphs meant something else. Possibly he will tell the House shortly exactly what he meant.  Yesterday he explained his thinking in 1972 and some of the statements he made in his interview with <i>The Washington Post.</i> Perhaps the second instalment will be the true and real one and we will come to understand what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs really meant in his contribution here yesterday.</P>
    <P>It was very interesting to listen to the same Minister yesterday when he retracted to a large degree his assertions of the recent past that anyone who seeks a declaration of intent by the British to withdraw from the Six Counties is a Provo, and he particularly apologised to the Fianna Fáil Party for attributing to them almost general membership of the Provos since they made known their view that they agreed that a declaration of intent to withdraw by the British Government is a necessary start to the settlement of the Partition problem.</P>
    <P>He still asserts, as he is entitled to do, that any such declaration of intent would trigger off a bloody civil war.  I want to place on record that I totally and absolutely disagree with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his reasoning on this matter.  It is that type of statement, that type of attitude displayed by members of this Government which I believe is the greatest deterrent to the British Government declaring their intentions.</P>
    <P>I must state that I object to the fact that the Minister's view receives such a large amount of publicity in the media, particularly on radio and television.  I say this deliberately to RTE and to some of the newspapers. We have heard the Minister's view so many times over the years that it is no longer news that needs to be repeated monthly or weekly.  The repeated reporting of the Minister's opinion that a declaration of intent by the British Government would trigger off a civil war can only be regarded as propaganda, not news.  I would appeal to the newspapers and to RTE, despite the connection between RTE and the Minister, not to become propaganda media for the <Col N="618" /> Minister in this very serious matter. There is no general acceptance of the Minister's point of view and it is doing irreparable damage and is delaying the end of our troubles, the declaration of intent to withdraw by the British Government.  If there is no validity in that view, its repeated expression is inhibiting that which we all desire, which is peace in our own land.</P>
    <P>I also take exception to and want to point out the dangers of accepting assurances from a Minister, no matter how well intentioned those assurances may be, regarding any fears expressed in respect of any part of this proposed legislation, as to how it will not be used or how a particular section may be utilised.  No assurances by the Minister reduces or adds to any section in this or any other Bill.  No statement no matter in what good faith it is made by any Minister in respect of any provision of this or any other Bill is worth the paper of the Dáil record on which it will be transcribed.  No statement of the intention behind any provision of this or any other Bill, no declaration by any Minister no matter how well intentioned he may be or in what good faith it may be made is worth the paper of the Dáil record.  We know from experience that the courts not only insist on their own interpretation of the lines, sentences, words, commas and full stops but even the words, commas and full stops that are not there.  With a great deal of pride the courts, from the lowest to the top level of the Supreme Court, interpret the actual words provided on the Statute Book regardless of the effects of their interpretations or how far removed they may be from the declared intentions of the Government of the time, or even from the ordinary sense one would expect to have been read into it.  That does not come into it as we have found out over the years.  It is ultimately determined by final examination of the words and their meanings, in the legal sense, regardless of the stated intentions, of anything or anybody else by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to the Minister, <Col N="619" /> his assurances to allay fears expressed in regard to dangers are of no consequence whatsoever.  Accepting that these assurances may be given by the Minister in all good faith, he would be the first to agree that his assurances and the statement of the intention behind any proposed form of words set down here as part of a Bill are of no consequence and are not a substitute for making changes where he agrees they would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Let us get away from this idea that we can by assurances and statement of intentions have our cake and eat it. That is a waste of time.  It is misleading and might have serious consequences on people who may be affected in future by some part of this or some other measure.  A person may have relied on these assurances because he did not know any better.  He may take it that when the Minister, who is piloting the Bill through the House, assures us that it means this or that, the public do not know that these assurances do not matter a hoot and need not necessarily conform to the actual application of the particular provision about which the assurances were given.</P>
    <P>There are strange points mentioned in the Minister's introductory speech. He said:</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation, the maximum penalty for which is two years, a maximum which the Bill proposes to raise to seven years.  I am aware that the point has been made more than once in recent times that such a proposal is irrelevant in view of the fact that the courts seldom if ever impose the present maximum.  I mention this point because it is one that calls for an answer.  I am satisfied that there is an answer and a good one and it is this.  The courts, when deciding on a penalty have to take account of the fact that a particular maximum is prescribed by law and it is a fair assumption that they look on that maximum as something that ought to be reserved for the exceptional <Col N="620" /> circumstances&mdash;what one might describe as the worst cases as shown by the evidence before them. If, however, the Oireachtas decides to increase that maximum substantially, the courts are then discharging their functions in a new framework and they can, and I have no doubt will, take account not only of the wider discretion allowed by the new law but also of the clear intentions of the Oireachtas as to the inherent seriousness of the crime.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point which is recurring in this Bill, that is, the absolutely crazy increase in prison sentences.  The Minister's attitude to this is that the maximum was not being used by the judges as he would like them to use it and, therefore, he pressurises them into sentencing people for a longer period in jail for an offence which had a maximum of two years, but now it could be seven years or 20 years.  Many sentences have been increased by 1,000 per cent.  The Minister feels this is a good thing.  He is codding the judges by saying that 20 years, ten years or seven years is the maximum.  He is telling them they are not applying the maximum, even though the Oireachtas regard these crimes as extremely serious.  Indeed, they regard them so seriously as to increase the maximum from two years to 20 years.  Instead of giving them a year, the judges are now being put on notice that the Oireachtas take a serious view of the matter and have multiplied the maximum by ten, seven six or five and expect them to do likewise.</P>
    <P>In this way we try to bamboozle the Judiciary into doing what we, the Oireachtas, would seem to intend them to do rather than what they in their judicial capacity have been determining to do.  They are entitled to determine in future what they will do.  The Minister believes he can lead the Judiciary by the nose in regard to these offences and penalties by outlandishly increasing the sentences as against what they were, so that by so crazily multiplying the maximum he will create a situation in the minds of the Judiciary that maybe two years <Col N="621" /> was not enough.  If it should be a case that is one of the worst that could occur, under any provision in this measure he will slap on 20 years.  The Minister's approach in this regard is at variance with what he would defend as the independent status of the Judiciary without being pressured or intimidated by the Government of the day.  What does the Minister mean in the first paragraph of page 3 of his brief other than an indication that, one way or another, we are going to get the judges to do something that in their wisdom they have not been doing up to now, that we do it by subterfuge, by giving exaggerated penalties in order that the judges may give realistic ones?  In fairness, that is what can be taken from what the Minister said.  I do not know whether it is what he intended to say.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the increased sentences.  In section 2 there is a litany of penalties for offences under the Act of 1939.  In subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) the multiple of ten is used in regard to the increases in fines and the increases in terms of imprisonment.  I can understand that a 1939 fine of £50 should be increased to £500 today. It is not so excessively increased as to be out of the realms of credibility.  The reason for not taking umbrage in regard to such an increase is the fact that our money has swiftly depreciated. But surely the Government do not believe that time has in some mystical fashion depreciated and that a 20-year penalty is equal in severity to a penalty of two years in 1939.  Have the Government gone mad or are they allowing one or two Ministers who are mad to run the show?</P>
    <P>Imagine substituting a penalty of 20 years for a two-year penalty, £500 fines and 12 months instead of three months&mdash;all of these for offences outlined in the 1939 Act, all no different from the offences being provided for almost 37 years ago.</P>
    <P>The tendency in the intervening 37 years has been that, far from multiplying prison sentences for an offence that carried two years in 1939, we should be going in the opposite direction. This multiplication of sentences is all the more staggering when you consider <Col N="622" /> that the general tendency has been to go in the opposite direction. What appals me is that these 20 years are thrown out like snuff at a wake and are no doubt to be taken with the intentions expressed by the Minister for Justice at page 3 of his brief, which would seem to indicate a lack of appreciation of the value or judgment of the Judiciary in the application of the law.  Apart from that, when you consider that the sentence of life for premeditated murder averages seven years how can you seriously talk about increasing a two-year sentence to 20 years?  Who is being codded?  What sort of outlook is indicated by the approach of the Minister and the Government?  I thought it was a misprint until I saw it in four sections.  We can understand the depreciation in the value of money but time served in jail by any person is as long as it was 50 years ago.  In 1939 and 1972 a two-year sentence was regarded as sufficient.  This was part of the law available to the then Fianna Fáil Government who were criticised by the members of the present Government on the basis that, without the amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, the Fianna Fáil Party had enough law at its disposal.  A great part of that law was what section 2 represented in the 1939 Act.  The sentences in those cases were two years and from that down to three months.  Now we have 20 years instead of two years right down to one year instead of three months, which sentences were sufficient in 1939 and were held to be sufficient in pre-November, 1972.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not be able to talk his way out of this because that would be a physical impossibility.  He will probably give us some reason which will make partly credible his attempt under section 2 to have the sentences multiplied by ten.  Perhaps he will give us some reason which will enable us to accept that he has not gone over the top.  That is the best he can do.  He cannot talk his way out of it, and he cannot talk the rest of us into it, because it is so daft, so unreasonable, and so exaggerated against the background of his own attitude in 1972.  He was here in 1972 <Col N="623" /> although, like myself, he was not here in 1939.  If what was there in the 1939 Act was more than enough in 1972, why should the ten times multiplication table be added since then?  We would be interested to know that.</P>
    <P>There is something in section 1 to which I want particularly to draw the Minister's attention.  I doubt that it is intended, but it is in keeping with the practice of this Government in their peace-keeping efforts during their time in office.  The definition of &ldquo;unlawful organisation&rdquo; is an organisation which is an unlawful organisation within the meaning and for the purposes of the Act of 1939. I take it that blurb really means it is an organisation which has been proscribed because of the type of its operations.  I want to know why that proscription has been applied so sparingly not only by this Government but by the previous Government. Naturally, the present Government cannot be answerable for the previous Government's selective use of their powers under the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which bothers me quite a bit.  Others have raised it in various ways, but I do not think we have got any clarity on it from any speaker from the Government front bench as yet. It occurs in a few places but notably in section 7.  Paragraph (f) reads: &ldquo;seize and retain for testing anything that he has in his possession.&rdquo; That &ldquo;anything&rdquo; might be tied very closely to the testing, in other words, to retain anything for testing.  The word &ldquo;anything&rdquo; recurs in another way in another section.  The Minister does not help matters in regard to the alarming wording used in section 7 (1) (f).  He makes things even worse in his introductory speech when he says: &ldquo;The new section provides for the issue of a warrant in respect of any evidence&mdash;section 29 only covered documentary evidence.&rdquo; That is section 29 of the 1939 Act. Section 7 gives power to seize and retain for testing anything the person who is being searched has in his possession.  Section 5 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>A search warrant under this section shall operate to authorise <Col N="624" /> the member of the Garda Síochána named in the warrant, accompanied by any members of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces, to enter, within one week from the date of the warrant, and if necessary by the use of force, any building or part of a building or any vehicle, vessel, aircraft or hovercraft or any other place named in the warrant, and to search it and any person found there, and to seize anything found there or on such person.</P>
    <P>Without any question that is much wider.  There is more there than meets the eye.  It is significant that the word &ldquo;anything&rdquo; occurs in two separate sections.  Had it been in one only, perhaps we could accept that it was not intended and was merely a slip.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs mentioned Crossmaglen.  His contribution was extraordinary in various respects.  Perhaps we should expect the extraordinary from him, but the Government front bench is hardly the place for it.  He was chiding those who criticised the Government for the measures now being put through this House as in any way interfering with the rights of individuals.  He justified them in a most extraordinary fashion.  He invited anybody who felt critical of the Government's proposals to go and visit Crossmaglen and there to witness the pistol whipping, the knee-capping and the capital punishment without trial.  As a result of that he felt people would come back cured and of the frame of mind that they would not blame the Government for what they are proposing to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Extraordinary, is the only way one can describe the effort on the part of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to justify what his Government are doing by referring people to the absolutely abnormal situation obtaining in Crossmaglen.  He suggested that people who would go there to see what is happening would do so at their peril.  He dared people to go there and said they would come back convinced that the Government should not be blamed for this package. <Col N="625" /> He seemed to imply by that invitation that the Government are not entitled to do these things but are more entitled to do them because of what is being done in Crossmaglen. It is an extraordinary thing but, I suppose, he is an extraordinary man. That was one of the few things worth noting in the contribution by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The years that are being shot in in this Bill are just daft if they were not going to be very serious for somebody somewhere.  Perhaps the judges, in their good sense will, take the daftness of the ten times multiplication of prison sentences into account and will not be pressured by what seems to be the intentions of the Oireachtas in passing this in its draft form. Perhaps they will use their own discretion in the matter.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 5 dealing with misleading information bothers me.  For giving a wrong name or address a person can now be sentenced to five years in prison.  That is a fairly onerous undertaking and I can see people, if this is passed, writing their names and addresses on cards and rushing to the nearest garda station to have them recorded lest at some stage for one reason or another they are held not to have co-operated fully. It could happen that at some stage they may not be in a proper shape to give their name and address as required by this section. If they give a wrong, misleading or inaccurate address they are subject to having a permanent address for five years thereafter.  It is an extraordinary penalty and one which I cannot see being justified.  In this case the five times tables were used because under the 1939 Act the maximum sentence was 12 months.  Again, there has been a devaluation in time, as well as in money, in the Government's estimation because five years is now equivalent to what 12 months was in 1939.  It is a rare time we live in.  The Government can feel anything but proud of being a Government responsible for the devaluing of money and now the devaluing of time.  Not even I would attempt to <Col N="626" /> hang that one on them but for the fact that they appear to be proving this by their exercise in this and other sections in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the powers to retain articles seized and I should like to know what the law is at present in regard to articles seized.  In what way is it defective?  In what way does it require to be amended or added to in order to make it as useful as could be expected in so far as prosecutions might be concerned?  There seems to be no limit in time on articles or properties seized in pursuance of a prosecution.  This section is thought necessary by some but I do not know why it is nor can I understand why we should have this big hooha about bringing in powers for the Garda to stop, search and arrest.  It is amazing how informative the Minister for Justice has become quite suddenly in telling us that the Garda did not have this power, legally, up to now although they were exercising such a power. It is a rare admission for a Minister to make but it was done only, we suspect, to advance his case for bringing in now what he proposes.  It is only now we know that the Garda did not have any right to do the things they have been doing with his knowledge, and, no doubt, with his encouragement. The public were not informed at any stage, despite the illegal and unlawful infringement by the Garda in stopping and searching them, of the true position.  The Minister and the Government must have known for a long time that these things were going on daily.  The Minister and the Government deserve a hard kick for allowing and encouraging such a situation to continue.  They would have allowed it to continue indefinitely were it not for the fact that the Minister now wishes to blow a hole in the procedure by informing the public and this House that it was not legal to do this and he wants to make it legal for them to do it now.</P>
    <P>In that regard the Minister and the Government have been inciting the police force to break the law and it was done religiously daily with the connivance and the encouragement of the Minister.  An apology is needed for this or the Minister should at least <Col N="627" /> justify his action in this regard.  When we think of that we must doubt his assertion that he needs this new law to enable these things to be done legally and effectively.  It is a rare comment on the honesty of our Administration that, by their own admission, their agents, our police force, participated in and perpetrated on the public visitations by way of stop and search that were totally without legal support. That is comment enough of the Government's lack of consideration for the public.  It shows their contempt for the public on whose votes they depend to be here.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reasonable force&rdquo; is used in section 8 (3).  What does that mean? Rather more pertinent, what will it mean if put into this enactment?  Who is to be the judge of &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo;?  What will reasonable force really mean?  Surely it cannot mean an aid to performances, maybe in very isolated cases&mdash;but isolated cases even though few would be too many &mdash;of some repetition of that over which we took the British to task for the behaviour of their peace-keeping forces in the Six Counties some five years ago.  If it is not absolutely necessary to have that there, if it is not possible to define what it is with some reasonable accuracy, then there is danger inherent in providing such a power in an unqualified manner. While it will not be taken advantage of in 99 per cent of cases we cannot afford to risk that it might be taken advantage of in 1 per cent of cases or even a fraction of 1 per cent of cases.  We will have to be most careful of this.  I ask the Minister what does reasonable force mean?  Why do we have this provision since the powers given under the various measures proposed in this Bill without question seem to provide sufficient power to the Garda in the pursuance of their duties to have done that which the law says they are entitled to do?  To write &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo; into various sections of this Bill seems to be contemplating something specific in addition to what powers the law already would give to the members of the Garda in these various circumstances.  Why has that <Col N="628" /> provision been put in?  What does it mean?  Can it be limited, defined, made safe?  That is the important aspect of it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a rare one.  It conjures up some rather rare situations that could take place.  It is the section which deals with prohibition of possession of photographs and so on of certain buildings.  I can see a fellow coming in from abroad or from another town into any of our towns or cities.  He has never been there before and somebody who knows how best he can get to where he wants to go kindly draws a sketch for him.  In future he will need to memorise such a sketch and then tear it up because if he is found with such a sketch, perhaps a diagram of certain buildings of which, as an innocent party, he would have no knowledge he could be in trouble.  In fact, he could find himself, in complete innocence, an occupant of one of the buildings, and because of his innocence.  That is the ridiculous part, that the person may have a diagram to make sure that when he gets off the train or bus he will get to the exact house to which he is going, never having been in that part of the town or city before.  Let us take our own city here, Dublin.</P>
    <P>He is down near the Four Courts, or the Special Criminal Court, and the diagram shows the river, the roadway and the turn up past it.  The possession of that would land that fellow right inside one of those buildings and from there to somewhere else for some considerable time.  He would not know what had hit him because he had never been up before.  I do not mean up in court, I mean up in that part of the city from somewhere outside the city or the country. Such is the situation that street directions will have to be memorised by such visitors in future and at their peril may these directions be written down in the form of a sketch or a diagram if that should in any way be capable of being interpreted as coming near to or including certain buildings of various kinds, Garda stations, prisons, courthouses.  That is enough to be going on with.  There may be others, but those three categories are specifically mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> I wonder how the Minister regards that sort of section which could very well have the ludicrous follow-up I have indicated.  Much good it would be to the innocent abroad who tells how he has this little diagram and how it was essential to him to get to where he was going, that he did not know that Green Street or the Central Criminal Court or the Garda barracks or a courthouse or a prison or whatever it might be happened to be in that vicinity quite adjacent to where he was going?  It will not help him a bit.</P>
    <P>Regarding the section dealing with incitement, I omitted to mention another aspect of it.  I more or less put it by way of question though I am afraid I know the answer.  Will this section, if and when this is walked through the lobbies and becomes law, mean in so far as the incitement section as we might call it, is concerned, that all our ballads, old and new, that might be regarded as traditional republican or such like, lauding some of our past exploits in defence of our little country and our efforts to free it, shall be banned from all publication, over the air, or by record or tape.  I am thinking of ballads like &ldquo;The Boys of Wexford&rdquo;, &ldquo;Father Murphy&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Men Behind the Wire&rdquo;, &ldquo;Seán South&rdquo;&mdash;even the National Anthem could raise a rather interesting highlight or sidelight. Will these all be taboo?  Will publicising them by writing, singing, or one might even say whistling, or broadcasting on radio or on television, in the newspapers or otherwise, all come within the incitement section and carry the absolutely crazy penalties I have already adverted to with the big figures on it?  Will they all go out the window, and who will issue the list that is permissible?</P>
    <P>Will we have a list of songs that may be sung or will we have a list of those that may not be sung?  Will the National Anthem be excused?  It seems to me that the whole message, the whole underlying note of our National Anthem would be very suspect.  It would be ludricrous, but it would be our just deserts if our National Anthem was caught within the meshes <Col N="630" /> of this amazing incitement section.  It would show the Government to be as ludricrous as we reckon they are, judging by the proposals that are before us here.</P>
    <P>Is it possible that the teaching of Irish and British history in our schools, as has been mentioned by some of those who do not like the way it is being taught in some schools at the moment, will be taboo in future, while this section operates, together with traditional Irish songs and ballads? Will we have the spectacle of a teacher being informed on by his pupils, not wittingly, but children talk about what they hear in school just as they talk in school about what they hear at home?  Will we have the sad spectacle of the teacher being afraid, and weighing every word when he is teaching his students history in the future, if this measure becomes law?  Will a teacher have to weigh every word lest a pupil may repeat somewhere what has been said, and as a result of which the teacher may be visited by someone who was of the opinion that he should be taken in for seven days and thereafter maybe for five or ten years?  This is a serious question which has been raised in a reverse manner by some of the speakers behind the Minister.  They are questioning the manner in which history is being taught at the moment. I question the manner in which I understand it is being taught at the moment also, and I question very much some of the texts that have been prescribed in so far as modern Irish history is concerned this year.  I would like to see history being taught as it was recorded, as it happened and not the propaganda documents which were compelled to be issued this year.  But that pales into insignificance, beside what may be the case here, that neither one slant or the other of our modern Irish history will be permissible because it may be caught in the incitement section of this Bill, and that indeed British history, modern or past, may not be truly passed on to our students of today because it also may come within the incitement section. We want to have answers to these questions.  I and many others would be very pleased if the Minister would clarify on the incitement section those <Col N="631" /> two items, our traditional ballads and the teaching of history in our schools. What will the position be if the present section is put through this House and becomes law?  The Minister on page 5 of his speech said that the new section provided for the issue of a warrant in respect of any evidence.  Section 29 only covered documentary evidence. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Moreover, section 29 provided for the issue of the warrant to a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector, but the new section enables a warrant to be issued to a member not below the rank of sergeant. This latter change is proposed because of the requirement that an inspector be in charge has caused substantial difficulties especially in circumstances where it was very important that several searches be carried out simultaneously. There could be situations where unarmed gardaí executing such search warrants might need to seek assistance from the Defence Forces and accordingly provision is made to authorise members of the Defence Forces to accompany and assist gardaí to carry out searches under the section.</P>
    <P>From that, my impression is that we do not have enough gardaí.  If we do not have enough, why have we not got enough?  No doubt there is need for additional gardaí, because many of them are rather uselessly taken up on Border duties, while other traditional duties are being very much neglected through lack of personnel.  Where are all the extra gardaí that the Minister has been bragging about?  If there have been additions to the Garda Síochána, how come that it is necessary in 1976 to make these changes on the basis that there are not enough to go round, where there seemed to have been enough in the past when we had fewer than we have now?  We certainly do not have enough gardaí in so far as normal policing is concerned.  The hundreds of those who are sitting waiting for a long expected call to the Garda training headquarters should be put out of their misery <Col N="632" /> quickly and called in for training. This would be a much better idea than providing that certain things which heretofore had to be done by an inspector or a superintendent must now, because of the shortage of gardaí according to the Minister, be done by an inspector or a sergeant. The Minister also said that since unarmed gardaí operating on the authority of a search warrant might need assistance from the Defence Forces and being only now under a sergeant who would not have the right to call in forces, it is being provided to authorise members of the Defence Forces to accompany and assist gardaí to carry out searches under the section.  Without any call out by an officer of the Garda, here we have this section providing that the Defence Forces may operate the section with the Garda.  Because we do not seem to have sufficient numbers we must get more inspectors to stand in for superintendents, and sergeants to stand in for inspectors and the Army to be given the authorisation to participate without the safeguards that have been built around their being called in by an officer of the Garda. According to the Minister's speech that is what will now be done.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that the Army have been assisting the Garda and I had not heard any complaints that the procedure by which they are made available up to now is not adequate for all the needs that have arisen in recent years.  I seldom see a road check at night without the Army backing up the Garda who are doing the checking.  What circumstances bring about the situation in which we want all this law that there is here now and this section particularly, providing for the Army to go on specific duty with the Garda as a matter of form, without any request from any Garda officer?  Why is the existing procedure not adequate? What defects have emerged in it?  I see the Army frequently accompanying the Garda doing the checking and searching&mdash;which they had no right to do, according to the Minister&mdash;and they are backed up by members of the Defence Forces employed <Col N="633" /> in the location of the road check.  Why do we want these provisions here since that system has been and is operating?  Was that illegal also?  We have not been told that and I do not believe it is.  If so, why do we have to make new provisions for the use of the Army?</P>
    <P>In the last analysis one can only get back to one's first thoughts on measures such as this, the absolute lack of necessity for it, the lack of any effort on the part of the Government to justify it in any serious way with the result that most people must develop a cynical outlook in seeking very unusual reasons for this unusual package and come up with some uncharitable answers as to why the Government are participating in this unusual situation involving this package including the declaration of the emergency, the Emergency Powers Bill and now the Criminal Law Bill, not one iota of which will be changed, according to the Minister for Defence.  All of this is already agreed and heads counted in sufficient numbers to put it through with the feet of those who support the Government even though the majority of those I have heard here have spoken against what they are supporting.  Despite that, they will walk through the lobbies to put it into law and so have the best of both worlds, retaining the power and the influence and the image that they feel goes with the support of the Government as public men and at the same time bamboozling&mdash;they hope&mdash;their constituents who have put them here and who will be voting on their performance at the next election.  They will be able to show the record of the House or some newspaper in which they have been recorded as speaking against this, that or the other provision.  It seems this is a bob each way bet going a bit of the way with everybody's dog.</P>
    <P>The damage that this is doing to the country abroad is incalculable because although people may have heard many jokes about the strange contradictions of the Irish I do not think it can be expected that people should think that at Government and <Col N="634" /> Parliament level we are creating this new type of Irish joke on ourselves, declaring an emergency when none exists.  It may be a good joke for the future but it is a very sore one at the moment and is undoubtedly not regarded as a joke by those abroad who would be doing business with us or intending to holiday here and spend money here which we so badly need.</P>
    <P>The immediate evidence is of very strong reaction to the declaration of this emergency, the indication being that people who were coming have cancelled their arrangements and that people who were considering setting up factories here have had second thoughts.  Perhaps others will be deterred from showing interest now that they have heard that we have a national emergency which to them can only mean, seeing that some of them have experienced it in their own countries, a most serious situation with martial law, curfews, restrictions, the Army on the streets and the tanks rolling.  They do not know we do not have tanks.  I suppose that is part of the joke that will be told of us in years to come about the year 1976 and the declaration of a national emergency that never was, hurting ourselves further, economically speaking, making little of ourselves for a purpose we do not know in the eyes of our old occupiers, Britain, kowtowing to her in various respects while we go through the motions of providing that which she has not thought fit to provide even in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>All of this comes to mind and I suppose will make no dent in the already cemented position of the Government and the parties supporting it.  This is a tragedy but our history has been littered with tragedies of various kinds and, perhaps, it is because of these possibly self-induced tragedies all down the generations that we are still occupied by the old enemy, Britain. That she remains no matter what nice words we might say in apology for taking the torture case against her and having proved it to the hilt and having been slighted and slandered by Mr. Rees for our pains she is the old enemy and until she gets out we will not have any peace.  This package in no way helps that&mdash;rather does it <Col N="635" /> hinder it&mdash;and anyone that hinders in any way the ultimate solution to our problem of getting the British out may well yet&mdash;if they live long enough &mdash;get their deserts and be tried in due time for their culpability, their efforts at collaboration with the occupying forces of Her Majesty.  But that is little comfort or consolation to the people of today who will be burdened with this package for reasons known only to the Government, unnecessary in every respect and hurtful in many, a denial of the rights of our people for no good, stated purpose.</P>
    <P>These are pertinent thoughts about these measures.  My opposition to them is not in any way biased or arising from a biased attitude.  There is no national emergency in this part of the country at this time.  The Government know it; their supporters inside and outside the House know it; the Opposition and their supporters inside and outside the House know it.  I know it and my supporters know it.  Everybody knows it but still we go through the motions of backing up the assertion we made last week when, with their feet, Government supporters declared this country to be in a state of national emergency. The emergency is economic.  Let us drop this package and get on with talking of ways and means to get us out of our real problems rather than be making difficulties for ourselves.</P>

      <P>I shall be brief not merely relative to the last speaker but in absolute terms also.  I do not intend to comment on his contribution which came from one of the few members of this House who was a co-author of internment at a time when the number of deaths that had taken place on this island in that campaign was a tiny fraction of the 1,600 now dead.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary duty of a Government is to take all necessary measures to protect life and property and the democratic system, the system which is repudiated by the IRA and its sister bodies, the system which they do not recognise, or accept, and which they seek to overthrow. There can be no excuse for any failure by a Government of any complexion to devise and use laws fully for this purpose, with minimum prejudice to necessary safeguards of human rights.  The tension between civil liberties, on the one hand, and the preservation of life, public property and public order on the other is one which at any time any society lists and which becomes more acute in a situation where there is significant violence and a significant threat both to life and to the democratic system.  One cannot ignore this tension. It is not one to which there is any simple answer and it is the proper role of the Opposition and the press to be vigilant when measures are taken to protect life and public order, measures which inevitably have some implications in respect of aspects of the safeguarding of human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The democratic system works and the Government take their responsibilities and take the minimum measures they deem necessary when the Opposition and the press are critical in a rational, logical way of what is done and thereby provide a tension and a constraint through which the optimum balance at any given moment in time can hope to be achieved.  We did this in Opposition.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said he thought we <Col N="637" /> were wrong in relation to the Bill in 1972.  I think that is true, certainly to the extent that the fears we had about the possible abuse of that Bill were unrealistic, as we found in Government. Moreover, I think it could be argued that our opposition was disproportionate.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may be right in that.  But I do not apologise for the opposition as such.  It is important when any measure is brought in with possible implications for human rights that it should be criticised, examined with care and opposed.  That does not permit the Opposition, if it comes into Government, abolishing the laws it criticised and opposed. I am sure the present Opposition, when they come into Government, will be unlikely to repeal anything that goes through in this Bill any more than we did in regard to the Bill that was before us at that time. Each of us has our function to perform and the system works when each performer functions.</P>
    <P>It is important that the press, as well as the Opposition, plays its role. Reasoned criticism can be of great importance and value and no Government will ignore reasoned criticism. At times the criticism can be unreasonable and this can be damaging because, when you read in the paper, as I read in this morning's paper coming back from Amsterdam, something on the lines I have in front of me here the effect can be counter productive because, if criticism is totally unreasonable, then of course it induces in those criticised an irrational reaction.  I read in this morning's <i>Irish Time:</i></P>
    <P>Caithfidh sé go léir anois don teachta is dúire i bhFianna Fáil&mdash; gan trácht ar ghnáthmhuintir na hÉireann nach bhfuil dúr chor ar bith&mdash;go bhfuil deireadh á chur le pé cuid den daonlathas atá fágtha sa taoibh seo tíre, go bhfuil sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas cos ar bolg a imirt ar éinne nach n-aontaíonn leo faoi chuile shórt.</P>
    <P>It goes on to suggest later on that we in the Republic have probably heard the National Anthem for the last time in Croke Park.  This is all <Col N="638" /> said not jocosely but with great seriousness. It is not helpful because it induces, or could induce, in those criticised an unreasoning reaction. That we must avoid because there has been reasoned criticism of the legislation and it is right that there should be.</P>
    <P>We heard from Deputy Blaney recently and also from others more responsible that there is no need for an emergency and that the reason for such an emergency has not been explained. I think it has been explained <i>ad nauseam</i> in the debates we have had so far.  It is quite clear that if it is thought necessary to extend the period of detention to seven days, and the Government judge it is necessary on the advice of the Garda Síochána, then it is necessary to go through the procedure of ensuring there is an appropriate emergency that will stand up in the Supreme Court in order to enable that additional period of detention to be secured in law.  That is clear and simple.  Some may think it is unfortunate that in order to achieve that result the Constitution is so rigid it requires the Government to go through such a procedure.  It is no bad thing that the Constitution is so rigid in this matter and does not allow the Government outside of an emergency framework to go beyond certain limits.  We have a Constitution designed to protect human rights and inevitably in those circumstances the declaration of an emergency becomes necessary in order to modify the period of detention which we judge, on the advice given us, is necessary for the safety of the State and the safety of life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney has asserted that everybody knows there is no such thing as an emergency.  In fact by any standards of any normal civilised country there is an emergency.  To take an example: what would be the position in Britain&mdash;the figures I give are arithmetical extrapolations, notably more accurate than Deputy Blaney's extrapolations with regard to sentences in this Bill&mdash;if there were over half a million injured and 50,000 killed in that island?  Would it be regarded <Col N="639" /> as unreasonable if in part of that island, where 1,300 were dead, certain emergency measures were taken?  I think it would be astonishing if in Britain&mdash;take France, or Germany or some other country where the population figures are similar&mdash; the reaction to that kind of situation were not to accept that emergency measures were necessary.  When you get those kinds of figures in their direct arithmetical extrapolations in relation to our population then there is an emergency situation that has to be faced and all necessary measures taken.</P>
    <P>Again there was criticism that the Minister did not explain or justify this legislation.  I think some of that criticism was based on a misunderstanding of parliamentary procedure. We had to go through the procedure of an Emergency Resolution first. Then we had to have the Second Stage of the Emergency Bill and then the Second Stage of the Criminal Law Bill.  It would have been inappropriate and contrary to order if the Minister had attempted to explain in detail the purposes and justification of the particular provisions in this Bill in advance of the Second Stage of this Bill and the criticism of him for not doing so was, in my opinion, premature and based on a sort of confusion with regard to a rather complex procedure necessitated by the present situation and the complex form the legislation has had to take.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we have been accused of introducing legislation as a gimmick to distract people's attention from the economic situation.  That criticism is interesting because it implies that this kind of legislation is something which has strong support.  I think this is true.  But a political gimmick? If we were about to have an election it could, perhaps, be so argued, given the amount of support, but it would very quickly become apparent that there is no such intention.  This Government will govern for their term of office.  I cannot believe that anybody will remember enough about this debate, when the election comes at its appropriate time, for this to be a relevant factor in their considerations. <Col N="640" /> It is really the other way round, that this measure is one which is needed now.  Indeed we could have been criticised for not having introduced some of these provisions earlier. It is important to get it through and out of the way so as to clear the way for getting on with the very important economic measures that are needed, which will have to be debated and agreed by the social partners, put across and accepted in the country in the months ahead.  Therefore, it is important, even if there was no urgent need for this legislation, which there is, that it should be got out of the way so that we and the country can concentrate in the months ahead on the economic issues.  Therefore to contend that this is a political gimmick does not make sense in this context and is not true.</P>
    <P>Coming to the individual sections, there are two which appear to be controversial and I shall confine my remarks to them.  One is section 3. Here there is a real problem which the Government face, the problem of wording this section in a manner that will catch those who recruit to and promote the IRA while not endangering civil liberties, free speech and so on.  It is very hard to judge how best to do this.  Given the nature of our society, with its intense commitment to freedom and the vigilance of Opposition and press, there is small danger of a Government abusing this power even if this power were one open to the Government to exercise. In fact of course it is not, because the exercise of this power will be on the initiative of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the consequence of that exercise will be determined by the courts.</P>
    <P>Given that situation and the importance of ensuring that the legislation will catch those it is meant to catch, the wording, no matter who drafts it or how it is drafted, will tend to have to be fairly comprehensive.  There is a problem of balance here.  It is important that that balance be got right and we have done our best to do so.  This does not mean, when others have argued and put the point, that the legislation will be implemented on the initiative of the <Col N="641" /> Director of Public Prosecutions and decisions taken by the courts.  That does not justify&mdash;I am not suggesting for a moment it does; nor does anybody on this side&mdash;any carelessness in drafting.  But it does mean that at least no political abuse is possible. That is an important innovation as a result of the decision we took. It cannot be manipulated or used politically for a political purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be extreme occasions when it might be necessary.  But the Attorney-General is himself a law officer, has an independent function in the matter and does not act on the directions of the Government.  But as a further process of removing the matter, he may give directions to the Director of Public Prosecutions though I take Deputy Collins's point which is technically correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the section was brought in in some way to deal with the press.  That is simply not true.  In relation to this section the question of the press never arose in its preparation, drafting or discussion. It was brought in for the purpose of getting at those who recruit to the IRA.  The question of the press did not arise in connection with it at all when it was being drafted, prepared and decided.  It is important that that should be said and I can <Col N="642" /> assert that firmly and decisively.  The fact is the existing common law imposes certain obligations on all, press and otherwise, obligations not to incite violence.  The press has due regard to this.  It is a fact that this common law obligation does constrain the press in that it cannot, nor should it at any stage, incite people to violence or try to get them to join illegal organisations.  No responsible paper, no paper as far as I know, has done this.  There have been no prosecutions because papers, though they publish a wide variety of correspondence, do not act in that way, as no responsible person would in any democratic society.  Nobody has ever described that common law situation as censorship and I think the question of censorship simply does not arise.</P>
    <P>The debate is useful.  It has brought out the dangers to democracy and freedom posed by violence and by the need to respond appropriately to violence. This is, of course, where there is always a threat to any democratic system, that violent men may seek to overthrow it thereby necessitating measures which themselves reduce in some measure democratic freedoms. The Government, Parliament, Opposition and press must be vigilant in this, each carrying out their function, ensuring that we never allow the men of violence to create a reaction that could prejudice freedom. In our system this is unlikely because of our tradition&mdash;we won freedom dearly&mdash;and because the vigilance and sensitivity of these issues is a feature of our society.</P>
    <P>The other point with which I wanted to deal is simply the question of the greater use to be made of the Army.  Deputy Blaney made reference to the Garda Síochána and said the answer was more gardaí.  The fact is this Government have increased the strength of the Garda Síochána by one-third and recruitment is under way, of a further 500. But, no matter how many gardaí there are, it would be quite irresponsible not to make full use of the other force available for limited purposes for which that force is appropriate. That involves, in Border areas <Col N="643" /> in particular, patrolling, and if somebody is found <i>in flagrante delicto</i> or, in suspicious circumstances, detaining him and handling him over speedily to the police.</P>
    <P>Up to now the law may have been &mdash;this is not clear and there is certainly a doubt in regard to it&mdash;for them to act in that way they would need the presence of members of the Garda Síochána.  This is a restriction on the use of the manpower in question. If one extra person is killed because at a given moment in time at a given point on the Border there is not a garda to go on a particular patrol, then the Government would have failed in their duty.  Therefore it is right&mdash;and I have no inhibitions on this point&mdash;that the Army should be used for this limited purpose, under the authority of a superintendent of the Garda Síochána, so there is single control of the security exercise&mdash;and this is perhaps one of the difficulties in Northern Ireland, that there is not such single control&mdash;but without the necessity at any given moment in time of the physical presence of a member of the Garda Síochána, in order to effect the arrest of somebody who is acting suspiciously or in respect of whom it is evident or probable that he has committed an offence so that he may be handed over to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>For the rest of the Bill, the other provisions have been generally agreed by most people in the House and, I think, welcomed by the public at large, who recognise the need to take stronger and further action of this kind.  The additional sentences are not, as Deputy Blaney said, increased tenfold. He seems to have arrived at that conclusion by ignoring the penal servitude sentences in the 1939 Act and confining himself to the alternative imprisonment sentence of two years. They have been increased quite sharply in certain cases.  In that, I think the Opposition generally support the Government because these offences in present circumstances, are ones of great seriousness.  Given the length of time that this problem of violence has been with us, since 1969, it is desirable that people who involve <Col N="644" /> themselves in these matters and who act in this way against the State, against life and freedom, should be capable of being put out of harm's way for long enough for it to be reasonably probable that the present period of violence will have come to an end.  On that basis these longer sentences are necessary.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to make those few points in regard to the Bill and I do not wish to detain the House any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>We would want to remind ourselves that the debate we have just had has been one on the Second Stage of the Criminal Law Bill.  It is quite separate legally from the consequences of the Emergency Resolution and from the Emergency Powers Bill.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has just explained the legal and constitutional background to both of those measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood the Opposition to say in the course of the debate that they accept the Criminal Law Bill in principle. That, I think, was said quite clearly.  Of course, it has been introduced at a time of emergency, a time of danger for the State and its citizens. I find something contradictory between welcoming the State's answer to this situation and at the same time saying: &ldquo;What is all this hoo-ha about?  There is no state of emergency, There is nothing unusual about the times in which we are living.&rdquo; While it was welcomed in principle it was so clouded by reservations that the welcome got snowed under.  &ldquo;We welcome it in principle but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; It reminded me of the early and fairly recent days when one heard condemnations of violence all the time with a qualification on them: &ldquo;We condemn this atrocious act but what about&rdquo;, or &ldquo;But we recognise it is a response to institutional violence&rdquo;, or some such qualification which took away the whole good of the condemnation. I have that similar feeling here that the welcome in principle has been grudging, and indeed the tone of the debate, because it was so hedged with qualifications.  Nevertheless even a grudging welcome in principle is heartening because it shows that both sides of this <Col N="645" /> House are united in recognising the need for tough measures to deal with a tough situation.  There is no doubt about it, there are tough measures in this Bill.  I will deal with the points raised in connection with them but before I do so I want to deal with a preliminary matter in case I overlook it.</P>
    <P>There were criticisms by Deputy Collins and others not about the Bill itself but about the explanatory memorandum. Deputy Collins was critical of what he called the brevity of the memorandum in regard to section 3 and he complained it did not show the thinking behind it.  A statement recently issued by a body known as the Irish Commission for Peace and Justice also made a similar complaint about the explanatory memorandum. They said it was the duty of the Government to explain the background and the need for the Emergency Powers Bill and they were critical of the absence of any explanatory memorandum in relation to that Bill.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Collins was in Government his portfolio was not one that brought with it the necessity to introduce much legislation but those of his colleagues who had the task of introducing legislation will know that the one thing an explanatory memorandum must not do is to enter into the controversial political area and explain the thinking behind the Bill.  That is not the function of a memorandum. If it were to do that it would become an advocate for the Bill.  The purpose of an explanatory memorandum is to give in layman's language the gist of the various sections and to do so in a purely technical way and in a neutral fashion so that it will be of equal help to Deputies opposing the Bill as to those supporting it.  It is concerned to say what is in the Bill, not why it is in the Bill.  The reasons behind a Bill are proper matters for the debate by the Minister and other speakers who support the Bill and the arguments against it are proper matters for the Opposition, not for the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>More seriously, Deputy Collins <Col N="646" /> implied that the explanatory memorandum tended to slide over some things and, in that sense, could be construed as misleading.  He may not have meant that it was designed to mislead&mdash;I am sure he did not&mdash; because that would be a very serious charge to make about an explanatory memorandum.  I should like to clarify that matter.  Very emphatically I reject any such charge.</P>
    <P>Of course, the memorandum is not meant to be a substitute for a reading of the Bill.  As legislators our first source is the Bill itself, not the memorandum.  I submit that the memorandum issued with this Bill covers the ground of the Bill reasonably and accurately.  It was suggested that the explanation in the memorandum with regard to section 5 was misleading.  The main change section 5 makes is that it extends the range of a search warrant from documentary evidence to any evidence.  A secondary change, but this is more significant from the point of view of the Garda Síochána, is that the warrant can now be executed by a sergeant and not an inspector.  Both of these changes are emphasised in the explanatory memorandum, now just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I hope what I am saying with regard to the memorandum will possibly be of general interest and will clear up misapprehensions as to the nature and function of the memorandum.  If explanatory memoranda were to become allegations of bad faith just because someone thought something should be in that was not in or <i>vice versa</i>, it would lead to a very difficult situation and there would be an inhibition on producing them.  I think they are a useful feature of our procedures but it is important to realise exactly their role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with it then at this stage.  I was going to deal with the sections in sequence.  I suppose that, strictly speaking, the debate in so far as it related to the Criminal Law Bill rather than to the general question of the emergency was more a Committee type debate but general points were made which I think I should deal with at this stage in fairness.  I think I can appropriately deal with this point because it is related to the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 8 the explanatory memorandum says that section 7 gives the Garda Síochána certain powers in relation to persons in custody &ldquo;under the provisions of any enactment ... under which persons may be arrested, kept in custody and questioned&rdquo;.  I said that at present section 30 of the 1939 Act gives the power and the power is also proposed in the Emergency Powers Bill.  Section 7 is intended to apply to persons in custody under either of these sections.  The Deputy's case was that the explanatory memorandum was not accurate but that is not so.  It is quite accurate.  Section 7 cannot apply to any enactments other than to those two specific enactments.  The wording of section 7 is:</P>
      <P>Where a person is in custody under the provisions of any enactment for the time being in force under which persons may be arrested, kept in custody and questioned, ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only two enactments in force in which all three conditions are fulfilled are section 30 of the 1939 Act and the draft section in the Bill.  It was a misreading of the section but I do not blame the Deputy because I think he followed the point made by the Incorporated Law Society.  I have pointed this out to the Incorporated Law Society and I have invited them <Col N="648" /> to intimate to me if they are aware of any other enactment that would comply with the criteria in that section. The explanatory memorandum is quite accurate.</P>
    <P>It was suggested somewhere that a person in custody for a breathalyser test could come within the provisions of section 7.  That is wrong and is a misstatement of the law.  It is important that people read draft Bills very carefully and this is a duty that particularly lies on those who have professional training in the area of the law.  When they make comment on them they should be sure their comments are accurate.  Deputy Collins wanted to know if I had replied to the Incorporated Law Society. I have done so and I have replied in detail to the memorandum they submitted to me.  That is one of the points I have cleared up.  I have also cleared up some other misconceptions and misapprehensions with regard to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Various questions were raised by Deputies and I shall deal with them. Deputy Collins had a question on section 3.  He thought the insertion of the word &ldquo;recruit&rdquo; would be better. Again, as this is essentially a Committee Stage point we should leave it to the Committee Stage.  Section 3 in general terms has been one to generate much controversy.  It is not necessary for me to repeat what has been put so adequately in regard to this section by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The main area of controversy has been the fear that the section will lead to press censorship.  Press freedom does not rely on an Act of Parliament.  It relies on Article 40.6.1º of our Constitution in which there is provision for freedom of the press.  This provision is still in operation.  It is as alive today as it ever has been.  The Constitution has not been suspended, despite the rash assertions by some members of the Opposition to the contrary.  The rights of the press under Article 40 cannot be taken away by the proposed section 3 of this Bill. The relevant paragraph of the Article reads:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights, <Col N="649" /> subject to public order and morality:&mdash;</P>
    <P>i.  The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State....</P>
    <P>The right to express opinions and convictions freely is contained in that part of Article 40 with the safeguards and the restrictions which the Constitution imposes.  In effect the restrictions are those which the people impose, because the Constitution is the document of the people.  I am sure that nobody in the world of the press would assert that he or she is in any way exempt from the will of the people as expressed in that Article of the Constitution.  There is nothing which this Government could enact in section 3 which would in any way take away from that right.  But should any member of the journalistic profession consider that the section as drafted interferes with the right given to him by the Constitution&mdash;and none of us has rights other than those given to us by the Constitution nor can we expect any rights greater than those given to us by the Constitution&mdash;he has the same remedy that is available to every other citizen, that is, the right to challenge any legislation which in his opinion infringes his constitutional rights.  Therefore to suggest that there is censorship in the sense of diminishing the rights conferred by the Constitution is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest evils facing us is the existence of malevolent men who entice young people into unlawful organisations.  This is done in various ways.  Such activities must be curbed because of their consequences for the young people concerned and for the people on whom their subsequent <Col N="650" /> unlawful activities may impinge. We must curb all forms of recruiting, but the difficulty lies in devising a legal formula for this purpose. I consider section 3 to be the answer to that difficulty.  But, as I said when introducing this stage of the Bill, it will be a matter essentially for the courts to decide on the facts of any case, to decide whether those facts constitute an offence against section 3.  Time and again I have been asked by frustrated citizens whether nothing can be done about the enticing-inciting situation.  I put forward this section as being the response to that widespread frustration. The section is not designed to impose censorship or to restrict freedom of speech, because the Constitution guarantees such freedoms; but should any person consider that, notwithstanding the <i>bona fide</i> intentions of the section, it unwittingly interferes with freedom of speech or with the freedom of the Constitution, it may be challenged.  I am prepared to see it challenged, but I am satisfied also that it will stand up to any such challenge.</P>
    <P>On section 5, questions were raised as to why a change is being made from the 1939 Act, a change proposing to allow a superintendent to issue a search warrant whereas the 1939 Act specified that this role be taken by a chief superintendent.  This is purely a matter of convenience. There is nothing sinister about it. Under the 1939 Act it was provided that any power conferred on a chief superintendent could be exercised by a superintendent, so there is nothing new here.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which deals with the assisting of an escape from custody, was mentioned in the context of the Incorporated Law Society's criticism and it was raised by the society and also by Deputy Collins in conjunction with section 9, which deals with the power to retain articles seized.  It might be no harm if I indicated in some detail some of the points of view which I put forward to the society.  They were concerned that section 6, when read in conjunction with section 9, would be detrimental to the position of their members and <Col N="651" /> that the combined possible effect of the two sections would be to give a right to seize and retain for use as evidence in any criminal proceedings documents which may be confidential or privileged between a person in custody and his legal adviser.  Section 6, subsection (2), provides that an offence is committed by a person who conveys things into or out of a prison contrary to any rules or regulations in force in relation to the prison.</P>
    <P>In their memorandum the society said that it made it an offence to bring things into or out of a prison in certain circumstances.  That was very loose wording.  The section contains the phrase &ldquo;contrary to any rules or regulations in force in relation to a prison&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a vastly different situation, and I have suggested to the law society that they are hardly saying that legal advisers should be allowed to smuggle articles in or out of a prison.  In this connection I think it is only right to say that the law society have held disciplinary proceedings on one of their members who has admitted, and I gather the society have found the member so guilty, attempting to smuggle a communication out of the prison concealed in his trousers.  I think the very fact that such an event took place is ample justification for me to be wary and careful in this general area.</P>
    <P>As regards confidential documents, there has been this abuse and admitted abuse, but, as I say, in a very limited way.  I do not say that to reflect on the vast majority of members of that society, and I want to emphasise that I would have complete confidence in the <i>bona fides</i> and the professional standards of the vast majority of solicitors and that they are not going to abuse their professional position to do anything contrary to our prison rules.  However, when serious security issues are involved&mdash;and they are involved because breaches of security of our prisons were paraded here as being matters in which the Government have failed&mdash;it is not enough to say that we can ignore the possibility <Col N="652" /> of this taking place, when we have evidence that it took place, and say it can be left to the disciplinary body concerned.  Again, it could happen that I would have information or information could come to me that it would not be possible for me to place before the appropriate disciplinary body but on which I would be well satisfied I would be justified in taking action.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the general right to search and take articles from legal advisers is one that cannot be waived.  The law society felt that the prison staff would abuse what they might see when searching, that they would not observe the privacy of documents.  I want to reject this, because I am thinking again that the vast majority of lawyers who have occasion to go to our prisons would bear out that our prison staff have been scrupulous in respecting the privacy of documents.  If the Incorporated Law Society can give me a formula that will provide the statutory guarantee to cover their end of it and at the same time cover my end of it from the security point of view, I would certainly be happy to consider it, but I do not see how it could be given with regard to documents.  There was a notorious case in England where a letter was being written to a firm of solicitors, and if the privacy was absolute this letter would have gone out giving detailed instructions for setting up a false alibi.  Therefore, this is an area where there has to be executive power to ensure that security is the priority.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the misinterpretation of section 7, that is the search section.  I am advised and satisfied that, as the law stands at the moment, the only enactments to which it applies are the sections under the Offences Against the State Act to which I have referred, that is, section 13 and the section proposed in the Emergency Powers Bill.</P>
    <P>There were various drafting points made in regard to section 12, the bomb hoax section.  It was suggested that the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; be introduced.  I can deal with that on Committee Stage; likewise the question <Col N="653" /> of District Court sentences and appeals to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 15 was the other section that came in for a great deal of criticism.  I think it is important to recall two of the features of section 15.  For the convenience of Deputies I would remind them that section 15 is the one that gives certain powers of arrest and search to the Army. Traditionally in this country the primary law enforcement agency has been the Garda Síochána and traditionally it has been the policy of all Governments to maintain that force as an unarmed police force. There is no change in that policy and there is no change in my anxiety to ensure that the Garda Síochána will continue to be the primary law enforcement agency of the country. That principle, which I consider to be a very basic and important principle, is observed in this section giving powers to the Army, because in effect the giving of the powers to the Army is subject to Garda control. The powers given to the Army cannot be triggered off unless a Garda superintendent requires Army assistance. There must be a formal requisition, so the primacy of the police in this area is preserved.  It is very important to recognise that when the Army are called out in aid of the civil power they are called out in a role subordinate to the police and designed to assist the police.  That general principle is being very strictly observed in this measure.</P>
    <P>The second constraint is that the powers given to the Army are limited in relation to the offences specified in section 8 which I could broadly categorise as terrorist offences.  The Army's power of search and arrest is not applicable to every situation they might encounter.  They are applicable only to the terrorist offences specified in section 8.  This power, which has been criticised as being drastic and wrong in principle, is a very restricted power, restricted to ensure the continued primacy of the police, to ensure the continued secondary role of the Army, and restricted in legal implications and consequences.  In order to get the <Col N="654" /> power into perspective, one has to keep those two facts before one's mind.</P>
    <P>The Army have traditionally had this role in supporting the civil power. They have been called out in the past to exercise this function.  They have been called out, of course, in the immediate past in Border areas.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Haughey was recording his achievements for us in the Department of Justice, and creditable achievements they were&mdash;I doubt if we will want to deny that&mdash;some of us were disappointed that he did not, perhaps, go on and deal with highlights of his career in other Departments. I want to recall one, and he can correct me as to whether he was Minister for Agriculture at the time or not.  It was an instance where the Army were called out in aid of the civil power in a gross abuse of that provision.  That was the time when the NFA, as they then were, were engaged in a no rates campaign. Was the Deputy Minister for Agriculture then?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time the farmers were engaged in a campaign of withholding rates.  As far as my recollection goes, two farmers were singled out to have the amount of their rates levied on them.  One, I think, was in Kilkenny.  It would be invidious to give his name.  The other was in my own county, quite close to my home town.  The Government of the day, of which Deputy Haughey was a member, brought out the Army in aid of the civil power in levying those rates, and they so allowed the Army to conduct themselves that they blocked the roads of the country.  It was not a question of their standing by to ensure that there was no assault or no <i>force majeure</i> used against the sheriff or the sheriff's officers.  The Army of this land were used in an extravagant and wrong way.  For a <Col N="655" /> period of some hours in my county there was literally martial law.</P>
      <P>That was an abuse by the then Executive of the role of the Army as an aid to the civil power.  It was not possible for a citizen to drive from Athlone to Birr on that occasion because the road was impeded by the unlawful presence of the Army which was being abused by the Executive of the day in their role as an aid to the civil power.  When I think of that rather extraordinary incident, the criticism of these carefully considered powers being given in a statute does not ring very true to me.  It is as well to recall that incident and to say that despite all the occasions on which the Army have had to be enlisted in support of the civil power in recent years, no one can say that there was an excess practised in that regard, nor would this Government allow an excess of their power.</P>

      <P>No, Finance.  I am getting the impression of an overwhelming desire on the part of the Government to have a go at Deputy Haughey.  It is leading them into all sorts of ridiculous situations.  It is illustrative of something&mdash;I am not quite sure what it is.  There is a continual direction of their fire at poor old Deputy Haughey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a worry that the power given to the Army to hold a person for as long as six hours is wrong.  I think it is a realistic period.  The section requires the Army to hand over the person &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; but not to hold the person for more than six hours.  If the person cannot be handed over within six hours, he has to be released. There could be a situation in which a person may have to be held for some hours.  The exigencies of a situation <Col N="656" /> facing the Army at such a time might mean they could not leave where they were and travel to a Garda station.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling wanted to know if the Army would continue to be called in aid of the civil power.  Of course the answer is yes.  The fact that these powers are being given for particular situations does not mean that the existing powers of the Army to go to the aid of the civil power will be put into cold storage.  There are many situations in which the Army will be required but not to carry out arrests or to conduct searches.  There will be no limitation on that.</P>
      <P>The same Deputy spoke about added responsibility for the Army and he asked what would their methods of investigation be.  They would have no power of investigation.  They will have no right to question people. Their powers will merely be to detain and hand over to the civil power. The other powers will be reserved to the Garda Síochána.  Deputy Dowling wanted to know if the Government had yielded to pressure by the British to get the Army involved by giving them power of arrest and search.  The answer to that is of course not.  He wanted to know if the Irish Army and the British Army would work in parallel.  The position in regard to co-operation between the security forces will not be affected by this change.  The co-operation is between the police.  As I said earlier, the primacy of our police as the law enforcement agency is being preserved and they will be the proper people to continue liaison with the other side in matters of mutual interest.  There will be no change there at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the other points made were Committee Stage points and I do not propose to go into them in any detail with the exception of one matter.  Deputy G. Collins mentioned that the proof copy of the Bill which was given to the Opposition&mdash;in order to be helpful it was given to them at the earliest possible moment &mdash;differed from the final version in so far as the provision limiting the application of the new punishment <Col N="657" /> was concerned.  He said there is no need for that because of the Constitution. That is not quite so.  The Constitution states that no act which was not a crime at the date of its commission could be subsequently made a crime.  There is nothing in the Constitution to prohibit the increased penalties subsequently but there is in the Convention on Human Rights a provision that heavier penalties shall not be imposed than the ones that were applicable at the time when the criminal offence was committed.  That is a proper principle and it is being preserved in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the provisions in the Bill are tough, but then we are dealing with a tough situation and the State is entitled to meet force with a legitimate response in kind. The Minister for Foreign Affairs gave an explanation of the casualty figures here related to Great Britain, and of course they are quite staggering. It has been suggested to me that the 1,600 people killed here is a higher percentage than all those killed in Britain during the air raids in the last war.  That is another figure that puts the magnitude of the problem facing us into perspective.  I think it should begin to get home to people who say that these measures are too severe and that they are not justified.</P>
    <P>The feeling I get throughout the country is that the vast majority of the people wish&mdash;and indeed the Opposition say they accept this Bill in principle&mdash;for harsh, tough measures to end violence.  In taking these measures this Parliament will run slap up against the age old dilemma that faces every democracy: that in protecting itself it has to take away some of the privileges of living in a democracy.  We have to do things that people may fear may intrude on their rights and liberties but these are theoretical fears for law abiding citizens.  These are not real fears for people unless they are on the side of the enemies of the State.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the tragedies that are rife up and down the country, are <Col N="658" /> those of us who are privileged to have these rights and liberties to be so mean and so miserly in holding them to ourselves that we are not prepared to concede even a few of them for the purpose of overcoming our enemies? I wonder how some of these people who are vocal and emotional about the interference with their liberties would feel if I brought them to meet a father in Donegal who did not know that his son had been recruited into active service with the IRA until the Garda called on him with a piece of clothing and asked him to identify it, and he did, and then learned that his son had been blown up in an explosion in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the people who are so grudging and selfish about their civil liberties and their freedom like to meet that father and ask him does he think what we are doing here to tackle this problem is excessive.</P>
    <P>I recall being in a hotel some time ago and there was a wedding reception taking place.  The groom carried the bride into the reception.  One might say that there was nothing unusual about that until I tell you that the bride had only one arm and no legs.  Would those people who grudge the giving of some of their precious freedoms and some of their rights come to meet that couple and tell them: &ldquo;No, we will not give any more.  There are enough legal weapons to fight the murderers who destroyed your life.&rdquo; It can be said that hard cases make bad law and as a general principle that is a good one. We are not talking about individual hard cases.  We are talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of similar hard cases.  They are our justification for coming before this Legislature and asking for the powers contained in these Bills.  No law-abiding citizen need fear these Bills.  They are designed exclusively to deal with the gangster terrorists that we all have a duty to eliminate.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Emergency Powers Bill, this first amendment which we propose would have the effect of limiting the operation of the Bill, if enacted, for a period of 12 months.  Of course, it would give the Government the opportunity if they so wished at the <Col N="660" /> conclusion of the 12-month period to bring before this House and the Seanad draft legislation to continue the Emergency Powers Act in force for a further 12 months.  This is in contrast to the position taken by the Government in the Bill as it stands. The Government propose that the Bill may continue in force for as long as the Government wish solely by order of the Government.  Therefore, I find it difficult to understand the Government's position.</P>
      <P>The Emergency Powers Bill is consequent upon the state of emergency having been declared by a resolution passed in the Seanad and in this House last week.  The only precedent we have is the state of emergency which was declared by the Oireachtas in September, 1939, consequential upon which the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, was passed.  Section 13 (2) of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, provided:</P>
      <P>Unless previously terminated under subsection (3) of this section this Act shall continue in force until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the passing thereof and, unless the Oireachtas otherwise determines, shall then expire.</P>
      <P>The subsection referred to enabled the Government to declare the Emergency Powers Act to have expired at an earlier date but did not give the Government the power to continue it in force.  If one looks at the volumes of Statutes from 1939 and 1940 onwards one sees a series of Emergency Powers (Continuance) Acts which were necessary to continue the basic Emergency Powers Act, 1939, in force.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister wishes to change the position now or, indeed, what his motive is in refusing to give to the elected members of Oireachtas Éireann the power and the annual choice of deciding whether or not the Emergency Powers Bill, if passed, should be continued in force.  It is useless to pretend that the powers given to the Oireachtas under section 1 (3) of the Bill as it now stands could equate in any way with the automatic expiry of emergency powers legislation unless renewed by the full vote of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> Last week I said that I did not trust the motives of the Members of the Government, individually or collectively, in relation to the alleged state of emergency and the Emergency Powers provisions.  The attitude of the Government in relation to the proposed amendment strengthen my distrust.  One has to bear in mind in relation to this Emergency Powers Bill that, being a Bill expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State, and being passed consequent on the state of emergency declared, it enjoys extraordinary constitutional protection in that its provisions are not subject to review by the courts. This is one of the reasons why we wish to have an annual review of the legislation by the Oireachtas and why we feel the desirable way of doing this is to use the precedent of the 1939 legislation.</P>
    <P>The second comment I wish to make in that context is that last week the Leader of the Opposition specifically asked the Taoiseach whether any further legislation was already in contemplation by the Government apart from this Emergency Powers Bill.  No reply has been given to that query.  In the light of recent interviews given by Members of the Government who are, presumably, aware of the doctrine of Cabinet collective responsibility when giving these interviews, it seems all the more imperative that any emergency powers legislation should have built into it an expiry date unless renewed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The third comment I wish to make in this context is that last week in the Seanad the Minister for Justice specifically stated that he would be open and receptive to any reasoned amendments to either of the two Bills currently before the House.  It seems to us on this side of the House&mdash;and I believe it would seem to any fair outside observer&mdash;that this is a reasoned amendment on our part.  In the light of the Minister's assurances it seems somewhat odd, if not sinister, that his colleague the Minister for Defence yesterday afternoon&mdash;presuming that he also is aware of the doctrine of Cabinet collective responsibility&mdash;said <Col N="662" /> the Government would not accept any amendment, and I stress any amendment, to any of the sections of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It seems that one or other or possibly both gentlemen, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence, are not accurate in their statements for public consumption in relation to the intentions of the Government and in relation to this legislation. I suppose this is deliberately so.  It is possible that communications between them may not be as good as they should be.  Perhaps neither understands what the other intends to do.</P>

When it does happen matters of Government importance or Government documents will not be used in the way the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs used them, or as the Minister for Justice tried to use or partly use documents in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be regarded as frightening that we have the Minister for Justice with quite a number of policemen and the Minister for Defence with what he regards as a private army, <Col N="663" /> and we have not got the co-operation we should have between those two gentlemen.  One says he and the Government are prepared to accept reasoned amendments and the other says: &ldquo;Not an inch&rdquo;.  He nods.  He did say it and he means it.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice is calling his colleague the Minister for Defence a bit of a Yahoo for saying things like that, and that he himself will accept reasoned amendments.  I do not know. It is time they made up their minds as to what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the amendment, if I may, I believe the case for the amendment in my name is a fairly good case.  I am taking the only precedent that exists and I am asking that the same procedure should now apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to advert to the same point as has been raised by my colleague Deputy Collins, that is, to inquire from the Minister for Justice and the Government as to their approach to the putting forward of amendments by the Opposition.  This is of great importance to this Parliament, to the Oireachtas.  This is an occasion on which there is a special obligation on the Government to listen carefully to what we on this side of the House have to say about this legislation.  It is an important constitutional occasion on which the Government should endeavour, if at all possible, to bring the Opposition along with them and try to meet any reasonable and sensible objections the Opposition put forward.</P>
      <P>It is the Government who are emphasising the serious emergency nature of the situation.  Surely if that is so, there is a very serious and onerous obligation on them to endeavour to see that the legislation going through the House has the widest possible public support.  That public support can best be indicated by some sort of support in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disconcerting for Members of the Opposition and I am sure for the general public to perceive the unco-ordinated approach by the Government <Col N="664" /> to this matter.  I am not talking with any second-hand information or any hearsay evidence; I have heard the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence express totally different viewpoints in regard to amendments to this legislation.  The Minister for Justice, interviewed on the national television network, clearly stated that he was open to consider amendments put forward, to consider them on their merits, and if they were reasonable, to accept them.  I also heard the Minister for Defence in this House state equally categorically that the Government have no intention of changing one iota&mdash;I think they are his exact words&mdash;of this legislation.</P>
    <P>What are we in the Opposition to think in that sort of situation?  I suggest that that is not the only contradiction that is apparent in the approach of different members of the Government to this legislation.  Indeed, individual members of the Government are changing their own attitudes in relation to the legislation.  There is a fundamental dichotomy between the attitude of the Taoiseach when he introduced the legislation and things which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach subsequently said.  There is a further contradiction between the attitude taken by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the Opposition on one day and the different attitude he takes on another day.  I suggest that in the public interest this unco-ordinated approach by different Ministers to the situation is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, in particular, have always put themselves forward as the parliamentary party, the party to whom the democratic process was all important, that they cherish that process more than anybody else.  Indeed, there was always a slight suspicion that Fianna Fáil were not really fully and wholeheartedly committed to parliamentary democracy.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael have consistently purported to be that sort of party.  In that event, are they not prepared to recognise in legislation of this fundamental constitutional importance that the Opposition have an important part to play?  Will the Minister for Justice not admit that, if we put forward an amendment here and can persuade reasonably-minded people that our amendment is reasonable and acceptable, he will accept it?  Is the Minister prepared at this stage of the debate to acknowledge that, or are we wasting our time? Would we be better at this stage to say to the Government: &ldquo;You have the voting power, you are not open to reason, you will not listen to any arguments we put forward.  Here is your Bill, take it and we will all go home&rdquo;.  Is that the situation that confronts us?  Is the attitude of the Minister for Defence the Government's attitude?  Are the Government prepared to listen to reasoned argument from this side of the House and accept reasonable propositions, fully supported by logical argument on our part?  It is important that we should get that straight at this early stage of the Committee Stage debate on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very necessary that the Opposition should outline clearly for the benefit of the general public what exactly is involved in our putting down this amendment to section 1.  I want to emphasise that there is a matter of principle involved here and a very important principle.  This is not just a matter of improving the drafting of this Bill; it is a matter of parliamentary procedure, of the rights and standing of this Parliament as the representative of the people, of the balance which has to be preserved in any parliamentary democracy between the power of the Executive and <Col N="666" /> continue these extra-constitutional powers <i>ad infinitum.</i> the rights of Parliament.  That is involved in the amendment we have tabled.  Section 1 as it stands provides that once the Bill becomes law the whole question of the continuing in force of this extraordinary power of tension moves from the Oireachtas and becomes vested in the Government. It is important that everybody should understand that.  If section 1 in its present form stands part of the Bill then operative power in regard to the continuance of these powers moves out of this House and becomes a strictly Executive function.</P>
    <P>The Government will be empowered to extend the provisions of this Bill indefinitely by order and not by an order which will have to be passed by Dáil Éireann.  This Bill and the extra-constitutional powers of detention which it initiates can be extended by the Government by a simple order which, unless it is set aside by the Dáil specifically, will remain in force.  If the Bill is passed in its present form we can in effect say that this is not temporary legislation, that in fact it is permanent legislation to all intents and purposes.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House and the public to the absurdity of what the Government are proposing in this regard.  The Government have come before the Oireachtas with a constitutional resolution and a piece of emergency legislation in order to achieve this seven-day detention power situation.  By asking the Oireachtas to pass an emergency resolution declaring a state of national emergency and bringing in a Bill, they are acknowledging the exceptional nature of what they propose.</P>
    <P>Having given that initial acknowledgment of the exceptional and unique nature of their proposals they in this first section totally dispense with that approach.  Having recognised the reality of the situation, that they are asking for something exceptional and extra-constitutional, they then proceeded to incorporate in section 1 a provision which gets the Oireachtas out of the situation altogether and enables them to <Col N="667" /> I should also like to make this point. The Minister for Justice, in defending other proposals in these two pieces of legislation, can argue that what is proposed is necessary to enable the Garda to operate effectively. He can say that if we curtail the powers given in any section we are interfering with the efficiency and effectiveness of our security arrangements. No such argument applies in the case of this amendment.  This amendment, let us be clear about it, is related strictly to parliamentary procedures.  If the Government were to accept this amendment on our part it would not in any way interfere with the powers and capacity of the Garda Síochána or indeed of the Army.  We are concerned in this only with protecting the rights of this Oireachtas as representative of the people.  We want to ensure that this Oireachtas keep some grip over the situation, and we suggest that our proposition is entirely reasonable and should be an entirely acceptable one.</P>
    <P>We want to be logical about this. We are in effect saying to the Government: &ldquo;If you think it is necessary for this Oireachtas to pass legislation in order to initiate these powers you should acknowledge that it should be equally necessary for the Oireachtas to renew them every year.  Otherwise the section is a fraud, it is a sham. You should not bother mentioning 12 months in section 1 because you are making this legislation permanent to all intents and purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins has pointed out that in previous emergency legislation this provision was always incorporated. The Oireachtas, perhaps unwillingly, granted these emergency powers to the Government of the day because of the exigencies of the situation; but in doing so they said: &ldquo;You have to come back to this Parliament every 12 months and report and ask this Parliament for a renewal of these exceptional extra-constitutional powers&rdquo;.  What we propose in this amendment is a very important parliamentary and constitutional safeguard. If the Government do not accept it they cannot put forward the argument that they are refusing to <Col N="668" /> accept it because of security considerations. The only reason they can put forward for refusing to accept it is that they do not want to have to come back to Parliament.  They want to defy the Oireachtas.  They do not want to have to justify the continuing in operation of these extraordinary powers.</P>
    <P>It is important that we establish that clearly, that the normal argument open to the Minister in relation to other provisions in this legislation does not apply in this regard.  If the Fine Gael Party and the Minister for Justice are the devoted Parliamentarians they have always held themselves out to be, I believe they have no alternative but to accept this amendment, because it is a simple parliamentary, constitutional safeguard we are seeking.  Once the legislation is in operation its powers cannot be diminished in any way by the Government accepting this amendment. But we are asking them to go to the parliamentary trouble of coming back to this Oireachtas and asking for a renewal of this exceptional mandate which they are seeking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Deputy G. Collins and what he and Deputy Haughey have said in relation to this. One would have expected and hoped that the Minister would have intervened at the very start when the amendment was moved to say he was prepared to accept it.  Indeed, if he meant what he said in the Seanad and on television, that he was prepared to accept any reasonable amendment, he would have done that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed from the Minister's silence that he was not accepting this.  If he is he could tell us and it would save a lot of time, delay and trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot conceive of a more reasonable amendment than this one. Deputy Haughey has clearly pointed <Col N="669" /> out the significance and the nature of it.  What must above all else in relation to this be borne in mind is that the amendment, as Deputy G. Collins has said, constitutes, in fact, section 13 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.  That was passed early in September, 1939.  A genuine declaration of emergency had been passed by this House and by the Seanad at that time.  I emphasise &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; in contrasting it with the pseudo one forced through this House last week because there was a genuine national emergency at the beginning of September, 1939.  Europe was just descending into total war which, unfortunately, was to last for six years and this country and every person in it was in terrible and mortal danger and was saved from that danger by the skill of Éamon de Valera and the Government which he led throughout those six years.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the obvious character and rather terrible nature of the genuine emergency that existed in September, 1939, the Emergency Powers Act, which was passed that day and was so patently necessary, did not contain any section enabling it to be kept permanently in force by order of the Government such as this Bill contains. Instead it contained a provision in section 13 which is reproduced precisely in our amendment which would enable the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, which was a very serious and necessary measure, to continue in force for only 12 months at maximum, or that it would expire earlier by Government order or if the declaration of emergency ceased or went out of effect before then.  We had in 1939, in those terrible times therefore, a very definite limitation on the length of time for which that necessary Act of that year could remain in force.  The only way it could be continued beyond 12 months was by the Government of the day coming back here into this House and the other House and relegislating through the full legislative process for it to be continued in force for a further period not exceeding 12 months.  That process went on right through the war and the last Bill was passed in the summer of 1945 just before the end of <Col N="670" /> the war and it expired on the 2nd September, 1946.</P>
    <P>The position with this Bill, if it is enacted with this section 1 as it stands if our amendment is not accepted, means that, without coming back to the Oireachtas for consent or permission, the Government by order made privately can continue it in force and the only way that the Oireachtas have of even attempting to discuss it here if these orders are made is to put down a resolution seeking to annul the order within 21 sitting days of when it is made.  We had experience here that if orders are made during the summer recess 21 sitting days not infrequently can bring us virtually up to Christmas and there is no obligation on the Government to provide time for discussion of the motion until the 21st day.  Of course when we come to the 21st day and the Government, because they cannot avoid it have to provide time for the discussion of such an order, it is not unreasonable for us to assume in the light of history over the last three years that that motion will be guillotined, that perhaps two or three hours will be allowed for it and if the discussion is not finished in that time, even though the Opposition and Deputies generally might want to discuss it further, the Government will come in here, as they have done on dozens of occasions over the last three years and guillotine it and that is the end of it&mdash;and that is democracy.</P>
    <P>Why, if at the beginning of a terrible war and right through the whole six-year history of a terrible war the Government of the day could put in their Emergency Powers Acts provision for relegislation every year in order to give both Houses of the Oireachtas the fullest opportunity to discuss the operation of the Act, why if at a terrible time of mortal danger like that, that could be done, why can it not be done now in this pseudo emergency we are now living under?  The Government give no answer to that.  The only answer is that the Government have not the guts to come back in here and ask this House to renew the extraordinary provisions which are in this Bill for the detention of citizens without charge or trial and for the removal <Col N="671" /> of the protection which the Constitution of Ireland grants to all its citizens. They want to have the minimum discussion and they want this Bill and the very unusual and serious powers that are contained in it renewed and renewable every year by the private act of the Government themselves, by affixing their seal to a short order keeping it in force for 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is no justification at this time for this.  There was never any justification even in the horrors of the Second World War for not seeking legislative renewal, and that was a very real and terrible emergency.  The Government of the day had the guts to come back here and face the Parliament and the representatives of the people to renew those powers.  They were not ashamed to ask for renewal because when that Bill was put through the House the Government knew that the powers would not be abused, and they were not abused.  They were very stringent powers, but they were necessary.  We now have this so-called emergency and we have this Bill which may contribute nothing to the solution of the problem and may even exacerbate the somewhat delicate situation, but the Government feel that it is not right to come back to the Oireachtas to ask for a renewal of this after 12 months.  It can all be done privately by the Government making an order, and all the Oireachtas can do is put down a motion within 21 sitting days which will be guillotined down to a couple of hours to prevent a discussion of it.  The net effect of that is to continue in force more or less permanently the abrogation of the constitutional rights of the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>The constitutional rights of citizens should only be taken away in extreme circumstances.  There is only one other occasion on which it was done, the 2nd September, 1939.  That sort of situation was what was envisaged by Article 28 of the Constitution.  The framers of the Constitution would, no doubt, be horrified if they saw the one loophole they left a Government for use in time of grave national crisis being abused as it is today in order to introduce legislation at a time when there is no national emergency arising <Col N="672" /> from defects in our law.  Certainly there is a national emergency in relation to the economy.  I cannot accept that the Government are genuine in the protestations they made when this legislation was originally announced, and that they have made subsequently, if they do not accept this, which must surely be the most reasonable of amendments ever proposed to any measure in this House. It is patently proper that it should be accepted and that this limitation should be there, and that if it should be necessary in the opinion of the Government of the day to extend these extraordinary powers and the derogation of the citizens' constitutional rights for longer than 12 months, then it is this Oireachtas that should legislate for a further 12 months' derogation of the constitutional rights of our citizens.</P>
    <P>In column 275, Volume 264 of the Official Report for the 29th November, 1972, an amendment was put down by the present Minister for Justice to the proposal that the Offences Against the State Bill, 1972, be read a second time.  The amendment read as follows:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the ground that it contains matter which is unnecessary and excessive and which is repugnant to the basic principles of justice and liberty and the long established rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not think any one sentence could more clearly or more succinctly express what is being done in this Bill. That description is very true of what the present Minister for Justice asks this House and this country to accept so unnecessarily.  The whole country knows it is unnecessary, and still it is being steamrolled through, with a display of arrogance which we have come to expect, unfortunately, from some Ministers, but which I thought that the present Minister for Justice would at least have the intelligence not to exhibit.  Unfortunately, the characteristics of some of his colleagues seem to be rubbing off on the Minister.  If this House is to allow the derogation of our citizens' basic rights <Col N="673" /> and liberties as guaranteed in the Constitution of Ireland to be permanently derogated from, as this section proposes, then I think that this country can look forward to a very difficult time in the years to come.  If there are not enough people of principle in this House to stand up and to stop this permanent derogation of the rights of our citizens, I am afraid the outlook for this House and this country is a sorry one, not just in this field but in many other fields.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate that has taken place so far has been on a number of planes.  It has been related to the amendment, the justification for it, and it has been on a political plane.  Deputy Collins raised a point as to whether we can expect any more emergency power Bills, Deputy Haughey spoke about what he said was a contradiction between myself and my colleague the Minister for Defence, and Deputy O'Malley was digging sweetly into debates of two or three years ago.  Before I deal with the political points that were raised I will deal with the amendment. Although their thoughts were obscured by making political points I understood from the speakers that the principle which is being sought to establish in the amendment was parliamentary review, a parliamentary check over an Executive.  I am puzzled why Deputies have failed to recognise that that principle is written into the Bill as drafted.  The Bill as drafted says that it continues only in force for 12 months, unless the Government by order continues it, and then it goes on to say&mdash;nobody seems to have read this except Deputy O'Malley who interpreted it in a way to suit his arguments&mdash;that every Government order extending the powers of this Bill shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.  When the Government extend the life of the powers under this Bill, they must lay the order immediately before the Oireachtas, and if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within the next 21 days in which that House has sat after the order has been laid before it the order <Col N="674" /> shall be annulled accordingly.  There is a clear power for the Oireachtas to review the action of the Government in making the order continuing the powers in force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle that the Opposition have been urging here is parliamentary review, and that their amendment is reasonable to give recognition to that principle.  This principle is already recognised clearly in the Bill before the House.  It is clearly recognised that the order must be laid before the House and it can then be annulled.  There is a time limit within which that can be done.  It is only right that that should be so so that there will be certainty.  Deputy O'Malley's answer to that is that there might not be time provided by the Government to debate the matter. Having regard to the fact that there has been more Private Members' Time in the past three years of this Government's office than in the previous 16 years, an argument alleging that no time would be made available comes badly from the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential point I want to make on the amendment is that the principle of parliamentary review is already in the Bill and is devised in a much more satisfactory way to ensure certainty and continuity of this measure in the emergency that we have.  I should love to think that in 12 months' time the emergency would be gone and that we could afford the luxury of this exercise of political point-scoring that we have had here for the past ten days.  Unfortunately, the political horizon does not seem that hopeful and it seems to me that the emergency we face, the troubled times that we face will continue somewhat longer than that.  The proper way to deal with the situation is to give the Government charged with the Executive authority of the State in enforcing laws passed by this House the primary power to continue this emergency power in operation for a further 12 months subject to parliamentary review.  It is a matter then for Parliament to review it.  But the principle <Col N="675" /> of parliamentary review which the Opposition seek to express in their amendment is already in the Bill.  I want to assure Deputy Collins that what the Taoiseach said&mdash;and I said it also&mdash;was that as of now no further emergency power is contemplated.  But I also said that I cannot see into tomorrow; neither can Deputy Collins and I would hope there will be no need for any further emergency power but, as of now, none is contemplated by the Government.  I say that categorically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey introduced a discordant political note into what I thought would be a dispassionate debate on the merits of the Bill and the amendments.  The discordant note was struck in trying to suggest that there was some contradiction between the position of the Minister for Defence and myself.  He was echoed by others who were talking about collective responsibility and contradictory statements being made by Ministers.  If we are to have politics, let us have politics. I think that allegations of contradictions in that sense come very badly from a person who was a party to the most notorious contradiction between Ministers in the history of this State and I am not the authority for that: a judge of the Supreme Court is the authority for it.</P>

      <P>When we have a political debate Deputies opposite do not like it.  The point is that, as I have already indicated, I am prepared to consider reasonable amendments but as the Minister for Defence indicated the principles of this legislation have been established, set down and decided on by the Government and no Government so far as I am aware have decided on a matter of principle and then amended away that principle&mdash;improve the implementation of it, the definition of it, the way of operating it by all <Col N="676" /> means by amendment but not eviscerate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to hear the Minister on this matter particularly in view of the quotation that was aptly presented to him in regard to his contribution by way of an amendment in 1972 to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act. It is very apt that it should be applied to this and that the present occupant of the post of Minister for Justice should be the man who could be quoted in 1972.  Before coming to that, I want to say that all we have been talking about today and for part of last week derives from the effort of the Government in invoking Article 22 of the Constitution in order to set aside that part of the Constitution protecting the rights of individuals.  Having taken from the public by means of the operations in regard to the motion under Article 28 of the Constitution, it is small wonder that we find the same Government now denying Parliament their rights.  They utilised Article 28 to take away the rights of the people; they now utilise the whip and the feet of the people who support them to take away the rights of Parliament. That is what the Government are doing and it is not unexpected coming from a Government that have already trumped up a situation and the mockery that has taken place of resolutions going through the Oireachtas to conform to Article 28 in order to declare an emergency that never was. It is only to be expected, following that, that Parliament would be denied its rights in regard to the same operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to say that I am amazed that in regard to the previous part of the package of which this is part and of which the motions were part there was no vote on Second Stage.  I was led to believe that such a vote would take place; otherwise I would have been in the House to record dissent which I now wish to do on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Keavney.  We dissent from the agreement that apparently was reached here very quickly this evening without <Col N="677" /> a vote to accept the Second Reading of the Criminal Law Bill.  I want to say that; I am sorry to be so late about it but I was totally misled in regard to the matter; otherwise I would have appeared here to record my dissent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as I can make it quite clear that is the situation.  I can only be satisfied that I have been enabled, by the good grace of the Chair, to get on the record of the House my total dissent.</P>
      <P>I come now to what we are doing and what we propose to do in section 1 for which the amendment proposes to substitute another section.  The original section is wrong and, while the substitution would be less wrong, both, in my opinion, are wrong. Merely trimming the sails of what is totally wrong in section 1, by substituting a new section by way of amendment does not justify or make right what is proposed to be done in the section.</P>
      <P>I find that I cannot support the amendment, much as I might like to show my displeasure at the original section proposed in the Bill, because I would not be a party to giving to the Minister even the reduced time that is sought for the emergency powers, the application of section 2. If there is no emergency&mdash;and there is no emergency&mdash;of a national character to justify the setting aside of the rights of our people then there is no justification for putting into effect all the provisions of section 2, no matter under what guise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the provisions in section 1, disregarding my total rejection of the content or intention of the section, either as it stands or as it is proposed to be amended, it is a fact that here Parliament is being totally ignored and its functions totally usurped.  No waffling by the Minister will controvert that fact.  We have the situation now wherein section 2 remains in force for a period of 12 <Col N="678" /> months from the passing of this Act. Section 1 provides:</P>
    <P>(2)  The Government may by order provide:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  at any time when section 2 of this Act is in force, that that section shall continue in force for a period not exceeding twelve months from the commencement of the order,</P>
    <P>(b)  at any time when section 2 of this Act is in force, that that section shall cease to be in force on and from a date specified in the order.</P>
    <P>In other words, while it is in force, it can by order be terminated.  The most repugnant part of the section is subsection (2) (c) which provides that the Government may by order provide:</P>
    <P>at any time when section 2 of this Act is not in force, that that section shall come into force again and remain in force for a period not exceeding twelve months from the commencement of the order.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is a bit of a swizz. Subsection (2) (a) may by order continue for another 12 months or for year after year or it may cease to operate.  Subsection (c) is the real stunner.  If it is not in force it can be brought into force, by order, for 12 months and another 12 months and the Minister's defence of the charge that he is here bypassing Parliament and usurping its powers is that the order is subject to renewal and either House of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, annul the order within 21 sitting days from the date on which the order is laid before the House. We are not worried about subparagraph (b) but we are certainly worried about subparagraphs (a) and (c). Either one of the two Houses can annul the order.  That sounds grand. It looks as if we are really recognising that Parliament, elected by the people, is supreme.  That is not so here.</P>
    <P>The order can be annulled by resolution of either House after 21 sitting days.  If an order is made during the Summer Recess it could be Christmas or New Year before <Col N="679" /> such a resolution could be passed.  So much for the Minister's defence of parliamentary democracy.  As Deputy Haughey said, Fine Gael held themselves out as the guardians of parliamentary democracy.  They certainly did that in all the years I have been here and they jibed at Fianna Fáil as if Fianna Fáil's adherence to parliamentary procedures was in some way questionable.  I listened to many highfalutin' lectures here from Fine Gael Deputies admonishing those of us not of that party about the sacredness of the parliamentary process and how important and necessary a part of democracy it was.  Of course, they were in Opposition then.  It is a different matter now when they are in Government. They can ride roughshod over parliamentary democracy and over the concept of Parliament being above and beyond party.</P>
    <P>Parliament is, in fact, the people. It is from the people we derive what powers we have.  This Government, dominated by Fine Gael, the great guardians down the years of parliamentary democracy, are now throwing out the window, without batting an eyelid, and with a cheek that it is difficult to conceive, parliamentary democracy.  They do that blandly.  Because of their phoney defence of parliamentary institutions over the years during which they held themselves out to be the guardians of those institutions, they now think they can throw parliamentary democracy out the window, the institutions and procedures they pretended to uphold when in Opposition but are now, with the authority of Government, actually opposing.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister justify, more than he has attempted to do, this proposition? In the period that would elapse before the annulment of such an order, and it could be a very lengthy period, anything done during that period would still stand.  If that is the Minister's regard for the supremacy of Parliament, then God help us while such a Minister presides over the Department of Justice.  Perhaps he is merely fronting for a Government that forces him to do this.  It is <Col N="680" /> conceivable that he has no more liking for this particular section than I have.  In fact, his dislike of this section would be in keeping with his past contributions to debate in this House.  Perhaps he is being compelled to do this.  If he is, all I can say is &ldquo;God help him&rdquo;.  If he is not, all I can say is &ldquo;God help us&rdquo;.  It is a total negation of the recognition of the authority of the elected Parliament of the people and is only capable of being brought before us in such a manner by the abuse of Article 28 of the Constitution and the motions that were thumped through the two Houses last week.  It is a sad, sorry chapter now being written by this Government.  But whatever way the package is presented according to the Minister for Defence not one iota of it will be changed.  It is a sad package in three parts: knock the Constitution, knock the Parliament and, the result of it all, add on the Criminal Law Bill and knock the people.  Why the hell do they not go to the people and ask them?</P>

Perhaps the Government feel that that would be more than their skin could contain.  My notion is that if they had to do this again they would not start it at all.  If they do not feel that they can, with any dignity, withdraw the Bill, they should scrap those dangerous proceedings, go to the people, and ask them, they are the bosses.</P>

      <P>It is an abominable section.  Despite the best efforts of the people who put the amendment before us, it could not be amended by any device.  There is no possible device by which it could be made acceptable because the basis on which it hangs does not exist; it is a phoney.  It is, as has been said, a pseudo-emergency. Without the emergency there can be no Emergency Powers Bill.  Without the Emergency Powers Bill there could be no section 1.  Section 1 is such an abominable one that no brain is capable of amending it to the point at which it might be acceptable.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated the reasons why I think this amendment is not necessary.  Deputy Blaney probably was not listening to me or did not want to listen.  He wanted to make certain points.  The position on this amendment is that the principle of parliamentary review is already enshrined in the Bill, as drafted.  That was conceded, to all intents and purposes, by Deputy Blaney because what he was complaining about was the possibility that the review might not take place.  That is a matter for the House to decide.  As I have said already, there has been more time given to the Opposition in the last three years than in the previous 16.  It is beside the point to argue it on that question when there is a question of principle to be decided. The question of principle&mdash;that is the subject of the amendment&mdash;is the question of parliamentary review. Parliamentary review is already enshrined in the measure.  That is the logical reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances of this debate I am entitled to argue <i>ad hominem</i> in regard to Deputy Blaney.  It is this, that for a person who is an avowed <Col N="684" /> supporter of an organisation, one of whose objectives is the overthrow of this Parliament, it comes odd from him seeking to establish a principle of parliamentary review.</P>

      <P>It is very unfortunate that the debate has gone the way it has in the last 30 or 45 minutes.  In the last few days many of us believed that because of the important nature of the legislation we should approach it in a reasonable fashion.  We believed it to be the best course to approach it without becoming emotional, without losing our tempers, without making personal attacks or abusing personalities in the House.  I had hoped that would be acceptable to everyone here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was confusion about who said what, it is a fact that the Minister for Justice in the course of the debate in both Houses said he was prepared <Col N="687" /> to consider reasonable amendments.  It is also true, and the Minister for Defence has not denied it, that he said that the Government would not change the legislation one iota.  Anything that is amended is changed.  I know there are principles in the Bill and I recognise that one does not change one's principles.  That is fair enough.  The Government can stick to their principles and we will stick to ours.</P>
    <P>The amendment I put forward is a most reasonable one and I made a case for it in a very simple way.  When there was a declaration of a state of emergency in 1939 there was the Emergency Powers Act of that year. That Act was in operation for 12 months and at the end of that time the Government of the day had to come back to the House.  The matter had to be discussed and the legislation had to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it could be put into operation for another 12 months.  That is the only precedent we have with regard to legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now changing the system to a different system.  He will have this legislation renewed by order of the Government.  He is trying to maintain that we can come here and discuss it in full but he knows as well as I do that is not so.  We can put down a motion to annual the order.  The arguments about finding time to discuss the order annulling the legislation have been made more than once and I do not want to repeat them but the Minister cannot expect the House to believe that an order to annul this legislation and an opportunity to discuss it and to pass new legislation is one and the same thing.  It is not so and I have spelled this out clearly in my amendment.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry the Minister lost his temper at least twice since we resumed at 7.15 p.m.  If he was upset by a comment of Deputy O'Malley when he read for him an amendment the Minister put down in regard to legislation in 1972 which Deputy O'Malley was steering through the House, then I would say to him: &ldquo;so well it should&rdquo;.  I suggest there is no need for the Minister to launch a personal attack on Deputy Haughey or on <Col N="688" /> Deputy O'Malley.  If he disagrees with the points made that is all right; we cannot go across and twist his arm or push him to do what we want.</P>
    <P>There was confusion during the debate. With due respect to the Minister for Defence, he confused the issue by saying what he did.  We were not scoring political points.  We were only seeking clarification when we raised the matter and there is nothing wrong with that.  The Minister for Justice is responsible to the Government for steering legislation through the House and when he makes a statement I am prepared to accept it for what it is worth.  I am prepared to examine it further and see what is in it but when that statement is contradicted by one of his own, naturally we must question it.  That is not being political.  It is seeking clarification, nothing else.</P>
    <P>Seemingly the Minister has decided to reject our amendment.  All right.  If the Minister wants to refuse the amendment he is fully entitled to do so but if we are to get through this Bill and other legislation in the way that we should do, in a reasonable and fair manner without shouting, roaring, ranting and raving, we should be careful in the way we approach it. I am not going to attack the Minister personally or say any of the nasty things that can be said about anyone because it will get us nowhere.  I will not remind the Minister, his colleagues or any other Member of the House of what they said in 1972 or 1973 or what they did in 1969 or 1970.  All of us are elected Members of the Irish Parliament and I hope all of us are responsible and reasonable people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not accepting what we want him to accept, namely, the system that operated on the only other occasion when we had an Emergency Powers Act in operation, if he does not want to accept the system that was there for the renewal of that legislation, then let him say so.  He gave us his arguments; we do not accept them but that is all right.  If the Minister does not see his way to it we will have to vote on the matter.</P>

      <P>This Government have decided.  We accept collective responsibility that this package is one that will see to it that the IRA or any other subversive organisation that is killing and bombing people, that is stopping the advancement of this State, will be put down and &ldquo;put down&rdquo; is the operative phrase.  The Opposition have seen fit to take two debating points and to say that my colleague said that reasonable amendments would be considered.  Immediately the untruth was propagated that an amendment must constitute change.  There is no conflict between the Minister for Justice and myself or between us and the Government in regard to this legislation.  All 15 members of the Cabinet are adamant that subversion must end and in that regard not one iota of the package will be changed materially.  People opposite have given to something a meaning it does not have.  Having said that, if there is a way in which the Opposition can demonstrate to us that the mechanics of dealing with the legislation can be improved during Committee Stage, the Minister is right in saying that he would consider any such suggestion.</P>
      <P>The package before us is that decided on by the Government.  We stand clear before the people in regard to it but the same cannot be said of the Opposition.  On them there has been suspicion since 1970 and all the debating points that they can think of will not change that situation.</P>

I do not know what sort of debating parliament this is supposed to be if I am to be castigated for introducing a discordant political note into a debate on a measure of this importance.  I do not think I am being politically <Col N="690" /> discordant in asking the Government whether they are prepared to accept any amendment.  That was the question I addressed to the Minister.  Are the minds of the Ministers opposite closed completely to any suggestion or proposal from us?  Regardless of how he may quibble now or of what twist he may give to his words, the Minister for Defence has made the straightforward statement that no change will be made, that this legislation will not be changed one iota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should prefer the Minister for Justice to answer the specific question I put to him.  There is no point in our putting forward arguments to the best of our ability in favour of carefully thought out amendments if there is no possibility or hope of their being accepted by the Government.  I asked a specific straightforward question at the commencement of Committee Stage.  Was it not a legitimate political question? By way of reply it is not fair of the Minister to continue to launch these personal attacks on my integrity.  By behaving in this way he demeans himself. The Minister will be well advised in the course of this and other debates to shed this sanctimonious unctuous self-righteousness in which he has clothed himself and accept that on this side of the House there might be honest views held legitimately and with integrity.  In this way he would increase his stature as a Minister and, perhaps, would find greater public support for what he proposes.  During debates here I have always endeavoured to impose some restraint on myself.  I have sought to avoid personal argument so far as that was possible although from time to time I am tempted to break that restraint. <Col N="691" /> In this connection I did not refer back to 1970, to 1972 or to anything the Minister may have said on two other occasions.  Rather, I directed my arguments to the amendment we are putting forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister must admit that there is a fundamental difference between asking the Government to come forward and legislate again in 12 months time and simply enabling them to extend by order the legislation.</P>
      <P>There are three different ways in which this legislation can be extended on the expiration of the 12-month period; one is by asking the Government to come back and legislate again, the other is to make an order which must be moved and accepted by this House while the third and least effective way is by granting the Government power to make an order which stands unless it is over-ruled positively by the House.  In regard to this important and extraordinary constitutional legislation the Government have chosen the least effective of those three methods from the parliamentary point of view, namely, the procedure whereby they can simply make an order which stands unless somebody in this House moves to over-rule it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point we are making and if it is being discordant politically to make that point then, in the interest of our parliamentary procedures, we must be discordant politically, however much that upsets the Minister.  I thought and I considered it to have been a legitimate aim to get a co-ordinated approach from the Minister but he objects to my pointing out discrepancies in what individual Ministers say. Do we not continually day after day hear the Taoiseach and some Ministers accuse us of being divided, of having no unanimity in regard to what we propose?  Because I seek to get from these Ministers some co-ordinated approach to our amendments I am accused practically of treasonable activities.  I could point to further discrepancies between what Ministers have said.  For instance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said today that when these proposals were being discussed <Col N="692" /> in Cabinet there was no suggestion in anyone's mind that the proposals would be used in any way to impose censorship on newspapers, that this never entered into anyone's thoughts or into the discussions which took place.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs revealed that at all times he considered that section 3 of the Criminal Law Bill could be used to impose censorship on the press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He withdrew it.  That is different.  There is ample evidence available to us here to indicate separate approaches to this package by individual members of the Government but I am not concerned with that. It is an undesirable state of affairs because in a matter of this sort there should be a straightforward co-ordinated approach by every member of the Government.  But I am concerned with finding out what is the attitude to amendments.  This is particularly relevant to the amendment before us.  The Minister for Defence has come in to justify the stance of the Government, to tell us that the reason for the legislation is the necessity to put down violence and other unlawful activities but that is not what is concerned in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister admit that the amendment before us does not affect the legislation but that it affects the power of this Parliament?  That is all we are concerned with in this amendment. If Fine Gael have particular dedication and devotion to Parliamentary procedures I cannot see why in this regard they are turning down the <Col N="693" /> amendment.  In rejecting it they are undoubtedly diminishing in an unnecessary way the power of Parliament. There is all the difference in the world between the Government having to come in here and put legislation through this House which gives us, the Opposition, the opportunity of putting forward arguments, and the Government being enabled to do this by order which need never come near this House.  Admittedly, if the Opposition moved positively we could be given some restricted time to debate the order, but that is an entirely different procedure or mechanism from that for legislation which has to go through the full parliamentary process here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make just one point which is very much in line with what Deputy Haughey has said at the end of his speech.  In the Minister's reply previously he stated that in subsection (3) of section 1 this matter could be brought before Parliament. Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Collins and other speakers on this side of the House pointed out that we were not satisfied with this procedure and, as Deputy Haughey pointed out, there are three different ways in which the Minister could deal with this matter, that none of them affects in any way the principle involved in the Bill and that what we are concerned with here is parliamentary procedures.</P>
      <P>While the Minister has stated in his reply that this was one way in which the matter could be brought before the House, he has not stated why he refuses to accept the amendment.  The Opposition are not satisfied with the proposal put forward by the Minister. The amendment put forward by us is related to the manner in which the Government can deal with this matter. Therefore, if the procedure we have proposed is a procedure which can be adopted and which does not interfere in any way with the objective of the Government, then why is the Minister refusing to accept it?  As I said before, if he were to accept our amendment, while we are opposed to the Bill as such, nevertheless, we would then have a situation where there would be at least some small measure of agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="694" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take note that the last contributions from Deputy Haughey and Deputy Collins were full of sweetness and light, and I welcome that.  Deputy Collins' contribution was very much so, and I would be very happy to have the debate conducted on that basis, and I will say no more about the discordant political note.  If that element is introduced it has to be answered, but possibly it has been introduced and answered and we can forget about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey raised the point of our attitude to amendments, that if we are not going to accept amendments, let us say so now and get down to the voting.  He is not so naive as to expect me to say: &ldquo;Yes, we are accepting all your amendments&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, we are accepting none of your amendments&rdquo;.  I cannot give a decision on any amendment until I hear at least the arguments for it. The arguments for this amendment are being developed and I am replying to them.  I will consider each amendment in that light, that the arguments will have to be put forward and the debate will have to develop.  How those arguments impress me, how basic the amendment would be to the principle of the Bill, all these factors have to be weighed in the balance, and such factors prevent any Minister, as Deputy Haughey knows well, from giving a commitment in advance for or against accepting amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kernel of this particular matter is this: when the Bill is enacted here, the enforcement of that Bill then becomes a matter for the Executive of the day.  The passing of the law is a matter for the Legislature, and this is as prescribed in the Constitution, the separation of powers.  In this Bill the Government have sought, because of the emergency nature of it, a <i>via media</i> between the two responsibilities to keep the two parts linked to some extent.  Normally, the Executive goes its way when the legislation has been passed and is subject only to review by the courts.  In this case, because of the emergency nature of the Bill, what the Executive is proposing to the Legislature is that the law should be an annual law to be reviewed <Col N="695" /> by the Executive to whom this Legislature is being asked to give the law in the first instance.  Again, because of its emergency nature, the Executive is putting in a second provision for review, that is, the provision that either House of the Oireachtas may annul an Executive order.</P>
    <P>There is in the Bill as drafted a recognition of the functions of Executive and Legislature and there is a proper balance between the two. The Executive must be free to implement the laws given to it by the Legislature, but because of the emergency nature of this law, there is provision for parliamentary review, and that is an unusual thing to have in an Act of Parliament.  The Opposition amendment would disturb that balance and would put that balance too much in favour of the Legislature, away from the Executive, who have a constitutional responsibility to discharge. I think the constitutional positions of the two powers are adequately met in the section as drafted.  Parliamentary review is recognised and provided for.  Legislative continuity is also provided for, and I think that is the proper balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree at all with what the Minister has said, and this amendment gives him an opportunity to demonstrate what he and his colleagues have been saying over the last few days, that it is not intended that in the enforcement of this legislation the power given will be abused.  He is arguing that the device he has built into this section is as good as what the amendment proposes. It certainly is not.  Whether you argue that it is necessary or unnecessary, the distasteful part of the legislation is that it requires derogation from the Constitution and from the Convention on Human Rights. One would expect that a Government would, in the face of that, take every possible opportunity to see that the powers of Parliament would not be filched away in any re-enacting of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can visualise a situation that can exist, and I take exception to the provisions <Col N="696" /> of paragraph (c) of subsection (2).  In that paragraph, even if the legislation is not in force, the Government may at any time by motion reintroduce the powers provided for here.  That immediately would bring the legislation into effect and it could be months, because of the 21-day sitting provision, before this Parliament could debate it under the limited provisions governing statutory orders which are used in connection with the most trivial things.  There is a provision for 21 sitting days to elapse during which time the Opposition might seek to put down an annulment motion.  We have had examples of this in the past in relation to much less serious legislative matters.</P>
    <P>This provision in this paragraph is not a safeguard against the reintroduction of the legislation.  Statutory order could reintroduce the legislation. It must be laid before the Oireachtas &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; after the motion is made.  Therefore, if the Government introduced the motion at the end of July and the House did not meet again until October or November, in the meantime there would be no opportunity for the Opposition to use this limited device in a reasonable time.  That is the kernel of the points we are making and which the Minister has not answered.  Here there is a tremendous derogation from legislative safeguard. The Government are not prepared to give the fullest opportunity to Parliament to debate any such order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in respect of this paragraph involves a situation in which the Act is not in force, say for an interval.  Deputy Brennan said that in such an eventuality it involved legislating again.  I can see force in what he has said, but on the other side of the coin there is the exigency of the situation that would be responsible for calling these powers into operation again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill being debated pursuant to an emergency resolution and in the context of an abnormal situation with the possibility of high, low or medium points of crisis.  If the <Col N="697" /> Executive are to safeguard the situation, it is of the essence that they be able to move quickly and decisively. If every time this arose there had to be a debate here, there would be a conflict here to the detriment of the nation.  That is my judgment and that of the Government&mdash;that the power given should be exercised on an annual basis subject to parliamentary review. If we were to do what the Opposition require, the balance would be shifted too much in favour of the Legislature. The proper balance is being preserved here.</P>
    <P>The criticism in regard to the 21 sitting days is not of the Bill but has reference to the way this House orders its affairs.  It does not answer the point that parliamentary review within a reasonable time is provided for in the Bill.  How the Legislature orders its affairs to engage in that review is a separate matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Sincere though he sounded, I find it difficult to believe the Minister's arguments.  It is only after two hours that the Minister has come to the kernel of the point and he still has missed out on the case put for the amendment.  During the course of the last war when we had similar legislation in operation, Parliament was able to meet and order its business in such a way that there was no hold up in getting the legislation re-enacted each 12 months.  Last week the Taoiseach made great play of the proposition that we would have this Act for one year but when one probes the Minister's latest reply one finds there is no question about having it in a permanent fashion, subject only to review by Parliament.</P>

If the Government and the Government Whip decide to bring in such an order at the beginning of a recess, it could be Christmas before the House debated it.  The Minister has not given a clear explanation of why the system in operation, and which was successful, is now being rejected. On this amendment we have made a reasonable case which I am sorry the Minister has rejected.</P>

      <P>If the Minister did not see fit to reply to Deputy Collins, I have not much hope of getting a reply to my points.  In which circumstances does the Minister see paragraph (c) coming into play?  As I interpret it, the operation of the powers depends solely on the continuance of the declared emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can envisage a state of affairs where the activities giving rise to the emergency would begin to taper off and hopefully and happily would cease, and then the powers in the Bill could be allowed to lapse. However, that cessor might be only temporary: there might be a flare up on a localised basis or in terms of time and it might be necessary to deal quickly with that flare up, and to achieve that it might be necessary to reactivate the power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for this information.  This would be a tapering off situation which the Government in their enthusiasm are pushing us to accept and which has been allowed to lapse.  They misjudged the situation.  It was only a temporary lull of such a short duration that the necessary dismantling of the emergency declaration has not taken place and will flare up again so quickly that speed and haste are the essence of the operation and therefore subsection (c) will be available as an immediate strike weapon to get things going again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to discuss a few points the Minister raised but which the evidence does not bear out.  He asserted that a review is already provided for.  It has already been argued very competently from the Opposition <Col N="699" /> benches that that review is not in any way comparable with the full parliamentary procedure which was followed during the 1939-45 period. In that period things were very different to what they are now.  Those who are old enough to remember should try to cast their minds back to the difficulties of travelling to Dublin from the remoter parts of the country when the only available mode of transport was a train which might get to the place it was going on the day it departed.  This was due to the fact that the fuel situation was desperate and the boilers were being fired by fuel they were never intended to burn. Despite that and the dire necessity to conserve everything because of severe shortages, something similar to what is contained in section 1 could have been proposed.  It is strikingly peculiar that during all those difficulties, provision was made and full parliamentary procedure had to be gone through not less than once every 12 months during that emergency.</P>
    <P>It comes strange in a situation of non-national emergency, where petrol is much more expensive but is not as unobtainable as it was then, and when the trains which still run to some parts of the country do not run on unsuitable fuel, the air services that Deputies can avail of on some occasions and the helicopters that are available from the Minister for Defence's stable, if from nowhere else, to find that the Minister feels justified in ignoring the procedure which was then exceedingly difficult to carry out because of the emergency, and which is now not finding favour with the Government.  Instead there is being foisted on this House, with the full approval of the Minister and the Government, a review by way of opportunity to annul by either House within 21 sitting days of the laying before either of the Houses of an order.  If an order were made in the latter part of July or in August and placed with all possible speed before the two Houses, neither House might sit for a considerable time after.  It is conceivable that the Government, having made an order to <Col N="700" /> continue section 2 of this Bill for a period of 12 months or had by order brought into being again a lapsed Act, might feel and in their wisdom decide that if the order was discussed by either House it could run the risk of being annulled and this could be contrary to the views of the Government who had made the order, and it would not be beyond the bounds of possibility in such circumstances that the coming together of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas could be considerably delayed beyond the normal time of recall.  These are possibilities. I think the Minister would be the first to agree that in these possibilities there are dangerous overtones.</P>
    <P>His assured attitude that the review provided for in section 1 (3) is adequate is not shared by many in this House, including many of those sitting behind him.  Despite that there is no doubt that they will traipse into the lobby and support whatever finally emerges as the proposal of the Minister fronting for the Government. I am told there are &ldquo;wigs on the green&rdquo; in certain quarters tonight about what should be done by way of amendment to this Bill within certain supporters of the Government on whom they are relying to carry it through.  Of course, these are only rumours but rumours in this House, it being a close community, have a queer habit of being correct.  Some supporters of the Government are in a small gathering since early tonight and they are finding it difficult to resolve their consciences to accept this Bill as it stands.  I hope they reach a conclusion before it is passed, otherwise it will be too late.  If they then attempt to step out of line they will have the terms of the Bill applied to them instead of the Whip.  I was interested in Deputy Donegan's contribution.</P>

      <P>Sorry, Sir.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan.  A short while ago he stated in explanation <Col N="701" /> of what he is alleged to have said yesterday evening that the principle of this package would not be changed. He may have said that at some stage but I did not hear him.  One thing I did hear as he proceeded to leave the House with files under his arm, and it has been quoted by others, was that the Government would not change one iota of the package.  For what it is worth that is my recollection of his movements as well as of what he said. I did not hear Deputy Cooney state his willingness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Sir.  It is hard to get used to addressing them properly.  It is all too easy to address them improperly.  I did not hear what he is alleged to have said nor did I hear the contribution that he made on TV or on the radio.  It is said that he indicated that he would be willing to consider any reasonable amendments to this package.  I do not doubt it nor has the Minister for Justice denied that he said something to this effect. In fact, I think he confirmed that he is still willing to do whatever he said on TV or radio he would do.  That statement, together with what I have quoted the Minister for Defence as saying within my own hearing, seems to confuse Fianna Fáil.  While Fianna Fáil were being confused by these two contradictory statements it occurred to me that the answer to this situation is that it is open Government in operation, where more than two members of the Government may make contradictory statements but still mean the same thing.  That explanation may help to relieve the confusion of the members of Fianna Fáil who heard both statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said that in furtherance of his plea a review was already provided for and that this should be adequate.  To placate those who had fears about the review not being adequate he said that more private time was given in the past three years than in the previous 16 years.  That may be an exaggeration but I would not attempt to contradict <Col N="702" /> the Minister.  Nevertheless I think it is unlikely.  Not having the evidence to refute what I believe is not a fact, one can regard it as an enthusiastic exaggeration in furtherance of a weak case in regard to a review that is being provided as a substitution for the full parliamentary process.  One thing I do know is that it is a complete denial of the time for discussion of serious matters in this House.  I have been waiting four years for time to discuss the repeal of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act which the Government members were vociferous in opposing.  I am still waiting and it is still on the Order Paper.  So much for the generosity in the provision of time by this Government which was advanced tonight as an additional reason to placate those who do not feel happy about the review procedure.  I have as much chance of being given time as a snowball has in hell.  The Minister knows that and everybody else in the House knows that, but it will remain on that paper as a reminder and a contradiction of the assertion that you can expect a fair deal from this Government in regard to the provision of time for the discussion of important matters.</P>
    <P>The provision contained in section 2 for the extension of the terms of the Bill is a negation of the role of Parliament.  That in itself makes it a dangerous procedure, a procedure that denies Parliament its voice on behalf of the people for whom it speaks and with whose authority we have the right to speak in this House. When we deny Parliament we deny the very people who give us that authority.  The Minister is ill-advised to proceed in this manner, no matter how wet he is of the whole concept of what is enshrined in this Bill, which is part of the three-way package we are discussing, some of which we have completed.  No matter how high his enthusiasm is for putting the three-cornered item together, I still say that it is a dangerous procedure that he is proposing and one which could very readily have a kick-back, because a denial of the rights of Parliament is a denial of the rights of <Col N="703" /> the people who elected that Parliament. You cannot spit in the face of <Col N="704" /> the electorate for long and get away with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment <Col N="707" /> No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (3), to delete lines 10 to 12 inclusive.</P>
      <P>In connection with the amendments to section 2 I understand that the amendments are separate in their own right.  Perhaps the Minister and the Chair might consider taking them together for the purpose of discussion and we can vote separately on them when we get to that stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to subsection (3) of section 2 I have already in this House expressed my wonderment that, where a person has been in custody for the purpose of interrogation for 48 hours and during that 48 hours has given the Garda no information whatsoever and for that matter he may have remained silent throughout the 48 hour period, it is to be assumed that after a further five or seven days such a person would be, as it were, singing like the proverbial canary.  This provision of the Emergency Powers Bill cannot be read in isolation from section 7 of the Criminal Law Bill which provides that not merely can the Garda interrogate him but can also photograph him, fingerprint him, take tests from him in relation to firearms and explosives, and for which purpose may take skin swabs or hair samples and retain for testing anything found in his possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably the facilities proposed to be given to the Garda by section 7 could easily be given and the results ascertained within the 48 hour period. The Minister in the course of the Second Reading of this Bill said that he was unaware of any instance where a person having been detained for 48 hours was then theoretically released and allowed to step out of the place of detention and was then re-arrested and detained for a further period of 48 hours.  I have made further inquiries since the Minister queried my statement and I am satisfied <Col N="708" /> that what I said was correct, that the Garda in some instances operated their powers of detention for a 48 hour period in such a manner.  The question must be asked what guarantee is there that the Garda will not regard themselves similarly permitted to operate the seven day detention period?  It is of little use for the Minister to protest that this is not how the section is intended to operate.  There is no qualification in the section and any views of the Minister as to how it is intended to operate are of no use to the detained person either during the period of his detention or afterwards.  It is equivalent to the various protestations of members of the Government in relation to section 3, the incitement section of the Criminal Law Bill, where they are at pains to point out what their views of the law are, and how they believe our courts will interpret the law, notwithstanding that the clear and explicit wording of section 3 is phrased directly contrary to their views.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 2 (3) of this Bill, as in relation to section 3 of the Criminal Law Bill, I have little doubt that any court would prefer not to try to interpret the views of some Minister in this House as to what the Minister thinks this section really means.  If a person was picked up by the Garda and held in detention for seven days at the beginning of January of any year, and the same operation was carried out in the following June of the same year, then clearly the Minister would have no objection if the person who was picked up and detained for seven days on 1st January was also picked up and detained for seven days on the 1st of the following February.  This is clearly allowable under this section, and once one has accepted in principle that it can be so operated, with a gap of three or four weeks between each period of seven days detention then there is no logical argument in principle whereby a person cannot be arrested and held in detention for seven days every eight or nine days.</P>
    <P>The amendments which I am proposing to this section propose that any person so in detention shall have rights <Col N="709" /> of access available to him by his legal and medical advisers and the right to correspond with his relatives and advisers, and they shall have the right to know at what Garda station or prison or other convenient place the detainee is being held.  It should be quite clear to the Minister and to the House that persons have been and are being arrested and held in confinement and their whereabouts are not being disclosed to their legal advisers, even in cases where their legal advisers have gone in search of them.  The House will recall a case in the High Court some months ago where a person was being held in a Garda station over a weekend and his solicitor and his solicitor's assistant and their counsel went looking for that person to give him legal advice.  The advisers eventually made contact with a senior member of the Garda Síochána, and at the Garda officer's instigation a query was sent out from the communications centre in Dublin Castle to each Garda station in the Dublin area as to whether that person was in custody in any Garda station.  I understand that no answer was received to that request although at the relative time the person was in custody in a Garda station not far from this House.  It seems unreal of the Minister not to accept the proposition that where a person is in Garda custody his relations and advisers should have some basis of at least knowing where he is.  A suggestion was made that this could lead to riots outside any Garda station but the section is drafted sufficiently wide to enable any person to be brought to a place as secure as an Army barracks, for example.  Looking at the record of this Government, one queries whether any Garda station or prison is secure to detain convicted persons, not to mention persons allegedly innocent and merely in detention.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend the Minister commented on the fact that our proposal that medical advisers be allowed to see a person while in detention is a slur on the Garda Síochána.  I do not accept that such is the case.  There have been cases in the past where persons would appear to have suffered some physical injury while in Garda <Col N="710" /> custody.  I accept that those cases are very few and far between but nonetheless it seems clear that some happened.  In relation to the majority of cases where this does not happen, surely the Minister and the House will agree that it is in the interests and indeed for the protection of the Garda Síochána that the person arrested should be medically examined. I cannot understand how the Minister can state that this suggestion is a slur on the Garda when it is already accepted practice that when any person is brought to Mountjoy Prison as a convicted prisoner or on remand from any court, he is automatically and as a matter of practice examined to see if he bears any physical marks on him.  It would seem that the medical examination of a person in those circumstances, so long as the Minister's Department operate it is all right, but all wrong, and a slur on the Garda when it is suggested by anyone on this side of the House. It is fair to say in relation to any legislation, but especially in relation to criminal legislation deemed to be of an emergency nature, and having constitutional protection, it should be acceptable to the public, as a general body, whether or not they are persons likely to be affected by such legislation. The writing into this Bill of very basic safeguards which may only be of significance in one per cent of cases which this legislation would affect, would at least tend to make the public less fearful of the proposed legislation and less fearful of the motivations of the Government who propose such legislation.  Without wishing to appear to tease the Minister or annoy him, he said that a reasoned amendment would be considered by him and I believe this is a reasoned amendment and I hope he will see his way to accept it.</P>
    <P>I have a fair idea already of the Minister's reply since in the course of interviews on radio and television and in an interview with the <i>Sunday Independent</i> the Minister made known his views on some of these points.  He said that the accused person would get the normal legal advice but he said that if doctors were allowed admittance it followed that <Col N="711" /> arguments in favour of dentists, hairdressers and so on, would be made that they also should get in.  Perhaps the Minister was under pressure during that interview and I would hope that is why he said what he said because it is a serious matter that a person should have access to legal and medical advice if he requires it.</P>
    <P>As regards my suggestion that it was only right and proper that the family of the accused person should know where he was held, the Minister is reported as having said in some instances the family of the accused person might not want to know his whereabouts.  Again, I shall not stick that statement to the Minister's coat collar because he may have been under pressure and may have said this for the sake of giving an answer, but that is not so; the Minister realises that if a person is being held &mdash;I am sorry if the Minister for Foreign Affairs finds this funny and amusing.  I think it is a very serious matter.</P>

      <P>In an interview which the Minister had with Vincent Browne in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> the Minister was quoted as saying that complaints of ill-treatment were coming almost invariably from subversives who were taken into custody and &ldquo;complaints from these sources do not impress me&rdquo;.  If this is what the Minister said it represents a most inhuman attitude on his part.  It suggests that had he been Minister for Justice or a member of the Government at the time of the torture allegations five years ago, the case against Britain might never have been taken since the allegations were made at that time by people who came under the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By agreement, we are dealing with two amendments of which the first proposes to delete lines ten to 12, in other words, to remove the provision <Col N="713" /> to detain in custody for a further five days.  In support of that amendment Deputy Collins made two points &mdash;he will correct me if there were more.  First, he is worried that there might be abuses, that if there were not consecutive holdings for periods of seven days there would be virtually consecutive holdings with only a small interval between them.  I think that in replying to the Second Stage debate I pointed out that it would be administratively and, in my opinion, legally wrong to do this; administratively wrong because it would be an abuse of the powers given here and I shall go into why it would be legally wrong in more detail later.</P>
      <P>In the Second Stage debate Deputy Collins made the point that this abuse had taken place and that people had been held for successive periods of 48 hours.  I said I was not aware of any such abuse and that certainly such cases had not come to me, that it was conceivable in all the arrests that had been made that a person was held for two successive periods of 48 hours but that that would be wrong.  I invited details from Deputy Collins if he was aware of such cases and I said I would see that investigations would be carried out and that any necessary consequences would be visited on the people responsible.  He says that since then he has been making inquiries which have confirmed what he said on the Second Stage debate about this abuse taking place.  Again, for the sake of the Garda and for the sake of the public generally, I ask him to give me this information, pass on to me the hard facts which, I take it, he has found.  I look forward to receiving those in due course from him and I undertake to him here that I shall have them investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I said there were two constraints that would prevent the abuse of successive arrests.  The first is that there would be a very clear and unequivocal Government direction to the Garda that such use of the section would be an abuse of it and, therefore, this was not to be done.  I am confident that such a direction, given the loyalty and discipline of the force, will be honoured in <Col N="714" /> the spirit and in the letter.  That is the first constraint.</P>
    <P>The second constraint is that this is not a blanket power to arrest people. People can be arrested only when the conditions set out in subsection (1) of section 2 are fulfilled.  Let me remind the House what they are:</P>
    <P>(1)  A member of the Garda Síochána (on production of his identification card, if demanded, where he is not in uniform) may without warrant stop, search, question and arrest any person, or do any one or more of these things in respect of any person, if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person has committed, is committing or is about to commit an offence under the Offences against the State Act, 1939, or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of part V of that Act, or if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person is carrying any document or other article or thing, or is in possession of information, relating to the commission or intended commission of the offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be wider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is written into the Bill that the person making the arrest must have reasonable cause.  It would be incredible that a person could without reasonable cause arrest the same individual on successive, or well-nigh successive, occasions or periods of seven days.  I am satisfied that, if a person were arrested in that manner, he would quickly have recourse to the courts on the grounds that such arrest was not within the terms of the section and that entitlement to go to the court would not be removed by the immunity given by virtue of Article 28 of the Constitution because that immunity arises only when the arrest is in accordance with the law.  The case can be made, I believe very convincingly and successfully, that the arrest of a person in those circumstances could <Col N="715" /> not possibly be in accordance with the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the protection afforded by way of direction to the Garda there is the legal protection that the arrest must conform with the requirements of the section.  I reject Deputy Collins' argument on these two scores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt to ask one question?  Did I hear the Minister say a direction will be given from the Government to the Garda as to how they should interpret the administration of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Garda will get an instruction from the Government that what is feared by Deputy Collins, namely, arrests for successive periods of seven days, are not to be carried out because that would be an abuse of the powers given by the Bill. Furthermore, it would, in the Government's opinion, be illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the garda suspect the man was carrying documents? The Minister argued it is unlikely the garda would suspect a man of being about to commit a crime twice in seven days.  He could certainly suspect the man, so to speak, of carrying documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He could but he would have to be able to do so &ldquo;with reasonable cause&rdquo; and, if the circumstances of the case were such that he could not possibly have &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;, then he would be open to legal sanctions.  If he had not legal powers, the powers so exercised would come within the confines of the section. But I would regard that as an extremely rare and exceptional situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins' second amendment seeks to provide for:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>daily access to a person in custody within the meaning of section 2 (3) of this Act by such person's legal and medical advisers and facilities for such person in custody to contact his legal and medical advisers, and <Col N="716" /> the disclosure to the next-of-kin of a person in custody under section 2 (3) of this Act of his whereabouts and address at any particular time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy prefers the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; rather than next-of-kin.  I do not object to what the Deputy seeks but I suggest these rights are already in existence.  I am advised&mdash;I have no doubt about it &mdash;that by virtue of the guarantee of personal rights under the Constitution one such right is a right to legal advice. That is a constitutional right and, as such, it is part of our law.  I have no doubt at all that that is the situation and since that is so, it is unnecessary to write into this legislation what is the existing legal position.  I have no doubt, too, that were there any impediment placed in the way of the exercise of that right, the court would very speedily grant relief.</P>
    <P>Likewise, should there be need for medical attention, that is also a personal right guaranteed under the Constitution.  When this suggestion with regard to a medical adviser was first mentioned I said&mdash;I think I was expressing what would be a common enough and natural enough reaction &mdash;that the suggestion carried with it an implication that there was need for such advice arising out of the custody of the individual and that carried with it the implication that the person had been assaulted.  I rejected the implication then and I reject it again now.</P>
    <P>I suggested humorously on Second Stage that one should also demand rights of access for various other classes, such as a hairdresser, a dentist or an optician.  If access in the case of a doctor is not required to treat ill-treatment then logically provision should be made for all sorts of advisers.  I was not under any pressure when I said that.  It was a clear, logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>With regard to families I have never heard that there was any difficulty about families being notified of the whereabouts of a person in custody.  The 48-hours provision has been in force since 1939.  This is a small, intimate community and what happens becomes known very quickly. <Col N="717" /> We do not live in large, anonymous conurbations.  I consider a person has a right to have his family informed. Deputy Collins mentioned an instance in which a solicitor had difficulty.  I am thinking of a case where the solicitor was a lady&mdash;Deputy Collins indicates it is the same case&mdash;where there was alleged concealment by the gardaí of the lady's client.  The court was invoked and fully investigated the matter and exonerated the gardaí of any attempt to conceal from this lady the whereabouts of her client.  My recollection is that the court was satisfied there was a series of coincidences, or misapprehensions, or misunderstandings which got in the way of this lady finding out what she wanted and I think, by way of implication, the court was critical of it.  I am satisfied that getting information as to the whereabouts of someone in custody has not been a problem.</P>

      <P>If a person is <Col N="718" /> arrested and he asks that his family be told and also requests medical or legal advice&mdash;we will say &ldquo;legal&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;medical&rdquo;&mdash;is the Minister giving a guarantee to the House that that person may communicate with his family and, if he so wishes, get legal advice that same day?</P>
