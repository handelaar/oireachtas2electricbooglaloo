      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has noted the contents of the statement issued on 28th May, 1976, by the Local Authority Medical Specialists Co. Ltd., regarding <Col N="835" /> the period of time some patients must wait for operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to by the Deputy.  Waiting periods for operations vary from hospital to hospital and from one surgical condition to another.  In general, the waiting period for operations is not unduly long and urgent cases are usually admitted for treatment without delay.  There are a few problem areas such as eye surgery and hip replacement surgery.  With regard to eye surgery, additional ophthalmic consultants and extra facilities have been provided within the past few years and the position is improving. The arrangements for providing orthopaedic surgery are being specially examined by Comhairle na nOspidéal and by my Department at present to see what can be done to improve the situation, within the resources available.</P>

      <P>Social welfare payments to all recipients, both men and women, are regularly reviewed, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, and very substantial improvements have been made in those payments since this Government took office.  Particular attention has been paid to the position of women in relation to access to social welfare benefits and allowances <Col N="837" /> and special provision has been made for them in recent years by way of alterations to existing schemes and the introduction of new schemes. Considerable progress has been made and in this connection may I remind the Deputy that of 15 recommendations made by the Commission on the Status of Women regarding the elimination of discrimination against women in the social welfare code, eight have been fully implemented and three partly implemented.  Of the remaining four recommendations one would, if implemented, worsen the position of widows by importing a condition of age or of responsibility for dependants; the other three will be kept in view in relation to any future development of the services for which my Department are responsible but, although it is my hope that I will be able to eliminate discrimination where it exists, I regret that I am not in a position to give the Deputy any timetable in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will arrange for widows of public servants who retired before 1968 to have their pensions increased from one quarter of their late husbands' pension to one half as is paid to widows <Col N="849" /> of public servants who retired from 1968 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pension benefits for the widows and children of civil servants are provided on the basis of contributions being paid by officers serving on or after 23rd July, 1968, to cover the risk of predeceasing their wives.  Those who had retired or died prior to that date were not covered and paid no contributions. Accordingly, their widows could not benefit under the scheme.  It is, of course, clear that a scheme framed to cover a potential risk would not be appropriate where the contingency had already arisen, due to the husband's death.</P>
      <P>A special scheme was provided on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis as from 1st October, 1969, for the widows and children of those who retired or died prior to the introduction of the contributory scheme.  It enables pensions of one-half of the rate payable under the contributory scheme to be awarded to such widows.  The current annual rate of expenditure on these pensions for the public service, including the civil service, is £3,000,000, so to double the rate would entail an extra annual charge of £3,000,000 on the Exchequer; indeed that sum will in crease from 1st July next.  This figure does not allow for the possibility of claims from other groups for compensatory increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of existing members of the contributory scheme making higher contributions, to meet the cost of improving the <i>ex gratia</i> pensions, was taken up with staff side representatives but no positive reaction was obtained.  I should point out, however, that because of the annual pension increases for public service pensioners, the average <i>ex gratia</i> pension went up by at least 29 per cent last year and will attract a further increase of over 11 per cent with effect from 1st July, 1976.  Allowing for the latter increase the rates will have risen, on average, by approximately 203 per cent since the scheme was introduced in 1969. Accordingly, I am afraid that, in present circumstances, it is not feasible to <Col N="850" /> double the existing rate of pension for pre-1968 civil service widows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that this is a longstanding problem, and would he, first of all, admit that these pre-1968 widows, as they are identified, must necessarily be a diminishing group? Did he give a figure of £3 million as the cost of pensions to these <i>ex gratia</i> widows alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as of now. It will be £3,250,000 for 1st July next. That is under the existing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does recognise that the group cannot grow in size; it must diminish, and therefore when he mentions £3 million it will not be a permanent annual charge of £3 million?  Would the Minister agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probable assuming that the existing rates will not be altered, but it will be £3,250,000.  To accede to the suggestion would mean that the total would be £6,500,000 as of now; please God, many of them will survive for a long time to come.  Having regard to the fact that contributory pensioners are required to contribute to pensions at the level which is being sought in this question, obviously were others to receive equal pensions without making any contribution, there would be pressure to relieve people from the obligation of making a contribution in respect of what are now contributory pensions.</P>

Does the Minister agree that when this scheme was introduced for the public service generally this group of people were, through no fault of their own, badly and unfortunately treated?  Does the Minister agree that this <i>ex gratia</i> scheme was brought in to try and ameliorate their circumstances as an <i>ad hoc ad misericordiam</i><Col N="851" /> measure?  Bearing all that in mind does the Minister not think in view of the fact that they are a diminishing group he could be reasonable in his approach to them now and grant them this concession which they have always been seeking, particularly in view of the facts I have outlined? Secondly, if the Minister cannot see his way to doing that from the general Exchequer, would the Minister now initiate meaningful discussions with the organisations to see if they could be catered for through the new scheme rather than directly from the Exchequer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection at all.  Certainly, I would hope that there would be a disposition to make a contribution but at present one could not warrant giving pensions on a basis equal to those which are paid to those who are making contributions, nor would one be justified in asking the general body of taxpayers to contribute another £3¼ million in order to bring the pensions in question up to the level sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that if the general body of taxpayers were prepared to pay half these pensions as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, once that principle is established it would be quite reasonable to have the general body of taxpayers pay the entire pensions?  That is a sort of argument that we could throw back and forth across the House for a long time.  I am appealing to the Minister on <i>ad misericordiam</i> generosity grounds to try and do something for this group of people. <Col N="852" /> The Minister's own reputation at present could do with a little bit of helping in this regard and if he could do something that would appear to the general public to be reasonable, decent and generous it would be very helpful from his own point of view.</P>

Does the Minister consider that the gain of £30,000, or whatever figure he mentioned, to the State is a valid tax upon what is alleged to be a musical nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure supplied to me by the Revenue Commissioners is £55,000 and I have no reason to doubt that figure.  Of course, it is possible to buy pianos other than new pianos.  There are many excellent built-up pianos so that a mother anxious to impart musical training to her children can do this without investing £1,000 for a new piano.  I can <Col N="853" /> understand the Deputy's anxiety to make this facility available at a lower cost but there are many goods and services subject to VAT for which a very good case can be made in isolation but I am afraid the Exchequer is in the position that it must take a neutral stand and not proceed to use the fiscal laws of the country for the purpose of advancing the merits of each case.</P>

I accept all the Deputy has said about the contribution to music in general and Ireland's cultural image in particular arising out of the activities of the persons to whom he referred, but I would find it very difficult, for instance, to justify granting exemption to some international star who can make more in a one night stand than many a hard working person can make in one year.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that there is a very good case for exempting the national and provincial newspaper industries both of which are now in serious difficulties, from VAT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not accept that the difficulties of any business are attributable to VAT which is a tax paid by the purchaser or consumer, not by the industry itself.  Secondly, it is wrong to assume that if VAT is removed an industry will benefit.  If VAT is removed it is the consumer who must benefit, not the producer of the goods.  Therefore, it is an empty argument to suggest that VAT is the cause of difficulties.  It is not a tax borne by an industry; it is a tax paid by the consumer and further, it is not open to this country to remove VAT from any commodity which is produced in Ireland without giving a similar concession to a similar commodity coming in from abroad.  Any relief would be an omnibus relief which would apply to newspapers other than Irish-produced newspapers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister can deal with imports of newspapers in a different way from the manner in which he deals with the newspaper industry here?

However, a number of French individual projects <Col N="861" /> relating to land drainage and general improvement of infrastructures on an area basis, as distinct from individual farms, have been approved for FEOGA grants in recent years.  The proportion of the cost to be recouped from FEOGA would vary from one project to another.</P>

      <P>The farm modernisation scheme as operated here complies with the appropriate EEC directive.  I have given the Deputy what information was at my disposal and there is no need to establish or implement any further drainage schemes here.  The existing schemes are quite adequate to meet the demands of our farming community.  However, if there is a change in the position in future, that is a matter that will be open to discussion. The only change I can see is that if drainage is to be carried out on an area basis rather than on individual farms as obtains at present, then if syndicates are formed and apply for drainage covering a number of farms that could be something for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to set up a statutory national gas board which will be the national authority responsible for the supply and distribution of natural gas.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself I would like to dwell briefly on the events which led up to the present proposal.</P>
      <P>In the intensive search for new energy patterns now being undertaken by all oil importing countries, natural gas has emerged as one of the most promising elements.  The significant reserves of onshore gas discovered in the Netherlands in the late 1950s stimulated interest in the possibility of the existence of hydrocarbon deposits extending under the Continent Shelf areas around these islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surveying and drilling in our Continental Shelf area was initiated in the late 1960s by Marathon Petroleum Ireland Ltd. under an agreement originally concluded in 1959.  The commercial gas field confirmed by Marathon in 1973 in the area south of Kinsale Head has been estimated to contain one million million cubic feet of gas, capable of sustaining a flow rate of 125 million cubic feet a day over a period of 20 years.  This is not a major gas find compared to some of the North Sea deposits but it is equivalent to about 12 per cent of Ireland's present total energy requirements.  Even more significantly it has confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in the Irish Continental Shelf and has given encouragement to the programme for the <Col N="925" /> further exploration of our offshore area.</P>
    <P>In considering the possible allocation of the gas, the Government had to take account of the fact that we did not have an established gas industry with the potential to absorb the flow of gas from this field from an early stage in sufficient quantity to remunerate the enormous capital investment involved.  The Government, after careful consideration, decided to allocate this gas for a new plant to be built by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta at Marino Point in Cork for the production of ammonia and urea for the fertiliser industry and for additional ESB generating capacity of 400mw in a new station at Whitegate and the extension of the board's existing plant at Marina.  An allocation is also being made available to Cork Gas Company to meet the requirements of their consumers.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by various commentators that the use of natural gas for electricity generation is not the most efficient method of utilisation. There are however a number of other important considerations that have to be taken into account.  The high rate of offtake required in the early stages to justify the heavy investment, both offshore and onshore, could only be provided here by substantial users like the electricity and fertiliser industries. The use of gas by the ESB will reduce the Board's dependence on imported oil and thus safeguard the consumer against the worst effects of any future interruptions of international oil movements.  The allocation of natural gas for the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta project will assure supply of nitrogenous fertiliser to Irish agriculture with a surplus for export.</P>
    <P>The development of the field and the associated onshore projects will involve total investment in excess of £200 million.  The onshore construction projects will provide over 2,000 jobs and there will be permanent employment for about 700 workers.  The country's balance of payments will improve by an estimated £75 million a year and the total development will involve an accrual of new technology <Col N="926" /> which will be of considerable benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>An important consideration in regard to the utilisation of natural gas and the arrangements for onshore transmission and distribution is the need for a system of co-ordinated national control.  It is clearly important that indigenous energy resources should be developed and exploited to the best advantage of the economy as a whole and that the benefits, both direct and indirect, should accrue to the community.  A national authority is also desirable so that uniformly high standards should be applied in the construction and operation of terminals, pipelines and associated installations. Accordingly, the Government decided early last year that a national gas authority should be established and they authorised me to undertake the preparation of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the preparation of legislation for the establishment of a new State-sponsored body takes a certain amount of time. To have deferred action on the development of the Kinsale Head field until a Bill was enacted and the new board established would have involved an unnecessary delay in bringing the gas on stream.  Accordingly, in April last year I set up Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta under the Companies Acts to undertake the conclusion of the negotiations with Marathon for the purchase of the gas and to initiate the planning of the onshore pipeline system.</P>
    <P>BGE's first task was, as I have mentioned, the conclusion of a contract with Marathon for purchase of the Kinsale Head gas.  The foundations for this contract had already been laid in the negotiations conducted initially by the ESB and NET with Marathon and while commercial considerations dictate that the terms of the contract must remain confidential, I can assure the House that a very good deal was, in fact, negotiated.  Contractual obligations between BGE and Marathon envisage a first delivery date of 1st April, 1979 for the gas. However, at my prompting and with the encouragement of the Minister for <Col N="927" /> Industry and Commerce, both BGE and Marathon are pressing ahead with their projects with a view to meeting a target delivery date of early 1978.</P>
    <P>As regards the onshore pipeline project, I understand that this comprises a combination of conventional engineering skills with certain gas technologies new to this country.  I know that BGE saw this project from the outset as a pilot scheme on which the foundations would be laid for any future gas developments.</P>
    <P>Maximisation of the involvement of Irish enterprise and skills has been a plank in BGE's policy and it was in this context, and with a view to developing the gas technology expertise which was lacking within this country, that BGE found it necessary to obtain consultancy services from the British Gas Corporation.  This decision met with a certain amount of adverse criticism at the time and I think that it is only right that I should avail of this occasion to repeat my support for BGE's decision.</P>
    <P>The consultancy services being provided by British Gas are mainly of an advisory nature, covering matters such as safety codes and standards, design parameters and route selection, areas in which the necessary expertise was not available within the country. The engagement of British Gas does not mean that decisions on the placing of contracts have been taken from the hands of BGE.  On the contrary, the awarding of contracts remains the responsibility of BGE and in this connection I was heartened to learn some time ago that two of the earliest contracts to arise were awarded to the ESB.  These covered a feasibility study of the pipeline crossing of the river Lee from Little Island to Ring Mahon and detailed design drawings for the pipeline system.</P>
    <P>The services of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have been retained by BGE to monitor the possibilities for Irish manufacturers and contractors and I understand that a number of Irish contractors have already expressed interest in the construction phase, some in consortia with experienced gas pipelaying contractors, <Col N="928" /> a move which BGE welcome and which I heartily endorse.</P>
    <P>The principal onshore feature of any natural gas development is, of course, the construction of the underground pipeline.  It is in the public interest that the construction of such pipelines should be subject to overall control by the State and it is with that in mind that I have framed section 8 of the Bill to require the board to obtain my consent to the construction of a pipeline and to adhere to such conditions as I may specify regarding codes and standards of safety and efficiency in construction and maintenance.</P>
    <P>The section further provides that in the construction of a gas pipeline the board shall take all reasonable measures to protect the natural environment and amenities including buildings and other objects of architectural or historical interest.  Furthermore, provision is made whereby the board in the selection of a route for the construction of a pipeline shall take into account the representations of any local or harbour authority or any railway, electricity, water or other gas undertaker concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has agreed in the light of these statutory obligations that the laying of the underground pipeline should be exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission and he proposes to make appropriate regulations under the Planning Act in due course.  In this respect the board's position will be similar to that of other gas undertakings.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this section will apply to the onshore pipeline being provided in connection with the Kinsale Head development, and, indeed, I understand from BGE that detailed consultations have already taken place and are continuing with interested parties, including the Cork local authorities, statutory bodies and other representative organisations.</P>
    <P>The securing of wayleaves will be an important task in any natural gas pipeline project.  Some 30 miles of wayleaves are involved in the Kinsale Head project and the co-operation of <Col N="929" /> the farming community hardly needs to be stressed.  Negotiations have been taking place between BGE and representatives of the landowners with a view to securing by agreement the wayleaves for the pipeline.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that these negotiations can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  In this connection, I should mention, that, while the negotiation of wayleave terms is a matter falling within the day to day affairs of BGE, the board as a public utility must have regard to the levels of wayleave payment currently payable within the public sector including settlements arrived at by means of arbitration.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important to ensure that a project as important to the country as a whole as the present one, or indeed any further natural gas development, is not frustrated or unduly delayed and accordingly provision is included in section 32 for the making of a ministerial order to authorise the board to acquire compulsorily land or rights over land.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule sets out the procedure to be followed in relation to a compulsory acquisition order.  The board's powers to acquire land or rights over land are no different from those of other State bodies and local authorities who have to have such powers for the discharge of their functions.  Provision is made for the normal safeguards for all interested parties such as provisions for the hearing of objections and representations and for independent arbitration on compensation terms.</P>
    <P>At this point I should mention that the progress made by BGE to date gives every indication that, provided no exceptional difficulties arise, the gas should be on stream in accordance with our target date of early 1978.  I am satisfied that this could not have been achieved if I had not taken the step of setting up BGE as an interim company in advance of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The company, Bord Gáis Éireann Teo., will of course be dissolved under the present Bill in the manner prescribed in section 35 but this does not mean that there will be any interruption <Col N="930" /> in the project.  Continuity and momentum must be maintained and the project will of course be carried through to completion by the Gas Board acting within the statutory framework which will be provided by this Bill.  I think it is appropriate that I should express my appreciation of the work of both board members and staff in getting a new and complex project so well advanced within a comparatively short space of time.</P>
    <P>The statutory board, which will be appointed by me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, will comprise a chairman and not more than six other members.  The First Schedule deals in detail with the constitution and membership of the new board, while sections 16 to 20 deal with matters relating to the employment of staff, consultants, and so on.</P>
    <P>The duty of the new board as set out in section 8 will be to develop and maintain an efficient and economical system of supply of natural gas, as it may appear to it to be requisite, with due regard to available sources of supply.  The duty of the board will, of course, be influenced in large measure by the scale of natural gas deposits which may become available as a result of exploration activity in our Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>Offshore exploration activity is a matter which comes within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in this regard, Deputies will note that section 36 provides for a consultation process on any development relating to a natural gas deposit.  Furthermore, section 37 provides that all natural gas landed in the State for consumption in the State shall be offered for sale on reasonable terms to the board except in particular cases where it is considered that the gas should be offered for sale for a specified industrial use.  Any dispute as to the reasonableness of the terms on which gas is offered to the board will be determined by arbitration.</P>
    <P>Section 8 also sets out the general powers of the board.  These include powers to transmit, distribute and sell natural gas; to purchase and acquire natural gas from any source; to contermine <Col N="931" /> struct and operate pipelines, terminals, and so forth and to carry out various works and activities to enable them to discharge their functions under the Bill.  The powers provided in the Bill for the board are those which it is considered the board will require in so far as can be foreseen.  However, in a new area such as this where rapid technological changes can take place it may be necessary in the future to confer certain additional powers on the board and provision is therefore made in section 9 for the conferring of additional powers on the board. These powers would, of course, have to be related to the provision of a supply of gas and could only be conferred by way of a ministerial order made after the passing of a resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The new board will be subject to the controls normally applicable to State-sponsored bodies.  Accordingly, provision is included in section 21 for control of the capital commitments of the board.  Sections 22 to 25 deal with the board's borrowing powers and are generally similar to the provisions applicable to other State-sponsored bodies.  The Bill sets a limit of £25 million on the aggregate amount of long-term borrowing which may be incurred by the board for capital purposes.  While this may be more than enough to meet the board's requirements arising from the Kinsale Head development, it would not be adequate to meet requirements arising from any future significant gas finds and any proposals for financing of any substantial new projects will, therefore, have to come before the Oireachtas in the form of an amendment to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is intended that expenditure and borrowing by the board will be financed from revenue from the sale of gas.  Section 10 deals with this aspect and in this connection, Deputies will note that a separate section &mdash;section 11&mdash;is included to permit my giving the board directions as to profits, financial objectives and pricing policy.  I consider that a provision on these lines is essential to ensure the best possible results to the nation from the exploitation of such natural <Col N="932" /> gas resources as may become available to the board.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt in detail with all the provisions of the Bill because many of them are fairly standard for any State-sponsored body and also because an explanatory memorandum has been circulated which gives a general outline of the Bill.  If, however, there is any matter which Deputies may wish to raise about any of the provisions which I have not dealt with, I will be happy to deal with them in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>With the possibility of further gas finds, it is now necessary to give careful consideration to all options for the utilisation of natural gas.  Within the energy sector, gas could be used for power generation and could be fed through a pipeline system for direct heating and cooking uses.  Natural gas also has considerable advantages as a feedstock for petro-chemical industries. Decisions on the allocation of gas will have to take account of all relevant factors, including market capacity, investment costs and the related economic considerations and the comparative efficiency ratios of various uses.  The nation is entitled to use its resources in a way which will optimise the benefits in terms of energy security and stability, employment creation and value added to the economy.</P>
    <P>With these considerations in mind, I am arranging for an objective and authoritative study of all possible uses of natural gas.  On the basis of such study, realistic options on the allocation of future finds can be identified and assessed without delay.  Decisions will have to be taken within the context of general energy and economic policy and matters of such great significance for our future development will obviously be decided at Ministerial level.</P>
    <P>The setting up of Bord Gáis Éireann is a complementary measure to the offshore policy decisions already announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is an important stage in the planning and utilisation of our national energy resources and it is a step into the future which will broaden our technological <Col N="933" /> base and strengthen our infrastructure in a way which will significantly facilitate our economic progress.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In December, 1973, the Dáil debated the problems associated with what has now become known as the energy crisis.  On numerous occasions since then Fianna Fáil have sought from the Government an indication as to what they propose to do to counterbalance the effects on the consumers of the steep increase in costs of oil products, electricity and gas.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has alone shown a response&mdash;he compounded the economic problem by loading more in taxation in the budget of 1976 than the country as a whole had paid for all oil imported on an annual basis up to 1973.  Notwithstanding the constant excuses from every member of the Government when they seek to pass the blame for their disastrous handling of our economic affairs, nothing has so far been done to devise an energy policy which would in any way show that the Government understood what they say has been the cause of our national instability during practically the entire life of this Government. This Bill is a further indication of Coalition paralysis.  It may truly be described a &ldquo;Gas&rdquo; Bill in more ways than one.</P>
      <P>Instead of providing the weapon from which a national economic recovery could be forged we are presented with a set of mechanical proposals which would probably be inadequate to deal with the development of a rural drainage scheme.  It has all the elements of a careful launching of a venture which is about to enter the exciting future of a petroleum-orientated future, by devising a scheme which will just about be adequate in arranging for paraffin for the oil lamp in the kitchen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the dynamism in this Bill? Where is the enterprise?  It is lost because of the past three years of economic mismanagement.  We are now trying to mine the gold of natural gas without having the money to buy the proper tools.  The board, as proposed <Col N="934" /> by this Bill, curtailed by interference from the Minister for Finance on the one hand, and, if this is not enough, curtailed by the same Minister but wearing his hat as Minister for Public Services, have not the initial capital available to them to do the right job with this first proven reserve of natural gas.</P>
    <P>Above all the Dáil is being asked to approve a Bill which in section 35 transfers the errors in policy and approach already made by Bord Gáis Teoranta&mdash;who have not been answerable to the Dáil for their misuse of natural gas by wasting 75 per cent of the thermal value of the gas used in the generation of electricity by the ESB.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will, therefore, oppose this Bill because of its inadequacy in general and, in particular, because by agreeing to the Bill we would be condoning the well publicised failures of An Bord Gáis Teoranta.  In fairness I should say that I do not entirely place the blame for what we consider the incorrect approach of An Bord Gáis Teoranta on the board.  If the Government by their policies have left themselves without the means to maximise the benefit of the existing gas find off Kinsale, I suppose An Bord Gáis could only carry on with a policy based on expediency, which the Government have themselves done over the past three years, where energy is concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants our agreement to a Gas Bill, then let me spell out the provisions that we will demand be incorporated.  First, the capital availability should not be limited and initially should be £100 million. Second, the gas board must be empowered to secure all natural gas produced from areas which are the subject of licence by an Irish Government. Third, the provision of natural gas for the purposes of electricity generation should cease and the agreement of their predecessor&mdash;An Bord Gáis Teoranta&mdash;be cancelled.  Fourth, the board should establish a commercial gas grid linking Cork with Dublin initially.  Fifth, the board should ensure their viability by catering for the premium gas market in <Col N="935" /> densely populated areas, such as Dublin.  Sixth, the board should be used to provide a supply of energy to facilitate the development of industrial expansion in Limerick, Shannon, Galway, the west, Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Reading the report of the press conference held by the Minister for Transport and Power, one must marvel at how the usual public relations exercise is used instead of realistic policy.  The headline taken by the press of possible participation by the Gas Board in offshore exploitation is a deception.</P>
    <P>Can anyone seriously consider that there is any serious intention to do anything which will involve the expenditure of risk capital when the Minister for Transport and Power has to seek the permission of the Minister for Finance?  He will be lucky if he is provided with the capital necessary to supply anaesthetic gas to the Cork Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>There are many interesting sections in the Bill.  Section 9, for example, provides that the Minister may confer additional functions related to the supply of gas providing he obtains the consent of the Minister with two hats &mdash;Finance and the Public Service. Might one design to ask does Deputy Ryan, Minister for Finance, have established procedures for consulting with Deputy Ryan, Minister for the Public Service or does he look at his reflection in the mirror and reach a consensus between the two reflections?</P>
    <P>Section 9 also provides that on the assumption that the Minister in his twin capacity manages to agree with himself, the Minister for Transport may then consult with any other concerned Minister.  What a recipe for soul-stirring action.  Can you imagine a commercial group requiring details of the cost of energy supplies based on a supply of natural gas in order to assist its viability assessment, waiting for decisions from such an unwieldy arrangement?  If probably will not make any difference because section 37 restricts control to natural <Col N="936" /> gas landed in the State provided it has not already been disposed of by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive in its technical provisions but it errs in its fundamental approach to the proper exploitation of the first proven hydrocarbon resource.  Fianna Fáil would require that all proven reserves of natural gas would come within the control of the Gas Board and that, apart from use as a feedstock for fertiliser production a policy of conservation could best be achieved by supplying the premium gas market.  A gas grid pipeline would be used to facilitate supplies of natural gas to Dublin and all other substantial conurbations on a line from Cork to Dublin.  This grid would ensure that domestic supplies for cooking and heating would be available to all domestic and some industrial users in all the centres referred to.  We are satisfied that this arrangement would result in considerable savings compared with the present wasteful competition between electricity and other forms of energy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are satisfied that the resulting reduction in demand in the short and medium term for electricity would avoid the need for considering expansion of electricity generating capacity for the short term, thereby releasing for the greater benefit of the national economy funds at present being borrowed by the ESB with the Minister for Finance guaranteeing interest and capital repayments.  These guarantees are, of course, not really expected to be called in.  They, nevertheless, affect our credit standing, having to be taken into consideration in calculating our overseas indebtedness.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance laid great stress on the importance of our figures when he tried to excuse his ignorance as to the difference between imports and exports when he imposed his first 15p per gallon extra tax on petrol at the end of 1974.  He said the a Northern Ireland car filling with petrol in the South and then returning North with its tank full of petrol would not be an export because our statistics did not show the details of the exports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Well, our statistics show the full details of the massive borrowings made abroad by the ESB.  ESB consumers can speak only too well from their increased bills of just how expensive the investment in generating capacity has become when foreign borrowing is subject to ever increasing foreign exchange compensation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil would re-examine the entire national energy needs and formulate usage patterns which would reflect the changed conditions of the past three years.  Fianna Fáil would use a vigorous Gas Board as one element in a national energy policy.  By making all natural gas supplies available to the board, they would be armed with the tools which would be used to exploit fully the hydrocarbon resource to facilitate the development of processing units for the development of other natural resources.</P>
    <P>I am speaking particularly of the establishment of a smelter.  The key to the viability of such a smelter is the ability to convert our existing reserves of lead and zinc into competitively priced products.  Whatever international cartel arrangements that may or may not exist in these products, availability of competitively priced manufactured end products will ensure a market for our products. A way to achieve satisfactory pricings is by ensuring that operating costs are kept to a minimum.  The cost of energy supply has a major effect on operating costs.</P>
    <P>This is just one example of the type of initiative that is required to get the economy on the move again. Twenty years ago Britain and the USA used their national energy availability to encourage the establishment of aluminium smelting processes.  The resulting economic benefits from downstream activities are well known.</P>
    <P>The job opportunities required to absorb the numbers of workers made redundant from traditional industries in Ireland which have closed down together with the need to generate thousands of new job opportunities for the present generation of school leavers can only be achieved by a dynamic approach which ploughs all <Col N="938" /> our available financial resources into the conversion of our newly found natural resources.  This is what I have called for each time over the past three years when I have asked for an energy policy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil recognise that a flexible energy policy is the cornerstone upon which our economy can be revitalised, adapted to the modern age and capable of sustaining our ever-growing population at home.  This is not the time for a Government mentality which is conditioned by what is paid out in pay-related benefits to over 130,000 unemployed.  The country is sick of a pay-related mentality.</P>
    <P>We will not accept a Gas Board as proposed in this Bill with paltry resources of £25 million and subjected to the whim of every member of the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to section 8 (1) in the Bill:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Board to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas&mdash;being a system which is both economical and efficient and which appears to the Board to be requisite for the time being.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the time being&rdquo; is an apt description of Government thinking in the conduct of all our national affairs &mdash;it will do for the time being.</P>
    <P>With regard to the use of gas for the generation of electricity, I would like to point out that the National Coal Board and the electricity authority in Britain are lobbying the Energy Minister asking him to impose a tax of 20 to 40 per cent on natural gas to enable them to compete.  This is surely proof that we should maximise the benefits from natural gas by making ourselves more competitive industrially and otherwise in using the gas properly instead of wasting 75 per cent of the thermal value of 50 per cent of the gas by allowing the ESB to use it for the generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>With regard to making this gas available in Dublin, the Dublin Gas Company are at present using naphtha to supply gas to consumers and naphtha could be deemed to be very <Col N="939" /> nearly as expensive as petrol.  We should be thinking therefore of supplying the Dublin Gas Company with natural gas.  If that is done it will lead to cheaper energy costs for those using gas.  The French are importing natural gas from the Middle East.  They are not using the gas to generate electricity. In fact it is contrary to EEC policy to use natural gas to generate electricity.  That has been established within the EEC.</P>
    <P>We have set out the reasons we are opposed to this Bill and we have also set out our constructive ideas with regard to what should be done with this natural gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I Welcome the Bill and the setting up of the new board. Time is vitally important in this matter and the important thing is to get the gas in and get it working.  This is precisely what the Minister is doing. The interim board have been doing an excellent job and it is hoped the good work will be carried on by the new board.  I am sure the Minister will bring in all the expertise available so that the job will be done as speedily and as efficiently as possible.  In my book speed is of the essence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition spokesman talked about unemployment.  A couple of thousand jobs right off the reel is a massive contribution towards solving the unemployment problem.  Mark you, this follows on a single commercial find.  I am quite sure subsequent finds will go a long way towards benefiting Dublin and everywhere else.  As a Cork Deputy, I am in full agreement with what the Minister is doing.  Unemployment in the Cork area will practically be solved by this bold stroke by the Minister in getting this project off the ground.  I compliment him on his choice of personnel on the interim board and I compliment the board on the efficient and sensible way they went about acquiring wayleaves and discussing rather delicate problems with landowners and so on.  I can assure the Minister that people are responding very well to the treatment they are getting in regard to the acquisition of wayleaves and so on.  It is very important to get off on the <Col N="940" /> right foot because it is more than likely we will have these kinds of problems all over the place.  The more often we have them the better.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ESB project, the location in the lower harbour is particularly beneficial.  We will be using practically 50 per cent of this natural resource to generate electricity.  I can see no better use for the gas.  It is not for us to look at what the French or the Germans are doing with their resources.  That is their business.  We are an insular people dependent on an agricultural economy and that economy is, in turn, heavily dependent on electricity.  I am sure the correspondence the Minister is receiving with regard to electricity is mainly concerned with the inadequacy of power.  If the gas find does nothing else but solve that problem that will be a major step in helping the agricultural industry, particularly the dairying section of the industry.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed with so-called wastage.  I am glad the board decided very wisely to use this natural resource in Cork for what will be the biggest fertiliser plant in Europe, producing something like 2,350 tons of nitrogenous fertiliser per year and thereby providing 600 or 700 jobs.  The sky is the limit when one comes to think in terms of spin-offs.  There will inevitably be a demand for compounds and we will have a big export not only of nitrogenous fertilisers but of compounds as well.</P>
    <P>We must put first things first.  Agriculture is our primary industry and it is through agriculture we will get people back to work and get the economy generally going.  I commend the Minister for using this resource to do two vitally important things, generate electricity and make fertilisers available. I compliment Nítrigin Éireann for their speed in getting off the ground.  I am pleased to hear we are ahead of target.  I am confident there will be further finds of gas and, hopefully, of oil.  We already have a very useful commercial find.  There will be time enough to talk about national grids and digging up the country.  We know the difficulties involved in figuring out 30 miles of wayleaves.  Just <Col N="941" /> imagine the problems attached to 300 miles.  We must be sensible in our approach.  Where we admit freely there is a problem about jobs and there is a need to get people back to work, surely the quickest and most practical way to get them back to work is the way the Minister is going about it.</P>
    <P>As a Cork Deputy, I would like to compliment the Minister on getting on with the job.  I hope everything will keep on target.  I can assure him from my conversations with people that the whole project is very much welcomed in Cork by all sectors both rural and urban.  I am sure that time will prove that this decision in regard to this find of gas was a very wise one. We do not wish to take from the Opposition spokesman's idea of a national grid and so on.  All that will come in good time, let us hope in the not too distant future when we have further finds of natural gas, because it is widely accepted from the general situation in the North Sea and, indeed, anywhere gas is found that it does come in substantial quantities where it is found at all and it also comes in conjunction with oil finds. However, as I say, that is a job for another day.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Opposition spokesman that the new board should be responsible for all finds of gas and oil and for any type of hydrocarbon resources, and that they should use their collective wisdom to ensure that it is put to the proper use.  In any event, I am quite pleased with the decision of the Government and the Minister, and I wish him well.  I am confident that his decision will prove in time to have been a very wise one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not intend to detain the House more than a few minutes, I think this is sufficiently important to justify all of us making some remarks on the setting up of yet another State body and the use to be made of the discovery of some energy resource of our own.  It has turned out to be a damp squib in so far as the hopes of our people are concerned.  To hear the last speaker and the Minister as well, one would think this was something for Cork alone, that it had nothing to do <Col N="942" /> with the rest of the country at all.</P>
      <P>All of us were hoping when the energy crisis first manifested itself in the world that we would take action to minimise its effects.  We were disappointed. Not only did the Minister rush in to add extra cost to what the Arabs had already over-costed, but now a resource which would naturally be expected to ease the burden is being used in a manner which will be of no benefit whatever to the consumer.</P>
      <P>Most people talk well of the ESB as an establishment which has been successful, but we have learned to our cost that the ESB is a Frankenstein which has got out of control and, on this small island has got so much strength that it is almost capable of using economic power&mdash;I use the term figuratively&mdash;to do things as they wish, and the effect their overcharging has had on the economy in the difficult days in the past and the difficult times we face in the future and their contribution to inflation condoned by the Government are things which have disenchanted many people with the working of the Electricity Supply Board. Now the proposal is to hand over 50 per cent of our gas to be put into a grid which is already being overcharged to the consumer.  If there is one authority in the country more dictatorial than another, it is the ESB in their method of charging the consumer.</P>
      <P>When people ask the ESB to supply electricity to a new house or to reconnect a supply for a business or even an industry, they get a curt letter from a local engineer saying the costing has been established in accordance with the board's method of calculating such costs.  These words have been used all over the country.  On the Order Paper we have a motion, No. 21, to set up a committee to do something.  It is a feeble effort to meet partly a promise made by the Coalition before coming into office.  No effort is being made to bring the Committee into existence to give us a chance of bringing these people to heel in some way.</P>

    <P>This is not an opportunity to go entirely into the working of the ESB.

    <P>The ESB did a difficult task well under difficult circumstances, but they are now so encouraged by their success and have become so strong in the economic power they wield that they have become a Frankenstein, and the sooner something is done about it the better.  I would hope to see the Minister bring in legislation here&mdash;and it can be applied to this as well as to the ESB&mdash;whereby, when people are having jobs done for connecting with the national grid they would be permitted to consider contracts to do the work from private firms as well as <Col N="944" /> from the ESB who have a monopoly of such connections at present.  I would hope to see brought back the local plants that existed in all towns and villages in order to have them as a standby at times when we would be deprived of current and as a warning against the overcharging which is taking place.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance direct that the profits of the Board in a year specified in the direction shall be applied in such manner (including application for the benefit of the Exchequer) as is specified in the direction.</P>
      <P>In other words, this Minister has such an obsession about tax collecting that no source is to be left untouched. Under that section he may compel the board to make certain charges and then pass the profits over for the benefit of the Exchequer.  Without taxing the Minister may find a means of channelling the profits from the board into the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>State-sponsored bodies have passed the stage of teeth-cutting; they have passed the struggling stage and have arrived.  We should now set about doing something to control them and the consumer must be the first to be considered.  So much hope was held out about the gas find but most of that gas is being channelled into the ESB who have already taken complete possession of our resources and are virtually in a position to defy anybody objecting to the price they charge the consumer or the way they use our resources.  It is time the House asserted its relevance and took some control of these bodies that are threatening to engulf our economy as they wish.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill to show that the Government are asserting themselves in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with the Gas Board and not the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with the setting up of another board and <Col N="945" /> this gives us an opportunity to ask the Minister to outline his attitude towards State boards.  Many people are disenchanted about the way they have acted during this period of inflation. Their actions are condoned by the Government even though they are adding fuel to the flames of inflation. They are pressing the consumer at a time when they could contribute so much to the economic situation.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not give any reason for rejoicing.  It has dashed the hopes many people had.  Those of us who live in the northern part of the country heard many Cork Deputies tell the House the great benefit the gas find would be to Cork.  They told us that they would get a greater percentage of the gas but after the ESB have taken their share there will be little left. What benefit will this be to the consumer of energy or to the national energy problem?  It will be of no benefit and it is time we lodged some form of protest about this.  The Government are taking the easy way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the board having regard to the need to maximise the use of local technical ability in relation to contracts and so on but they have not set a good headline in that respect.  There is no use in making excuses.  I remember the late Seán Lemass saying to me that there was nothing the Irish could not do if they were given the opportunity of doing it.  I should like to refer to the famous contract for telephone parts.  An Irish manufacturer was out-priced by people who were about to dump from abroad but the Government of the day ordered that they be given the contract.  If the present outlook, as demonstrated in this Bill, prevailed we would have to send abroad for some technical assistance because the board do not consider the Irish are capable of dealing with complicated matters.  The sooner we get confidence in the ability of our own people to adjust themselves to any situation, technical or otherwise, as they have done in many other countries, the better.  The sooner we do away with boards who try to convince us that we must go abroad for this, <Col N="946" /> that or the other, the better.  Our people can do anything and they have proved it.  Boards like this are being brought more and more under the control of Ministers and those Ministers should have important contracts discussed in this House.  We should be told why such contracts are placed outside the country.  It is disappointing that such a major contribution to the energy of the country should be filtered away, hidden in its misuse by a State-sponsored body which has not been very kind to the consumer, to say the least of it.  There goes our new find of gas; the consumer how are you, he benefits nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years we looked forward to the day when we would discover natural gas or oil within our territorial waters.  We hoped that such a discovery would be the start of a great new era in our economic development. When the United Kingdom discovered oil and gas off their shores it was said that they were not fully prepared to deal with their great new discoveries. For that reason it was felt they were not able to reap the full benefits from these resources.  Unkind critics of the British say that they got round their difficulties by selling out to the multi-nationals.  They say they are far from reaping the full benefits of the finds of the North Sea and other places because they sold out when they were short of money.  The result is that the multi-nationals will reap the benefits.  In our case a great opportunity is being lost in starting up a National Energy Board without having an energy and fuel policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has decided how natural gas should be distributed shows that enough thought has not been given to the matter.  It has been established by scientists, engineers and economists that converting oil to electricity is probably the most wasteful way of using oil because the conversion will work out at about 40 per cent.  To use oil in other ways one would get a conversion rate of up to 80 per cent.  Even at this late stage the Minister should look at the decision in relation to the allocation of natural gas. It may be said in defence of the Minister that the fact that the ESB import <Col N="947" /> more oil than any other concern influenced the Government.  They may have felt that by giving all the natural gas available to the ESB we would be able to cut down our imports of oil. On the surface that seems to be a fairly good argument but on examination one finds that in using this natural asset in this way we shall waste almost half of it by conversion to energy.  Therefore it is bad economics because although we may cut our imports of oil we will waste this wonderful source of energy found off our southern shores.  I thought the Minister would avail of this opportunity to bring in private enterprise along with public enterprise and have a real national fuel authority with the expertise that Irish workers can provide both in the private and public sectors of industry.  We should take the opportunity of looking at all our immediately available sources of fuel and energy and any we may find in future.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Minister for Industry and Commerce on tests carried out in the Dublin Bay area for gas and oil and while I do not know the full answer as to the possibilities in Dublin Bay, on the east coast or in the Celtic Sea and while we must anxiously await the findings of the geologists and others involved, it is all the more important that the Minister should reconsider the allocation of the gas at Kinsale.  For too long we have favoured public companies at the expense of the private sector.  For instance, the ESB, a semi-State concern, are given very great concessions by local authorities and do not pay rates on any of their power stations but an industry engaged in the production of fuel or energy as a private concern must pay full rates to each local authority.  While the ESB have played a very prominent part in the development of energy, I believe that it was wrong to make the allocation of natural gas through the board.  We shall pay for wasting this precious commodity of natural gas.  Before the Bill becomes an Act I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole matter and try to be a little fairer in his distribution.</P>
    <P>We may discover good, or even <Col N="948" /> great resources of oil off our coasts or even on land but even if we were to get a fairly small supply of oil within our jurisdiction which would help to cut down our imports, the Minister's whole approach to the use of natural gas as a means of allowing the ESB to cut their imports would be shown to be completely wrong from an economic point of view because even if the oil were found and we could provide for half our needs we would never be so fully dependent on the outside markets and the ESB would not be dependent totally on the imports of oil or even on our natural gas.  While the Minister may have given the ESB this huge allocation of gas in an effort to cut down oil imports let us be optimistic and hope that oil will be found to enable the board and other fuel developing bodies to reduce imports.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister was influenced purely by economic considerations&mdash;he could not have been or he would not have given the allocation to the ESB&mdash;or whether he wishes to cut down oil imports or whether it was the fact that the gas was found in the south that the nearest town gas company is given an allocation.  I feel the Bill was not altogether well prepared.  I know the Minister and the Departments may say: &ldquo;This is the first time we have found natural gas and we must learn by experience&rdquo;, but I suggest that many countries have been developing natural gas resources for many years and surely we could learn from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>You have done it partially but you have not got the gas ashore yet.  I hope you will have great celebrations on the day you do.  The Minister should have another look at the Bill before it is finalised.  It is true that it is not in the Bill that the ESB shall have the allocation of gas but the point is that the Bill enables the Minister to develop not only the southern gas find but gas that we hope will be found in other parts of our jurisdiction.  I believe the Bill has been prepared in haste.  If the gas has been there for a couple of million years&mdash;and I hope plenty of oil with it&mdash;we could wait another six months for this Bill and have it perfected. When the Minister is replying he might assure the House, since he says there is no mention of an allocation in the Bill, that he will have another look at the allocation that has been mentioned in the media and that he will bear in mind the fact that converting natural gas into electricity is a wasteful method since the conversion rate is so low.</P>
      <P>Even at this stage he might consider how he would bring in the private sector of industry which has experience of using this type of gas or oil so that we will get off to a good start on the establishment of an organisation which will make the very fullest use of our natural resources.  Many countries have become great because they were lucky enough to have oil or gas in their seas or lands.  Perhaps our turn is now coming and we should not be prodigal in the use of a natural resource.  We are being prodigal indeed if we are to believe that it is the Minister's intention to allocate the natural gas off Kinsale in the way that has been stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important legislation but it does not come near meeting the criteria we must have of using our natural resources for the greatest possible benefit of our people.  The Minister said that the Government, after careful consideration, decided to allocate this gas for a new plant to be built by NET at Marino Point in Cork for the production of ammonia and urea for the fertiliser industry.  This is using the gas <Col N="950" /> to good advantage seeing that we are an agricultural country, that we need fertilisers and need urea in order to develop another of our assets, our agriculture.  This is true.</P>
      <P>The Minister then goes on to state:</P>
      <P>... for additional ESB generating capacity of 400 MV in a new station at Whitegate and the extension of the Board's existing plant at Marina.</P>
      <P>I disagree with this.  I will skip two lines for the moment and come back to the third point.  The Minister glibs over something here.  I quote:</P>
      <P>It has been stated by various commentators that the use of natural gas for electricity generation is not the most efficient method of utilisation.</P>
      <P>Could I put one or two questions to the Minister on this point?  I think he has glossed over something here. Are my calculations correct when I suggest that the ESB may use 270 million therms per annum from the Kinsale field?  Also am I correct in saying that in a ratio of every three units of natural gas to be used for the generation of electricity two of these units are lost?  Two units in three of our natural resource are lost, and if we are to work that ratio into the 270 million therms does that mean we are going to lose 90 million therms?</P>
      <P>Could I ask a further question? Is it true that the cost of a therm is now 15p?  I believe it is a fact that 90 million therms at 15p per therm amounts to £13.5 million gone each year and, as the Minister states, for 20 years.  This is not using natural resources for our people.  This Government have been acting on spendthrift policies of huge borrowings abroad and absolutely nothing concrete to show at the moment as a result of all this borrowing abroad. But if these figures are correct&mdash;and I believe they are&mdash;surely this is bordering on the lunatic completely, with £13.5 million lost a year for 20 years, and the Minister runs it off in one sentence in this Second Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated by various commentators that the use of <Col N="951" /> natural gas for electricity generation is not the most efficient method of utilisation.</P>
    <P>I wait, and I know many people in this country are waiting, for the Minister's reply.  I hope he will deal with the hard cash situation.  £30 million going up, not in smoke but just in vapour a year for 20 years, from one of our natural resources, something that we have been led to believe, something we have anticipated as a nation, will be a lifeline to us to start on the road back to recovery, to prosperity once again.  If this is true it is a fantastic abuse.  I believe that these figures are accurate. They have come from a very reputable commentator on the subject, and I hope the Minister will come along here and try to defy them and say that this is not so.  Just think what could be done.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the third point in the brief, and I quote:</P>
    <P>An allocation is also being made available to Cork Gas Company to meet the requirements of their consumers</P>
    <P>To meet the needs of our people in Cork.  The loss alone in the conversion of natural gas and electricity running at £13.5 million a year over 20 years&mdash;look at the capital sum that that would give towards the provision of a national grid.  Look at the labour that would be generated by that. Look at the benefits to our people.</P>
    <P>This Bill could not have been though out in full.  It is bad legislation, in my opinion.  As I said, I await the Minister's comments on those figures.  That one sentence on page two of this brief is not sufficient to write off a huge amount of money of that nature.  This is not making maximum use of one of our resources.  We must use this resource for our people. for the maximum benefit of as many of our people as possible.  The allocation that is being made available to gas consumers in Cork is to be welcomed. Why is this not being expanded through various routes to the towns and cities, to the people in various parts of our country?  Why? It seems as if we have taken the simplistic <Col N="952" /> way out, but that is not making full use of a resource, a resource which our people may depend on.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points I should like to make in relation to this. I notice also in the course of the Bill it is stated that planning permission will not be required for a pipeline, and at the moment of course that we do not have the legislation here to allow this.  Nevertheless it is stated here again just in passing, and eventually we will bring in legislation which we will backdate to allow steps such as this to be taken.  We have had a lot of this in the life of this Government, an extreme amount of it.  In my three years here I have noticed it creeping in quite a lot.  We agreed to this pending legislation to come&mdash; pending.  What is the function of this House?  What is the function of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet?  If he knows that legislation is necessary why is the legislation not brought in? Has he a right to move so far forward in advance of legislation?</P>
    <P>A final comment.  I suppose, regrettably, the Minister will have his way, and when I pick up my Order Paper some day and look at No. 21 on the list, Setting up of Joint Committee, I will see added to the Schedule, &ldquo;Bord Gáis Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My view of this Bill is one of disappointment, unfortunately, that so little use is made of the first new natural energy resource discovered here perhaps in centuries.  It is disappointing that, while the find is a small one, and perhaps particularly because it is a small one, a very high proportion of it&mdash;it would appear up to 60 per cent of it&mdash;is to be used in a manner which, as previous speakers pointed out, is clearly uneconomic.</P>
      <P>As I understand the ESB's attitude to it&mdash;and they have a very strong lobby in these matters&mdash;they are very heavily dependent on oil.  I think 64 per cent of our electricity at present is generated by oil.  They argue that it is in the national interest that any native source of energy is preferable to such heavy dependence on oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> That is all right provided there was no other use that could be made of a native source of energy, provided there was no more beneficial or economic use that could be made of it.  The first new source that has arisen for centuries is this natural gas.  It has been clearly demonstrated and not contradicted by anybody that far more beneficial use could be made of it than by throwing two-thirds of it away in converting it into electricity and feeding it into the national grid.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the problem about energy generally here at present is that there are various groups fighting their own corner very hard.  Much the strongest of those groups is the ESB.  They tend to dominate the thinking in Department of Transport and Power on these matters.  They hold themselves out as being the premier Irish energy organisation, which of course they are.  But, by virtue of being that, they seem to get the Department and the Minister to accept that, therefore, the national interest is approximately the same as the interest of the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is proof that what the Deputy is saying is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The body being set up by this Bill have already agreed to sell 60 per cent of this gas find to the ESB.  It is very convenient for the ESB.  It means they have a certain amount of very cheap power on which they can rely even if there is an oil crisis and so on abroad.  But it fails completely to take account of any wider view of the whole problem.  For example, why should we be committing now 60 per cent of this gas find&mdash;and it may be the only gas find that will be made, certainly on that part of the Continental Shelf&mdash;to wasteful usage by the ESB when the indications are that within some fairly short number of years oil will be discovered in quite significant quantities off the west coast and that we will have the right to land that oil and have it supplied to the ESB?  The ESB will be in the situation then that it will have spent tens of millions of pounds establishing this proposed power station in Cork Harbour&mdash;which apparently, with some <Col N="954" /> further expenditure, can transfer back to oil&mdash;which will become quite unnecessary at that time.  It will become quite useless because the obvious thing to do will be to use the oil that hopefully will be landed on the west coast.</P>
      <P>As I recall, up to the end of last season, which would have been about September of last year, there have been 23 wells drilled in the Continental Shelf south of this country.  Only two of those have given any indication of hydrocarbon commercial possibilities. That is a fairly low proportion.  I understand indications we are now that if any further gas or oil is found the likelihood is it will be found off the west coast.  Unfortunately for us indications are that it will be found there in very deep water by comparison with the very shallow water in which this gas has been found.  The area immediately around this gas find has been very throughly drilled over the last few years and, unfortunately, there is very little else forthcoming.  If this find were a huge one, one could sympathise with the point of view that would give the ESB a large proportion of it rather than merely keeping it bottled up and unused.  But it is not huge; even by North Sea standards it is a small find.  As the Minister said, in terms of our total energy needs at present, it is equivalent to approximately 12 per cent.  Our present total requirements are very low by any normal world standard.  Even the <i>per capita</i> requirements are very low. Therefore, to have a small gas find&mdash; and it may be the only one we will ever make in that area anyway&mdash;used in a way that is clearly wasteful is the wrong way of looking at it.</P>
      <P>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta are going to use 40 per cent of this gas field.  If there were no other industrial users ready in 1978 or 1979 when this gas comes ashore, to take it up and use it in a beneficial and economic way, there is no obligation on the Gas Board, the Minister or anybody else to land the gas until such time as there are other users in a position to make beneficial use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one examines the permanent employment that will be generated by this find&mdash;of course, this find is a <Col N="955" /> God send to this country&mdash;one must refer to the Minister's introductory remarks when he said:</P>
    <P>The onshore construction projects will provide over 2,000 jobs and there will be permanent employment for about 700 workers.</P>
    <P>That is pathetic&mdash;700 people, apart from the 2,000 who will get work for a year, two or whatever length of time it takes to build this plant.  Of those 700 presumably quite a proportion would have got work anyway in Arklow at NET's existing plant or in an oil-burning ESB station if that had to be built instead of a gas burning one.  Therefore, the net gain to our economy in terms of jobs from this important find for us&mdash;even though small by world standards&mdash; may be a matter of a few hundred jobs only.  One cannot quantify that exactly but certainly it is a startingly low figure.  This is an indication to me, and I think should be to anyone, of the fact that unfortunately this board only now being set up&mdash;they were set up previously on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis&mdash;are approaching the matter, presumably under the direction of the Minister, in a way that will not redound to the benefit of this country. The ESB, the Gas Board and the Minister will look extremely foolish if in a few years time, as one hopes may come to pass, a fairly substantial oil find is made off our shores because the ESB have at present numerous oil-burning generating plants which can use any oil we are fortunate enough to discover off our shores. Any sort of reasonable oil find, even one half the size of the average oil finds in the North Sea, would probably do the ESB for many years to come and might obviate imports on their part entirely.  They would be in the situation then that they would have built in Cork Harbour a very extensive plant at a cost of tens of millions of pounds for converting natural gas into electricity and that plant would become useless.  At the same time, there would obtain a situation in which the natural gas which could have been used very profitably, in <Col N="956" /> every sense of the word, in industrial, petro-chemical and similar processes is wasted by being left with the ESB.</P>
    <P>There is one industry of which we are in dire need at present.  That is a zinc smelter and, perhaps to a lesser extent, a lead smelter.  There is an interesting article, which I am sure the Minister is aware of, in the June issue of <i>Technology Ireland</i> by Messrs. Francis Walsh and Malcolm Farmer on the various alternative methods of zinc smelting.  They argue there very forcibly that the blast furnace method of smelting zinc is preferable from various points of view.  That is on the basis that the blast furnaces&mdash;for example, at Avonmouth in Britain&mdash; are fuelled by coke.  We have virtually no coke so we could not contemplate any such efforts to fuel a zinc smelter of the blast furnace kind from our own resources.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister and the House that we can do this by the direct utilisation of natural gas.  We could build a zinc smelter at the moment in Cork Harbour and, hopefully, somewhere else in the not too distant future which would be able to smelt zinc, which will come into production in Navan within the next six to 12 months.  An interesting points is made by the authors of this article that as well as smelting zinc in the sort of mine where you get a mixture of lead and zinc as you do in Navan, the blast furnace technique of smelting has the added advantage of actually smelting the portion of the lead as well as the zinc which could be looked on almost as a by-product of the zinc produced in such a smelter.</P>
    <P>This nation has a crying need for a zinc smelter and also for a lead one, if that is feasible.  Unfortunately, we have serious difficulty in providing the more traditional type of electrolytic smelter because our electricity costs are very high due to the activities of the ESB.  Unless the ESB were prepared to give some reasonable deal to any organisation which would establish a smelter and provide electric power at a reasonable level, something akin to what can be purchased in other parts of Europe, then it is very <Col N="957" /> doubtful if the traditional type of smelter using a large amount of electric power is on.</P>
    <P>The blast furnace type of smelter is very much on.  It seems to me that the way to fuel it is not to import vast quantities of coke or any other type of fuel, but to use direct the natural gas that is landed from Kinsale Headfield and hopefully from whatever other field it may turn up in in the future.  Instead of some useful method of utilising this gas, such as the one I have suggested and which has also been suggested by others on this side of the House, unfortunately the lazy, easy way is being taken.  It is being given to the ESB on the basis that two-thirds of it goes up the chimney and one-third of it becomes electricity. This suits the ESB and it suits everyone because they do not have to worry about it and it does not involve any great problem in trying to evolve new industry and new technology. The ESB can just very conveniently convert it into electricity. It is a pity that the two-thirds is wasted but it is felt we can get over that.</P>
    <P>There are other ways of using this gas which may be more difficult, which may entail more work, which may not be as easy as what is being done now, but which are infinitely more beneficial to the country.  The latest date we have been given when the mine in Navan will come into production is March or April, 1977.  The mine will then export concentrates that could be smelted into over 100,000 tons of zinc a year and 20,000 tons of lead a year.  All those concentrates will go abroad.  Three-quarters of the value of the zinc concentrates brought from this mine will go outside the country. As the House is aware, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has asked the IDA to start having talks with people who might consider setting up a smelter and report back to him on the possibility of this being done by the 31st March, 1977.  It will be after that when the actual planning will begin and it will be after that again when the actual building will begin. It is accepted by all concerned that it is not possible to build a zinc smelter <Col N="958" /> of either of the types I have been talking about in less than four years.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that we bring in this gas.  If it comes in in April, 1978, as it is now hoped, I suggest that 40 per cent of it should be brought in and given to NET. Since they have experts coming from almost every country in the world except Ireland to erect their building one hopes it will be ready by April, 1978.  They should be given the 40 per cent and we should not take up the other 60 per cent of the flow of 125 million cubic feet a day.  I understand there is no great technical problem in keeping the gas down, that the flow of it can be regulated.  The gas should be kept down below and a blast furnace smelter should be erected to smelt zinc primarily and possibly to smelt lead as a by-product of the zinc.  If the erection of that smelter were started now it could be ready in 1980 so there would only be a two-year delay in bringing in 60 per cent of the daily flow.  The fuel would not then be wasted.  It seems shameful to see such a high proportion of it go up in vapour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to Mr. Richard Bunyan's article in a recent issue of <i>Energy Ireland</i> on the feasibility of a commercial gas grid.  He argues that it is feasible to run a grid from Cork to Dublin.  I am not qualified to say if he is right or wrong, but he certainly puts up a well argued case on it.  When this is suggested the ESB throw up their hands in horror and say that we already have a national energy grid in the country and the right way to use this source of power is to convert it into electricity, which is the only form that the existing national power grid can take and that it would be wasteful to establish a totally separate and new grid which would take the gas to Dublin where the principal market for it would be. Mr. Bunyan's argument is well put. The Minister refers to this in a passing way but not in any great detail.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;examining all these possibilities.  Why were these possibilities not examined in detail and in depth at the time the decision was made, a year or 18 months ago, to devote 60 per cent of this particular field to the ESB?</P>
      <P>By saying that he is now arranging for an objective and authoritative study of all possible uses of natural gas the Minister is clearly implying that hitherto we have not had an objective and authoritative study of all possible uses of natural gas.  I am afraid that is obvious.  It is clear that the Minister and the Department have been sold the ESB line.  While this is very good for the ESB, it is not good for Ireland.  It is a serious underutilisation of a scarce commodity.  It fails absolutely to take into account also the likelihood&mdash;I would use the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;possibility&rdquo;&mdash;of significant oil finds somewhere off our coasts over the next five years or so.</P>
      <P>If these oil finds are made it will be easier and cheaper for the ESB to use that oil.  Unfortunately, they have committed tens of millions of pounds to building this station which would have to be reconverted back to oil. Because there is the distinct possibility that within quite a short time they would have to do that reconversion, is it not very unwise for the ESB to be given the go-ahead to build an expensive station in Cork harbour which clearly will be of very little benefit to this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not gone into any of the details in this Bill which is quite long and we can go into it in great details <Col N="960" /> on Committee Stage.  There are some sections which have rather strange and wide powers for the board and the Minister.  There is one section which would apparently allow the Minister, without further legislation, to change the objects of the board, which is not a concept I like.</P>
    <P>My feeling, and the feelings of most people who spoke here today on the general principles involved here, is that we are setting up a board who have already, in their <i>ad hoc</i> form, given away 60 per cent of the find to a user who will waste two-thirds of that 60 per cent.  Of course, they will not deliberately waste it; that happens to be the thermal loss in the conversion of natural gas into electricity. We are trying to evaluate the various alternative and different uses of natural gas as against electricity, town gas and other forms of energy and power.  We have not been given &mdash;even though these contracts were completed a year or more ago&mdash;the price Marathon are getting for this gas.</P>

Can the Minister give an indication what the likely annual surplus will be?  Will they all be ploughed back into investment, repaying loans from the Exchequer? Will the Exchequer get any dividends out of this?  These are fundamental and obvious questions which should not have to be asked.  They should have been answered in the Minister's opening speech which, unfortunately, just glossed over them and talked about them being confidential.</P>
      <P>Another question the Minister could and should profitably answer is this: is there any other nation in the world which has allocated 60 per cent of its natural gas to the generation of electricity?  There is no such country I know of within the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To allow us in our situation, with a very small find by world or European standards, to use 60 per cent in this rather wasteful way, seems to be basically the wrong approach.  It is so serious from a long-term national point of view that we <Col N="962" /> are forced into the position that we must oppose this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because its purpose is to utilise a new resource to the best advantage of the nation.  It is necessary that such utilisation should be properly controlled otherwise the State would lose considerably.  Deputy O'Malley was very concerned about the ESB uses of natural gas and he spoke about the losses that would follow. It is my experiences and that of many others that the ESB are a body who would maximise the use of this gas to a very high percentage.  If something is being built in Corks a network could be inserted which would centrally heat the whole of the city.  It might not be the most efficient way but the new board will ensure that the gas will be used to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>When we hear the opposite side talking about wastage and about smelters and what have you, we must hark back to the fact that we are doing something to correlate the natural resources of the country instead of giving them away to outsiders as was done when they were in Government.  The sooner they wake up to that the better.  Is it any wonder that the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that he would have to look into the whole question of choosing candidates for the next general election?  I can well understand that when I hear the contributions from the opposite side.</P>

      <P>The people of Dublin South-West and Donegal made it very hard for you.  Deputy O'Malley spoke about smelters, but they have nothing to do with this Bill. The establishment of a gas board is essential if we are to make the best use of our natural resources.  Perhaps it may be said that I was employed formerly by the ESB and that I have a vested interest.  I have no such interest but I know they are a very efficient organisation who have left no industry ever without a supply of electricity.  This new resource can <Col N="963" /> with confidence be channelled into the ESB as well as other companies. There are many other aspects in which the ESB can involve themselves. Central heating systems all over Europe are being fired by local generating stations operated on gas. The Opposition did not come up with many ideas as to how we should use this gas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>They came up with very few ideas.  That is why the Leader of the Opposition had to speak to them last night.  They had better come up with ideas if they are to be selected for the next general election. Deputy O'Malley's reasons for opposing the Bill are beyond me.  Surely we must get some order into the disposal of any new reasources we may have, and this Bill will do just that.  I would expect the Gas Board to examine in an in-depth way how best the gas supply can be used.  It has been indicated that the ESB and NET will be getting it.  Circumstances will change and it is important that we would have a responsible body to ensure that the best use will be made of this resource.  How the Opposition can put forward such mealy-mouthed objections to the Bill is beyond me.  We know what they did when they had an opportunity to utilise the natural resources we had.</P>
      <P>I am appalled at the opposition to this Bill.  There may be certain details in it that will require change but it is highly desirable that all development in this sphere should be controlled.  I support the Minister.  The new board when set up will examine the details fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the complexity and the difficulties involved in this Bill which seeks to regulate the utilisation of our natural gas.  It was to be expected that this first measure would give rise to controversy, more so than subsequent measures, but I was surprised to find such objections from the Opposition.  If the Bill were to be defeated the control of our natural gas would be removed from <Col N="964" /> this House.  All the Bill proposes to do is to set up a board to determine how the gas will be used.  In opposing the Bill the Opposition are in a very contradictory position because they know it would not be in the best interests of the country if the House did not have a say in the utilisation of our natural gas supplies.  Perhaps the Bill is being opposed because the Opposition think the whole thing should be in the hands of private enterprise, of multinationals.  Deputy Moore seems to think so.</P>
      <P>Who is to develop these resources if not the State?  The Minister concerned and the State must have the opportunity to decide how our natural resources should be used, who will get them and in what proportion.  The Opposition seemed to oppose the use of natural gas in the generation of electricity and Deputy O'Malley put up an extraordinary performance, implying that we should not build an ESB station in Cork harbour because we might find oil.  He seems to be under the impression that any oil found can be used straight away to generate electricity.  This is not so.  It would, in fact, be a far more wasteful way of using the oil because what electricity is generated from is the residual oil after all the final fuels for central heating, for petrol, aviation and so on have been taken off.  What is left then is used to generate electricity.</P>
      <P>The Deputy did not refer to the siting of this generating station which is next to the only existing oil refinery in the country.  I do not know any more than anybody else in this House or elsewhere whether we will find oil but, if we do find oil, an obvious place to refine it is in the existing refinery and the residual can then be switched to the generating station next door in Whitegate, giving the ESB another advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the ESB as being almost out of control. He said it is a Frankenstein and, in the next breath, without stopping to think, he said Bord Gáis Éireann have already been outside this country to consult while there are people in Ireland well capable of doing this. The only people who applied to Bord <Col N="965" /> Gáis Éireann, to be allowed to take control of the gas coming ashore were the ESB, the very firm which Deputy Brennan says are out of control, a Frankenstein running the Department, the Minister for Transport and Power and the Government, overcharging consumers, raping the countryside, and apparently anything that goes wrong in this country now can be blamed on the ESB.  I suppose it is a fairly natural reaction for an Opposition Deputy and others when they get their bills from the ESB every two months but how many people switch on, even in a lifetime, and the light or power does not come on?  They can be counted on the fingers of one hand.</P>
    <P>The ESB were established just 50 years ago this year to provide the people with electricity at the cheapest rate possible.  All the towns and 98 per cent of rural houses are connected to electricity, definitely the highest percentage in Europe.  The ESB foresaw the demand.  They raised their own capital to provide the power lines and connections so that everybody would have electricity. They are exceedingly competent technically. They are a natural whipping boy when anything goes wrong and for the annoyance people feel when they get their bills, but let us remember that every time one presses a switch the light or the power comes on.  There are countries where the grid is so designed that for one day a week in particular areas consumers have to do without electricity simply because their boards could not foresee the need and cater for the demand. That charge cannot be laid against the ESB.</P>
    <P>For Deputies to come in here, abuse the ESB, call it a Frankenstein, and so on, is grossly unfair and grossly lacking in appreciation of what the ESB have done.  Our agriculture could not have advanced as it has done without rural electrification. We could not have had the industries we have, particularly those based outside Dublin, were it not for rural electrification.  The ESB have been an essential part of the infrastructure in bringing industry to the <Col N="966" /> country.  That should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The ESB do not control either the Department or the Minister for Transport and Power.  They certainly do not control the present Minister because I have ultimate power.  I appoint the board and, if I am dissatisfied with the performance of the board, I can fire the board and I would have no hesitation in doing so if I thought the Board were at any time guiding the ESB in a direction which was not in the public interest.</P>

If the Taoiseach thought that I, in handling the Department of Transport and Power and, through it, the ESB was not acting in the public interest he would naturally take steps to remedy that situation.  Indeed, if I were guilty in that respect, then I should be fired.  I have no hesitation in saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett gave five reasons for opposing the Bill.  He said the capital should be increased from £25 million to £100 million.  The £25 million is sufficient for Bord Gáis Éireann to cater for the existing gas find.  They can purchase the gas, lay the pipes, instal the valve connections and so on and set up their company with that amount.  Why give them more than they want?  What is the point in giving them £100 million when £25 million will do?  Is it not much better, if there is a further gas find and it is going to be sold to Bord Gáis Éireann, that I should come back here and ask authority from this House to allow Bord Gáis Éireann to borrow more money?  If we gave them £100 million now I would not be back in here justifying their use of the balance of £75 million if that is required.  Is it not much better that I should come back in here regularly and justify the use Bord Gáis Éireann are making of the money?  This is a silly objection to the Bill.  If they could do it for £15 million I would have their borrowing powers reduced to £15 million to ensure that I, or any other Minister for Transport and Power, will be responsible <Col N="967" /> to this House for the operation of a State company under his control.</P>
    <P>Again, I come back to the decision to allocate the gas for electricity generation. Deputy Barrett says this should be cancelled and he says this provision is one of the reasons for Fianna Fáil opposing the Bill.  There is an argument here, of course, and I acknowledged that two years ago when the Government made a decision to allocate the gas.  This is a small gas find by North Sea standards. Deputy O'Malley says we should leave it in the ground and take it up in two or three years' time to be a source of energy for a smelter.  We have to get the best contract price we can and all adjustments to a contract affect other parts of that contract.  We were anxious to get this gas ashore quickly and cheaply so that the input it will make to the economy will be available as quickly as possible.  Now part of the contract says we will take it all ashore on 31st March, 1979, at this price for 20 years.  If we were not going to take it for two years after that we would still have to pay for it because the contract so says and we would not get the benefit inside the economy.  Therefore we were faced with the necessity of taking it ashore at a certain time if we wanted to get it at a certain price and taking the total amount and if we were not prepared to take the total amount at the given time, then we would have to pay a higher price. We had to balance the benefits to the economy and we came to the conclusion we wanted the gas immediately.</P>
    <P>There was talk here about building a national grid and piping the gas to Dublin.  The amount the Dublin Gas Company could take would be about 10 per cent.  That is all the company would use and we would be still faced with finding another big user for the balance.  We decided, in the knowledge we would be criticised, on providing natural gas for the generation of electricity. This is one of the uses we will put it to.</P>
    <P>The figure of 60 per cent may be a good political football, but it is not accurate because what one is talking <Col N="968" /> about is the conversion rate to electricity and, when you get the end use of energy, natural gas, even to burn it under a kettle, is not efficient because there is a wastage of heat.  But there is no wastage of heat in electricity. This is where the 40/60 per cent figure comes in.  It is the conversion rate to electricity where the thermal efficiency of the natural gas is as low as 40 while other fuels would be higher.  Any fuel has a wastage and for Deputy C. Murphy to say this is an appalling sum of money to be going up in the air in smoke is too ridiculous for words.  It is absolute nonsense because the only way to stop wastage is by stopping generating electricity altogether. Any fuel, whether it is oil, coal, peat or gas, has wastage and the only way you can stop wastage is to stop burning electricity and to go back to burning candles.  There is a waste in burning candles too because you end up with no candles.  The argument is a silly one and it bears no relation to the facts of energy consumption or the use of fuels for the generation of electricity as a source of energy.</P>
    <P>The balance will be used in a fertiliser plant.  For some reason Deputy O'Malley is opposed to that and I cannot understand it, because we are an importer of fertiliser and when the NET plant at Marino Point in Cork is built and is functioning we will have 100 per cent sufficiency in fertilisers and have a surplus for export. That is using natural gas in a way that seems to be approved by Deputy Barrett, Deputy Murphy and Deputy Moore but, for some reason, not by Deputy O'Malley, and I do not understand his argument there.  However, he did make the argument in favour of giving further finds of natural gas to the ESB on the assumption that the distribution grid already exists.  I personally do not favour that.  That is my personal opinion now, but when the study to which I referred in the last page of my speech is completed, it may be that is one way of using it, and that, adding together all the components, the use of the field, whatever size it may be, and so on, it may be the right thing to do.  I am not willing to commit myself either way at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> I have said on numerous occasions that if there are further finds of gas Bord Gáis Éireann would be responsible for creating the grid that is found necessary to distribute supplies to the rest of the country.  Deputy O'Malley referred to an article written in a magazine last month or the month before.  This article was based on the assumption that the cost of the gas was so much and the laying of the pipe for the transmission of the gas to Dublin would therefore work out at so much, that we could afford to pay so much for it.  It is all based on the assumption of what the cost of the gas is.  As he is wrong in that, his whole argument falls down.</P>
    <P>The cost of a national grid would be extremely expensive but if the find was big enough, that would probably be the correct thing to do.  Again it must be remembered that when the oil crisis came in October-December, 1973, when we were practically totally dependent on imported oil as an energy source, we had no redress at all; we had no sympathy and no help from anybody.  We were probably more dependent on imported oil than any other country in Europe.  The expansion of Bord na Móna's activities into bogs that were not considered economic up to that point because of the low price obtainable for peat and the very low price of the competing energy source, imported oil, and the expansion of the third programme of Bord na Mona have meant that we will be lowering our dependence on imported oil.</P>
    <P>Another very important factor the Government took into consideration when deciding the ESB should get the natural gas for the generation of electricity was this further lowering of our dependence on imported oil.  This is very important, and I would personally like to see the position arrived at&mdash; and this relates to what is found on our Continental Shelf&mdash;where we would be totally independent of all imported sources of energy, as we shall be totally independent for our sources of imported fertilisers when NET have completed their factory at Marino Point in Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Bord Gáis Éireann will have the duty of looking into the various possible uses of natural gas.  At this stage we should not rule out any of those, whether it is to pump it into generating stations or whatever other use is made of it.  A great deal of consideration must be given to the fact that the grid exists.  It has to be accepted that there is not the most efficient conversion from natural gas to electricity, but as I say the grid does exist.  In establishing a national grid&mdash;Deputy Barrett mentioned Dublin-Cork-Drogheda with branches to Waterford and Limerick&mdash; there is probably over 300 miles involved. That will cost something like £500,000 a mile, maybe less, making a total investment of £150 million.  Is it better to suffer the loss from the less efficient conversion from natural gas to electricity, and, because the grid already exists, invest that money in creating jobs and industries at points on the existing grid, or is it better to make this investment of £150 million to establish the grid because a more efficient use of the gas is obtained?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, you are creating more jobs but you cannot create more jobs except in the building of the grid, and, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, once that is done, the employment is finished.  I am not saying which is the best thing, but these are the choices.  If you make the capital investment in the national grid, then you cannot make a capital investment of that amount in industries to find other jobs.  There are arguments on both sides, and it will be the jobs of Bord Gáis Éireann to bring forward their proposals to the Government in the event of another find.  It must be remembered that this is the only find we have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett spoke of the wastage of using this in Cork, that it should be pumped straight to Dublin.  Given the fact that there is only one find and that it is of quite a small amount, satisfying 12 per cent of our energy needs, it might have been ridiculous to build a grid to take that up to Dublin.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett's fifth point was that the Minister for Finance controls the finances and that Bord Gáis Éireann, through the Minister for Transport and Power, must go to him for permission.  This is current practice in most semi-State bodies.  Anything to do with finance must be cleared and that is written into all legislation controlling State boards.  It must be done in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made a point about the profits being taken by the State into the normal Exchequer funds.  This is no different from the royalty provision in regard to oil.  In the licences issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the exploration or exploitation of our oil resources there is a section stating that the Minister for Finance may charge a royalty.  He is allowed to do the same thing in this Bill with regard to natural gas.  Deputy Barrett was concerned about the &ldquo;additional functions&rdquo; which I may give with regard to consultation with the Departments of Finance and the Public Service.  He felt that this consulting would be done before the board could do anything.  In this field of natural resources we are still young in experience and ability to handle those resources.  A number of other Ministers <Col N="973" /> have interests in this regard, particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the person who grants licences for exploration.  The Minister for Finance is also involved because of the royalties and the Minister for the Public Service is mentioned in all legislation controlling State bodies.  On every occasion I brought in legislation dealing with a State company in the last 12 months I put in a section at the request of the Minister for the Public Service to the effect that the chief executive's salary should be controlled and determined in consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan made the point that in the use of this natural resource the consumer would not benefit.  I gather he was referring to the consumer of electricity.  His point is not correct because it will be a benefit to the consumer in that it relieves the ESB of some of their dependence on imported oil.  In the event of another crisis it assures supply for consumers. If it is as good a bargain as we are led to believe, and I can assure the House that the deal will be very beneficial to the country, the purchase of natural gas will have its effect on the price of electricity in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore felt the Bill had been prepared in haste and said we should have waited another six months.  He was of the opinion we had come to a hasty decision as to how to allocate the natural gas.  I should like to state that the decision allocating the natural gas was taken two years ago and has nothing to do with the Bill.  Any future finds will be used by the board according to the dictates of the Ministers involved.  The board will not have that right and the passing of this legislation will not give them any right over the use of it.  That point is not relevant.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is confusing me again.  This has nothing to <Col N="974" /> do with the Bill.  Deputy O'Malley made the point that an oil find might obviate the necessity to import any oil and this is true.  If there is such an oil find God speed the day.  However, the fact that we will not have to import oil does not mean that we will not have to generate electricity. It is in the use of the oil afterwards that we will get the benefit.  The object would be to get as much value out of the oil found off our shores as possible. That oil be found off the west coast seems to be Deputy O'Malley's hope and it was his belief that people felt there would not be any finds off the south coast.  If that is so some of the multi-nationals who have been accused of being very clever in their use of the resources in the countries where they operate are very stupid.  If there is no chance, as Deputy O'Malley thinks, of an oil find off the south coast some of the biggest companies in the world are wasting a lot of money drilling there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the long term perhaps but the technology to explore in deep water is there but the technology to exploit out of depths of the west coast is not there and may not be there for ten or 15 years.  The people who are now exploring the Celtic Sea would not be doing so if they thought there was not hope.  It may not work out but at least they are there and we would hope to get something at the end of the year.  In opposing this Bill the Opposition are short-sighted, silly and are basing their opposition on false premises that have nothing to do with the Bill.  I can only conclude that their efforts, based on wrong information, are to try to prevent the country getting the benefit of our first find of natural gas.  These obstructionist tactics are based on poor research, bad information and such tactics will keep them opposing similar legislation for many years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>All gas found must be sold to the board.  We are allowing one exception and I shall give an example to illustrate that exception. Suppose all the gas is found off the south coast and is pumped into a national grid there and in 20 years' time there is a small find above the north coast of Donegal, to insist on the board taking that on and pumping it through their grid would be very expensive.  It would mean connecting the north of Donegal to the grid.  That would be silly.  In that event we would consider setting up a big industry near the gas find and pump the gas straight to that industry.  That is the only exception. Otherwise the Bill states that <Col N="976" /> all gas found must be sold to the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dublin Gas Order, 1976, proposed to be made by me and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 10th June, 1976 under subsection (4) of section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas and which impose certain controls on their finances.  Modifications to these special Acts may be made by order under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  Before an order of this kind is made, it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft order in the form submitted or they may approve it with modifications or additions. When such approval is given, I may make the order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Gas Company have applied to me for a special order. The object of the proposed order is to extend the company's borrowing powers, at present limited to £1.2 million. This is substantially below the amount required to carry on their extensive business.  As an interim measure, the company's bankers have continued to meet their current borrowing requirements but it is of course desirable that all borrowings by the company should have the necessary statutory authority.  This will be attained by the making of the order now before the House.</P>
      <P>The company have pointed out to me that up to the present extensions to their borrowing powers have been limited to a definite figure in money terms.  Today a borrowing limit in such terms is likely to be reached quickly because of inflation and other developments outside the company's control, such as the vast increase in raw materials costs which followed the energy crisis in late 1973.  The company are therefore anxious to obtain an extension of borrowing powers on a basis which will make reasonable provision for future developments without the need for repeat applications within short intervals. The company are heavily involved in the supply of gas in the Dublin area and have been giving consideration to their future strategy, taking account of the possibility of further finds of natural gas in the Irish Continental Shelf area.  It is only prudent that the company should now be engaged in making the preliminary arrangements for such developments. This implies a significant extension of their borrowing powers.</P>
      <P>The company accordingly propose that the present statutory limitation on their borrowing powers should be modified to give them power to borrow a sum equivalent to one-and-a-half times the amount of the stockholders' funds as shown in their accounts.  The company say that it is almost universal with companies whose shares are quoted on the stock exchange that their borrowing powers are related to the stockholders' funds and that the directors are authorised to exercise such powers provided they do not borrow in excess of a fixed multiple of the stockholders' funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having examined the company's proposal I am satisfied that the proposal that the borrowing limit as expressed <Col N="979" /> by an amount equal to one-and-a-half times their stockholders' funds is not out of line with general company practice.  The draft order accordingly provides for borrowing power for the company on that basis. The draft order further prescribes the manner in which the amount of the stockholders' funds shall be determined. Based on the company's accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1975, the amount of the stockholders' funds would be approximately £12 million, so that in accordance with the proposal to which I referred the company's borrowing powers would be £18 million.</P>
    <P>Notice of the proposed order was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a daily paper.  No objection to the proposed order was received.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas Company make a significant contribution to the supply of the energy requirements of the Dublin area as about one in three households use gas.  In the recent past they encountered financial problems, due largely to the massive increases in raw material costs which followed the energy crisis in 1973.  Special arrangements were necessary to tide them over this difficult period, including temporary advances from State funds and the nomination by me of four directors to the board.  I am happy to say that events took a turn for the better and the company's financial situation, as reflected in their accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1975, is reasonably satisfactory.  The company are very conscious of the need to improve their performance, and I gather that serious efforts are now being made to foster better labour relations and to increase productivity. As Minister responsible for fuel supplies I welcome and commend these developments and I am anxious to facilitate the company in every way open to me in evolving their plans for the future.  I am satisfied as to the need for this order and I therefore recommend the order for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister if in view of the high cost of the raw materials, namely naphtha, have <Col N="980" /> the gas company or the Minister considered the feasibility of bringing some of the natural gas around the coast by small tankers?  The French already bring it by tankers from the Middle East.  Has this been examined as a means of lowering the cost of gas in the Dublin area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it has not, because the allocation of the total field of natural gas, the only one so far discovered, has been made; therefore there is no surplus for the Dublin Gas Company.  However, in the event of another find it would be the duty of Bord Gáis Éireann to investigate the possibility of establishing a grid or perhaps using the natural gas in the way suggested by the Deputy&mdash;loading it on to tankers and bringing it round the coast to the Dublin Gas Company.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose for which An Bord Bainne Co-operative Ltd. were established was to take over from the statutory Bord Bainne on a voluntary basis, as from 1st February, 1973, the central purchasing and marketing of Irish dairy products.  With the support of the milk processing industry generally in Ireland the board have since that date been purchasing the vast bulk of our output of dairy products and marketing it to best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the production of milk, and consequently of milk products, is largely concentrated in Ireland in the months <Col N="981" /> of April to August each year and as, on the other hand, marketing by the board takes place, fairly evently throughout the year, expenditure by the board on purchasing by far exceeds income from sales during the peak production months.  As a result the board are obliged to borrow on short term vast amounts of working capital from banks and other lending institutions the borrowing to be repaid in the valley period of production when income from sales exceeds expenditure on purchases.  When the board were established they had very little capital of their own and were consequently not in a position to depend solely on their own resources to borrow the vast amounts of working capital they required.  It was for this reason that in 1973 I sought and obtained in section 6 of the Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1973, power to guarantee borrowings by the board for the purchase of dairy products up to a maximum, of £20 million at any one time.  With the aid of this State guarantee the board have up to recently been in a position to borrow their full requirements each year, which at maximum have been well in excess of the £20 million guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Now with the increasing volume of milk being produced and with the substantial increases which have taken place in the price payable to farmers for their milk and, consequently, for the products manufactured from the milk, the peak borrowing requirements of the board have increased to such an extent that the State guarantee of £20 million is no longer sufficient to induce the banks and lending institutions to advance the board's peak capital needs, which this year are expected to exceed £90 million. The Board have in the meantime been endeavouring to build up their own capital reserves so as to enable them to operate free of State guarantee as soon as possible.  However, to enable them to borrow sufficient capital this year and next to meet their needs a State guarantee of borrowings up to a maximum of £40 million is needed. Section 2 of the Bill before the House in effect increases from £20 million, <Col N="982" /> as specified in section 6 of the 1973 Act, to £40 million the maximum amount of the State guarantee of borrowings by the board.  This increased maximum will apply until 31st December, 1977, when, as laid down in the 1973 Act, the period over which the guarantee is available is due to expire.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Government are demonstrating their continued confidence in the marketing arrangements which the dairying industry itself have drawn up and which are operated by An Bord Bainne Co-operative Ltd.  I trust that the House will readily approve of its terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the Minister is necessary and, for that reason, should be welcomed. It affords us an opportunity in the House of discussing, briefly I hope, certain questions that arise for An Bord Bainne and the dairy industry generally, especially in the context of the Minister for Finance's proposal to tax this industry which finds it necessary to seek State guarantees for their borrowings.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a conflict of purpose in the minds of different Ministers with regard to this.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in reading the Minister's speech, alluded to the activities of An Bord Bainne acting as a collective marketing organisation for the dairy industry generally.  I should be greateful if, when replying to the debate, he would enlighten us as to the Government's attitude to the most recent indications of Community policy with regard to what has come to be known as producer co-responsibility, especially in the light of Commissioner Haferkamp's speech reported yesterday wherein a very sharp tightening of the resources being placed at the disposal of the Community's farmers is envisaged and in which the likelihood of exceedingly tight control over price support is adumbrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's observations on the proposals being alluded to at present in the light of the unsatisfactory situation in the existence of 1.3 million. <Col N="983" /> tons of dried skim powder and the growing impatience of some of our colleagues in the Community with this situation; the growth of a strong feeling within the Community that the intervention system which worked satisfactorily enough for the old Six is breaking down in the reorganised Community of Nine because there is a strong body of opinion that feels that the intervention system is not the best means of maintaining some control over production and, at the same time, guaranteeing producer incomes.</P>
    <P>The questions of marketing boards is currently being discussed in the different sectors but particularly in the dairy sector.  I should be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would let the House have the benefit of Government thinking in this regard.  It must be admitted by the Minister, the farming community and everybody that the progressive build-up of more or less unsaleable skim milk powder reserves serves neither the Community nor the farming industry and that if some more satisfactory and equitable method of controlling output could be found&mdash;that would have regard to the state of development of the different countries within the Community&mdash;then such method should be considered.  In that context it would be very necessary to remember that the dairy industry in countries such as Denmark and Holland is indeed a very sophisticated enterprise.</P>
    <P>Here, if measured by production per acre or lactation per cow, one readily recognises that our state of development lags very far behind the countries I have mentioned.  For that reason we would be entitled to demand that any restrictions that might be put on the production of dairy products would not militate against the further development of our dairy industry.  It is on that industry more than any other that the continued existence of the small farmers depends. The question of the replacement of the creaking intervention system by a system of deficiency payments has been mentioned.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be good enough to <Col N="984" /> give us the benefit of the Government's thinking on this subject.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his speech referred to the peculiar difficulties of the dairy industry, and said that the great bulk of production takes place, broadly speaking, in the summer months.  It would be to our advantage as well as to the advantage of Bord Bainne and the dairy industry generally if the length of the lactation season could be extended at both ends, if milk production could begin earlier in the year and be continued &mdash;possibly by a suitable arrangement of an incentive price bonus&mdash;into the winter in order to flatten out the very deep valley which production falls into in the winter months.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say what the thinking of the Department in this regard is.</P>
    <P>I readily accept that, whatever the opinion of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary may be, the dairy industry need not necessarily carry out the Minister's intentions or have any regard to them unless they feel like it.  I feel certain within that context that the Minister would like to see the lactation period extended at both ends.  Therefore it is likely he has some scheme in mind for the achievement of this purpose.  I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would let us know what it is.</P>
    <P>Has any outline been made by the Department for the reorganisation of the co-operative dairy industry?  We recently had a discussion in the House on the great achievement of the co-operative industry when I referred to some of its shortcomings.  The shortcomings as well as the achievements are there and will have to be tackled. Bord Bainne and the IAOS should ensure that any structural deficiencies in the dairy industry are corrected as soon as possible.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to inform us of the Government's attitude to financial co-responsibility on the part of the producers and the intimations by Commissioner Haferkamp of stringent times ahead especially in the dairy sector?  Would he tell us the Government's views on the different <Col N="985" /> views on market support and producer and consumer protection and if they believe that the intervention system should be continued as it is or what alteration should be made to it?  We should also like to know if the Government would favour a system of deficiency payments and also if the Minister and the Government have any proposals to make to the industry with regard to the extension of the lactation season.  I welcome the proposals in the Bill, having asked these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House and Deputy Gibbons will appreciate, this Bill is narrow in its scope.  It is purely a Bill to substitute £40 million for £20 million which the State guarantee to Bord Bainne for borrowings by the board.  I see that Deputy Gibbons has no objection to giving them those extra borrowing rights.</P>
      <P>In my view the questions raised by Deputy Gibbons do not arise on this measure, particularly now because it is only a fortnight since the Estimate for the Department was before the House. The Minister then made a rather lengthy statement on the activities of the Department with particular reference to the dairy industry.  He also had an opportunity of making a rather detailed analysis of the varying aspects of our agricultural industry in his reply to the debate.  The questions asked by Deputy Gibbons about the Government's outlook so far as the industry is concerned were well covered by the Minister during his introductory remarks to the Estimate debate and also in his statement on the conclusion of the debate, but it is no harm to repeat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the Government are particularly anxious to develop our major industry, agriculture, and that any help or assistance they can give towards this development is being given and will continue to be given as long as this Government are in office.  That sums up the Government's position.  It scarcely needs repetition because we have set it down fairly and squarely on numerous <Col N="986" /> occasions that that is our policy so far as this industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>The incidental questions raised by Deputy Gibbons so far as the extension of the lactation period is concerned are questions that would best be considered by farming organisations in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. We would all like to see the lactation period extended.  There are differing views on how that can be achieved.  I appreciate that it is important and that it is something there is no difference of opinion on.  As we are giving the board power to double their borrowing authority with State guarantee I appreciate the work Bord Bainne are doing on behalf of the State and in the interests of the dairy community.</P>
    <P>The board are selling the vast bulk of our dairy products to the best advantage. I am also very pleased that they have not sold any butter so far to intervention.  I believe that should be the last resort.  Deputy Gibbons referred to the skim milk position, which is a worrying one at the moment.  I appreciate that the mountain is building up but the board did not sell any skim milk to intervention until March, 1975, when the market for the product slumped badly.  Unfortunately it has not yet recovered.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to acknowledge the Department's approval of the work of the board.  I am sure Deputy Gibbons will accept that the board are comprised of men who are well conversant with the industry on the production side and the processing side.  They are all men who merit membership of this board.  It cannot be said of them, as it used to be said and as I said on occasions regarding boards set up by the State where Ministers had the nomination of members, that they were nominated because of their political affiliations. This board are nominated outside Department control altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as reflecting on boards that were partially nominated by Ministers.  Undoubtedly on many occasions such boards did very useful work and are continuing <Col N="987" /> to do so.  Many people nominated by Ministers were worthy of their nomination. I do not want to assert here that because a person is of a certain political persuasion he should not be nominated to a State board.  If he has the necessary qualifications, the fact that he is a member of a political party should not be a hinderance to his nomination.  We hear of some people being nominated to boards who are not associated with politics.  I have not too much value on such people because in my view politics are essential. I do not consider that a person who is neutral politically can claim that as an extra qualification for nomination to a board.  However, that does not arise in this case.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the board are doing a good job.  The Government and the Opposition are satisfied that they are doing a good job and that they should get this additional advantage by way of guaranteeing their borrowing up to £40 million.  I thank Deputy Gibbons for his co-operation.</P>

      <P>Would the Chair allow me to intervene to explain briefly why the House will be rising early this evening.  In part, it arises from my having overestimated the amount of time which would be spent on the Second Stage of the very important Gas Bill, and in part from my having been finally informed only this morning that the Opposition would not seek Private Members' time.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought this Adjournment debate because I considered the reply to my question of June 1st to have been inadequate especially having regard to the great urgency surrounding this question.  However, before embarking on the pros and cons of the situation it is imperative that I give a brief outline of this post-primary school at Castleconnell.</P>
      <P>About 30 years ago the English Presentation Sisters came to Castleconnell for the purpose of establishing a novitiate but ten years later they decided to open a secondary school.  This school was residential at the outset but at the request of the people of the parish of Castleconnell as well as those of the adjoining parishes the order decided to cater for day students also.  This venture proved an undoubted success despite the fact that Limerick city had been the traditional and only post-primary location for the Castleconnell area for both boys and girls.</P>
      <P>In 1962 the County Limerick VEC, under my chairmanship, incidentally, decided to expand their teaching services in County Limerick, Castleconnell being one of the new centres. Consequently a VEC school was opened in Castleconnell as a pilot scheme, the premises being a recently-vacated national school building. This venture also met with success and the technical instruction branch of the Department of Education suggested to the Limerick VEC that a new vocational school should be built. As a result of the OECD report on investment in education and of the county development meetings which were held afterwards, meetings that were initiated by the development branch of the Department of Education, it was decided by the two schools authorities in Castleconnell that they would both embark on a scheme of close co-operation in regard to the use of buildings, equipment and teaching resources.  In 1966 there was common enrolment with each school retaining its complete independence and autonomy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> Due to the changing circumstances in the field of post-primary education the Department decided that Castleconnell should be one centre and consequently in 1969 both school authorities agreed to establish a post-primary centre on the convent grounds at Castleconnell.  This arrangement was agreed to by the Department of Education at a meeting in Castleconnell in April, 1970.  That meeting was chaired by Mr. Moloney, principal officer of the development branch.  As the first stage of the new development five new rooms were to be added to the convent school buildings as they then existed.  These were a science room, a woodwork room, a metalwork room, a domestic science room and a library.  During the following 18 months difficulties were encountered but these were overcome subsequently.  Eventually it was decided by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner&mdash;this was in late 1972&mdash;that the new post-primary complex at Castleconnell would be ready for the first student intake in September, 1973.  Unfortunately, Deputy Faulkner was no longer Minister after February, 1973 and in May of that year I was informed by the Department that the Castleconnell school project had been deferred indefinitely. On 12th June, 1975 I asked the Minister for Education if there was a proposal in his Department for the erection of a post-primary centre at Castleconnell. The Minister replied that there were no immediate plans for the erection of new school premises in Castleconnell but that it was anticipated that a community school might be required in the area in the long-term.</P>
    <P>In November, 1975 a meeting of both school authorities, under the chairmanship of the Bishop of Killaloe, Dr. Harty, decided again to approach the Department with a view to reopening the entire question of the Castleconnell project.  As a result of this meeting a letter, dated February 11th, was received by the convent school authority from the post-primary branch of the Department of Education, and I quote:</P>
    <P>... The Department's view... is that because of the relatively <Col N="991" /> small number of pupils in this centre, the ideal arrangement for Castleconnell would be a single second-level school.  The most appropriate location for this school would be the Convent in view of the condition of the existing Vocational School building.</P>
    <P>The form of management of the single school would be a matter for discussion and agreement with the County Limerick Vocational Education Committee.  Existing teachers in the Vocational School could be assimilated on to the staff of the single school without loss of salary or allowances.</P>
    <P>The Department would not favour the enrolment of boys in your school in advance of agreement with the Vocational Education Committee on future developments in the area.</P>
    <P>On may 17th the parents of the convent students received a letter from the convent authorities which read and, I quote:</P>
    <P>For many years, the future of our school has been under consideration due to difficulties in the spheres of educational facilities, finance, personnel and co-operation with the local Vocational School.  On Saturday May 15th the Council of our Congregation met and reached a decision to close Rosary Hill School with effect from July 31st 1977.</P>
    <P>On the same date I received a letter from the Mother Superior confirming this notification to the Department of Education and stating:</P>
    <P>You will see by the enclosed that we have made our final decision about Rosary Hill School.  I am sure that you will realise it is the best we can do under the circumstances. Allow me to thank you on behalf of the Sisters for the efforts you have made on our behalf over the years.</P>
    <P>On May 26th about 200 parents from the catchment area decided unanimously to request the Minister to provide alternative post-primary facilities in Castleconnell.  On June 1st I asked the Minister for Education, as reported <Col N="992" /> at column 488 of the Official Report for that day:</P>
    <P>If he is aware of the proposed closure of Rosary Hill secondary school, Castleconnell, County Limerick; and if he will enter into immediate negotiations with the school authorities with a view to purchasing their existing school buildings for the purposes of establishing a post-primary centre to cater for secondary and vocational school students as outlined in his letter of 10th February, 1976, to the school supervisor.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>My Department have recently been informed by the school authorities that they have decided to close Rosary Hill girls' secondary school in Castleconnell as from 31st July, 1977.  The Department's letter dated 10th February, 1976, was issued in the context of the continued involvement of the Presentation Sisters in second-level education in Castleconnell.  The proposed closing of their school produces a new situation to which consideration will now have to be given.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the circumstances of the Minister's reply but the fact remains that the other partner of the project, the County Limerick Vocational Education Committee, a statutory body, are quite willing and eager to activate section 32 of the Vocational Education Act and establish a post-primary centre in Castleconnell.  Alternatively the Minister could directly approach the convent authorities with a view to purchasing their school buildings for the purpose of establishing a post-primary centre.  It is imperative that the Minister act immediately to ensure that there is no break in the centre's continuity.  A post-primary school is an urgent requirement for this rapidly growing suburban area on the eastern side of Limerick city which also embraces a portion of County Clare.  Castleconnell is ideally suitable geographically as it is now a suburb of Limerick city and has access to east Clare, which is also growing rapidly.  I should like to point out that from an environmental viewpoint <Col N="993" /> it is also ideally suitable.  It has one of the finest aspects in western Europe.  I am asking the Minister to act immediately to ensure that there is no break in the continuity of education in this centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House will realise that the decision to close Rosary Hill girls' secondary school comes as a regrettable surprise in some respects to the Department.  It creates a new situation which has to be assessed carefully.  Any decision to set up a new school in Castleconnell will involve substantial capital expenditure which would ultimately have to be met by the taxpayer.  Therefore, in assessing the new situation created by the decision of the authorities of Rosary Hill Convent the Minister must consider the overall educational facilities <Col N="994" /> of this area with a view to seeing whether there are alternative means of meeting the needs of the children who are attending Castleconnell convent school, or would have attended it.  The Minister must assess all possible alternative means of coping with this problem.  However, I have noted the case made by Deputy Herbert and will convey it to the Minister.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the decision to close Rosary Hill is a relatively new development and not one upon which I could be expected to make a definitive comment as to the Department's response after the short lapse of time which has occurred since the decision.  I regret that I cannot give a fuller statement than this.</P>

Some of the bodies are <Col N="874" /> self-supporting and derive funds to meet their operational expenses from fees or charges for services or products. Others receive grants from the Health Vote or from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  In the case of bodies funded from the Health Vote or from the Hospitals Trust Fund charges for depreciation are not allowed for grant purposes.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the nature of the bodies in question and to the funding arrangements it is necessary to depart somewhat from the format in which the information has been sought. Subject to the necessary adaptation of the headings the information is as follows:</P>
