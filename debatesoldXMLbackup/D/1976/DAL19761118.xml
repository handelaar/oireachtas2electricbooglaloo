      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Faulkner for co-operating in this matter.  I asked him to have amendments put in fairly quickly so that we could deal with the matter this week if possible.  I wish to state how grateful I am to him for making an extra effort to have this done. Yesterday when I was talking to him it appeared we would not get an opportunity of discussing the Bill this week but now we have that opportunity. If it is dealt with in the same expeditious way I am sure we will get it through fairly quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We could go out to very far degrees of kindred but we decided the section went far enough. In reply to the Deputy's question, it may leave a loophole but I hope it will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the matter.  I just wanted to know if the Minister had that in mind when he decided on definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We checked on this matter but we did not want to go too wide.  I admit that what the Deputy suggests could happen but I do not think anybody would do a thing like that.  I feel it would be too pointed.</P>

      <P>In this section the word &ldquo;society&rdquo; means a building society established for the purpose of raising funds, by the subscriptions of members and the acceptance of deposits and loans, for making loans to members on security by the mortgage of freehold or leasehold estate or interest. Does the Minister not consider this definition is too narrow? Would he not consider including development in some way as well as the simple function of raising money or making loans available?  Does the present definition not confine the building societies too much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="285" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.  We do not want to make this too wide.  We are dealing with building societies and it was thought that if we went any further possibly we might enable societies to expand their operations in areas other than those strictly necessary to enable them to carry on as building societies.  I can assure the Deputy a great deal of thought was given to this section and to this definition.  We came down in favour of confining it in the way stated and I think that was the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event that at a later stage the Minister considered the building societies could involve themselves in something other than what is laid down here, would that mean he would have to amend the definition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it would.  I would point out that there are quite a few finance houses dealing with various matters.  To widen this area and allow building societies to expand into other sectors would give them an opportunity if the occasion arose to make profit on some other front.  All of us are interested in ensuring that as much as possible of the money invested is used for the purpose of the building societies.  That is as it should be and we are anxious to have it retained there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the definition of the word &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; is clear enough?  It states in the Bill that it includes charge. Does that mean any charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the difficulties one encounters when framing a Bill of this kind.  The word &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; has a well-known connotation. If we attempted to give it another connotation it might do more harm than good.  When we talk of a mortgage we mean a charge on registered land.  I take the point made by the Deputy but he can be assured it was deliberately kept very short because everyone understands what the word &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 13, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than a regulation under section 76)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section provides for the making of regulations by the Ministers for Local Government and Finance.  Subsection (4) provides that every regulation made under the Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as it is made and it may be annulled by resolution of either House.  As it stands, subsection (4) does not take account of the fact that a draft of any regulation under section 76 must be approved by each House before it is made.  The purpose of the amendment is to eliminate the necessity of laying regulations before each House which have already been approved in draft by each House.  In other words, it is the draft that will come before the Oireachtas and it can be annulled by either House.  There would be no point in having the regulations back again for a second run.  This is simply a drafting measure to ensure that there is no confusion.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to define what is meant by &ldquo;prescribing&rdquo;.  The section states that he may make regulations prescribing any matter or thing and I should like his comments on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general provision regarding the making of regulations. It empowers the Ministers for Local Government and Finance as appropriate to make regulations under the Act.  The regulations may apply <Col N="287" /> generally or to specified classes of society.  Any regulation must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of the Oireachtas except for 1976 which we have just mentioned.  &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; is the word normally used to say&mdash;&ldquo;the Act of&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that it is normally used.  I wanted to get a basic definition as it applies to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find it in the definitions section.  If the Ceann Comhairle has no objection, let us go back to the definitions section. &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made under this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed.  I will not take it any further. If the Minister looks at the definitions he will see that &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And we all know what prescribed means.  Let us not bring a dictionary in here.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that previously a fewer number of persons could establish a building society.  Is the Minister satisfied that ten, which is a relatively small number, is sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think ten is an appropriate number.  Normally it would not be ten individuals but ten people representing perhaps many more.  Ten would appear to be a fairly reasonable number.  As Deputy Faulkner said, under existing regulations any number of persons may establish a society, under section 13 of the 1874 Act, and the rules to be transmitted to the registrar must be signed by three persons and the intended secretary or other officers, under section 17 of the 1874 Act.  All of us agree that the existing requirements are inadequate and a reasonably large number of persons <Col N="288" /> should be involved.  Therefore, the ten founder members provided for is in line with the requirements of section 1 (3) of the British Building Societies Act, 1962.  It seems to be working well over there.  At least we can use experience which has been found to be useful in other countries. Therefore, ten is what we have inserted here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This section reads:</P>
      <P>Any ten or more persons not disqualified under this Act...</P>
      <P>Would it not be better if it read: &ldquo;Any ten or more qualified persons&rdquo;? The word &ldquo;disqualified&rdquo; seems somewhat negative; it gives the impression that one is looking for people disqualified, rather than assuming that most of them are honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very good reason for that wording because persons disqualified from establishing societies are undischarged bankrupts or persons convicted on indictment of offences involving fraud or dishonesty. Deputy Moore says it is a negative way of doing it but it has been found to be the safest phraseology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In relation to the ten persons mentioned in this section is there any criterion laid down as to what should be their qualifications? I agree that it should not be less than ten persons.  It is important when establishing a building society that plays such an important role in handling the money of shareholders and depositors that some criterion be laid down with regard to their qualification in this field, at least some of them.  I know that in a later section the Bill states that it requires a deposit of £10,000.  In my opinion money should not be the sole criterion here&mdash;the £10,000 from each of the directors that would be necessary.  In today's society people can come by that amount fairly easily.  I should like to see at least some of those ten qualified in the field of handling finance.  If an average ten people got together with no proper knowledge of the running of a building society, investment of the funds, or handling <Col N="289" /> of mortgages, it would be a bad day for building societies.  Expertise is needed in this field today; people who know their job are essential to the proper running of the societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We think it would be rather dangerous to lay down qualifications such as Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am saying one or two; I am not saying all of the ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe it would be dangerous to do so.  The registrar will have the right to decide whether or not the person is qualified.  For example, section 11 (3) says:</P>
      <P>The Registrar, if he is satisfied that the rules comply with the relevant requirements of this Act, shall not refuse to register rules delivered to him...or that the name of the proposed society is undesirable or so resembles the name of another society or the name of a person carrying on in the State banking business within the meaning of the Act of 1971 as to be calculated to deceive, or that registration would not be in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business.</P>
      <P>That gives the registrar fairly wide scope, much wider than if we stipulated certain things.  We could be at it for a week and still miss out something that would cause a lot of trouble.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) I <Col N="290" /> recognise the reason for the use of the words &ldquo;building society&rdquo; or &ldquo;cumann foirgníochta&rdquo;.  Basically it is to ensure, when we refer to subsection (2), that societies which are not entitled to be building societies cannot use either description.  I should like to know in what circumstances it is envisaged that the English or Irish version would be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a re-enactment of section 1 (a) of the 1894 Act.  It is similar to section 4 (1) (b) of the British Act of 1962.  The rules must state the manner in which the funds of the society are to be raised.  They raise their funds in different ways, by the issue of shares, of one or more denominations to be paid up in full or to be paid by periodic or other subscription. It is a continuance of what obtains already except that we are tightening it in such a way that, before a society are registered they know exactly what are the terms.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked how they would know what they were going to do with the funds eventually.  We must have in it a certain broadness which will allow this to be dealt with.  We could not enact in this House in any way a Bill which would allow building societies to take in money supposed to be for building houses and it turned out that it was to be loaned to other people, perhaps members of the society, for the purpose of buying or investments for which the money was never intended.  Deputy Fitzpatrick will find that there is nothing new in this.  We are trying to ensure that the loopholes that were there are not being continued.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is probably aware that on the 23rd of May, 1973, the Minister for Local Government, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, had to make certain arrangements to save the building societies with regard to tax remissions, that unless they use the money as building society money and not for other reasons or further uses certain steps would have to be taken.  We are now ensuring, before the society are registered they will know what is expected of them.  It will be in their rules and it will be discussed before the society is registered.</P>

      <P>Lines 26 to 39 of this section deal with the rights of members to requisition meetings, the formal notice for convening meetings and the manner in which notice will be sent.  Is there a change in this Bill as distinct from the previous legislation? Does a mortgage holder have voting rights?  Did he under the previous Bill?  We want to get this on the record and have it clarified.  What protections are there for mortgage holders?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if the Minister has anything in his brief he feels he should tell the House he should do so but it is not necessary that he should be concerned with every section.  Subsection (4) of this section states:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Registrar decides to refuse to register rules delivered to him under subsection (1), he shall, within six months of such delivery, notify the signatories of the rules of his decision and of his reasons for it,</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that six months is a very long period?  Even the courts would be quicker than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be a question of the registrar receiving a set of rules, looking at them and saying: &ldquo;Okay, they are not right&rdquo;.  I am sure he will ask to see the people who have submitted the rules and there will be a lot of discussion in connection with them. We felt that a period of six months was not an unduly long term for such discussions. In fact, there was a suggestion that 12 months might be more suitable. It will not affect the operation of existing societies while the rules are being considered.  This is a reasonable approach to the matter and to make it shorter than six months would not be in the interests of the societies or the proper drawing up of rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If a building society decides to register particular rules they must regard it as a matter of importance to them that these rules should be registered.  The registrar has the right to refuse to accept the rules and in such cases they can bring the matter to the courts on appeal.  It is my view that societies would be more than anxious to have discussions with the registrar to clear new rules as quickly as possible after they submit them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should remember that the existing societies were aware of this provision and raised no objection to it.  With regard to new societies, if the rules are approved there is no trouble about the matter and they can be accepted within a short period. If a discussion is necessary, it can take place as soon as the registrar and the societies can arrange a meeting but in no case can it drag on longer than six months because within a period of six months the registrar must give a definite decision.  I feel the Deputy is looking at it as if the registrar was going to sit down for six months and do nothing about it.  That is not so.  Six months is the longest period the registrar can hold up an application for the registration of rules.  If the Deputy looks at it in that light, he will find that it is a far more reasonable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that where one defines a particular period it is often allowed to run to that.  I agree that where the registrar is satisfied that the rules are in order he can sanction them quickly but where he is not satisfied and the society wishes to have the rules registered a problem can arise.  I can fully appreciate agreement with the existing societies on this matter because they already have rules laid down and the vast majority of them have been accepted.  If the Minister assures me that from the consultations he has had with the societies the period of time is not considered too long, I accept his word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view there will be very few cases where this will drag on.  In most cases the rules when submitted will be approved within a short time.  However, it would be unfair to the societies if we insisted that the rules are approved within, for instance, two months.  They may be forced to go to the courts on appeal then when a longer period of discussion with the registrar might clear the matter.  It would be in the interests of the registrar also to ensure that the rules are confirmed as quickly as possible. It is in the interest of us all to ensure that he does not allow <Col N="298" /> through a rule which would be against the interests of our people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but that is the best method.  Those who are anxious to start a building society do not make up their minds to do so today and commence operations tomorrow. Even if they submit rules with which the registrar does not agree it follows that they are still making the necessary arrangements to proceed as a building society.  I imagine that one of the first things they will do is draw up a set of rules. When that is done they apply to the registrar and then go ahead with arrangements to set up a society. Unless there is something terribly wrong with their rules&mdash;in which case they should never have started&mdash;they will eventually get their rules cleared. &ldquo;Eventually&rdquo; in this case means not later than six months after the application is made.  If it runs beyond that period, they have a right to go to court.  It is preferable to have it this way rather than have a shorter period and have discussions breaking down resulting in expensive court actions over something which could be solved over discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest a compromise similar to that brought in by the Minister on the Bill dealing with planning, an amendment which gives an applicant the right to go to the planning authority and say that the application can be held for two <Col N="299" /> months or four months while negotiations proceed.  Could the Minister do that in the case of building societies, that the registrar can hold the application for three months and a further three months, by agreement?</P>

      <P>Although I can see the merit in Deputy Burke's point, I would prefer not to do that.  I can see arguments against it.  We are talking about the extreme case here.  The number of societies that will be registered will be very small.  Of that number a small proportion may submit a rule or rules which are not acceptable. It would be a mistake in order to try to rush things if we did something which would work against the general body of societies.  A society interested in going ahead will wait that period to have the rules approved.  I would prefer to leave it as it is.</P>

There can be reasons why it may take that time.  He will have the right to sanction rules as soon as he is satisfied, whether that is within a week, or a day, or whatever it is. Section 10 lays down what they are expected to meet so it should not be so difficult.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke has brought out an excellent point. One does not want the registrar's office sitting on every application for at least six months and arriving at a decision in the last week.  One would hope there would be consultations throughout the whole period and that, in most cases, it would be a great deal less than six months.  The public must be protected by giving the registrar a longer period to enable him, if necessary, to go into the various financial and legal matters that will arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (6), line 24, after &ldquo;society&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;within two months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I notice that in the Bill the registrar is required to take various actions and that no time period is specified within which a decision must be taken.  In contrast to that, there are a number of occasions where the societies are compelled to take action within a specified time limit.  Our whole approach on this side of the House is towards giving more power to the registrar, but we still believe some checks and controls are necessary.  In most Local Government Bills, on contentious matters local authorities are required to give their decisions within specified time limits.  It seems reasonable, therefore, that the registrar should be similarly constrained.  This would have the additional advantage of ensuring he has adequate staff to carry out his legal obligations.</P>
      <P>By a special resolution, the building societies can alter their rules.  If they decide to do so, we must assume the alteration is being made for the benefit of the society and their members.  The registrar may decide to accept the change in the rules or to reject it, and an appeal may then be made to the courts.  If the society believe the alteration is beneficial to their members, the longer the decision is held up the greater the disadvantage to the members concerned.  As I said earlier, to ensure that a decision of this kind is not put on the long finger, we should leave it open to the registrar to delay a decision for a limited period of time, but we should specify the time within which he must make a decision.</P>

      <P>I said on Second Reading of this Bill and on a number of other Bills that this is a matter which is in the interests of everybody in this House.  The Bill is the property of the House and the House have the right to make amendments if they consider them necessary.  As on previous Bills, I will welcome any reasonable amendment which will improve the Bill.  If I think an amendment will not improve the Bill or is not necessary, I will say so.  I can easily see the merit of what Deputy Faulkner is proposing in these amendments.  I accept the principle that a time limit should be set within which the registrar should be required to give a decision.  I visualise that the registrar will be very involved with the societies and the need for the time limit will not arise in practice.  In most of the cases mentioned, I agree that two months is an acceptable limit, but I would suggest to Deputy Faulkner that in the case of section 19 regarding an application for permission to advertise for funds, a time limit of six months would be more appropriate.  The registrar is statutorily bound to take into account a large number of factors under section 19 and a limit of two months might become impracticable.</P>
      <P>As regards the amendment he proposes to section 30, amendment No. 11, this section derives from section 169 of the Companies Act, 1963. There is no time limit in the section in the Companies Act and the practice throughout this Bill has been to follow, rather than anticipate, company law.  Furthermore, this is mainly a matter of internal communication and I do not think a time limit is really necessary.  I propose, therefore, to accept in principle amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 10, and No. 7 amended to six months.  As the precise wording needs to be looked at, with the permission of the House I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  I thank Deputy Faulkner for bringing the matter to my notice.</P>

The Minister said he is accepting the principle of Deputy Faulkner's amendments and that he will bring in an amendment covering a period of six months.  It is hardly necessary for the registrar to take six months to make his decision.  Other sections in the Bill are more complicated. Six months is a bit long.  Perhaps three months would be a compromise between Deputy Faulkner and the Minister.  Deputy Faulkner is quite right in putting some time limit in this and other sections in the Bill. Otherwise a decision would be left to the discretion of the registrar and it could lie on his desk for 12 months or two years.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister stated earlier that the purpose for which the building societies are established is primarily for the building of houses. Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>A society shall, so far as is necessary for the purpose for which it was established, have power to hold land with the right of sale.</P>
      <P>I did not think building societies could buy land as they are established at the moment, but evidently this subsection gives them this right.  Does this mean they can go into commercial development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They can buy land for the purpose of building an office. I can understand why the Deputy has this impression, but they cannot&mdash;and this is what was happening&mdash;go out and buy land for speculation purposes. This section, which is a re-enactment of existing provisions, allows a society to hold land or buildings for the purpose of conducting its business.  The section has been drafted tightly and would not allow a society to become involved in land speculation or land development.  A society may hold only such land and buildings as are necessary <Col N="304" /> to enable it to conduct its business as a building society, that is, to raise funds and make loans to members. The purpose for which a society may be established is clearly defined in section 2 as being the raising of funds for making loans to members by the mortgage of freehold or leasehold estate.</P>
      <P>There are a number of fields of commercial activity which are incidental to building society operations. These would include, for instance, bridging loans, fire insurance and life assurance.  Arguments have also been put forward that societies' close involvement with the property market places them in a good position to become more directly involved in that market.  Much consideration has been given to these questions but, on balance, it is felt that the interests of the building society movement as a whole and, in particular, the security and confidence enjoyed by investors, are best served by allowing societies to operate only within their traditional limits of accepting funds and making loans to members on the security of freehold or leasehold estate.</P>
      <P>This power to hold land is, accordingly, being limited by subsection (1) to that purpose.  Subsections (2) and (3) enable a society to acquire land for the purpose of erecting an office for the conduct of its business, but the section does not permit a society to hold land for development purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's good faith in this, I believe the section is broad enough as it is worded here to allow flexibility as far as the society is concerned.  Take office development, for example.  What is to stop a society buying a site, deciding they are going to build an office; they get a better offer for their site six months later and then sell the site?  I am not saying they would do it meaning any harm, but is this type of speculation stopped in section 16?  It should be written into the rules of the society that that type of operation will not be allowed.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Why they could not bring the provisions together I do not know. As subsection (3) of this section reads the society may purchase, hold or lease land for the sole purpose of erecting on it a building for conducting a business, and the next subsection says the society &ldquo;may sell, exchange or let&rdquo;.  Under that section I could erect a building, have part of it for my building society office and let a substantial amount of it as a hotel.  I I know that under section 76 that is tied up.</P>

The reasons are set out why the building societies were established and the purposes for which they can hold land.  That is clear enough without going to section 76, but 76 clinches it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated clearly that, on the one hand, there is the fact that the building societies do not want and have not been given the right in any way to indulge in land or property speculation. At the same time, it would be unfair to place them in a position in which they were unable to buy a property for the purpose of carrying on the administration necessary to their business.  Some of the societies are doing vast business and have vast administrative offices.  It would be very unfair to leave them in the position that they dare not buy any property, because they were held up somehow on a right of sale, if such was necessary for their business.  The Act recognises that there is a possibility that something might occur which gives them the right of sale.</P>

      <P>They may sell or let any building or land mentioned in subsection (2) or (3) which is for the purpose of conducting their business.  It may want to move to bigger premises so it may have to sell its property or part of its property.  It is right to ensure that societies cannot indulge in land speculation and property speculation.  Certainly they do not want to.  They have enough speculation in a sense with each individual loan but, at the same time, the Bill recognises that they must not be placed in an unfair position in relation to all other forms of financial business. In other words, they must be able to sell their own property if it is in their interest to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>While nobody would disagree with what Deputy Dockrell <Col N="307" /> says, many people would be worried about section (2).  A building society could build an office block, use one room in the office block themselves and let the rest of the block at a profit. That is very good business, but that is not what they were established for. Building societies were established for house building and not for building office blocks.  Office block building is a very lucrative business to be in and there is a temptation for building societies to build and let an office block and bring in plenty of money. While I know that this section cannot be omitted we should look at it further and ensure that building societies will recognise that their reason for existence is to make money available for house building.  A building society could become very prosperous and move out of its original sphere of activities, and we would have big property developers making plenty of money and even ploughing money back into house loans but they would be missing out on their essential purpose which is to devote all their energies towards providing house loans.  Deputy Dockrell made a very good case when he said that we cannot tie them down altogether.  We do not want to but we should write in every possible precaution to impress on them that the Oireachtas adopted this legislation to make them better prepared to provide more house loans and we do not want to see them go overboard on office developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly we are going a little wide of the mark.  I refer Deputy Moore particularly back to section 2, the definition section, page 5, line 10 which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;society&rdquo; means a building society established under this Act for the purpose of raising, in accordance with this Act, funds (by the subscriptions of the members, the acceptance of deposits and loans) for making loans to members on security by the mortgage of freehold or leasehold estate or interest;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present by arrangement between the Minister for Local Government and the societies 90 per cent of the net inflow must be spent on mortgages <Col N="308" /> for houses.  The suggestion that we are putting something in here which will allow building societies to go out and start building office blocks all over the place and completely ignore the object for which they were set up is wrong.  The Registrar of Building Societies will not allow that to happen because it would be an infringement of this section.  What Deputy Dockrell said was that if a society require an office and they purchase a building in which such an office is, it would be perfectly in order for them to make a transaction which would result in the sale or disposal of the remainder of the offices.  They could make money on that which could be re-invested provided they stayed within their 10 per cent.  We are talking about building societies whose object is to build houses and we are labouring the point.  We are making a lot of something which is not a serious matter. Even under existing legislation it has been possible to confine them to 10 per cent.  Under the new legislation we resisted the temptation to widen the scope; they must stay within their own ambit.  I think it would be a mistake if we attempted to tighten the Bill any further.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I would not like to inhibit the expansion of the building societies in any way.  I take the point that Deputy Dockrell has made, that if a society expands it requires new offices. Naturally, building societies are in business to make money.  When I read the section I thought that it was rather broad in its context in relation to the previous sections which the Minister had defined so closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> In page 11, subsection (5), line 31, to delete &ldquo;twenty-one&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eighteen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 17, subsection (5) reads:</P>
    <P>A person under the age of twenty-one years may be admitted as a member of any society the rules of which do not prohibit such admission and can give all necessary receipts, but while he is under that age he shall not be entitled to vote or to hold office.</P>
    <P>I believe that this subsection as it stands is very much out of date.  Many young people are marrying and becoming houseowners before the age of 21 and, more important still, they can vote in Dáil and local elections and they can become members of this House.  Yet in this Bill they are given less than their full rights.  I am aware of the argument put forward by the Minister when supporting this anomaly in the Seanad when the Minister said that the Department of Justice was preparing a law for changing the age of majority and that when such legislation was passed all reference in this legislation to 21 years would automatically change to 18 years.  I can see no reason why we should wait for that day.  This legislation is now before us and the Minister says it will last for a long time.  If we are to consider it in the context of the length of time since the previous legislation on building societies was enacted, it certainly will last a long time.  If this new legislation has to be amended in a few months when the legislation mentioned by the Minister is passed, then I can see no reason why we should not amend the legislation now and insert 18 instead of 21.  The same arguments I put forward in relation to section 17 relate perhaps even more closely to section 53 (2).  To suggest that the person who can vote for those who govern the country is not regarded as a fit and proper person to vote in elections on issues relating to building societies is ridiculous.  Therefore, I commend the amendments to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support everything said by Deputy Faulkner. It is ludicrous that a person of 18 who is entitled to vote for his representative <Col N="310" /> in the Dáil is treated in this way in this legislation.  Many young people between 18 years and 21 years are getting married and they are put into an awkward position in regard to mortgages.  I should like the Minister to give serious thought to this and to accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister is anxious to wait for the overall change with regard to majority age which is being drafted in the Department of Justice but we have seen instances where other Bills have been delayed in that Department and in others.  Various problems can arise that delay the drafting of Bills.  We should not wait for the general Bill but should make the decision as we go along.  Here is a classic example of problems being put in the way of young people by legislation. We had a referendum and the people expressed their wishes regarding the role of people of 18 years and we should not go against the general wish of the public.  The Minister should accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody in this House is more anxious to give rights to 18-year-olds than I am.  I would point out that the first Bill I piloted through the House was the measure that gave 18-year-olds the right to vote.  In this case it is not simply a question of putting this into the legislation and thus making it operative.  If that were the case I would be prepared to say this was the right thing to do but I am advised that putting in that provision here would not make it operative.</P>
      <P>Until the Law Reform Commission have completed their investigations and until the legislation is passed reducing the age of majority to 18 years, a person under 21 years is still a minor.  As such he is not entitled to sign a contract and, if a contract is signed, he can repudiate it unless it can be proven that it would be in his own interest not to do so.  In those circumstances I do not think anybody, never mind a building society, would be prepared to accept the signature of somebody under the age of majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every sympathy with Deputy Faulkner's amendments.  I know he thinks of this matter in the same way <Col N="311" /> as I do.  A young person can carry a gun to defend the State but he is still a minor until he is 21 years.  I could never see the merit in that but until legislation is passed it would be unfair and would be a bad joke on those people if we gave the impression that by writing that provision into this legislation we were giving them something when that was not the case.  For that reason I am sorry I cannot accept the amendments and it would be better if the Deputy withdrew them.  I will give an assurance to the House that I will do my best to have the age of majority reduced to 18 years.  I believe it will come in a relatively short time and it must apply to everybody in all walks of life.  When the age is reduced to 18 it will apply to existing law.  Where the age of 21 years is entered it will be as if it were 18 years.  In the circumstances I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendments.  They will not do what he wishes and will cause complications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 53 (2) provides that a person under the age of 21 years shall not be entitled to vote at a meeting.  I accept that the Minister is as anxious as anybody to have the change made.  I am trying to prove whether it is possible for us to make changes here before the Bill is introduced by the Minister for Justice because, as Deputy Burke pointed out, that may be held up for a considerable time.  It is absolutely ridiculous that at a meeting of a building society where individuals are being elected to certain positions somebody cannot vote for the person of his choice simply because he is under 21 years but, at the same time, the young person can vote in national and local elections.  Young people are being deprived of rights that all of us consider are their entitlement.  I think the Minister has pointed out that a person under 21 years is still a minor in law.</P>

      <P>A point was made by Deputy Burke regarding loans but neither of the amendments referred to loans.  They refer to the right to vote at a meeting of a society and that is an entirely different matter.  I am as <Col N="312" /> anxious to give 18-year-olds the same rights as anybody else.  If Deputy Faulkner will withdraw the amendments I will have a look at the position before Report Stage.  If it does not infringe on the law of contracts I will introduce an amendment that will meet the point he is making.  Many people of 18 years come to me and tell me that while they can get a loan they are not allowed to sign the relevant documents.  That would still be the position even if we put the requested provision into the Bill.</P>

I think it unwise to build into legislation a provision under which people, even without a £5 share or £10 share in a building society, can get a loan while, at the same time, other people can get a loan by reason of the fact that they have a share in a building society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A society, subject to its rules, may allow a person to whom a loan is being made to become a member without holding a share.  This subsection specifies the liability of such a person.  In the definitions section &ldquo;society&rdquo; is defined as a building society established for making loans to members.  In order to comply with this definition a building society is enabled to make a loan to a noninvestor by allowing him to become a member without holding a share, obviating the need for advance shares, which was the practice in many societies and will not disturb the practice of issuing advance shares.  The liability of a person to whom this subsection applies, in effect, will be that of the holder of an advance share, that is, the amount of the mortgage deed itself.</P>
      <P>As I said to Deputy O'Leary, to stipulate that if somebody had not got money invested they were not entitled to borrow money would simply mean either that building societies would have to go back to a statutory arrangement under which the shares would be referred to as advance shares or, alternatively, applicants for loans would have to put in a nominal sum, go through the motions of becoming a member, and then proceed to draw money out.  I do not think either would be desirable and would merely further complicate the matter. In view of what is happening, particularly this year in which an enormous number of people have drawn money without being members, it would be a pity if we interfered with that arrangement. If Deputy O'Leary takes another look at it he will realise it would be a pity to do so.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say why it is necessary to have subsection (2) in the Bill?  Surely the Minister will agree that a person with a £100, £50 or £25 share in a building society should have a prior right to a loan rather than a person who has no share at all in a building society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, he has. Suppose on the first of any particular month a particular building society have £1 million they want to loan for the purpose of building houses and by the 28th of that month they have loaned only £500,000.  Although they may have claims with them from people who are not members of the society for £2 million should they hold on to that and say: &ldquo;No, although you want the money, we are holding this just in case somebody who has an investment in the society wants to borrow money.&rdquo;  The point being missed is that an awful lot of people invest money in societies for the purpose of getting a loan and initially indicate that by saying: &ldquo;We will be looking for a loan at a later date.&rdquo;  However, an awful lot of people invest money in societies because it is an investment; it is a safe income on which tax will not be payable and which they are sure of getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> To insert a stipulation saying that unless somebody had an investment with a society they were not entitled to borrow money would be the cause of an uproar, particularly as the societies themselves, if they find they have 100 applications on hand and 50 of them are from members, will give priority to those 50 members. That is an established practice and is as it should be.  I am trying to go easy on Deputy O'Leary because I am sure he does not mean what he appears to be saying.  It might give the impression that Deputy O'Leary is opposed to anybody except those with money invested in building societies being allowed to draw moneys from them.  I do not think that is what he means but that is what he is saying.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Moore is attempting to put across&mdash;there may be a lot of merit in it but not in this Bill&mdash;is that there should be some way of differentiating that if the husband and wife have a dispute, even if it is only a temporary one, the husband or wife, whichever name is down first, should not be entitled to go along and vote for the other person.

      <P>In page 12, before section 18, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;18. &mdash;(1)  A society shall not raise any funds under section 22 after the commencement of this section unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  written evidence has been produced to the Registrar satisfying him that not less than ten of the appropriate persons (or where there are less than ten, all such persons) have each been issued with shares in the society to a value not less than such sum as may be prescribed by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance, and that the total value of such shares is not less than such sum as may be prescribed by the Minister after such consultation,</P>
      <P>(b)  written evidence has been produced to the Registrar satisfying him that the appropriate persons have been paid to the society the prescribed sums in cash for those shares,</P>
      <P>(c)  written evidence has been produced to the Registrar satisfying him that the society has complied with section 20, and</P>
      <P>(d)  the Registrar has certified that the evidence referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) has been produced.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of subsection (1) the appropriate persons are&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of a society which is incorporated on or after the 5th day of December, 1975, the persons who established the society, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of any other society, the directors of the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  (a)  The terms applicable to the shares to which subsection (1) (a) refers shall not, either at the time when the shares are issued or at any time before the expiration of five years from the date on which the Registrar's certificate <Col N="320" /> referred to in subsection (1) (d) is issued, be in any respect more favourable than those applicable to any other shares issued by the society.</P>
    <P>(b)  Within the five-year period referred to in paragraph (a) a society shall not give effect to or recognise any transfer of shares referred to in subsection (1) (a) other than a transfer by operation of law.</P>
    <P>(c)  For the purposes of paragraph (a) &ldquo;terms&rdquo; shall include rate of interest, dividend or bonus, liability to contribute to losses, rights on a transfer of engagements or winding-up of the society or on the union of the society with another society.</P>
    <P>(4)  Within the five-year period referred to in subsection (3) a society shall not repay the sum (or any part thereof) subscribed for the shares referred to in subsection (1) (a) unless during the period the society is wound up under section 95 or a transfer of its engagements to another society has been registered by the Registrar under sections 26 or 27 or a person who has subscribed for those shares becomes disqualified under this Act or dies.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a person referred to in subsection (4) becomes disqualified or dies, either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the remaining persons who subscribed for the shares referred to in subsection (1) (a) shall within the period of 30 days after the disqualification or death pay to the society sums in cash equal to the aggregate to the sum subscribed by the person becoming disqualified or dying, and shall be issued with shares in the society to the value so subscribed, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any other person not disqualified under this Act may subscribe in cash for, and be issued with, shares in the society to a value not less than the sum subscribed by the person disqualified or dying,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> and the provisions of subsection (3) shall apply to shares issued under this subsection.</P>
    <P>(6)  The evidence referred to in subsection (1) shall be produced to the Registrar&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a society which is incorporated on or after the commencement of this section, within three months from the date of incorporation;</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of any other society, within three months from the commencement of this section;</P>
    <P>(7)  Where a society fails to produce to the Registrar within the appropriate period specified in subsection (6) the evidence referred to in subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a society which is incorporated on or after the commencement of this section, the Registrar may cancel the registration of the society under section 94;</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of any other society, the Registrar may take an application to the Court under section 95 for the winding-up of the society.</P>
    <P>(8)  If a society to which this section applies raises any funds in contravention of this section, or if at any time within the five-year period referred to in subsection (3) any provision in that subsection or in subsection (4) is not complied with, the Registrar may make an application to the Court under section 95 for the winding-up of the society.</P>
    <P>(9)  For the purposes of this section, the shares referred to in subsection (1) (a) shall be deemed not to be shares issued under section 22.</P>
    <P>(10)  This section shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any society which was incorporated on or before the 5th day of December, 1973 and which, during the two-year period ended on the 5th day of December, <Col N="322" /> 1975, raised funds and made loans to members on the security of freehold or leasehold estate,</P>
    <P>(b)  any society which was incorporated during the two-year period ended on the 5th day of December, 1975 and which, on that date, had assets of not less than £20,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 20 deal with certain matters relating to the commencement and carrying on of business by a society.  The situation which exists at present is that where any four persons wishing to establish a society submit rules for registration, the registrar has little or no option but to register the rules and incorporate the society.  Once registration has been obtained, the society may immediately advertise and begin accepting funds from the public.  Bearing in mind the scale of operations of societies at present, this situation is considered most unsatisfactory.  The provisions of section 18 are designed to remedy the matter to some extent by prohibiting societies from accepting any funds until they have complied with certain requirements.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment before the House is simply to meet some inadequacies of detail which become apparent in the text of section 18 as it now stands.  I will elaborate on these points of detail in a moment.  In the main, however, the proposed amended version of the section does not differ from the existing text.  The purpose still remains of prohibiting a society from accepting funds until it had met with certain requirements.  These requirements are that:</P>
    <P>(a)  the founder-members must each have been issued with, and paid in cash for, shares in the society to a value not less than that specified by the Minister for Local Government, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the society must have deposited funds with the Central Bank in accordance with section 20.</P>
    <P>Certain restrictions are placed on the founder-members' shares&mdash;for example, <Col N="323" /> the terms applying to them cannot be more favourable than those applying to other shares in the society and they cannot be repaid or transferred within five years.  This is to ensure that persons establishing a society shall have and maintain a minimum interest in the society from the start and will, therefore, see to its proper management.  The purpose of the deposit at the Central Bank is to provide a measure of protection for investors' funds.</P>
    <P>Societies which do not comply with the requirements of the section may have their registration cancelled, or may be wound up.  It transpires, however, that a situation could arise with the section, as it stands, where the founders of an existing society, which may have been established for some years, could now be required to contribute substantial amounts if it is to be allowed to continue in operation. I am not satisfied that this would be either equitable or feasible as, in certain cases, some or all of the founders might have ceased to be associated with the society or might even have died.  Accordingly I am now proposing that, in the case of an existing society coming within the terms of the section, the shares should be subscribed by the directors, rather than by the founders.</P>
    <P>It is provided in subsection (2) (a) of the Bill that the terms applicable to the founders' shares shall not be more favourable than those applicable to &ldquo;any other shares of that class&rdquo; in the society.  It could be argued that the founder shares could themselves constitute a &ldquo;class of shares&rdquo; and, in that case, subsection (2) (a) would not be effective.  I am therefore proposing that the terms shall not be more favourable than those applying to &ldquo;any other shares&rdquo; issued by the society and the meaning of &ldquo;terms&rdquo; is being spelled out in detail.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed that societies which are actively carrying on business, that is, accepting shares and deposits and making loans, should come within the ambit of the section.  I am satisfied even that societies fairly recently established and which proceeded <Col N="324" /> to build up a fund for the making of loans should also be excluded.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of registered societies which have never carried on any business but which were established in an attempt to circumvent the provisions of the Bill and, presumably, to confer some advantage on the founders.  It is proposed that the provisions of the section should apply in full to these societies.  Similarly, there are a number of very old societies which have long ceased to function but which could be taken over and reactivated by persons seeking to circumvent the provisions of the Bill.  It is proposed that the provisions of the section should apply in full to these societies also.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment to the section has, accordingly, been drafted so as to apply the section to three categories of societies.  These are:</P>
    <P>(i)  all new societies established after the Bill was published,</P>
    <P>(ii)  societies established more than two years before the Bill was published but which in the two years prior to publication did not make any loans to members, that is, old dormant societies, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  societies established during the two years prior to publication but which at the date of publication did not have total assets of more than £20,000.</P>
    <P>I consider that the section, as amended, would be more watertight and more really enforceable than the original section and so I commend amendment No. 5 to the House for its approval.</P>
    <P>I also commend amendment No. 8 to the House.  This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 5 and serves only to maintain consistency between the terms used in sections 18 and 20.</P>

Surely it is in the interests of everybody that the remaining members take up these shares.  If they are not able to do that, they will find a reputable person who will fill in and take up the shares. I am sure there will be no difficulty about doing that.  If there is, I assume the registrar will have to decide what is to be done.  If the money cannot be found I can only assume that that society was in a bad way.  Steps would have to be taken to deal with that society if that could not be done. The alternative to what is in the Bill is that the society is on its way out.</P>

We either allow the people who may claim to have a proprietary right as they are the remaining members to take up the shares or if they cannot do it a reputable person prepared to do it is found.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome any section that will control in some way wasteful advertising by the building societies.  By the very nature of their business the building societies must advertise to get funds, but I should like to see some control as to the relationship between the amount of money spent on advertising and the total assets of the societies. A guideline should be set down by the Minister.  I do not see any such guidelines in this section setting down a particular figure which a building society cannot exceed in an advertising campaign in one year.  If there is such control I should like the Minister to clarify it.  We have seen over the past few years a ludicrous amount of advertising, particularly by two or three of the bigger societies.  Night after night we have seen this advertising on television.  Undoubtedly, it brings in a certain amount of money, but I feel that the same amount of money could be raised with much less wasteful advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the section which deals with the control of advertising. It deals with who may advertise for a certain purpose.  Deputy Burke's point can be discussed on section 76, which is the regulation section. However, I should like to deal with the two interesting points which <Col N="330" /> Deputy Burke has raised since they might appear in print and people might get the wrong impression.  First of all, if all societies stopped adver tising completely, it would mean a drop in the mortgage rate of one-third of 1 per cent.  Secondly, the three building societies to which Deputy Burke referred who have carried on a large amount of advertising are, in fact, the societies whose business has increased very substantially, while those who did not advertise at all or who spent less on advertising have grown very slowly.  Since all the building societies offer almost the same conditions it has been suggested that they should combine in some way, but, of course, business people often sell the same goods at the same price and they do not offer to combine. They have their own ways of seeking customers.  We can discuss this matter further on section 76.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a retrograde step if we were to prevent building societies from advertising over a certain limit.  The flow of funds could drop and fewer people would be able to get loans.  The cure would be worse than the disease.  We must be very careful on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke does not realise two things.  Firstly, if the Minister attempted to limit advertising quantitatively he would inevitably substantiate the position of the larger societies.  There would be no free competition.  Smaller societies would inevitably be condemned to remain in an inferior position.  If that had been done some years ago, many people who are now living in houses and paying off their mortgages would be walking about the streets or the country roads or living with their inlaws. The money would not have come in to make it possible for the societies to lend as much as they have done.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(8)  A deposit or loan to a society, which is permitted under section 19 of this Act to advertise for funds, shall be acceptable as a trustee security for the purposes of section 1 of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, specified those investments which are trustee securities. Section 2 authorised the Minister for Finance to vary, by addition or deletion, that list.  The trustee status can only be conferred on investment bodies which attain certain qualifications. These qualifications were not specified by the Minister when he spoke in the Seanad debate, but he did not imply that the bulk of building societies would not qualify.  He said:</P>
      <P>A number of the provisions in this Bill will remove the last obstacle in so far as a number of societies are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this may be so, it is still up to the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance to take action and they could be very slow in doing so, because, for example, this action might slow down the flow of funds into national loans.  The amendment we propose would make it automatic that any society which was permitted by the registrar to advertise for funds would have trustee status.  It would also make the decision to permit advertising a more crucial one and one that would not be taken without considerable thought.  I think we would be in agreement that when a building society is permitted to advertise this will only be done after very careful scrutiny by the registrar and that a building society in such circumstances <Col N="336" /> would be a fit society to be included among those who have the qualifications to be entitled to have trustee money invested with them.  As I said, while I recognise that it relates mainly to the Trustee Act, nevertheless, being admitted would result in a very considerable flow of funds into the building society and it would help to stabilise this flow of funds.  We have knowledge through past experience of the fact that money flows into the building societies at varying rates.  Sometimes the building societies are short of money and cannot fulfil their obligations as happened in 1974; then there was a considerable inflow of money, but in more recent times that has again slowed up and since the bank strike a considerable amount of money which was invested in the building societies has gone back to the banks, in fact, more than the inflow.  This resulted in some building societies refusing to grant mortgages, or granting them under stricter regulations, in October, 1976.  Membership would create a more stable situation.  I strongly urge the Minister to agree to its inclusion in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The question of trustee status was raised on Second Stage.  I indicated then that the granting of trustee status to building society deposits was a matter for the Minister for Finance under the Trustee Acts, 1893 to 1958.  As the Minister responsible for housing, I should like trustee status to be given to certain building society deposits as it would open up a new range of investment funds for building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner's amendment seeks to confer trustee status on deposits with any building society.  This would be an easy way for me to boost the inflow of funds to building societies, but I must resist the temptation to do so.  In the first instance the granting of trustee status is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  A society would have to satisfy more rigid financial criteria than those set out in section 19, which deals only with permission to advertise.  When an Act such as the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, exists, which deals fully with the matter, it would be absurd to <Col N="337" /> begin the proliferation of references to trustee status in a variety of enactments.  The provision in the Bill will remove obstacles which have been in the way to granting this status to building societies.</P>
    <P>To accept Deputy Faulkner's amendment would amount to bad legislation and I recommend that it be withdrawn. I am anxious to see trustee status granted.  I am sure that within a relatively short time of the enactment of this Bill most of the societies will obtain trustee status.  It is important that it does not become the right of any society to get it and for that reason I would ask Deputy Faulkner to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that my amendment would appear to grant the right to any building society to obtain trustee status.  That is not so. My amendment specifically states that only building societies authorised to advertise for funds should achieve this status.  Any building society which has to go through the stringent examination which would be necessary before it was permitted to advertise would be a suitable subject for trustee status. The Bill provides that the Minister may consult with his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  When we get to the Committee Stage the Minister for Finance will know what is likely to arise under this Bill and he could agree with the Minister for Local Government that trustee status should be granted to the type of society I have referred to.  The Minister will agree that, having gone through the process which will be necessary to ensure that a society has the right to advertise, there can be no doubt that such a society will be a suitable subject for trustee status.  Apart from an increased flow of funds, it would stabilise the situation and we would not have a continuation of the stopgo situation to which we have become accustomed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is oversimplifying the matter.  Trustee status will be granted quickly after the passing of the Bill.  The Minister for Finance and I are in agreement on this <Col N="338" /> matter.  Deputy Faulkner's amendment reads:</P>
      <P>A deposit or loan to a society, which is permitted under section 19 of this Act to advertise for funds, shall be acceptable as a trustee security for the purposes of section 1 of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958.</P>
      <P>In other words, Deputy Faulkner says that every building society is entitled to trustee status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If they cannot advertise they are not an active building society. Deputy Faulkner is saying that as soon as a building society is allowed to operate it is entitled to full trustee status.  I could not accept an amendment which would give that authority. Some people have found ways to circumvent the existing legislation. If trustee status had been granted a serious situation could have arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We share the Minister's hope that the passing of this legislation will strengthen the structure of the building societies.  If the amendment is not accepted it could be said that it will not give trustee status to building societies.  While we want to see money flowing into the housing fund, it may well be that other Government Departments might not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The registrar would not be able to interfere if, under section 19, they were allowed to advertise. They would be entitled to trustee status under Deputy Faulkner's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can raise the standards of building societies we hope that some day they will all be worthy of trustee status.  We must therefore speed the day when this is possible. Deputy Faulkner's amendment would strengthen the Bill, give status to building societies and attract a large amount of money for house building. Our main concern is to ensure that building societies are strong enough to help in the housing drive.  The more money we can attract, the more we will have for housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that he would like to extend trustee status and hopes that building society standards will be so high that every society will be worthy of trustee status.  If they get the right to advertise for funds under section 19&mdash;and there are strict controls on advertising for funds under the section&mdash;surely the small investor is entitled to the same controls.  If they are not given trustee status they should not be allowed to advertise to attract the small investor's funds.  If they are so weak as building societies, why should we give them the right to advertise for any funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke is assuming that the small investor goes to the small society.  That is not so.  Most of them invest in the larger societies because they have more confidence in them.  The small society may be prepared to meet more quickly the criteria required than the larger society. The main point is that they must reach a certain standard.  They are allowed to advertise and nothing will bring them to that standard more quickly than the fact that other building societies have been given trustee status.  Therefore, within a short time everybody must have trustee status to survive.  The right to advertise guarantees the right to trustee status.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We all appreciate that giving trustee status would be a wonderful advantage as regards the inflow of capital to any organisation but we must always consider that trustee status must carry far more guarantees than any other type of financial institution. We on this side of the House are convinced that if we want to boost inflow of capital to a building society the granting of trustee status at some time with proper regulations laid down is desirable.  This is very much a matter for the Minister for Finance and I am very glad to hear that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government are on the same wavelength in relation to the granting of trustee status.  I wonder if that view is shared by all the top financial experts in the Department of Finance.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister might mention publicly in the House that his heart is in the right place, but we know perfectly well that there are other impediments besides the regulations laid down here, although it is of vital importance that trustee status in building societies is protected.  A lot of funds are invested in trustee status that the Government have available to them.  I can see an outflow of this capital into the building societies.  I am not sure that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance are on the same wavelength. It is a good public thing to say: &ldquo;Of course we will give trustee status when the proper standards and regulations are established.&rdquo;  I know that the Minister for Finance will say that if a question is put down.  The standards that the Minister for Finance will set down will be fairly restrictive, in my opinion.  Many building societies will not be in a position to qualify, although the leading building societies are all on a par with each other.  A case can be made for the granting of trustee status to building societies.  I believe that the Minister for Finance may not be too keen to push trustee status and make it available to the building societies.  Certain funds which are available to the Minister at present could be used in the building societies to far better effect for the country if we get it.</P>

      <P>Trustee status will come but there is a recognised procedure in relation to conferring trustee status. Everybody here is aware of it and many, I am sure, will have checked up on it.  I am satisfied that there is no way to deal with the matter except through the recognised criteria.  It cannot be changed, as has been suggested, because somebody feels that this would be a way of preventing it from being given.  Section 19 does not require permission to advertise even for all the existing societies.  The amendment does not do what Deputy Faulkner suggested it would.  We have made a great deal of progress this morning on the Bill and I would ask Deputy Faulkner to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister for Local Government is as anxious as I am to have trustee status granted.  I am equally as sure of what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said: that the Minister for Finance may not be as anxious to have it granted.  It is vitally important that trustee status should be granted to the building societies, and I feel that in relation to these societies which under this Bill will be permitted to advertise the necessary structures will be built in. In these circumstances we should have trustee status incorporated in the Bill, but if the Minister can assure me that he will do his utmost to have trustee status conferred by the Minister for Finance as quickly as possible after this Bill is passed, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in giving that assurance.  There is no difference of opinion between the Minister for Finance and myself on this issue.  There has been a tremendous increase in the inflow of funds to building societies, and it is quite true that this year they hope to lend £100 million as against £43 million two years ago.  The granting of trustee status will bring in a lot of funds which can only be invested with trustee status.</P>

      <P>When we were speaking on this motion on the last occasion more than one Deputy commented on the proper attitude of all who took part in the debate towards this rather important problem. I wish to continue in that vein and I would ask the Minister to accept that where it appears I differ from him I hope it is in a constructive and understanding sense that I do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Chair would allow me to recall a few points I made on the <Col N="345" /> last occasion.  With regard to the status and the position of the committee itself, it will be a Joint Committee involving both Houses.  It will be involved in the administration and accounting of the State bodies.  The first question I should like to address to the Minister for his consideration, not necessarily for immediate answer, is the following.  Having regard to the differing financial responsibilities of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, how is this committee to report?</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might make the point a little more specific.  After a long history the concept of the Committee of Public Acounts as we have it now evolved.  It is a committee that is a watchdog for Dáil Éireann in the matter of public expenditure.  However, there the matter is comparatively simple because it is the Dáil that has overwhelming responsibility for the national finances and expenditure.  It is sufficient to recall that the powers of the Upper House are extremely limited in this regard.  To all intents and purposes, anything in the nature of a Money Bill is the sole concern of this House.  From a practical point of view it is the Dáil that determines what is or is not included in a Money Bill and the policy of such a Bill. Through that provision in our Constitution it is the Dáil which controls unequivocally the public finances and administration.</P>
    <P>In this instance we are bringing in the Seanad because we are having a Joint Committee of Oireachtas Éireann.  However, the area of responsibility and action of the committee lies almost entirely within the ambit of the financial power and responsibility of this House.  Therefore, to that extent, I raise the question as to where and how the reporting to the committee will take place.</P>
    <P>I am not to be taken as being over jealous of the prerogatives of this House as against the Upper House or in any way belittling the contribution the Seanad can make.  From a general point of view the inclusion of Senators on the committee is much to be welcomed.  It is one of the sad facts of modern life that sometimes the standard of debate, the thoughts <Col N="346" /> expressed and the criticisms offered in the Seanad, to put it conservatively, compare very favourably with those offered in this House.  However, because that House does not have the responsibility of the Dáil, unfortunately these contributions often do not receive the attention they merit or require. For that reason I most emphatically welcome the participation of the Upper House in the committee and there is no need to expand on the reasons.  They will be apparent to anyone who knows anything about the functioning of the Oireachtas in recent times.  Nevertheless it leaves me with the practical point as to where the committee will report and the efficacy of its reporting.</P>
    <P>I may be told that it will report to both Houses.  Well and good, but if that is so where is the responsibility to act?  To co-ordinate the two Houses at that level would require time and one might as well say that the reports of the committee will be laid before the House.  We are all aware that the device of laying reports or other matters before the House is equivalent to a funeral rite.  They are laid there and buried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the multitude of the dead in that cemetery are too often forgotten when they deserve to be remembered.  I should like to quote from a well-known book, <i>The Control of Public Expenditure</i> by Chubb, where he remarked that a committee&mdash;actually the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash; went a long way towards ensuring that notice was taken of its recommendations. He stated on page 40:</P>
      <P>This was the more necessary since the House itself, as Lord Robert Montague said, was and is &ldquo;a deaf adder&rdquo; which &ldquo;stoppeth her ears, charm the Committees never so wisely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question of to whom the committee reports and its mechanism of reporting are of great importance. I shall probably have to advert to this point again when I deal with the broader aspect of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> The second point is: is it a standing committee?  Will it be a committee to be set up, as in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, that will be a standing committee and/or Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that the selection committee or whatever agency is involved will nominate from Dáil to Dáil or from Oireachtas to Oireachtas?  Of course, if it is a Joint Committee, it involves the two Houses.  Taking the words of the motion, I commend to the Minister the consideration of whether it is a standing committee or an experimental committee and to whom it reports.  I shall deal with some of the implications of that later.</P>
    <P>In the evolution of some of these committees that have made parliament a practical instrument for the control of administration and for the implementation of policy in the past, an eventual solution has usually been arrived at after some experimentation. Take the history of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was considerable experimentation before that committee was set up about 1860, which was perfected by the mechanisms introduced in the Act of 1866.  I wonder whether this committee the Minister is setting up will prove itself to be the solution of the problem obtaining or whether it will appear as a tentative experiment which will need revision. That question cannot be answered by the Minister or by anybody else at this stage.  But it is well to bear in mind that the possibility exists.</P>
    <P>Of course, I speak on the assumption that something serious is intended here, that this is not merely going to be a gesture, a move to placate a growing demand or, yet again, something to complement the demands of the Committee of Public Accounts in a very narrow sense and, worst of all I hope, will be anything but a soap-box institution that will degenerate into a grouse shop or something that will introduce friction into the machinery rather than constructive work.  I am assuming that in modern circumstances we are aiming at adding to the machinery of parliamentary control an <Col N="348" /> agency that will work harmoniously with and complement the Administration and the bodies concerned thereby making the implementation of parliamentary policy a reality as well as parliamentary control.</P>
    <P>I am assuming that our purpose is serious.  In that assumption I am necessarily warning against a possible perversion or degeneration on the one hand and, on the other, raising the question at this stage&mdash;because this is all that can be done&mdash;about its actual working.</P>
    <P>Once the committee is set up&mdash;and I made it quite clear that I had absolutely no objection to the inclusion of the Upper House&mdash;I raise the question of its joint nature specifically in relation to the financial and administrative responsibilities of this House.  Assuming this committee will have power, clear-cut directions and people to whom to report, I come briefly to a matter which is the subject of one of our amendments, the question of who should be the chairman. I know there are two points of view on this.  If the committee is to be a serious effort, the task of its chairman seems to me to be so intimidating that any thinking Deputy or Senator would seek to have the chalice passed rather than accept it, as it will be a task of extreme responsibility calling for considerable initiative, imagination and understanding of democratic parliamentary functioning historically and in the context of the present day. Be that as it may, I still want to point out to the Minister that there is a strong case for having the Chairman taken from the other side of the House.  As other Deputies have pointed out, it would be short-sighted for any Government to take the view that merely because they are a Government it should be a Government appointment because Governments do not last forever no matter how long.  Therefore, it is always a safe rule to do the wise and the proper thing.  It pays all parties best in the end.</P>
    <P>We are conversant with three types of committees, Special Committees, Select Committees and Joint Committees. The Dáil, in its Standing <Col N="349" /> Orders, is particularly concerned with Select and Special Committees.  In the case of these committees normally the direction is that they will simply elect one of their members chairman.  I shall read Standing Order No. 69:</P>
    <P>Every Select or Special Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>There is no specification whatever as to where that chairman comes from. Standing Order No. 70 envisages that a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary may be members of these committees and provides therefore.  Therefore, in the case of ordinary committees of this House and, indeed, of Joint Committees also, the election of a chairman is open and members of the Government are not precluded; in fact, they very frequently sit on them.  Then the normal majority practice operates.  If the Government so choose, they can always by virtue of their majority in selection or otherwise appoint sufficient members of the committee to ensure that it will be a government member who is chairman.  In many cases in these committees that is what happens, although it is usually agreed by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>However, there is one significant exception to that situation, that is, the Committee of Public Accounts.  That committee is provided for in paragraph 126 of our Standing Orders.  The Standing Order defines the duties of the committee and states that no member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary can be a member of it.  This is in marked contrast to the provision of the Select and Special Committees.  There is a very significant addition in this Standing Order stating that the Committee of Public Accounts shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders Nos. 66 and 69 so as to be impartially representative of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts is on the same footing as any other committee but no member of the Government, a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary, can be a member of <Col N="350" /> it.  There is also a specific direction in Standing Order No. 126 about impartiality. Those semi-State bodies, everyone of which is in receipt of public moneys or set up and established with public aid, are the offspring of some Minister in his corporate capacity.  They are children of the various Departments, to which they are attached.  We have developed a device, as I pointed out the last day, which could hardly be better for preventing Parliament inquiring into the expenditure of the public moneys concerned or the administration of those bodies.  We find, because of that development that the Minister does not answer in any capacity and the matter does not come to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his corporate capacity and his Department have responsibility for the different semi-State bodies set up by him, and through him the Government have executive responsibility for them and they have a majority in the House.  What does all this add up to?  The Government have an interest in what such a committee, as we are contemplating, report. They have a partisan interest in the matter.  If the Government are the dominating factor in this committee, they are being asked to judge themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not believe anyone will deny that the convention that the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts is a Member of the Opposition has not worked well.  I have the honour of holding that position at the moment on the Appropriation Accounts that are currently being examined by the committee.  Many chairmen of different parties have held that post and there have been no complaints.  The Committee of Public Accounts have been nominated and functioned as they were intended to function.  I do not remember any serious cases where the committee were in conflict with the Executive.  In the famous case of the Department of Justice some years ago, no conflict developed with the Executive.  The rights of the committee and of the Comptroller and Auditor General were fully conceded. If we apply that principle here there is a very strong case for developing the <Col N="351" /> same sort of convention that the chairman of this committee, who will have a very onerous task and a very demanding one in the case of the first chairman, should be selected from the Opposition of the day.  The executive of the day and the administration of those bodies will be reviewed by the committee.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge on the Minister, in a completely impartial attitude, to appoint the chairman from the Opposition the same as applies in relation to the Committee of Public Accounts. I am not urging this from any narrow sense of sitting on these benches.  I hope I should take the same attitude if I was sitting on the other side.  I mentioned the Committee of Public Accounts to try to show the type of principle involved.  Suppose there is a difference between the Seanad and the Dáil as to whether or not a Bill is a Money Bill and there is an appeal from the Ceann Comhairle's decision, an impartial chairman is provided there.  I could multiply precedents.  I would not like to have the matter dismissed without very serious thought given to what the consequences of partiality might be.  We all want to make this committee a real success.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;we all&rdquo; I mean not only the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas but those involved in the administration of the Departments and semi-State bodies.  We neither want to see a monstrosity nor a futility.  I fear that if such a body is set up without careful thought and planning we would produce one or the other.  If it is a monstrosity it will do damage and make it impossible for the State bodies to discharge their functions, apart from the difficulties it will cause the Minister and his Department. If it is a futility it will become a meaningless time waster and a costly bit of friction into the machine One hopes, therefore, that a realistic solution in the context of the day will come about.  I stress that because there are other things that need attention in this regard also.  If it is to be a success the first requirement is impartiality and a spirit of co-operation.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned before, there are <Col N="352" /> essentially a number of parts to this mechanism if it is to function practically. It is not sufficient to say that we will set up a committee, that it will inquire and we will give it a roving commission.  The precursors of the Committee of Public Accounts in the early years of the last century are sufficient warning as to what that can lead to.  It can lead to either wasteful effort and friction or to a waste of time.  Therefore, if this committee can have, first, its own status as an impartial and responsible body, then a number of other things are necessary to make its work effective.  Again, I should like to draw an analogy with the Committee of Public Accounts. That committee would have gone the way of its predecessors had it not been for the fact that eventually a tripartite structure was evolved which proved the proper instrument for the task that depended essentially on the committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General established by the Act of 1866 and, not least, the wholehearted co-operation of the Treasury which, in modern terms, would be the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The committee without the Comptroller and Auditor General, and his powers, would have been a body without senses.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was its eyes, its ears and its information.  On the other hand, if the committee had the Comptroller and Auditor General it would have been powerless unless there was some way that its recommendations and, on occasions, its strictures and commendations were taken account of.  This was supplied by the Treasury. In short, the Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent person with powers necessary to the committee. Otherwise, the committee would have lacked its information and the knowledge necessary to function.  On the other hand, if the committee had not some influence and power the Comptroller and Auditor General's task might have degenerated into a futility. The committee reacted by being the encouragement, the support and the means by which the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General were made effective, whether remedial or otherwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> There was interaction between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee but&mdash;this must not be lost sight of&mdash;all that would have been nugatary were it not for the co-operation of the Treasury.  The Treasury saw in the committee an instrument that would inform it, co-ordinate it with Parliament and help it perform its supervisory functions.  The enthusiastic co-operation of these three agencies made the Committee of Public Accounts an effective instrument of public control up to the present.  In the formation of the State those institutions were continued and have been very effective.  It is no harm for Deputies and the public to realise that far from being an inquisition to which the Department of Finance is subject the Committee of Public Accounts is a body which represents this Parliament, which secures from and gives to the Minister's Department the greatest co-operation in its very important supervisory functions.  The secret of the effect of the Committee is that with these three agencies, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Finance and the committee, the matter is co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>Although nobody likes to be subjected to scrutiny I believe even the accounting officers explicitly find that the system is a great support for them. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was chairman of that committee on more than one occasion when its deliberations were important.  The late Deputy Hogan featured in a debate that came to the House where this machinery was vindicated and adopted by the House as a whole.</P>
    <P>With all that in mind I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the question of a convention in regard to the chairman.  If the chairman is to be a member from the Government side, he cannot help but have an interest in the Executive.  He is prejudiced immediately by the very fact that in the lobby and in his thinking he must support the Government.  As I pointed out on the adjournment last June, as reported in Volume 291 of the Official Report, in administrative terms the Government are pretty much in the hands of the Departments.  The <Col N="354" /> Government supporting Deputy, that is, the Deputy who is committed to being a supporter of the Government in the lobby, is immediately prejudiced in occupying the Chair because matters affecting the administration of the day can easily arise, and have arisen.</P>
    <P>To put the other side of the coin which may seem slightly contradictory, Governments do not last forever.  It may well be that the chairman who is examining the reports of one year may have changed sides in the House in the meantime.  As in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, if one pursues that argument, I do not think one finds anything to invalidate the general submission I have made.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised some things overmuch perhaps, and they are repetitions of what I said the last day.  The first is consideration of what the joint nature of the committee means when it comes to implementation and action, and to whom it relates in its final reports, especially with regard to time lags. The second is the necessity for this being a committee which will cooperate with the interests involved, and which will be supported by an administrative structure which will makes it effective, as in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts. The third is that the chairman should preferably be selected from the Opposition of the day.</P>
    <P>At the risk of being tedious I should like to place on the record of the House some of the reasons why this committee is necessary.  It is not enough to say people are dissatisfied with the way these bodies are accounting, or want to know more about them.  Everyone is agreed that, by and large, a high standard of administration and performance has been displayed by these State-sponsored bodies. No one has suggested that the bringing in of a motion of this nature is to be construed in any way as a reflection on them.  It is not sufficient to say people are clamouring for information out of curiosity and, therefore, we should go to all the trouble we are taking in this House.  There is a more vital reason why the committee is necessary.</P>
    <P>To summarise it briefly I can put it <Col N="355" /> this way.  Unless the <i>lacuna</i> in the development of the State-sponsored bodies is properly filled the parliamentary control of public expenditure and the power of this House to exercise its constitutional function in this regard will be completely defeated.  There is a gap which means that, having regard to the extent of the activities of the State-sponsored bodies and the amount of money involved, and more especially their interlinking with the Departments of State which are accounted for in the Book of Estimates and the Appropriation Accounts, unless the gap is filled it will become impossible to make complete the annual accounts which come before this House as the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
    <P>The way is becoming open for practices which could properly be called degenerate, if not something worse.  I say this in the full knowledge that all this can happen with the best of intentions and with motives of the highest integrity.  This is the frightening thing about it.  If you destroy the power of Parliament and bring in degeneracy of this nature, no matter for what high motives and justification of expediency, and no matter how perfect the integrity, in the end a disintegration of the system is accomplished and brings something else in its place more effectively than positive corruption could do.  With that thought in mind I can see the necessity for setting up this committee arises from the necessity to account completely for all public expenditure and to control democratically in its entirety, by whatever mechanism the day demands, the administration and expenditure of the State.  That thought more than anything else makes me feel this committee is a necessity.  As I said earlier, I wonder will it be a final solution or will it be an experiment.</P>
    <P>At the risk of taking some time I want to put certain points on the record.  To highlight the point I have just made in general, quite naturally the first real call for such a committee, and the first place where attention was drawn to the financial, accounting and administrative implications of the development of the concept of State <Col N="356" /> bodies, was at the Committee of Public Accounts.  In the past that committee found that its own information was incomplete.  It very quickly realised it could not get the information necessary to complete its picture and that furthermore ministerial responsibility was being evaded&mdash;and I say &ldquo;evaded&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;by the device of saying the Minister had no function in the matter because this House had technically hived off the responsibility to a body which was found to be no longer responsible to the House.  Therefore, it is very natural that the basic symptom should first have become apparent to the Committee of Public Accounts and that Committee should report.  I have here the 1966 Report of the Committee on the Appropriation Accounts for 1964-65.  It is signed by yourself, Sir, as Chairman of that Committee: &ldquo;(Signed) DENIS F. JONES, Chairman.&rdquo; Paragraph 3 reads:</P>
    <P>The Committee notes that its suggestions that an amendment of the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann should be made to enable it to review the accounts of State-sponsored bodies which receive subventions from voted moneys is being considered in the light of the comments of the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>Since the Committee of Public Accounts was first set up over forty years ago there has been no amendment to its terms of reference, notwithstanding the creation through legislation and administrative action of a large number of quasi-independent bodies with responsibility for spending substantial amounts of public money.</P>
    <P>The present system of accountability for public expenditure has its origins in the last century when national budgets provided for the traditional services administered by Government departments accountable to parliament.  All this has changed, public spending has greatly increased, governments have entered the fields of social and economic development, new institutions have been created with extensive powers, but beyond an obligation <Col N="357" /> to present reports and accounts to the legislature, these new institutions are not subject to the disciplines of explanation and investigation imposed on the Accounting Officers of Government departments by the traditional system of accountability.</P>
    <P>Clearly the system needs to be revised and extended to match the changes that have taken place in the modern machinery of government. The Committee suggested in its report dated 12th November, 1964, that as a first step the accounts of certain bodies could be referred to it for examination.  Since that report it has consulted the Comptroller and Auditor General who expressed the view that accounts could only be a guide to financial control and public accountability. He considered them to be the starting off point for explanations and investigations without which public control is ineffective.  The complex issues involved had, he stated, been debated at length by other governments and international bodies and the United States of America, France and Western Germany had evolved solutions which appeared to him to be working satisfactorily. In the opinion of the Committee the time has come for a detailed study of this subject.  including the practices in other countries and it trusts that the Minister for Finance will agree and make arrangements accordingly.</P>
    <P>That report is dated 17th November, 1966, ten years ago.  In a report on the Appropriation Accounts for 1962-63 the matter was raised under the same chairman and it says:</P>
    <P>That the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann be amended so as to provide, where appropriate, for the reference to the Committee of Public Accounts of the audited accounts of bodies who received subventions from voted moneys.</P>
    <P>There was the problem making itself felt over ten years ago with the Committee of Public Accounts, but nothing happened.  Now I come to the report on the Appropriation Accounts for 1968-69, the late Deputy Hogan being <Col N="358" /> the chairman of the committee.  On page 7 of the final report it says:</P>
    <P>3.  The question of making available to the Committee the audited accounts of bodies which receive subventions from voted moneys has exercised the minds of the Committee for many years.  It notes the observation of the Minister that he is making a reassessment of the question of a parliamentary review of the accounts of State-sponsored bodies in the light of the recommendations in relation to these bodies in the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group.</P>
    <P>4.  In the course of evidence the Committee noted with appreciation that a number of Accounting Officers had as an act of courtesy made available for the information of the Committee the audited accounts of some State-sporsored bodies associated with their Departments. This was most helpful and, pending a solution to the problem adverted to in the previous paragraph, the Committee would like all Accountanting Officers to extend to it a similar courtesy in respect of accounts of bodies sponsored by their Departments.</P>
    <P>Here is an interesting situation, that a Committee of this sovereign Parliament is reduced to relying on the courtesy of the people who are to answer to it.  I do not think that is good for either party.  The next report is that on the Appropriation Accounts for 1969-70.  Again, it refers to State-sponsored bodies and their accountability. Paragraph 5 reads:</P>
    <P>...The Committee does not propose to repeat what it has said in previous reports on this subject. It considers that the need for urgent action should be obvious in the light of the ever-increasing share of voted moneys expended by these bodies.  Indeed it feels that its work is stultified to a large degree by the failure to make these State-sponsored bodies subject to public accountability.  It urges once more that an early decision be reached and it is pleased to note that the Committee On Reform of Dáil <Col N="359" /> Procedure in its Report dated 1 December, 1972 also stressed the need for an urgent decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 10 of the Report of the Appropriation Accounts, 1970-71, the committee commented on progress and made the following recommendations:</P>
    <P>The Committee notes that in formulating arrangements for reviews that consultation will take place with State-sponsored bodies and the Comptroller and Auditor General on the question of the feasibility and desirability of having accounts of all bodies to be reviewed audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>That raises the question of mechanism.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 9 of the Appropriation Accounts, 1971-72, the committee adverts to the matter again and urges an early decision.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 25 of the final report, on the control and issue of public moneys to State-sponsored bodies, the committee points out the need to ensure that public money is not issued from the Exchequer before it is required, or in larger sums than is required, for the service for which it is issued requires. You can see that the committee finds itself stultified, that there is an area beyond its control.  Then it begins to find that things which could properly be called abuses in the technical sense are creeping in.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 4 of the Report of the Appropriation Accounts, 1973-74, which is not yet available in print, the committee states:</P>
    <P>The Committee is of the opinion that these bodies should also be subject to continuous parliamentary review and that all State-sponsored bodies should be subject to closer scrutiny and control by Parliament and, in particular, by the Comptroller and Auditor General, when such is requested by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>You will see that over a period of ten years you have a responsible committee of this House finding itself defeated <Col N="360" /> in getting information which appeared to be necessary for its task, going so far as to say that its efforts were being stultified and then pointing out that things such as the non-surrender of funds or the over-demand of funds, which would be irregularities in the State departments, were probably happening where State-sponsored bodies were concerned.  The committee concluded that there was a real need to bring this area under parliamentary control.  Therefore, one will realise that the demand for such a committee as we are considering today is more than a popular cry or mere chagrin and not, so to speak, being told everything that somebody might like to know.  There is good reason for this.  What is raised is the question of parliamentary control of public moneys and public expenditure. We are here to ensure that that control is exercised.  With due regard to the practicalities and the demands of the moment, mechanisms and concepts that were practical at the end of the last century are no longer so. The very existence of these State bodies is an indication of the need for adjusting to the times.  Their very success is also an indication that, without adjusting to the times, matters become unreal.  In the broader sense, one of our main problems is that our financial procedures and controls have degenerated to an ineffective ritual in many respects, that is, real parliamentary control.</P>
    <P>The answer is not to go back to 1866 and put everything through on these lines.  That would be putting back the clock and would not be feasible. The answer is to find mechanisms that will work and that will make control of a democratic parliament effective in the modern sense through agencies, not of itself, as might have been visualised 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have a number of State-sponsored bodies.  They are presumably performing useful functions. They are, unfortunately, like Government itself, subject to a conflict which characterises all democratic communities, namely, the conflict between the economic and the social, the conflict between the requirements of social justice and the realities of <Col N="361" /> economics.  These bodies are afflicted by this dilemma.  One of the traps I foresee for this committee is that its members may be over-obsessed by either of those two approaches&mdash;the severely economic one or the idealistic one.  To approach the type of problem that we are contemplating from such doctrinaire points of view would be fatal.</P>
    <P>Although we have lumped them all together we must realise that State-sponsored bodies are varied and have limited functions.  We must recognise the problems of each one of them and see how we can help them to be efficient and effective.  If the House can set up a mechanism whereby these State bodies are efficient and effective, then. the House is exercising its power in an efficient manner.  No matter what machinery is set up, there is a chain of organisation and the loss or gain at the end will depend very much on the functioning of the various links in the chain.  Let us not think that these bodies will depend on their own efficiency and that their efficiency will be ours.  We will have to depend on their control over expenditure in the last analysis.  The Department above them, the Department of Finance, and this committee are supervisory elements in the chain, but you cannot get away from the fact that the functioning organism, economic and social, is the State-sponsored body itself.  We must bring in the accountability of these State-sponsored bodies for public money received and spent and for public profit derived from them, such as payments from them into the Exchequer in any shape or form.  We should ensure that these bodies have to appear in the same way as accounting officers do before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Finance are needed by the Committee of Public Accounts.  So too this new Committee will need new structures that will afford the same kind of information, reports and advice that the Comptroller and Auditor General gives to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Unfortunately, nobody seems to have thought about this <Col N="362" /> specifically.  How will that be done? It is provided for generally in the motion but when it comes down to brass tacks how can this be achieved? What Department or agency, like the Department of Finance in relation to the Public Accounts Committee, will be there in close co-operation with the committee and will be able to implement its function, which is to make Oireachtas control a reality?  In the Committee of Public Accounts the Department of Finance have a supervisory role over all accounting officers. No such organ has been defined for the State-sponsored bodies whose activities are very varied.  If this committee is to function not only will it require the arm to afford it its information and enable it to function in a semi-judicial manner, but it will also require something in the nature of an executive arm.  How is that to be found?</P>
    <P>In this modern age, particularly where trading bodies are concerned, I find this a very difficult problem. Even in the analogous case the Department of Finance have divided into two Departments, the original Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service.  That in the long run may involve complications for the control of public accounting.  The case of the State-sponsored bodies is infinitely worse because their activities are so many and varied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy agree that we have reached a point where public administration and public economic policy is in collision and the various Departments of State are in collision for order of priority in the pipeline for discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a little wider than I intended to go.  There are quite enough complications in the area that I am dealing with at the moment without going any further, but it goes back to the essential point that this should be an operation of mutual understanding and co-operation if it is to be a success.  From the very start all suggestions of an inquisition or a prosecution or anything similar should be ignored.  The desire must be to make the State-sponsored bodies <Col N="363" /> work and to give them every help. In the case of trading bodies there are great difficulties in regard to competition and confidentiality, but I will not have time to deal with them in any way.</P>
      <P>There is the overall question of recognising their role, of making them more efficient and of integrating them into an efficient scheme of public administration and activity.  To that extent the agencies of the State, from the Government down, are involved. The task is to achieve the co-operation of all concerned.  That point cannot be stressed strongly enough.  On the other hand, there are those who will say that there is no need for any such committee, that State bodies should be allowed to continue to function as they are.  That view must be refuted because its logic is that taxpayers' money be paid out without there being any accountability to the taxpayers. We here are the representatives of the tax-payers.  We authorise the Minister, through this House, to collect these taxes on which the semi-State bodies rely for revenue. Consequently, it is not good enough to say that these bodies should not be responsible for accountability.  In principle and in justice there must be accountability.  This is important, too, from the point of view of the efficiency of the various semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can relate many instances of meeting businessmen in the private sector who are finding it very difficult to make even enough profit to keep their businesses in existence but who will look ruefully at a State-sponsored body who can make up a deficiency by the Minister's moving a Supplementary Estimate here.  I recall one such occasion in particular and of hearing a businessman talk to an executive of one of these bodies who gave the impression that the problems facing him were easy of solution.  The businessman did not agree entirely and it transpired, ironically that the very next day the relevant Minister introduced a Supplementary Estimate in aid of the semi-State body concerned.  That was some time ago but it shows what <Col N="364" /> happens in the absence of integrated responsibility, regardless of how well-intentioned everybody concerned may</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that people in the public sector are irresponsible but I am making the point that their attitude is very different from the attitude of the man who must go it alone.  In the case of the public sector it is a question of being able to go back to father for a loan.  From that point of view also there is a real necessity for having this matter put right.</P>
    <P>In the few moments remaining before Question Time I should like to advert to a couple of other matters.  I cannot see why one set of State bodies, taking the Minister's criteria of commercial transactions, should be subject to this committee and another set not so subject.  Possibly, though, it is understandable that the Minister would set up a committee for this purpose and with the restrictions envisaged but only if he provided also for the answering to Parliament for those State-sponsored bodies that are being excluded.  If we go through with this motion as it is, the State bodies indicated in this Schedule will be under the scrutiny of the committee and, presumably and hopefully, brought under Parliamentary control while another set of State-sponsored bodies will remain unanswerable to this House.  That situation will not meet the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a situation that leaves matters almost as bad as they have been and, furthermore, it introduces the possibility of any body being put into or taken out of a trading or non-trading category to suit the conveniences of the Minister or of the administration.  We could accept the situation as proposed if the Minister were to undertake the same extent of responsibility in regard to answering for what might be called the reserve State bodies or the non-trading ones and say that they be treated as State Departments or as State activities and be brought within the ambit of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  But there is difficulty in regard to his leaving one set apart and embracing the other set.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> Those semi-State bodies that can be referred to as trading ones are those most likely to cause difficulties from the point of view of confidentiality and competition.  This factor has been adverted to already but it is something that constitutes a very real problem and one in respect of which I have the greatest sympathy with the fears and anxieties of those executives in the semi-State bodies who are responsible for the success of their trading activities.  This raises the whole question of our second amendment which seeks to include the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To expand on the question of the desirability of including policy within the purview of the committee one must ask what exactly is meant by policy. Sometimes this word is spelled with a small &ldquo;P&rdquo;, sometimes with a big &ldquo;P&rdquo; but whatever is meant by it it will probably have to be explicit in the context in which we are speaking.  It would probably be going too far to embark on this question now.</P>
    <P>I would recap by asking the Minister again to consider the implications, from the point of view of reporting, of the committee being a joint venture. Would he give sympathetic thought to the pleas to have as chairman somebody from the Opposition of the day and would he give particular attention to the supporting mechanism that will be necessary and on which I have expanded at some length by analogy with the supporting mechanism of the Comptroller and Auditor General with the Department and with the Committee of Public Accounts?</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the dilapidated appearance of the camp at Lahinch?  It has become very bad over the years.  Some time ago the regular Army at Limerick went on rest camp there in addition to a training camp for the FCA.  It was an ideal centre. The invigorating health breezes from the Atlantic are very good for soldiers who need a rest.  I should like to bring to the notice&mdash;not from a military point of view&mdash;of the GOC of the Southern Command that the Lahinch camp is an ideal situation for young soldiers in training.  There is the seaside and the golf course and in addition to the major golf course there is a training golf course as well as beautiful pitches on which to play games and beautiful Clare girls to dance with at night.  It is a highly entertaining centre.  I think this centre should be developed or redeveloped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many building society mortgage holders are either redundant or on short time due to the failure of the Coalition economic policy and that many other mortgage holders <Col N="369" /> have not received any increase in income in past years due to circumstances of their employment and, in view of the enormous hardship which the increases will impose on such families, will he not agree that the State has a responsibility to help them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  The amount is not enormous.  The additional costs arising from an increase in the rates from 11.85 per cent to 13.95 is about £1.50 per month for each £1,000 borrowed.  Allowing for tax reliefs where this applies the net extra payment would be only about 97p per £1,000 borrowed per month and, in present circumstances, I do not see any hope in giving a subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to appreciate the situation. Is he aware of the escalating cost of living and the rapidly increasing inflation rate?  Does he not agree that in such circumstances it is vitally important that the mortgage holders who are at present living a hand-to-mouth existence should be assisted? Surely an increase of this magnitude, which was an increase of over 2 per cent, is an enormous burden on people who are presently just able to exist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of local authority areas in which the recent change in housing subsidy arrangements will give rise to rate increases of any appreciable magnitude is very small. Indeed, in many areas in which the local authority have maintained a reasonable and responsible attitude towards expenditure on the maintenance and management of their housing estates, substantial reductions <Col N="371" /> in the anticipated rates estimates for 1977 have resulted from the revision in the subsidy system.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of finance for the coming year, I would point out that in 1977, local authorities generally can use all rents, miscellaneous receipts, and 60 per cent of the proceeds of sales of their rented housing operations for the purpose of maintaining and managing their housing estates.  Many local authorities have already welcomed this arrangement.  A detailed circular letter on the new subsidy arrangements will be issued to local authorities very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that by his action he has now broken about the only pre-election Coalition promise left unbroken?  Is he further aware of the severe hardship which this enormous increase in rates will impose on ratepayers, especially in Dublin city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy Faulkner like to talk about County Louth, Drogheda and Dundalk where there is no increase at all because they carried out the repairs in an orderly way?  I want to make one thing very clear. While the Opposition are making a lot of noise now about only 60 per cent being given, the average until last year was 50 per cent.  This year was the first year in which 75 per cent was allowed, so Deputy Faulkner has not his facts correct.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

When the county councils were striking the rates they assumed this would be a Government responsibility as it had been last year.  They did not include in the estimates any sum for the repairs of these houses and the maintenance of them, and they cannot carry on the purchase scheme unless they carry out repairs.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the rent paid to a local authority by a tenant on differential rent who was in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit of £29.40 per week prior to 17th September, 1976; and the rent paid to a local authority by a tenant on differential rent who became entitled to unemployment or disability benefit of £29.40 subsequent to 17th September, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to state the rent payable by any particular tenant under the current national differential rent scheme, in the absence of the required information about the tenant's family circumstances and the rent scale applicable to his house or flat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment or disability benefit of £29.40 per week would be payable to a married man with four dependent children.  If he was a tenant of a local authority house and in receipt of such benefit on 17th September, 1976, and continually after that date, the rent payable under the scheme would be £0.54 per week.  A tenant in similar circumstances who submitted <Col N="376" /> a new claim for unemployment or disability benefit after 17th September, 1976, and was entitled to £29.40 per week would pay a rent of £3.44 from the date of such claim.</P>
    <P>The disposable income of some tenants who now become unemployed is of the order of 85 per cent of their disposable income while employed, taking income tax, social welfare contributions, pay-related benefits, redundancy payments and differential rent into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that £29.40 is the income from unemployment or disability benefit for a man with a wife and four children to support?  Is he aware that the rent for such a person will now increase, according to the Minister's figures, by almost £3 per week, reducing his income to £26 per week?  In the frightening inflationary situation in which we are living does he regard his decision as being socially justifiable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was announced in the Minister's budget last year, but what Deputy Faulkner is missing out is that if this man was employed at, say, £35 per week he would not have as much of a disposable income as he has at present.  This was introduced because complaints were made that unemployed people were able to get more money than they would if they were employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister for Finance said is hardly relevant here. Is the Minister for Local Government aware that £29.50 is far below the minimum wage rates for the lowest paid workers and therefore the point he made here is irrelevant?  Is he further aware that in the case of a young single man applying for unemployment assistance his means are assessed at £14 a week?  The deciding officer of the Department of Social Welfare stated that this £14 per week derived from the benefit or privilege from board and lodgings in his father's home.  In such circumstances can the Minister justify a reduction to £26 in the total income of a family of six?</P>

      <P>Deputy Faulkner is talking about £29.40.  He is completely overlooking the fact that the man would be stamping a card and paying for his stamp.  He might be paying income tax and this he will not be paying if he is unemployed.  There were complaints from Deputy Faulkner's side of the House about people who were unemployed and able to have almost as much and sometimes more than they had when they were employed and at the same time paying a low rent.  This clarified the position. With effect from the 17th September, anyone who is signing unemployed will pay the rate mentioned here.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have received a letter dated 25th of June, 1976, from one of the businesses affected by the unreasonable attitude of the road engineers in Dublin County Council.  Is he aware that this slip road is on a blind corner and that there is not, as a minimum, a stop sign on this slip road?  Despite many efforts by myself, a number of councillors and the local people themselves to get Dublin County Council to change their minds and attitude in relation to this slipway, they remain intransigent.

      <P>On 28th June, 1976, Leitrim County Council informed the Department by letter that due to present commitments there was no spare capacity available from the Carrick-Mohill regional scheme stage one to cater for the group's daily requirements of 12,680 gallons.  A further letter dated 4th July, 1976, from Leitrim County Council indicated that the council proposed to deal with documented applications designed for group schemes, and specifically the Effernagh scheme, in chronological order if any water became available.  The Effernagh group were subsequently advised by the Department to think of an alternative source of supply but they have not succeeded in doing so.  They are unwilling to bore a well.  The group are still trying to get the permission of the council to connect to the Carrick-Mohill scheme but the council say they have not got the spare water.  I think it will have to be settled at local level before we can do anything further about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The only thing that seems to be wrong is that the council gave the group the impression that the water would be available.  They got the group to design a scheme for which they then said there was no water.

      <P>The question of the allocation of resources by the IDA is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I understand, however, that what the Deputy refers to does not involve a switch of resources as between one region of the country and another.  As regards the organisational arrangements for the Western Development Board, proposals are being developed with all possible urgency by my Department in consultation with the other Departments concerned.  Because of the complexity of the issues involved, the process has taken longer than originally anticipated but I hope to be in a position to have discussions with the interested parties on the establishment of the board initiated at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank has informed me that it is satisfied that the associated banks are operating the arrangements which were to apply on cessation of the bank strike and which were published extensively in the national daily newspapers in August and September last.  Those arrangements were made following detailed discussions between the Central Bank and the associated banks.  In the case of loans and overdrafts the balances at end-June were used as a basis for calculating interest up to 22 September (the delayed value date).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank and the associated banks were concerned to ensure that the arrangements would be such that not only would normal banking activity be resumed in the shortest possible time but also that they would have regard to equity as between different categories of customers and between customers and the banks.  As the system adopted tended to favour the drawer of cheques rather than the recipient and to penalise those customers whose borrowings were abnormally high when the bank strike commenced, the banks undertook to consider the abatement or foregoing of interest in cases where the customer considered that the position at end-June did not reflect the normal operation of the account.  Particular consideration was given to bridging loans, seasonal advances and term loans due for repayment during the strike where it was apparent that the customer had <Col N="392" /> funds to effect such payment.  I might add that interest on deposit accounts continued to accrue to the benefit of depositors during the banks closure and was calculated in the normal manner, and no fees were charged in respect of bank transactions from 29th June, 1976, the first day of closure, to 22nd September, the end of the delayed value dating system.  It is apparent that in all the circumstances the most equitable and feasible arrangements were made to arrive at a balance between creditors and debtors.</P>
    <P>If a customer is dissatisfied with the way his account has been treated, it is open to him to pursue the matter with his bank.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Kitt</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a statement on the grants available from the special regional development fund towards the cost of providing factory buildings in western and other underdeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the purpose of the special regional development fund is to promote, in its area of application, worthwhile economic projects which do not fall within the scope of other schemes of State aid.  Subject to this condition, assistance may be provided from the fund towards financing the cost of a factory building where the assistance is proposed by the County Development Team and recommended by the Central Development Committee.</P>
      <P>Two, more general, schemes have been introduced on the recommendation of the Central Development Committee, as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  the fund finances the purchase by local authorities of demountable factory buildings for temporary leasing to promoters who have been approved for a State grant and who wish to commence training or production before their permanent premises are ready for occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  under the pilot scheme which I announced on 8th November, grants <Col N="393" /> will be payable towards the provision of three small factory units in Castlebar and three in Carrick-on-Shannon for renting by the county councils to small firms whose establishment or expansion is hampered by unavailability of suitable accommodation.  If the scheme proves successful, I intend to extend it to the other counties in the fund's area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state the amount of grants involved and the size of the buildings that would qualify for these grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The size of each set of three buildings in the arrangements to which I referred on the 8th November will be roughly 3,000 square feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>And the amount of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figure for money immediately available but it will be such as is necessary to build two sets of 3,000 square feet each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be a party to the operation.  As the Deputy knows, the County Development Teams are teams which organise different agencies so as to reduce the amount of red tape or delays that might otherwise be involved.  To that extent, yes, they will be involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for tabling the parliamentary question which enables my statement <Col N="394" /> of 8th November to get fresh publicity. As I think Deputies know, the County Development Teams are very active in bringing available schemes to the notice of entrepreneurs but I would welcome any additional assistance people might wish to give to publication of these schemes.  I feel certain they will be fully used and that this initial project will expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any particular reason for deciding on three units in one place rather than spreading the units around?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is because the County Development Team see merit in bringing a number of industrial projects together rather than scattering them.  There is comfort sometimes and benefits flowing from combined activities.  Of course, the fact that two towns received three units apiece at the beginning will probably lead to the possibility that some other towns will be chosen for future projects of a similar kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order.  I want to deal with other questions.  A very brief question.  We have dwelt a long time on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not strange that no town in the north eastern region, which has had the greatest job loss outside of Dublin, according to the recent IDA report, was selected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole regional development fund scheme operates with the advice of the county development teams and the central development committee.  They undoubtedly bear in mind what are the claims of individual areas and the facilities available in individual areas.  I will bring to their attention the remarks of the Deputy so that, if a further area is to be chosen, what he has to say about the <Col N="395" /> north eastern region will be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that such an area should have been chosen, where there is such a great job loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider job loss to be an element to be borne in mind. That is one of the reasons why, as I said earlier, the eastern region is receiving the help of the IDA, which it did not receive previously, because of the very heavy job losses in that region recently.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. J. O'Leary</b> asked the Minister for Finance the criteria used by him in deciding the types of investments that are trustee securities under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The investments in which trustees may invest trust funds, unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust, are listed in Section 1 of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958.</P>
      <P>Under the Act the Minister for Finance may, by order, vary the list of authorised investments by addition or deletion.  Every such order must be approved in draft by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  In assessing the suitability of an investment for addition to the list regard is had to the security of the investment and its ability to provide an appropriate return to the beneficiary.</P>
      <P>The Act requires me to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order to vary the list of authorised instruments:&mdash;a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the President of the Stock Exchange.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the legislation is through, the question of granting trustee status to building societies will be activated.  We have already indicated to building societies the criteria they will have to fulfil to qualify for trustee status.  I expect that most of the building societies will be in a position to qualify for such status.  When they qualify, such status will be conferred on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because it would be a matter, once the legislation is through, for the building societies to furnish the evidence on which an assessment can be made whether or not they fulfil the criteria which, I understand, are generally acceptable. There should not therefore be any undue delay.  Any reputable societies should be able very quickly to obtain the necessary recognition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the measures that are contemplated to minimise the tax burden by eliminating circular transfers as indicated in the Government's Green Paper <i>Economic and Social Development</i> 1976-1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Circular transfers arise when households contribute through general taxation for services or payments of which they themselves are largely the beneficiaries.  The rationalisation of existing transfers with the objective of easing the tax burden while at the same time adequately protecting the disadvantaged is obviously an involved process affecting different interests in varying ways.  It was for that reason that the Government's Green Paper proposed the question for discussion with the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the discussions which the Government had with the social partners <Col N="397" /> subsequent to the publication of the Green Paper necessarily concentrated upon issues having immediate impact upon taxation, expenditure and incomes levels in the short term it has not yet been possible to commence with the social partners the thorough examination visualised in the Green Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the paragraph in the Green Paper which is headed: &ldquo;Measures to Minimise the Tax Burden by Eliminating Circular Transfers&rdquo; was agreed to by all Ministers, including the Tánaiste and his Labour Party colleagues in the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as a matter which was discussed with the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Green Paper does not refer to those matters being matters for discussion with the social partners but rather as measures which might be taken to achieve the objective he has referred to in his original reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at the two pages previous to the one on which the paragraph he refers to is, he will observe that they are issues which the Government consider proper for discussion with the social partners. I do not have a copy of the Green Paper with me but I believe he will see it at the foot of one of the two pages before the one which contains the other paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can help the Minister because I have it in front of me.  It all comes under a general heading of &ldquo;Outline of Proposals to Stimulate Economic Growth&rdquo;.  Is it proposed, in an examination of those measures, to include as matters for examination the agricultural grants, school transport, disability benefit and children's allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All matters in which people receive payment and which they contribute towards the cost would fall for consideration in this area.  In so far as all taxpayers are contributing towards schemes which are provided <Col N="398" /> by the State it would be appropriate that they would consider such schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not so. The talks with the social partners will undoubtedly continue between the Government and the social partners for a long time to come on many issues affecting the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will examine them and will be anxious to stimulate discussion and a positive response from people so that we may operate public finances in the country to the best advantage of the people themselves, which I have no doubt many sane people want to bring about.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that separate figures for each of the several categories of rateable hereditaments, including new houses, which are dealt with each year are not recorded, as such statistics are not required for any official purpose by that office.  The total number of cases listed for revision of valuation by the various local authorities in each of the years 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976 was 66,492; 112,509 (this represents an 18-month period arising out of the change of the financial year); 72,040 and 77,837 respectively, making a grand total of 328,878 cases for the four-year period.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, because of the savage revaluations that have taken place in certain areas on business premises and private residences, this is an undue burden to be placing on the ratepayers in view of the fact that at the same time as the revaluation is taking place the rate in the £ has been increasing dramatically?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I am so informed. The valuation office receive lists from the local authorities in accordance with law and they make their decisions accordingly.  They have records of the number of valuations made by them but not of the number of premises to which they attach.  For instance, in relation to new houses the submission made to local authorities can frequently be to put valuations on &ldquo;X&rdquo; number of houses of a certain type on &ldquo;Y&rdquo; plot of land.  The determinations are made in that way, but there is no separate account kept in the valuation office of new as distinct from old dwellings.</P>

    <Title>Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>(1)  That it is expedient that a Joint Committee consisting of 7 members of the Dáil and 4 members of the Seanad (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary) be appointed to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities (being the State-sponsored bodies referred to in the Schedule hereto), and to report thereon to both House of the Oireachtas and make recommendations where appropriate.</P>
    <P>(2)  That, after consultation with the Joint Committee, the Minister for the Public Service with the agreement of the Minister for Finance may include from time to time the names of further State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities in the Schedule, or delete from the Schedule the names of any bodies which he considers no longer to be State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was adverting to the question of policy, the inclusion of review of policy in the work of this committee. That is an arguable question.  In the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, policy considerations are excluded and a lot of the efficiency of the committee results from that fact in that distracting excursions into that rather vague area are avoided. Policy is clearly defined and the committee can function.  We have a slightly different situation here.  Unless policy is defined, accounts, reports and operational results cannot be easily assessed and interpreted.  Policy can have two meanings.  It can have the <Col N="409" /> usual meaning that is attached to it, capital &ldquo;P&rdquo;, or it can refer to administrative or business policy or the policy of the State body in regard to its priorities.  Apparently this committee will merely lay its reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I consider inadequate.  For that reason I have asked the Minister to consider a more specific reporting.  If the committee cannot at least inquire into what is the governing policy and if the people who are answerable in these State bodies to the committee are not required to at least say what the policy is, then there may be a good deal of stultification.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; included, with the understanding that the functions of the committee would be mainly in the area of its functioning and accountability. Its policy beyond these limits is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas or the Government. Admittedly there is a grey area here, but if this mechanism is to be introduced in an attempt to regularise the responsibility of these State bodies to Parliament, then we have to provide for comment on policy.  I see no reason why we should not.</P>
      <P>Let us take a typical example and consider the case of CIE several years ago on the question of commercial policy.  Was the emphasis to be given to rail or road?  Admittedly, in its broader aspects, this would be laid down by the Executive and controlled by the Minister and the Executive but, in the implementation of that, there is surely room for comment.  It is precisely in this area that a committee can be useful.  Take the closing of the Harcourt Street line, for instance. This line was closed with what most people consider was indecent haste and, to this day, there are comments on the pity of it.  That might not have happened with the same precipitation if there had been a committee, and if that committee had power to comment on the implementation of policy in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not seek to make that committee the deciding factor but at least it would be a brake on the responsible parties, not only taking an action, but <Col N="410" /> taking it so precipitantly that it could not be reversed.  It is that kind of check on policy I would envisage here and, in the general nature of the committee being set up, I think it would be wiser to include the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; and see how it works.  If this committee merely considers social policies&mdash;I would not go as far as Deputy Halligan; I see a warning light in his approach to it&mdash; then it will solve its own problems very quickly.  I do not think anybody would be very worried about it.  If it interprets matters rationally and concentrates on accountability of public money and value for money's worth&mdash; because this is essentially what is involved here, as I see it&mdash;then the inclusion of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo;, while necessary to give scope, need not be a cause of apprehension.  For that reason, I support that amendment.</P>
    <P>Taking our amendments in order, I have already dealt with the question of the chairman.  That remark is sufficient to deal with the question of policy. Policy must be clear and defined, and a person answering to the committee should not be able to plead something was a matter of policy and therefore he could not answer.  That is not what happens at the Committee of Public Accounts.  Certainly, an accounting officer will plead that a matter is one of policy explained in order to put the question at issue in context, and this is very frequently done.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a long tradition behind it&mdash;110 years.  As Deputy Halligan pointed out this new committee is <i>sui generis</i> and it would be safer to add in the word.  That accounts for our second amendment.</P>
    <P>Our third amendment is in paragraph (2) to delete: &ldquo;or delete from the Schedule the names of any bodies which he considers no longer to be State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities&rdquo;.  If the Minister keeps one set of State-sponsored bodies which has in common with the other State-sponsored bodies that it is in receipt of a subvention from public funds and is spending the taxpayers' money, it should be equally responsible with the others.  If the Minister does not mend that situation by bringing accountability into <Col N="411" /> the regular course of answering in the Dáil by whatever mechanism, without casting aspersions on anyone, I fear the road is open to manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister discussed at some length what a State-sponsored body is.  The bodies are listed in a Schedule.  They are definite. He said that a general principle is being adopted that commercial bodies are those which derive the greater part of their current revenues from the sale of goods or services.  That is very vague.  It seems to me to open the door for removing a body from that category if things get too hot.  In other words, it is too definite and there is a temptation, possibly, for manoeuvre.  I do not see why that paragraph should be in the motion.  Why would the Minister want to delete one of the Bodies included already?  I do not mind him adding to the list, but why would he want to take some of them out of the Schedule?  They are a heterogeneous bunch when judged by that one criterion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment dealing with confidentiality we suggest the deletion of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;may, if it so decides.&rdquo;  Here we are getting at a serious problem for these bodies.  They are in a competitive business.  Ordinary business confidentiality, and particularly confidentiality about plans, may be very important, and may need care.  For instance, take an airline competing abroad.  Their plans for the future would have an element of confidentiality in them.  So would other bodies. Therefore, one can understand why this is being included.</P>
    <P>I wonder is paragraph (4) of the resolution really effective.  There are many confidential matters in the public service and confidentiality is preserved notwithstanding the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was the famous incident with the Department of Justice several years ago to which I referred already.  The rules were reiterated in Department of Finance minutes and circulars.  There has never been any real trouble about this.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, that Committee has been composed of <Col N="412" /> the most diverse elements from different parts of the House.  There has been no problem about confidentiality so far as I know.  I do not see why it should be a problem in regard to this committee, provided it functions in the way I postulated earlier.  I do not see why responsible Members of this House would not do so.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, how much good is that?  I could understand the Minister providing that confidential information would not be given to the committee, in which case the committee might as well go home before it starts.  If confidential information is to be given to the committee, all this does is prevent the committee putting it in a report and publishing it.  We all know how matters can be disseminated. Either it is genuinely confidential material where the confidence will be respected&mdash;and I would say that will be the vast majority of cases&mdash;or the confidentiality may be one of convenience for the executives concerned and there might be justification for publication and criticism.</P>
    <P>In that case what do you think will happen even if you have this?  If I am a member of this committee and I get that information, what is to stop me breaking this here in the House?  I have absolute privilege here.  I cannot be muzzled.  I make that point to show that this provision is to a certain extent unnecessary, and I am not so sure whether the better solution would not be to drop it altogether and to assume that people will act responsibly, as in most cases they will.  However, the inclusion of a provision like that will lead to friction and, in the last resort, it will be useless in the very case where somebody would want it to be effective. I would like the Minister to consider our amendment and his own drafting in that light&mdash;we are approaching this in a constructive way, I hope&mdash; and see whether the provision should be there at all.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4, prompts me to ask a question about technical specialists.  I am a little cynical about this.  There may be cases where it is necessary to call in a specialist consultant but the spectacle of this committee, with the State-sponsored bodies' technicians on <Col N="413" /> one side and commission technicians on the other side in a technical argument which the lay members of the committee could not be expected to understand, is a futile waste of time and money that I would prefer to avoid.  It is probably necessary to include such a provision, but it should not be the rule.</P>
    <P>Every one of these State bodies have their technical advisers and experts, and the approach of the committee should be fundamentally to rely on the executives and experts of these bodies rather than to bring in outsiders as a practice.  That is the way we function with the civil service and by and large it functions well.  The broader thinking of the committee is not dependent on technical details of this sort.</P>
    <P>In regard to the list of bodies here, the Comptroller and Auditor General audits some of these accounts.  For instance he audits accounts for Bord na Móna, Fóir Teoranta, the National Stud, Nítrigin Éireann and Radio Telefís Éireann; the others he does not. It seems to me that to impose the complete auditorial job on the Comptroller and Auditor General would be overloading him unless a very significant expression were made in his activities.  On the other hand, there is a very strong case why such a definite commercial activity as Aer Lingus and CIE should not be governed by the same rules as govern the State service, and there is a case for their own auditors in these instances.  Therefore, the question of auditors and the role the Comptroller and Auditor General plays in regard to public accounts and the corresponding role to be played by one agency or maybe several agencies <i>vis-à-vis</i> this committee need examination as well.  Certainly the Comptroller and Auditor General would not <i>simpliciter</i> be the answer.</P>
    <P>A great deal of thought will have to go into making this committee work. Its terms of reference are important, but its purpose should be made absolutely clear and its limitations defined. It may be that the first tentative effort of the first committee may require modification.  We should be prepared for that.  On the other hand, the hope would be that this committee would <Col N="414" /> do what it sets out to do, fill the gap in the accountability of the spenders of public money and accountability for public administration.  All this involves a structured organisation.  It is not like the old days when the House could appoint a committee and could do all the work within itself.  In the case of this committee there will be several tiers before it comes to this House at all.  The lowest tier will be the State-sponsored bodies; above them there will be the individual Departments to which they are responsible; above them again the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General as the controllers and dispensers of public money, the taxpayers' money. Quite possibly the Department of the Public Service would also have a role here, but I do not see it just at the moment.  On top of that there would be the committee itself, and then this House.</P>
    <P>There is a structure that seems to be taken more or less for granted in this motion, but at every level smooth-working machinery needs to be supplied which would not only do what we are setting out to do, to make these State bodies efficiently accountable for public moneys and for public activities, but would also co-ordinate them and make them part of an effective overall system of parliamentary control of public expenditure and administration.</P>
    <P>All these things can be said generally and perhaps that is our job here, to say them generally.  But these generalities will produce no fruit unless the detailed mechanisms are provided.  I would hope that in the setting up of the committee, the details of the terms of reference and so on would be worked out with greater precision than we have been able to visualise here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with some interest to Deputy de Valera's comments.  I have not heard all of them, but he has had considerable experience on the Committee of Public Accounts, which is a slightly different animal from what is contemplated by this motion.  The Committee of Public Accounts very often deals with <Col N="415" /> things very much after the events have occurred.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (1) of the motion reads:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a Joint Committee consisting of 7 members of the Dáil and 4 members of the Seanad (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary) be appointed to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities (being the State-sponsored bodies referred to in the Schedule hereto), and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas and make recommendations where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The last speaker referred to this paragraph and raised the question of the policy of State-sponsored bodies. We know that State-sponsored bodies are set up by statute.  In some cases it is evident that the statute does not give the Minister adequate powers to direct the policies of such bodies.  As the accounts and operations of these bodies are examined, it will become apparent that each one will have to be taken on its merits and structure. The committee will probably waste a good deal of time in their first few cases in researching their histories. The State bodies listed will have to be prepared to answer questions relating to their origins as operating entities.  The committee will probably ask for this information because of the wording of the motion.  This motion does not set any guidelines or standards by which the committee can assess the operations and accounts of these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the conflict between the commercial and social aspects of the performances of the State bodies.  That would be an easy problem, but I foresee bigger problems.  Time passes, and these concerns are involved in a commercial field.  It is the intention that the report of the committee will be, if I may use the word, neutral.  I do not mean that the report will not have teeth or criticism in it, but I hope <Col N="416" /> there will not be polarisation within the committee.  If there are disagreements, I hope they can be noted in an appendix as a minority view.</P>
    <P>I have been in the House since 1973 and have acted on nine committees in that time and as chairman of three select committees.  In some of those committees matters were put to votes and there was a political content in the decisions and in the manner of voting, sometimes an irrelevant political content.  I hope that we will not have the same atmosphere in this proposed committee.  If that were to be the case, it would defeat the purpose of the committee.  We are primarily concerned with the commercial and financial aspects of the State bodies concerned.  I am aware that the majority of the employees of these State bodies have long wanted a committee of this type.  They have naturally been the but of criticism, partly because they have not been accountable to anybody.  They have produced their annual reports and the Minister may give directives in regard to policy to the senior executives or boards of these bodies.  Owing to the rules of the House, parliamentary questions can only be asked in a limited fashion.  A tremendous feeling of frustration has been building up in regard to these bodies.  I do not believe this committee will satisfy this feeling of frustration, but it will at least go some distance towards relieving it. It will probably take a considerable time before the committee is recognised as an entity in the working of these bodies.  There is a committee of this type in the United Kingdom Parliament.  It reports on a number of select bodies.  I imagine that the committee's approach in dealing with the first six companies in the list would be a guideline to the other State bodies when it is their turn for examination.</P>
    <P>I must express concern as to whether the members of the committee will be properly qualified to deal with the technical matters that will arise for decision in the first year.  I wonder whether they will be qualified to make a decision in regard to contents of the report.  I foresee a slow teething stage <Col N="417" /> for this committee.  There are no guidelines or standards for the operation of the committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the meaning of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; and its inclusion in the terms of reference. I have referred to the constraints imposed on the Minister by the wording of the statutes.  Policy in this case may not be similar to the objects which are set out in an ordinary company's memorandum.  In State companies matters of policy can arise from day to day because of the heavy social implications in their operations.  The State bodies were established because private enterprise was not prepared to provide the structure or to do the work that the State bodies do.  That type of origin means a heavy social element.  I and, I am sure, many other people have read the thoughts of the late Deputy Seán Lemass in relation to State-sponsored bodies.  He said that the object should be to have progressive, modern business management with public accountability, that they should not show excessive caution because that might kill initiative and the flexibility of a trading concern. He said that if there was not public accountability there was a danger of an inlooking process setting in.  There would be a danger of being staff orientated.</P>
    <P>While the Government may not provide money directly to State bodies, they go guarantor.  We have had a recent example of this in dealing with Aer Lingus.  This is one of the processes whereby power is given to these State bodies to borrow money, but the ultimate person with whom the buck rests if something goes wrong is the Minister for Finance and the Government. In the long run the buck stops with the Deputies of this House who vote to give these powers to allow further borrowing or to give the Minister authority to go guarantor.  This is one of the things that worries the public.  They feel that there should be a running accountability, an interim check on the operation.  One does not need to be a lawyer or an accountant to know that accounts can be presented in a certain form.  It is not nice but it is a fact of life that <Col N="418" /> accounts do not disclose possible serious troubles within a concern.  We all read in the newspapers how very large companies have crashed in a comparatively short time because of a big change in the market conditions in which the company operated.  This committee will not be able to examine all that sort of thing, but at least senior executives who make decisions in State bodies will know that ultimately their work will come in for examination by this committee.</P>
    <P>I have adverted to whether a committee will be really competent to make the proper examination of a particular State body.  The Minister said and there is provision in the motion that experts within the public service could be made available and also that, if a certain situation should arise, outside experts could be consulted by the committee.  That is very necessary. Specialist services would probably deal with the explanation of accounts and with technical matters that may arise.  Not alone will we deal with accounts, but we will deal with matters like market expertise&mdash;and I do not see that coming from any Government Department because they are primarily administrators.  In that circumstance I can see an outside specialist being brought in and questioned about the market to explain what the general background should or should not have been.  I hope that the work of this committee will not be a question of examining the stable after the horse has bolted.  This will be one of the real dangers of failure on the part of this committee.</P>
    <P>We will have 27 State bodies to be reviewed by this committee.  The House sits on three days a week and I cannot see this committee sitting more than so many hours a week, if it does that.  I can see this committee laying an undue burden on back benchers, because this is the type of work that a Deputy cannot be absent from on a committee: he must keep up to date with the company that is being examined at the time.  It is no use being there for one meeting and not being there for a second, because any judgment that has to be given on the affairs of any company must be given as an overall view on <Col N="419" /> the information made available.  I suggest that when it goes before the House the report will show on what days certain members were present and on what days certain members were not present.  If members of a committee are prepared to work, they must work properly.  They will be in a position of trust.  They will have to examine the financial affairs and the overall running of a State body for which the public ultimately are paying.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right in putting the point in relation to confidentiality. I do not understand the reason for the amendment put forward by Deputy Colley to paragraph 3.  Paragraph 3 reads:</P>
    <P>That, if so requested by a trading or commercial State-sponsored body, the Joint Committee shall refrain from publishing confidential information regarding the body's activities and plans.</P>
    <P>and the amendment says &ldquo;may if it so desires&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I got a bit puzzled here.  I cannot quite follow what Deputy de Valera was dealing with in this, because he was supporting the amendment and at the same time saying that there is no real confidentiality before a committee of this sort.  I completely disagree with that.  I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the rule is that what is discussed within the four walls is confidential and the only thing that can come out of that committee is a report, if it feels fit to make a report.  That rule has, by and large, worked very well. Sometimes it takes time for new members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to understand the significance and the necessity for that rule.  Deputy Carter will bear me out on this as he is a long-standing member of that committee.  That committee works, and I think this will work also.</P>
    <P>As Deputies with a public duty it is in our interest to ensure that these public bodies work well and do not suffer from any undue handicap as a result of negligence or of a slip on the part of any of us.  We have adequate precedent for that.  While I <Col N="420" /> do not think it is written anywhere that the proceedings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are confidential, the confidentiality aspect is long established and it is a code that can be adopted in relation to the members of the committee we are talking about here.  I do not see why it should not be possible to devise a code of rules in relation to the managing of this committee.  If it is to be a paramount committee of the House it may be necessary to look at Standing Orders in order to make certain provisions for the committee.  It is a committee which is very much to be an arm of this House.  The report will not be made to any particular Minister or to the Government.  It will be made to the House as a whole in rather the same position as the committee dealing with the secondary legislation of the European Parliament. In the report advice is given to nobody apart from the Members of the House <i>in toto.</i> That is a good situation.  It is the sort of situation that the public require.  Up to now there has been a sense of frustration among the public in relation to public bodies to the extent that the public do not know what is going on in these institutions apart from what appears in the glossy yearly reports.  This situation can be of no benefit to the public bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>This committee will be a new experience for the House.  I suppose the nearest existing committee we have to it is the Committee of Public Accounts, the proceedings of which are confidential until the time of the production of the reports.  I do not know what are the hopes of the Minister in relation to this new committee.  In his opening speech he kept his remarks virtually to a minimum but said it is significant that the emphasis is on examining the general efficiency and effectiveness of the bodies rather than on attention to operational minutiae.  It is necessary to take that view in the first instance.  As time elapses one may have to add a further dimension to the work of the committee. I am thinking in terms of the financial sphere.  The various people who have written about State bodies have drawn attention to the question <Col N="421" /> of where the staff stand and of the finance involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think any useful purpose would be served by pointing out the fact that staff in State bodies are in a far more sheltered sphere of activity than those who are in the private sector. When this committee examine the affairs of State bodies I should imagine that this matter will be highlighted as comparisons are bounds to be made between technicians of the same grade and ability who are employed in State bodies and those employed in private enterprise.  We are living in a developing society of a mixed economy.  It may be that these State bodies will be entering more into the export field or into spheres allied closely to that area.  When that arises there will be much emphasis on the question of the viability and competitiveness of State bodies.  I wish the committee well.  Its setting up is long overdue because it is something that should have been in existence during the past 20 years.  It surprises me that up to now no one has taken the initiative in this regard but I compliment the Minister for the Public Service on grasping one more nettle in his career and I wish him luck in regard to it.</P>

      <P>We are all aware that for a long time past there is much competition among various Departments in their efforts to get their Estimates through the House.  We are aware, too, that on some occasions a large number of Estimates were not discussed at all in the House in the financial years concerned.  This is not a satisfactory situation.  While we are setting up this machinery for statutory corporation we should look also at this question of Estimates to ascertain whether by way of procedure we might make better plans for the future.  Those of us who have any experience here would be agreeable to an agreement such as that which obtains in the House of Commons whereby the Opposition have the choice of discussing Estimates which are deemed to be in respect of big-spending Departments.  If we had this option here it would enable us at least in alternate years to discuss the ramifications of the large-spending Departments. <Col N="422" /> I was a member of the committee set up about 1972 to study matters of procedure and I know that it is not very easy to separate administration from public economic policy. However, now that we have specific plans to deal with the affairs of semi-State companies, we should make an effort to make this distinction.</P>
      <P>For a long time both inside and outside this House it has been said that Minister present the spectacle of having no power in regard to semi-statutory corporations on matters even of minor policy.  What is policy, anyway? Does it not affect all facets of a business?  I have witnessed Ministers shunning the idea that they had any responsibility for any of the work of semi-State groups.  Deputy Esmonde referred to the question of responsibility. For a long time politicians have been much too timid in regard to accepting responsibility and retaining powers of decision in relation to these bodies.  Political parties have been falling over each other in their efforts to disentangle themselves from the responsibility of power in this regard. A politician must have power and must be seen to have power in this area.  Whether he exercises that power rightly or wrongly is a matter for the electorate.</P>
      <P>That is the check on this House. I think we&mdash;I am not referring to a particular party but to all parties&mdash; did not allow sufficient scope in the past to the politicians individually to determine that fact.  If a politician does something wrong there is a rigid way of dealing with him.  He is subject to public criticism; whatever he does is discussed in public at every fireside and over the meals.  That is the public safeguard in regard to his activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is large in scope and I think the debate could range fairly widely but let it be said at the outset that when the idea of founding semi-statutory corporations originated here we had in the civil service&mdash;and we should recognise this&mdash;men of integrity who were able to take over, despite the fact that they were supposed to be administrators and not businessmen, and administer the <Col N="423" /> affairs of those companies.  Let it also be recognised that this is no reflection on those men or on the personnel of the corporations concerned.  We should make that perfectly clear.  Any shortcomings, failings or other elements which could be deemed to hamper those companies would be our responsibility as politicians making up the personnel of this House.  That goes for Government and Opposition.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly pointed out, we have over 100 of those companies with assets in excess of £1,000 million and a turnover of £500 million.  This is enormous business and it is not generally recognised that when we went into Europe we were nearly the most socialised country&mdash;when we talk in terms of socialism and public ownership&mdash;becoming a member of that club.  Therefore, to this extent, we have fair experience of the failings and advantages of semi-statutory corporations. We should be able now to take this in easy stages and be able to separate the large spenders from the small spenders and see how a committee set up by this House is able to deal with this range of business.</P>
    <P>It is most unedifying to find social, economic and other administrative policies clashing on the floor of this House and we often have to go into recess without having fully discussed some of the affairs of the larger spending Departments of State.  We should take steps to clear the Order Paper and to see that in future this will not occur if we can possibly avoid it.  It is not easy to avoid; it is occurring in all Parliaments, but the general scope of semi-statutory corporations is growing as well as the scope of legislation dealing with other matters.  We would be doing a good day's work if we got rid of the unedifying spectacle of having Ministers partially but not wholly responsible for the working of those corporations. I would not be too squeamish and hesitant about whether confidentiality would be respected.  I believe confidentiality would be respected.  As Deputy Esmonde pointed out, it is respected on many other committees.  If it is not respected, the House has ways and means of dealing with that situation. <Col N="424" /> I would say that is only a small point in this whole matter.  I think it will be generally agreed that after nearly 35 years, since the first semi-State company was set up, we have fair experience of the workings of those companies.  To this extent we should be practised enough to be able to assess their performance and comment, if necessary, on their internal workings.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that we should recognise that in the first instance this House voted the money to found those companies and it would be wrong, I think, if we did not conclude on the floor of this House that this Chamber is best suited to make whatever arrangements are deemed necessary for the smooth and efficient running of the company and for whatever expansion of business they may engage in.  On the other hand, it could be and will be argued that if those companies present a balance sheet yearly this should be sufficient to satisfy this House as regards their operation.  In fact I do not think it is, but I shall not go too far into that aspect of the matter.  I believe it is preferable that in regard to the large spenders more information should often be forthcoming and should be forthcoming to whatever committee is set up to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Today we have large slices of the framework of the economy depending on the ramifications of those companies.  If we look at power and energy alone, two enormous factors in any developed or developing country or even in any undeveloped country, these are factors which can enhance or inhibit a country's progress.  Therefore, we have Bord na Móna and the ESB here jointly engaged in the generation and distribution of power.  Power makes up a large slice of our activities today.</P>
    <P>There may be something, in fact a good deal, to be said in our circumstances for private enterprise but it was long ago recognised, I think rightly, that private enterprise could not grapple with the business at that time which was facing the State, which the State had to do.  Therefore it is to the credit of all those involved that, without any previous experience <Col N="425" /> of semi-statutory corporations elsewhere, this State as a young State went forward with the idea which from there on was taken up with gusto and worked.  Now that we are a number of years watching this and living with it we should be able to understand better the workings of those companies through a committee composed of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas formed in circumstances similar to what is suggested here.</P>
    <P>One could go back to 1950, as the Minister pointed out, and I was looking at the report of the Seanad for the year 1950 when this matter was discussed.  At various other stages, sometimes when the Estimate for the Department of Finance would be presented here, at other times when the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries Bills would be here for amendment or otherwise, and we had several motions at various other times advocating some sort of administrative approach as is suggested here.</P>
    <P>Apart from the activities of those larger semi-State companies we have the enormous factor that they are large employers of labour.  This is a fact which we are bound to take into account and to recognise.  Sometimes this House imposes plans on some of those companies which turn out to be wholly of a social kind and not compatible with the workings of a company engaged in business.  A company engaged in business would have us believe in private enterprise terminology that profit is the main motive.  That is not so in regard to a semi-statutory corporation where this House can come along and impose overnight, by way of a decision, work running into thousands of pounds which is not remunerated to the company.  In the context of this suggestion here we need to have regard to this factor.  I do not want to go into that whole slice of legislation because here one could easily get lost.  I do not want to expand or extend the argument too far, but it is an area which a committee of the House when it would settle down would be qualified to consider.</P>
    <P>There is the further question on the <Col N="426" /> setting up of this committee of how far ministerial power would come into conflict with the general aims underlying this setting up.  This is a nice point and one which was not developed enough in this argument.  The Minister said in his introductory speech that the Minister would still be responsible wholly for the policy of a semi-statutory corporation under his control.  If he is, then he would not seem to be responsible in the House.  He does not seem to be responsible in public.  Will he be wholly responsible in the case of a committee of this kind?  Would a committee of this kind in such circumstances come into conflict then with the directives of the Minister or of the Government as the case might be?  I am not very clear on this point, and I take it that possibly what the Minister means is that the committee so set up by this House would need to be a fairly diplomatic unit in order to be able to inquire into the affairs of a company and at the same time not to cut across the aims of the Government or of the Minister concerned in trying to formulate policy for the company. It is a difficult problem.  I have no doubt whatever that if the committee were so set up the Minister would get the co-operation of the committee but he would have to have some regard to the Opposition of the day and to seek the co-operation of that Opposition.</P>
    <P>I pose some of these points because they may crop up later on and it would be well at the outset that we should be clear as to the aims and objectives of this proposed committee. One may speak of the Committee of Public Accounts, but to my mind it is a different thing altogether.  I was myself chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and I must say that I am not a great admirer of the methods adopted sometimes in that committee, because it is often two or three years after the money is spent that that committee inquire into the spending or otherwise of the various Departments. That is not to say that I find any fault with the Comptroller and Auditor General or that I am finding fault with ourselves.  We clog it up.  Maybe we have an election or even two on <Col N="427" /> hands and this causes the work of the committee to fall back maybe two years or more, and one finds oneself struggling with money that was spent maybe two or two-and-a-half years ago.  This would not be the case, I assume, with a committee of the kind we visualise here.  The fact that a committee may send for a person's papers, documents and so on is giving it quite a good standing.  I do not think that there would be any further analogy with the Committee of Public Accounts. If there is, I cannot see it. It is not an inquisitorial committee. I assume this committee would set out to be part inquisitorial and part helpful. That committee should co-operate if they had newer techniques or ideas to help companies seeking such help. Today most companies are seeking such help.  I will not go too far into that subject because I do not think it is called for at this stage.</P>
    <P>When the Minister refers to this committee as a committee of the Oireachtas, I think it is wise to have a proportion of Members from the Upper House because they have a combination of talents which could be of considerable help to Members of the Dáil when dealing with some subjects that might come before that committee. The mix would be calculated to enhance not merely the prestige of this House but also the prestige of the company concerned.  One hopes that that committee would be co-operative and helpful.</P>
    <P>As years pass it is obvious that the activities of committees will broaden, not contract.  I mentioned two semi-State bodies with which I am fairly familiar, that is, the corporations engaged in producing energy.  The scope of activities of the ESB will increase enormously in years to come especially if we go into nuclear power.  Similarly there will be drastic changes in the activities of Bord na Móna and not only in regard to production, they could help the Forestry Division and so on.  I can see no contraction in the <Col N="428" /> amount of work in the fields of energy for the future.</P>
    <P>In the past when it was found that public business was being carved up on the floor of this House, the idea arose that the various Ministers would hand over the work envisaged to the semi-State bodies.  This was a good idea.  One can see the work in this House broadening every day.  Every age begets its own problems.  New problems emerge every day of the week. There is need for greater scope by way of Bills.  We have need for increased subheads in various Departments and so on.  All this activity adds up to more pressure on the table of the House.  Therefore, the sooner we can regularise our procedure to deal with that kind of procedure, the better and, as was said elsewhere, the easier it will be for semi-State bodies to plan ahead.  This could be a good move providing we keep to the rules.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the volume of business which finds its way before this House is increasing.  It is essential that we should be in a position to be relevant.  Parliaments become irrelevant when they fail to take account of the factors I have mentioned, to harness the scope of their business or so to regulate their business that each facet will not be discussed in full. Democracy is a talking shop.  The longer it remains so the better.  Freedom must ring round a democracy.</P>
    <P>Our main aim should be to see that we do not indulge in wasteful talk. Whatever suggestions we have to make we should make them with a view towards enhancing the power and prestige of this House.  If we could make plans to discuss our selected Estimates more fully at special times and to clear a number of matters affecting semi-State bodies from the floor of this House, we would be seen to be making more relevant progress.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m., on Tuesday, 23rd November, 1976.</P>

The board say that in order to make supply available as soon as possible and at minimum cost they could not consider applications for subsidised supply received after that date.</P>
      <P>An application for supply to a new house was received by the board on 1st July, 1976, from the person in question.  As the application was received after the closing date for the subsidised scheme the terms quoted were unsubsidised and required the payment of £530.  This sum, the board says, is directly related to the cost of the work involved in extending supply to the applicant's house.</P>

      <Col N="405" /> Subsidised development work in the Ogonolloe area commenced in August-September, 1976, and is still in progress.</P>
