      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed I was to resume this debate tomorrow morning at 10.30.  I was in my constituency and, because of the magnificent way in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is handling his Department, the Chief Whip could not get in touch with me to let me know this debate was on today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion I was making the point that the most important and fundamental issue facing the Government and the country &mdash; the country will have to take some hand in the matter as the Government are not interested &mdash; is the question of unemployment. We have all kinds of headline-catching efforts being made by various Ministers to divert people's attention from the real problem facing the country.  I am asking that the Government face up to the problem of unemployment and not declare civil war through the mouths of three Ministers one weekend, and attacking the British Press through the mouth of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Justice is worried about the post offices and he uses headline-catching words about their being raided, while the Minister for Industry and Commerce is gushing in Kinsale, all for the purpose of diverting <Col N="1080" /> attention from the fundamental issue facing the country.  That is why the Government are running away from a debate on the budget.</P>
    <P>I understand that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition asked why the debate on the budget was not continuing and he was told that there was very important business to be done and that the budget debate could not resume until Thursday.  Then because three or four Government Deputies were unavailable and because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was afraid he would be beaten in a division we have the budget debate today.  This kind of Mickey-mouse playing with the most important single issue facing the country deserves the condemnation of this House and of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs nonchalantly is allowing the most serious telephone disruption in the country.  Is he going to make any statement on the matter?  Is he making any moves?  What is happening? Chaos reigns throughout the country so far as the telephone service is concerned. We will have to provide a grindstone for the noses of the members of the Government. We will have to see to it that they keep their noses to the grindstone; in other words, we must ensure that they address themselves to the serious economic problem of unemployment.  With close on 120,000 unemployed, with a new job demand in respect of the non-agricultural area of 30,000 each year up to 1985, this is no time to make jokes about conventions or recruiting people to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We have had the reign of Narcissus since this Government took over. Narcissus was in love with himself and when looking into the pool admiring himself, in rapt admiration of his own beauty, he fell head over heels into the pool.  That has happened to this Administration.  It is time they got out and gave way to a serious-minded administration to run the country.</P>
    <P>There has been a cynical disregard of the demands of workers in allowing so much work to leave the country. I do not want to make a meal out of this but apart from furniture, ship <Col N="1081" /> and steel orders, printing orders are leaving the country.  I know many printers who are out of work at the moment.  I have a little booklet here. The original book was the work of a man who was a Member of the Oireachtas and who never spoke a word of English while he was here.  This little book has been printed by Scheck Wah Tong.  The print is very small. It is either the name of a company or that of a man and it is printed in Hong Kong.  It is an English-Irish dictionary.  There are two others of these also done by our good friend in Hong Kong, Scheck Wah Tong. I am sure he is a decent little fellow. As a result of this order from Ireland I have no doubt that he will be able to buy his little Lotus Blossom several presents while many of our printers are out of work.  This is a disgraceful situation.  I should like to inquire if in the Book of Estimates the item for £240,000 for Irish publications was in any way involved with Scheck Wah Tong or Lotus Blossom.  I should like the Minister for Finance to tell me if the company which sent this printing to Hong Kong are getting any money from Government funds.</P>
    <P>On this particular theme I had occasion to raise on the Adjournment the matter of an Irish publishing firm to which the Government had a moral obligation, based on a promise made by the previous Government, about a series of Irish publications.  I showed in the House some of the productions of that company.  It is a disgrace the way the Government welshed on their promise.  It is something which should not be done.  Printing companies should not be allowed to set up editorial boards and go to considerable expense on the basis of a promise from an Irish Government and then be let down while Scheck Wah Tong of Hong Kong is printing Irish books.</P>
    <P>Dean Swift wrote a beautiful satirical essay once.  His theme was support for home manufactures.  He made a modest proposal.  There was a surplus of young people without jobs, as there is today, and he suggested that the alternatives were support and development of Irish manufactures or allowing the people, who were growing fat <Col N="1082" /> on the underprivileged of the time, to eat the young of the poor.  Metaphorically, that is what the Government are doing.  They are eating the young of the country by not providing them with jobs.  It is a great pity that there is no Jonathan Swift nowadays to tear the skin off them.  You can eat into their spirit if not their flesh and that is what is being done. Every Deputy has a briefcase full of letters from young people trying to get positions in the country, particularly young girls, because the service jobs are no longer available.</P>
    <P>It is only now it is dawning on people in rural constituencies how savage the imposition on petrol and the road tax has been.  The Minister bears a heavy responsibility towards people in areas like mine where there is no railway any more, where there is no major arterial road and where petrol is absolutely essential to people. It was said of the OPEC countries that by increasing the price of crude oil to the extent they did they were more severe on their poor relations than they were on the industrial countries which they were supposed to be attacking.  Tax on cars and petrol at the moment, particularly the small car, is severest of all on the man from the mountain, on the Glangevlin man or the man from Crooks Bolgadáin, where I worked in the Mayo by-election.  He is the man who suffers. It is thinking in terms of the past to imagine that taxes can be loaded on motor cars because they affect only people who are wealthy enough to bear those taxes.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable complaint about VAT on school and college textbooks.  The Minister's response to that is to increase the VAT up to 10 per cent.  Teachers are complaining; pupils are complaining; above all, the poorer parents are complaining. We have a spate of resolutions on VAT on school books and school texts for the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis. It shows there is concern, north, south, east and west about this matter. I ask the Minister to zero rate VAT on school and college textbooks for the benefit of the country.  If the Government cannot provide jobs at least <Col N="1083" /> they can take off the tax on school books so that young people may equip themselves for jobs in the future which may come their way.</P>
    <P>I now come to the very vexed problem of the smallholder's assistance from the social security fund.  There has been a lot of talk about this.  Deputy Barry Desmond in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> attacked assistance in rural areas.  He was very careful to specify that the abuses were confined to rural areas.  I do not need to remind the House that Deputy Desmond is from the constituency of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown. I am not so sure if I can pronounce that in the proper way.  In this article he called for what the Minister did in this budget.  When I debated this on Radio na Gaeltachta with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach he said: &ldquo;Ná bach le Barry Desmond.  Claoi le Frank Cluskey.  Sé Frank Cluskey an fear tábhachtach maidir leis an méid sin. Bhí sé ag cur in iúl nach mbeadh Frank Cluskey ná John Kelly féin toilteanach ligint le Barry Desmond dá mbeadh sé ag iarraidh an dole a laghdú san iarthar.  Níor chuala mé focal go fóill ó John Kelly, an Rúnaí Parlaiminte.</P>

      <P>An Teachta Wilson, gan aon chur isteach air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  In this House on a debate on the Industrial Development Authority Bill quite recently Deputy Myles Staunton from west Mayo got very hot under his elegant collar when Deputy O'Malley raised this matter and gave an indication to the House that it would be over his dead body anything would be done to the social assistance that goes to the small farmers in the west.  I would oppose abuses of any kind in the social welfare system but I do think that there are rural areas where this kind of assistance is necessary if people want to live and with the rising inflation this kind of money becomes more and more necessary every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> I make a plea for the smallholder who uses this money properly, to feed his children better than he himself was fed and to clothe them or to put the extra money into a little extra stock or into more amenities in his house. This money was being used to a great extent for those purposes and I am calling on the Minister to restore it to those people who are a very stable element in our society.  While I am on that theme there is obvious in the whole statement of the Minister a bias against rural Ireland.  We had the Cavan/Monaghan Convention on Sunday and the theme of that convention was this obvious, blatant bias from this Dublin dominated Administration, concerned merely with maintaining themselves in power, concerned merely with putting on a good show.  Narcissus, looking at himself in the pool, all the time.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister going to do with the money he will make on petrol, the money he will make on road taxation of cars, the money he will save in rural Ireland from unemployment assistance, because he is freezing that as well when the 10 per cent increase comes up?  What will he do with the money he will save in rural and urban Ireland by withdrawing the £325 grant on houses?  What will he do with the money he makes out of raising the interest on local loans?  What will he do with the money he will make on taxing the agricultural and fishery co-operatives? Those co-operatives were providing a wonderful service for the country, an educational service.  They were paying graduates in agricultural science to improve the farming of rural Ireland. They provided credit.  One co-operative, for example, at the time when the price of fertilisers increased steeply, held it for 12 months out of their money.  They also promoted social schemes such as group water schemes and aided them with money. They actually provided a kind of rural banking service as well.  Where will the Minister spend that money?  I do not know.</P>
    <P>There is some doubt about the local improvements scheme.  I suggest to the Minister that he should see to it that small drainage schemes, boreen and <Col N="1085" /> lane schemes, which are very necessary in the country, should get that money and should get at least 25 per cent more than they got last year to cope with inflation.  This would provide employment and would also improve the quality of rural living.  There is some doubt about the local improvements scheme money.  This doubt arose out of a letter from the Department of Local Government to local authorities throughout the country. There was an attempt to clear it up.  I have been looking at the Book of Estimates.  I am not quite sure how much was spent on what last year.  I have tabled a question to the Minister for Local Government to try to clarify this.  Even the most simple person knows that the purchasing power of the same amount of money this year has dropped by almost 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is one very important aspect and I see that Dr. Brendan Menton, the economist, referred to it recently. The farming community as a whole are in the forefront as people who save money.  There was a large increase last year in savings.  People became scared after 1974.  It was such a bad year, particularly in the country, that they became scared and personal savings went up.  I know this has an effect on manufacturing industry and I know it can throw people in manufacturing industry out of work but when people are afraid, when the economic ground is shaking under them, when they feel they are treading on an economic quagmire, then they begin to save, they run for shelter. Farmers, as is well known, are among the top savers.  Whatever few pounds they can save they save and this money is available to the Government. There is a serious responsibility on the Government to ensure that this money is spent equitably in the country generally but with a bias towards the farmers seeing that the budget itself is heavily biased against rural Ireland.  I quote from Mr. Menton's article:</P>
    <P>Farmers tend to save relatively more than other sections.</P>
    <P>The same, of course, goes for public service employees.  This money is available to the Government.  They <Col N="1086" /> have begged everywhere.  Their begging bowl has been shaken under the noses of everybody from the Persian Gulf to California.  Here they have money in which there is no risk.  For example, there is no exchange risk. They are borrowing pounds, they are not borrowing some currency which will harden <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pound in a very short time.  As well as that, the interest on this money is subject to taxation.</P>
    <P>The farming and rural communities deserve better from the Government than the kind of treatment they are getting in this budget.  We do not want posturing.  We do not want diversionary tactics.  We do not want speeches.  We do not want the Minister for Post and Telegraphs standing by until the telephonic system gets out of control just to take the eyes of the people off the pigs' dinner the Government have made of the economy. We want a facing up by the Government to the problem of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to give my views on what the Government should be doing to remedy the situation.  I intended dealing in some detail with education and the fact that the only thing the Minister for Finance mentioned was that the pupil-teacher ratio could not be improved this year.  This is our No. 1 priority in our policy on education.  It demands extra teachers &mdash; I am afraid the Minister for Education is running into trouble in this regard &mdash; and it demands extra class rooms.  The Minister for Finance has told us that nothing can be done at a time when a report has been published stating that the compulsory age <Col N="1087" /> group is No. 1 priority for expenditure. I have not time to quote from that report, the Report of the National Economic and Social Council, in detail.</P>
      <P>Ministers pick documents like the report of the Central Bank or the reports of the ESRI &mdash; take out what suits themselves, being careful to avoid mention of those that do not suit them.  The report of the National Economic and Social Council states that increased expenditure is needed on education for compulsory age groups.  The main burden of that increased expenditure in this regard should be devoted to improving the pupil-teacher ratio to prevent problems, not merely in the primary school but afterwards in the post primary schools and in society itself.  I have been in touch with social groups, nuns and a young Jesuit scholastic, who have set up in various areas in the city little evangelistic groups who are trying to get at the problem at the post-school stage.  They are trying to teach young women who got married at 16 or 17 years of age, unprepared by their educational experience, and give them pride and confidence in themselves and build them up as citizens.  This could not be done when there were 50 in a class in a school where the teacher most of the time was busy keeping down the revolution.</P>
      <P>I am glad that there is an increase in the education grant in the Book of Estimates.  In effect it is an increase of 4 per cent but it will not be able to deal with any of the problems at second or third level education.  We saw the trouble the voluntary schools had in getting their rights out of the Government last year and the increase in this grant will not help them.  I hope to have an opportunity of dealing with the educational problems later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining I should like to deal with the problem facing the Government of providing employment.  I have called on our young people to stand their ground and be heard.  I have called on them to organise themselves and to tell the Government: &ldquo;It is your <Col N="1088" /> duty to provide service jobs and industrial jobs for us; you are falling down on that duty.&rdquo;  Various people in the non-political world are talking about the seriousness of the position. Career guidance counsellors and others are shouting that out and I wish the Government were not as deaf as they are.  During the course of the debate on the Bill dealing with the IDA I referred to a paper which pointed out that in a European country with much the same background as ours they had, without Government grants, foreign capital or semi-State bodies, developed labour and skill intensive industries.  That country &mdash; Denmark &mdash; made wonderful strides in this development.</P>
    <P>I did not agree with the conclusions of that paper about education but the author of it pointed out that it was important for the Government to allow companies to retain profits, so to arrange taxation that if the money was being ploughed back and providing jobs, if the industry was being developed <i>in situ</i> the Revenue Commissioners, and the Minister for Finance, should look on that firm with a benign eye.  That is true of rural Ireland.  There is so much material to deal with that it is difficult to confine oneself to a few remarks.  No matter how well we or the performers <i>par excellence</i> of the television screen and the radio on the Government side perform, no matter how the words are put together the touchstone, the test, is are the numbers in gainful employment increasing, is wealth being created that can be distributed?  Distributing social welfare is necessary and important but in my opinion it is a minor irrelevancy compared with the provision of jobs, the creation of wealth which can be distributed over the various areas of the economy that need it most.  This is the Government's problem and I submit that Fianna Fáil will have their economic plan, and their other plans and policies ready, if Beethoven moves over.</P>

      <P>I have had occasion, when there was uproar or debate on the Order of Business, to complain about the sanctimonious and <Col N="1089" /> unreal line taken by the Opposition and, in particular, by the Leader of the Opposition, in regard to Government Business.  I am sorry to say this about a man whom I respect in most ways, and who enjoys the respect of most other people in most ways, but I believe these rows on the Order of Business, these niggling, pettifogging complaints which come from him every other day about the way the Government orders Dáil Business are uttered by him because he knows that at that point in the day they will seize maximum attention.  He realises that they will receive an attention far out of proportion to the reality or the importance of the matter he is dealing with.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has already made that point.  I must advise the House that in a debate in which a time limit applies intrusions of this kind ought not to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies but I wanted to explain my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Another feature about this is that the organising of Government Business, as nobody knows better than Deputy Lynch, is a matter which, until such time as we have an arrangement whereby an Opposition will cooperate, or collaborate, with a Government in organising Business, has to be fixed on a day-to-day basis.  Very often it requires on the side of the Government a certain rearranging or replanning in the middle of a week or even in the middle of a day.  I should like to make it clear that I do not expect any Opposition to collaborate or co-operate with the Government in this respect.  It would be foolish and unreal of me to do so.  Their job is, not perhaps to make things difficult in a malicious sense for a Government, but to keep the Government fully stretched. I accept that and I do not complain <Col N="1090" /> about it.  However, the result of the constraints which the Dáil system places on us is that the arranging of Business must have a certain flexibility. It had that flexibility in Fianna Fáil days, although the House was not so busy then, and it must have that flexibility now.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly true, as the Leader of the Opposition said this morning, that the Government's intention in regard to today's business was changed last night. It seems to me that it was changed in a sense which must suit the Opposition, because they were clamouring yesterday for more time for the budget debate. In regard to the sincerity of that clamour I will say something to the House in a minute or two.  But it is true that the business was changed, and it was changed in response to constraints which lie on every Government, and particularly on a Government with a narrow majority at a time when they have a couple of people ill.</P>
      <P>I absolutely resist and repudiate and will never have anything to do, if I can avoid it, with the idiotic system, cogged like everything else in the country from the British, whereby Deputies are brought in here on stretchers.  In fact, I did do that in my early days as Whip, not literally on stretchers but I did take two men out of hospital at the time of the election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I have not done it since and I do not propose to start doing it again. A democratic system which cannot evolve a rational way of overcoming the problem of illness on the Government side is seriously defective and those defects reflect perhaps even deeper defects in the way it does its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make absolutely no apology for recommending to the Government a change in the plan of the week's business which I communicated last week to the Opposition Whip.  I take full responsibility for it.  My job is to keep the Government out of trouble, to get through the work as quickly, as expeditiously and as successfully as possible. If that means chopping and changing, taking things out and putting things in in a way which suits the Government, that is my job and I will do it.  I am not one bit impressed <Col N="1091" /> by all the muling on the far side about being taken short by this or being taken short by that.  I regret the personal inconvenience to a Deputy who expected, in reliance on what I told the Opposition last week, that he would be called on tomorrow morning at 10.30 and finds himself called on this morning at 10.30.  That inconvenience is fully shared on the Government side; I also had my plan of speakers for tomorrow, and that plan has now been torn up.  The inconvenience is not entirely on their side, let me emphasise, and the personal inconvenience is subordinate, and must be subordinate, to the need of the Government and the duty of the Government to keep itself on top in the Dáil.  It is all very fine for Deputy Wilson to make a loud snort about that.  If he were over here in this job he would be doing exactly the same thing.</P>

      <P>I regret the personal inconvenience but that is as far as I can go.  I make no secret about it, and do not put a tooth in it, in telling the House why the business has changed; but apart from that we have had complaints about the unprecedented action of the Government in not having ordered the budget debate to continue on yesterday after last Thursday.  I will speak my mind about that too.  This budget debate and all budget debates that I have ever witnessed turn, after the first couple of speeches and in the case of this one even before the first Opposition speech, into a ritual ding-dong in which absolutely no one inside the House, and I believe very few outside, take the slightest bit of interest.  I may get a ritual gesture or words of protest from the far side when I say that. Let me recall to the House that when we had a budget debate here last June, five hours after that debate was opened by Deputy Lynch there was not one Deputy on the Opposition benches.  I can remember the occasion very well for a different reason, but I need not trouble the House with that.  The last man left on the Opposition benches was Deputy Callanan. He and I exchanged some words across the floor, which is why it sticks <Col N="1093" /> in my mind.  Very shortly after that incident he got up, gathered up his papers, put them into his brief case, apologised politely to the Chair and said he had to be off home.  He went off at about 3.50 in the afternoon leaving the Opposition benches completely vacant although the Opposition had been shouting the country down for a budget debate.  It was my regret that the Minister happened to be out having a cup of tea and I was standing in for him.  If the Minister had been there at that moment he could have got in and concluded the budget debate within four or five hours of Deputy Lynch having started his speech.  That is how serious they are about a budget debate.</P>

The two Deputies over there are doing themselves no credit by their barrage of interruption.  I am entitled to speak my piece &mdash; the Leader of the Opposition has done so and Deputy Wilson has done so &mdash; about the way the House does its business.  I probably know more about it than they do.  I cannot get excited about all these complaints about why cannot we have time for this because I know there is no reality in them.  I am open, when I say that, to being called anti-democratic and wanting to stifle debate.  I do not want to stifle debate at all but debate to me means a genuinely felt exchange of views, a conflict of words between people who really mean what they say, and not a ritual ding-dong like a medieval Japanese war ballet, or something like that, where the protagonists strike each other with padded imitation staffs and expect the public to be impressed.  It does not impress me and I do not believe it impresses the public either and the Press, who see the degree of reality that there is in the thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The budget is a deeply serious matter and I perfectly accept that there are a certain number of Deputies on the far side and on this side who have something serious to say about it, but the idea that work must <Col N="1095" /> be suspended here, that other things must be suspended, that the string of Bills on the Order Paper must take second place to this ritual ding-dong which cannot attract the attention of half-a-dozen Deputies, I absolutely reject.  I will not go along with that kind of foolery and that kind of hypocrisy in regard to the way this House does its business.</P>

      <P>We will deal with that when we come to it and with any other budget there may be.  It was in Fianna Fáil's time that the convention of one budget a year was definitively abandoned.  That was the occasion where, had the Minister happened to be present instead of absent for ten minutes, he could have got in and finished the budget debate within an absurdly small number of hours after its commencement, after Fianna Fáil had been shouting the House down and getting the country all worked up about not debating the alleged savage imposts.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality about the whining and muling about not having a debate, or enough time for a debate, or depriving the debate of a certain urgency by pushing it on for days and not having it immediately after the budget is introduced. That cuts no ice with me.  It cuts no ice with anybody looking at how the House worked over the last three years, let alone the previous 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the House and the country are depressed by the predictability and the extremely boring and empty nature of virtually all the comments that it has attracted of an unfavourable kind, largely from the Opposition but also from commentators who are critical of the budget.  Listening to Deputy Colley last Wednesday and to Deputy Lynch the following morning I noticed there was something about their speeches that irresistibly suggested that they had been prepared long before the budget was introduced. They had obviously made up their minds what they were going to say before they knew what the Minister was going to produce and, no matter what he produced, the same old reach-me-down clichés would have been uttered.  We would have had the flailing and sawing of the air from Deputy Colley about &ldquo;the party being over&rdquo;, about &ldquo;the last throw of the <Col N="1097" /> dice by the gambler&rdquo;.  All these old clichés are thrown out every year since the State started.  Probably the same thing still happens in the British Parliament.  It is depressing.</P>
    <P>I suppose I can hardly expect this to be taken seriously but, looking at it in a non-party way, it is depressing to find that reaction to major social, economic and political measures.  It is depressing to find a level so dull, so uninspired and so empty.  I could have written Deputy Colley's speech for him before the budget was delivered at all.  I could have written Deputy Lynch's speech for him before the budget was delivered.  I ask the House to apply a simple test: take an intelligent child, or an intelligent adult, and defy him or her to read out of Deputy Lynch's speech the faintest clue about what measures were proposed here last week by the Minister for Finance.  There is not a single clue in the whole of the Leader of the Opposition's speech as to what the measures were, measures for which the whole country was supposed to be waiting and which were supposed to have drawn the eyes of the entire Irish people to Leinster House.  There is not a single clue in his speech as to the actual measures proposed by the Minister for Finance, not one.  He makes oblique references to imposts but one could not get out of his speech any information as to what the imposts were.  There is not a clue of any kind to the concrete measures the Minister proposed and the Leader of the Opposition who, in his time was Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as well as Taoiseach and, before that, Minister for Industry and Commerce, and who must be peculiarly well qualified to pour reasoned scorn, even though the interval was a matter of only 20 hours, on the proposals of the Minister for Finance, failed to do even that.  So dim was his contribution here last Thursday and so predictable that there is barely a line of his speech which could not have been written the previous week as, indeed, I believe <Col N="1098" /> it was.  I believe the Fianna Fáil Party cranked up their think-tank and set to work on an acceptable reaction by the Leader of the Opposition to the budget proposals of the Minister for Finance, leaving an occasional gap here and there in case the Minister's budget proposals might in fact inspire a bit of thought on the part of the person delivering the speech.  But essentially that speech was written before this House sat on Wednesday and before the Minister produced his budget proposals.  I defy Deputy Cunningham to show me in Deputy Lynch's speech where there is any clue as to what the Minister actually proposed or any criticism of a single one of his concrete proposals.  I do so with a light heart because I know Deputy Cunningham will not be able to accept the challenge.</P>
      <P>That is one aspect of the Leader of the Opposition's speech, the predictability, and therefore the utter emptiness and utter irrelevance of his remarks from the point of view of the very serious economic situation we are in and the very serious measures taken by the Minister for Finance to deal with it.  I hope now the leader-writers and the sub-editors of the papers who produced the following day the bannerline: &ldquo;Lynch Lashes Budget&rdquo; will go back and read the speech again and see where in his speech there is any concrete criticism of any of the concrete proposals of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Certainly there is plenty of criticism of the general handling of the economy by the Government.  There is also criticism of the budget taxation. There is the familiar Opposition criticism that we have heard before, which, no doubt, Fianna Fáil got from us in their time in Government, of wanting to have it every way, so justly castigated in the following speech by the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>And there was no criticism outside this House at all, was there not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There was absolutely nothing in Deputy Lynch's speech which could be demonstrated to be referable to anything the Minister actually proposed.  There is no hint in his <Col N="1099" /> speech to show that anyone, the think-tank or anyone else, ever sat down with the speech, which was available from four o'clock the previous day, and threw even 20 words together about what the Minister proposed. That is the kind of Opposition we have got, and that is the party which will offer itself at the next election as an alternative Government.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that my remarks are not intended as an assault on Deputy Lynch, because I believe any other Opposition spokesman would have behaved in the same way. I say all this to underpin my basic plea that this kind of think-tank&mdash; particularly in the economic field in which all Governments and all Oppositions are at present in the dark to some extent, because we do not know quite what has overtaken us, and even the economic experts disagree&mdash;that this kind of ritual debating ding-dong is out of date.  We ought not to fall over backwards paying tribute to it and talking grandly and pompously about the dignity of the House and what the people expect of us and so on.  The people certainly expect things of the Dáil, and more particularly of the Government, and are frequently disappointed in their expectations.  But I cannot believe the people give a curse whether we debate this budget for six minutes, six hours or 600 hours.  I do not think they care, and we should not go through the idiotic pretence of supposing they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the absolute innocence of any reference of a concrete nature to the Minister's actual proposals in Deputy Lynch's speech.  I now will refer to the feebleness of an Opposition which will stuff into their leader's speech, as though it were an authority which would carry the speech on its back, quotations from the newspapers.  A schoolboy in a debate might very well suppose that, if he could find an apposite quotation from the editorial of that day's paper, it would carry a couple of paragraphs of his speech and win him favour with the adjudicator for having done his homework.  But what are we to make of a Leader of an <Col N="1100" /> Opposition who was Taoiseach for seven years, before that was Minister for Finance and before that was Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is one of three of four men who know most about the Irish economy, who in the course of a ritual speech, which must have been prepared long before the debate began, made at least three respectful references to Press comment on the Minister's budget?  He must have his own comments on the budget.  Who are these nameless commentators he is relying on?  Deputy Lynch probably knows 40 times more about the economy and fiscal measures than the people he is so respectfully quoting.  It is the feebleness of his speech that I am complaining about.</P>
    <P>At column 802, Volume 287, of the Official Report he says:</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to have recognised the problem which he created himself in this way with his proposal to introduce a price index which would include tax increases. That has received very adverse comment in at least one leading article in today's newspapers.</P>
    <P>Dear me!  We have all received adverse comment in the daily newspapers from time to time.  What kind of an inclusion is that in the budget speech barring a crisis, the main speech of the year of the Leader of the Opposition? What kind of material is that?  Are we supposed to fall over backwards because the writer of a leading article in one of today's papers has commented adversely on what we have done?  Of what value is that comment compared with a personal comment of a Leader of the Opposition? In the same column he says:</P>
    <P>Some estimates suggest that the overall deflation resulting from the budget could add up to&mdash;I heard this in an economic comment on the radio this morning&mdash;20,000 more people in the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>He tells us what he heard when casually listening to the wireless that morning and treats it as though it was of the slightest importance here.  He does not even give us the man's name <Col N="1101" /> although he probably was named on the radio.  At column 795 he says:</P>
    <P>The one unwelcome result we appear to have obtained from this debt finance spending has been the dangerously high level of inflation. Two days ago the <i>Irish Independent</i> in its second leader under the heading &ldquo;What Policy&rdquo; had this to say:</P>
    <P>and then we heard a tract from the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <P>Like other newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent</i> has extremely competent people on its economic staff who are well able to produce economic comment; and of course, if you know who is writing the material, it deserves as much attention as that person's reputation and training have earned for him. But what is one to make of a Leader of an Opposition who packs out his speech, or is allowed to do so by his party, with comments casually picked up from the day's newspapers or the radio?  It is possible that the members of his party who are trying to sink him wish this kind of material on him. It is possible that some of his bitterest enemies are in the think-tank and push speeches on him of which he should be ashamed and which he should not deliver.  As I said, that is a possibility and I hope for his sake it is not true, but it should be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal to get one's teeth into in Deputy Lynch's budget speech.  While, on the one hand, he pays the Minister a tribute for deciding to pay for day-to-day spending by taxation, on the other hand he complains in very general terms, without actually commenting on any individual impost, about taxation.  That type of comment is no use.  We do not want to hear it. It is only wasting the time of this House and the people watching us.  Of what is he in favour?  Is he in favour of taxation?  He appears to be when he commends the Minister for deciding to try to pay more of the day-to-day expenditure by taxation.  Why then complain about taxation at the end of his speech?  He does not say that tax should be imposed on any particular sector which the Minister has let off scot free.  He complains about its incidence on the motoring public.</P>
    <P>Most of us are motorists and we will <Col N="1102" /> all feel the effects of the new taxes. We will all grumble and then forget them, as taxation increases usually are forgotten and have been under all Governments. Some businesses may be seriously hit.  It is no use telling us that motorists will resent this tax.  We knew that before the budget was introduced. We did not need Deputy Lynch to tell us.  We do not want to have to listen to Deputy after Deputy telling us that we are savaging the motorist.  We know the motorist is hard hit but what we want to know is this: if we let off the motorist where will we get the money?  From whom would the Opposition like us to extract the money? That is what we want to know and that is the only kind of talk about which the people care.</P>
    <P>The moaning about taxation is uninteresting and irrelevant.  Nobody wants to be bothered with it unless it is accompanied by a suggestion on where Deputy Lynch and his party would wish this burden to fall.  He commends the Minister for paying his way by taxation but complains against one of the major fields of impost which the Minister proposed.  Where else will this taxation fall?</P>
    <P>This morning I listened to Deputy Wilson and, as far as I could make out through the roars, he seemed to be complaining about the Government relying on improvements in social welfare levels since they took office to win by-elections.  He seemed to be saying that the Government would be singing a different song now because of the mechanism for reducing the number of people in receipt of what is familiarly known as the &ldquo;smallholders dole&rdquo;.  How does he square what he said this morning with what his leader said at column 809 last Thursday?  Deputy Lynch said:</P>
    <P>Some attempt was made to regularise unemployment assistance to some people who could afford to do without it.  That is commendable.</P>
    <P>I do not criticise Deputy Lynch for putting this in gentle language, but essentially what he was saying is that it is commendable to reduce the number of people on the dole.  Will he go down and say that in Bangor Erris?  No, he will not&mdash;if he did, people would respect him for it.  That <Col N="1103" /> essentially is the reason why budget debates of the type we have had here since I came to this House three years ago seem to me to be so valueless.</P>
    <P>So far as the Opposition are concerned it is simply an exercise, absolutely predictable, pre-cooked and pre-digested, thought out in advance, whinging and whining.  The present Opposition are not unique in that; no doubt the same criticism might have been levelled at us before the change of Government.  There was no suggestion about what ought to have been done instead of the disagreeable things this budget does and most budgets do. There was no suggestion about where the health burden might have been allowed to fall.  Deputy Lynch said before sitting down that he had intended dealing with other points in the budget and I do not know why he abandoned them because&mdash;perhaps I am wrong&mdash; I think he spoke for less than an hour. These are the very points we wanted to hear.  The ritual condemnation of the Government's alleged mismanagement of this and that is heard every day&mdash;at Question Time, in Private Members' business and so on.  We want to hear what a Fianna Fáil budget would be like had they been in office now.  That we did not hear and that is why I write off their claim to return to Government and manage the economy.  I discount it as of no weight.</P>
    <P>At the same time I confess that I agreed with a couple of Deputy Lynch's points.  They were not specifically directed against the budget.  I agree with the mildly conservative line he appeared to take in the latter part of his speech and with the soft spot he evidently&mdash;and rightly, in my view&mdash; has for self-reliance and private enterprise. I have attacked his speech, not himself personally, but I do not want to finish without saying that I agree that the number of house owners in the country should be increased rather than depressed and that it is the job of a Government as far as possible to do that.  That is my own view.  I agree with most of what he said about recruitment of community effort particularly with young people, in order to approach national problems.  If Deputy <Col N="1104" /> Lynch and his party were to devote more time to considering how the ideas latent in both these very brief arguments could be sold to the people and incorporated in a serious political programme it would be more valuable and would attract much more interest and perhaps more political support.</P>
    <P>My own reflection on this budget and on previous budgets, including Fianna Fáil budgets, is a very general one, not an economist's reflection since I am not an economist.  It seems to me that governments, possibly through the accumulation of generations of democratic existence which carries with it the constant effort to attract political support and, in a sense perhaps, buy votes, have saddled themselves with tasks that I feel &mdash;not just now but under Fianna Fáil also&mdash;in some respects are almost beyond them.</P>
    <P>We talk glibly about how the Irish people will respond but there is no conscious entity known as the Irish people.  The Irish people is a collection of several million individual consciousnesses but there is no conscious entity which will react or respond in any way analogous to an individual reacting or responding to a particular need.  I think the kind of response a government seeks in seeking wage restraints and so on is not likely to be generated by appeals to a mass of people.  I have the deepest sympathy for the Government's appeals in this regard as I had for previous Government appeals.  I hoped they would be successful but there is the weakness in appeals of this kind that an individual is the person that is listening, not a collectivity. The individual has only one wage claim and feels that his claim will not do anybody any harm and will not bring the country to its knees.  We are without institutions and structures&mdash;much as I dislike that lunchtime seminar word&mdash;without mechanisms which create or tend to create communal or national consciousness of this kind.  In wartime or in response to some serious crisis of that kind you get something approaching a response like that but not, I think, to an economic situation, <Col N="1105" /> serious though it is, which, from the individual's&mdash;perhaps the uninstructed individual's&mdash;point of view, does not seem to change much from day to day.</P>
    <P>The individual, apart from feeling that the concession of his claim will not do any great harm, also feels fairly powerless to help.  He may have goodwill in regard to helping his country in an economic difficulty but feels perhaps that any effort he can make will be lost, absorbed and forgotten in the generality of people who are either not working at all or even working against him.  Speaking above party lines I feel that it is for that reason that Governments here will sooner or later have to take a look with a very long perspective at their way of regulating the economy and their way of allowing it to be supposed by the people that the prosperity of the economy and the happiness of society are things over which the Government have a very strong and powerful degree of control.  The degree of control any Government have over the economy or society is very limited but I do not think control is impossible to achieve.  It is possible to achieve and has been achieved.  I am sorry to say the examples are all in countries that have tyrannies and where I would not wish to live, countries I should never like this country to copy.</P>
    <P>There are societies, little though I admire them as regards their failure to concede freedom of speech, in which <i>via</i> authoritarian ways people are made to think differently about how societies work, and the way they live and a certain different kind of consciousness is generated in which it is possible to recruit the energy of the people into a conscious economic and social operation.  We miss these mechanisms here.  I am not far away here from Deputy Lynch's thought when he mentioned communities in saying that I believe that the way that is most congenial to Irish people for providing these institutions is to concentrate on the community, possibly even in a rather small community and give that community some sense of responsibility for its own economic and <Col N="1106" /> social future.  Most communities in Ireland, look essentially to Dublin for the provision of a factory.  There may be, and often is, a very strong degree of local initiative involved but essentially Dublin is regarded as a necessary piece of the pattern of economic development and social development&mdash; Dublin must provide grants for factories, investigate the potentialities of the area from the point of view of employment, must provide the school and school buses and so on.</P>
    <P>That role is one which Governments up to this have willingly assumed and, I suppose, recruited political support by doing so.  The acquiescence of successive Governments in all of this work is reaching an impossible point.  Deputy Cunningham may be about to say that I fear this Government are not able to dispose of these tasks, but that is not what I mean.  During the last generation Governments generally have reached the point of leaving the individual or the small community quite powerless to do anything in regard to their economic or social future.  In that way Governments have deprived themselves of the most powerful weapon of economic and social progress, namely, the effort which the individual or the community can put into their own future.  What I am saying is nothing new.  It has been said before many times but it is a relevant reflection in the context of the budget statements and at a time of very severe difficulty, a difficulty that is shared by other countries also. At a time when comment both inside and outside this House seems so impotent, so irrelevant, would it have made any difference to our economic and social prosperity if the Minister had drafted his imposts differently? He must operate within the conventional framework which he inherited. Had he proposed an alternative scheme can anyone say that it would have resulted in solving the unemployment problem, in providing houses for all those who need them, in reducing the inflation rate to zero? Nobody can point to an alternative scheme that would have achieved these aims in such times of difficulty as we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> In the kind of world in which we live there is a limit to what Governments can do in regard to budgeting, and that is why I say more responsibility must be given to the individual, to communities, be they small or otherwise, to help them to evolve in a way that will give them the opportunity of controlling and shaping their economic destinies but with all the necessary help that central Government can provide.  Central Government, though, must never appear to assume total responsibility for the achieving or non-achieving of prosperity and happiness.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I ask again that the earlier part of my speech not be taken as a personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition.  I should be very sorry were anyone to take it in that sense but his speech of Thursday last showed how impotent are this Opposition or how impotent any Opposition might be, in their criticism of budget proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister carries a heavy burden by reason of his office but I suppose this could have been said of all his predecessors during their periods in office.  However, the Minister has weathered well the past few years.  I wish him every success in respect of his proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been speaking for the past 55 minutes and during that time I have been trying to analyse his remarks.  In the first part of his speech he attacked the Leader of the Opposition for his method of dealing with the budget debate.  He had a go, too, at the Press.  In the second part of his speech he became nice and mild, but had nothing to tell us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset he referred to the ordering of business.  We know it is the Parliamentary Secretary's duty to keep the wheels of Government moving, but to have spoken as he did today must indicate that he is under severe pressure.  He has two political parties to deal with.  There are recalcitrant Deputies in both parties.  Also, he has a budget on his plate of which his own backbenchers are not enamoured. <Col N="1108" /> We appreciate all these difficulties but would point out that during Fianna Fáil's time in office when an order of business was decided on it was adhered to in the main, whereas the present position is that when there are controversial issues in respect of which legislation is required time for debating such issues is doled out grudgingly and in an opportune way, but withdrawn if clouds appear on the horizon.  This behaviour does not depend on the Fianna Fáil Opposition. It is geared to suit the vicissitudes of the Coalition backbenchers.</P>
    <P>There was a reference in the second part of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech which concerns me but I think it sums up the attitude of the Coalition and demolishes the case Deputy Kelly has been making for co-operation in respect of long-term national planning.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that the Leader of the Opposition wished for a reduction in the number of those unemployed but said emphatically that Deputy Lynch would not say this in Bangor Erris. Does this mean that the Government do not visualise a situation at any stage where it would be their duty to foster and provide employment in Bangor Erris and elsewhere in the west?  Has it not dawned on them that the only way to reduce the number of unemployed is to provide employment?</P>
    <P>I am worried that the Chief Whip of the Government has a mentality which caused him to come away with this expression.  If he were doing his job properly, and appreciated the difficulties of communication, and realised the Deputies on both sides of the House are engaged at meetings or functions, especially on Tuesday, he could at least have given some indication much earlier.  Where there is a sudden change in the order of business, if it is known to him the night before, and especially in a situation such as the present chaos with telephones, he could have it anounced on some of the late news on radio and television.  This would be helpful to Deputies who may have occasion to leave the precints of this House late at night.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> The most worrying aspect of the budget is not the taxes that are imposed, because taxes bring in only about one-seventh of the funds necessary to run the country for 12 months. However, I do not think that the imposition of taxes to meet one-seventh of the financial needs has been done in the proper way.  Would the Minister tell us, in respect of the imposition of petrol and road tax, whether all he had in mind was the acquisition of revenue?  Is it deliberate policy on his and the Government's part to cut down the import of fuel oils, and are we to have in the future more cutting-down of this source of power and energy? Would the Minister give an indication of his long-term intentions in the future?  Was this imposition a double-edged sword?  I think it was.  Could he elaborate on the second edge?  Are we to take it that there is to be a drastic cut-down, and is he by subterfuge going to do this by budgetary taxation provisions?  Are there not other methods?  Will anything be done to replace this energy?  I think energy will be the most important point of debate and the most important fact of life in the years ahead in the non-oil producing countries.  The Minister should be honest with the people and say: &ldquo;This is the Government's aim.  The results of that aim are&mdash;&rdquo; whatever they are &ldquo;&mdash;and these are our long-term plans to deal with it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his budget statement he mentioned an economic green paper. However, no matter what economic green papers or other papers are produced to the public, the main item to be dealt with by this and future Governments for years to come is the question of energy, its cost and availability. Now that this problem is being dealt with in the budget, it behoves the Government to put their plans regarding it before the people to alert them to what the Government are trying to do and what is expected of producers, manufacturers and others.  Perhaps the Minister thinks that a tax on petrol will conserve energy which is being wasted. It may bring about a decrease in the use of petrol, but it may be also that the optimum result will not be got <Col N="1110" /> from that.  In other words, the Minister has made no provision in his budget whereby if the use of petrol is to be reduced by taxation that that taxation will result in the optimum use of petrol or fuel oils.  The Minister knows perfectly well that fuel oils and petrol are being used for purposes which are not being productive and he has not proposed any tax on functions such as racing, for example, which in their operation create the use of very much fuel.</P>
    <P>The Chief Whip at the end of his speech apologised for anything he may have said about the Leader of the Opposition.  His words had been very strong.  He started off by saying that the one-seventh part of the money which is required in this financial transaction, the amount raised by taxation, is not the main worry of the Fianna Fáil party.  We are worried about the £570 million which will have to be found otherwise and elsewhere than by taxation.  I hope the Minister will make an effort to find this at home.</P>
    <P>There is a vast amount of money which has left the country, and there is some in the country, which could be made available for development, for the production of goods, and so on, and for the provision of employment, if the Minister's legislative provisions encourage investors.</P>
    <P>Our case is and has been that the actions of the Coalition Government over the past three years, the ideological clashings, the ideological differences between both parties in Government, and the ideologies they put into practice, are such that the investing public have no confidence in the long term viability of this Government.  These few points occurred to me arising out of the contribution to the debate by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I really intended to deal with the budget in the context of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don tionchar a bheidh ag an gcáinfhaisnéis seo ar mhuintir an iarthair agus go speisialta ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  San aeráid eacnamaíochta <Col N="1111" /> atá ann i láthair na huaire ba cheart don Rialtas seo&mdash;nó do Rialtas ar bith eile&mdash;dhá rud a dhéanamh, daoine a chur ag obair agus an costas beatha a choinneáil seasamhach.  Is í sin an aidhm is ceart a bheith ag Rialtas ar bith go spesialta nuair atá 117,000 daoine dífhostaithe agus an figiúir sin ag órdú in aghaidh an lae.  Cuid mhór de na daoine sin is daoine óga iad atá tar éis an scoil a fhágáil, daoine nach mhaith leo agus nach mhaith lena dtuismitheoirí iad a bheith dífhostaithe. San aeráid sin ba cheart don Rialtas an cháinfhaisnéis a ordú chun an figiúir a íslú.</P>
    <P>Conas is féidir é sin a dhéanamh? Tá 8,000 duine atá ag obair i dtógáil tithe dífhostaithe faoi láthair.  Is féidir an líon daoine sin a chur ag obair arís.  Ina measc sin tá siúinéirí, agus na ceardaithe eile to léir a bhaineann leis an gnó tógála, tá siad dífhostaithe.  Tá cabhair dhífhostaíochta agus pay-related benefits acu.  Ba cheart cuid den airgead a bhí le fáil ins na hiasachtaí a fhuaireamar ó thíortha eile, ba ceart chuid de sin a chur isteach i dtionscal seo na tógála agus na daoine sin a chur ag obair.  Chomh maith le sin bheadh cáin ioncaim a íoc acu, stampaí agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Tá géar-ghá le tithe a thógáil.  Cad a dheineann an Rialtas seo faoi?  Ón chéad lá den mhí seo níl aon deontas le fáil chun teach nua a thógáil nó teach nua a cheannach ag duine ar bith, ag cúpla ar bith, ag fear nó banchéile ar bith má shaothraíonn an bheirt acu le chéile níos mó ná £37 sa tseachtain.  Ar ndóigh, chuirfidh sin ceardaithe eile as obair agus tá a fhios an an Teachta O.  Flanagan, an Rúnaí Parlaiminte don Aire Rialtais Áitiúil, tá a fhios aige go mhaith gurab iad na daoine atá os chionn £37 na daoine a thógann tithe nó a cheannaíonn tithe uaire agus ní bheidh deontas ar bith le fáil acu anois.</P>
    <P>Comh maith leis sin, níor chomhlíon an Rialtas an gheallúint a thugadar is go mbeadh íslú ar rátaí ar thithe príobháideacha.  I nDún na nGall tá £11 sa £ rátaí ar thithe.  Dá bhrí sin, in ionad an cháinfhaisnéis <Col N="1112" /> seo fiúntas a dhéanamh agus forbairt a dhéanamh maidir le gnó na tógála sé an rud a dhéanfaidh sé agus a dhéanfaidh iarrachtaí an Aire ná níos mó ceardaithe nó daoine atá anois ag obair i dtógáil tithe a chur as obair chomh maith leis an 8,000 atá ann faoi láthair.  Chomh maith leis an 8,000 duine sin tá, b'fhéidir, 16,000 duine ar fad ag obair ins na tionscail eile a bhaineann le tógáil tithe agus is féidir na daoine sin a chur ag obair má éisteann an Rialtas le comhairle Fhianna Fáil.  Thugamar ardú 50 faoin gcéad ar na deontais a bhí ann go dtí gur chuir an Teachta Tully ar cheal iad.  An féidir liom impí ar an Rúnaí Parlaiminte, An Teachta O.  Flanagan a chos a chur síos&mdash;mar deirtear go bhfuil sé go han mhaith ag an rud sin&mdash;agus a rá lena Aire: &ldquo;Ní chuirfidh mé suas le cealadh deontaisí do thithe úra.  Tá a lán daoine ar mo dhruim i Laois agus Ua Fháilghe atá ar tí tithe a thógáil agus nach féidir leo deontaisí a fháil.&rdquo;  An n-abródh sé leis an Aire: &ldquo;Cuir ar ais na deontaisí nó&mdash;&rdquo; agus beidh fhios ag an Aire cad tá i gceist aige? Sin slí amháin, agus sin an slí, chun na daoine atá dífhostaithe a chur ag obair, cuid díobh i mBangor Erris, mar a luaigh Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh.</P>
    <P>Is tábhachtach an rud í cáinfhaisnéis, mar is tríd an mheán sin gur féidir le Rialtas an dearcadh atá acu i dtaobh saol eacnamaíochta na tíre a chur i bhfeidhm.  Chomh maith le sin, ba cheart don cháinfhaisnéis an costas beatha a choimeád gan ardú ró-mhór ionas nach mbeidh an ionad éileamh ar ardaithe pá.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán maitheasa bheith ag caint leis an Rialtas seo faoin chostas beatha agus cáinfhaisnéis.  Mar adeir siad sa tír, ag an Rialtas seo bíonn cháinfhaisnéis gach seachtain sa bhliain agus ardaithe ar earraí riachtanacha go minic taobh amuigh den cháinfhaisnéis.  Dá bhrí sin, ní rud úr ar bith 10p nó 13p de cháin a chuir ar artola taobh amuigh de cháinfhaisnéis, mar a dhein an tAire an tseachtain seo caithe, sé sin, 10p anois agus 3p ar an chéad lá de Mhárta. Rinneadar an rud céanna roimh Nollaig i 1974.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> I rith díospóireacht ar an cháinfhaisnéis is féidir linn an t-ardú i bpraghasanna a phlé.  Go minic cheana féin cuireadh ardú ar phraghasanna i rith na Cásca, an tsamhraidh agus laethe saoire, agus ní raibh caoi ag an Dáil an cheist a phlé, agus &ldquo;sean-hata&rdquo; ab ea í nuair a tháinig an Dáil ar ais.</P>
    <P>Ní dheineann an cháinfhaisnéis seo ceachtar den dá rud sin, ach a mhalarit. Beidh ardu ar an chostas beatha de bharr na cánach atá curtha ar pheitreal agus ola a usáidtear i mbusanna agus i dtrucaill mhóra agus, chomh maith leis sin, an t-ardú ar cháin-bhóthair. Cuirfidh costas iompair earraí ardú ar phraghasanna bia.</P>
    <P>Bhíodar ag moladh a chéile thall ansin i dtaobh gan aon cháin a chur ar bia agus i dtaobh na subsidies a choimeád ar bia.  Níl aon amhras ach, de bharr tionchar na cáinfhaisnéise seo, go n-ardófar an costas beatha, go n-ardófar luach plúir, aráin, bainne agus mar sin de.  Ní bheidh tionscalaithe ábalta an méid céanna earraí a dhíol thar lear, agus beidh tuilleadh dífhostaíochta sa tír.</P>
    <P>An rud is measa a chím-se mar urlabhraí na Gaeltachta, ná a laghad atá d'iarthar na tíre agus go mór mhór don Ghaeltacht.  Tá dhá rud geallta ag Aire na Gaeltachta: (1) go gcuirfí ar bun Ùdarás na Gaeltachta; agus (2) go gcuirfí ar bun Bord Forbartha an Iarthair.  Níl mórán cainte futhu sin san cháinfhaisnéis, agus níl mórán airgid leagtha i leataobh dóibh anseo.  An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag Aire na Gaeltachta údarás fiúntach a chur ar siúl? An bhfuil raic sa Rialtas mar gheall air?  An bhfuil daoine ar an taobh sin den Teach in éadan udarás fónta a chur ar siúl don Ghaeltacht?  Sílim go bhfuil, agus go bhfuil an tAire ag ciceáil &ldquo;for touch&rdquo;.  Sílim go bhfuil tuarascála ag dul isteach ins na páipéir chun an talamh a dhéanamh réidh do chúlú ar an gheallúint sin.  Tá an talamh á réiteach.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil mé mí-cheart.  B'fhéidir&mdash;&mdash;</P>

An bhfuil aon airgead sa cháinfhaisnéis ag dul d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus do Bhord Forbartha an Iarthair dála geallúintí eile nár chomhlíonadh agus nach gcomhlíonfar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chomh fada agus a bhaineann an cháinfhaisnéis seo leis an iarthar agus leis an nGaeltacht, bhí áthas orainn go léir go raibh muintir na Gaeltachta, muintir an iarthair ag teacht le chéile chun comhoibriú a dhéanamh chun rudaí a dhéanamh dóibh féin.  Is maith an rud é sin agus tá mé cinnte go n-aontaíonn an tAire Airgeadais leis an bprionsabal sin agus gur gné an-mhaith de fhorbairt an iarthair é sin, daoine ag teacht le chéile, daoine óga gur gnáth leo dul <Col N="1115" /> go Sasana agus go tíortha eile thar lear.</P>
    <P>Anois tá siad ag teacht le chéile i ngnó na hiascaireachta, i ngnó na talamhaíochta ag ceannach stoic sna marts, ag cur tionscal beaga ar siúl, ag bunú comharchumainn&mdash;comharchumainn a bhí ag deighleáil le cuairteoirí ag teacht go dtí na Gaeltachta, cuairteoirí a bhí ag dul go dtí an iarthar, comharchumainn oideachais, scoileanna Gaeilge agus mar sin. Tugadh cabhair agus cuidiú do na comharchumainn sin agus cuireadh AnCO ar siúl chun traenáil a thabhairt. Nuair a bhí an Teachta Faulkner ag deighleáil leis an nGaeltacht cuireadh AnCO ar siúl i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill chun traenáil theicniciúil a chur ar fáil d'oibrithe sna monarchana, do dhaoine ag deighleáil le tionscal na hiascaireachta, cuairteoireacht agus mar sin de. Má fhéachann an tAire ar an scéal arís sílim féin go n-admhóidh sé gur ceart cuidiú agus tarrtháil, cuidiú teicniciúil agus eile, a thabhairt do dhaoine sa Ghaeltacht agus san iarthar go geinearálta a thagann le chéile, a oibríonn saor in aisce agus a chuidíonn le saol níos fearr a chur ar fáil do na daoine i gceantar ar bith ina bhfuil siad.</P>
    <P>Cad a dhéanann an tAire sa cháinfhaisnéis seo?  Cuireann sé iachall orthu cáin ioncaim ar phroifidí a íoc.  Sin céim ar gcúl.  Sin buille d'fhorbairt na Gaeltachta agus an iarthair.  Má chuireann daoine comharchumainn ar bun chun báid a cheannach chun iascairí a thraenáil le gléasanna nua-aimsire agus chun slí beatha níos fearr a dhéanamh agus más comharchumainn iad beidh cáin ioncaim le híoc ar phroifidí na gcomharchumann seo. Impím ar an Aire an rud sin a stopadh. Is féidir leis an Rialtas seo cúlú i go leor geallúintí.  Iarraim ar an Aire cúlú ón iarracht seo agus ón dtionchar a bhéas ar an rud seo imeasc na gcomharchumann ó Dhún na nGall go dtí Contae Chiarraí agus san iarthar go geinearálta.</P>
    <P>Tá gá mór le leabhair Ghaeilge, leabhair scoile&mdash;sa Béarla fosta&mdash;ach go speisialta leabhair scoile Gaeilge. Tá siad gann.  Tá gá leo agus tá comharchumann sa Ghaeltacht chun <Col N="1116" /> iad seo a chur ar fáil.  Ní hamháin a chuireann an tAire ardú cánach ó 6 faoin gcéad go dtí 10 faoin gcéad ar leabhair scoile don tír ar fad ach cuireann sé an cháin sin ar leabhair scoile san iarthar ach chomh maith leis sin má dheineann an comharchumann sin nó comharchumann ar bith eile brabús beidh a phúnt feola ag an Aire.  Ní ceart é sin.  Nílim ach ag tabhairt sampla amháin den rud atá ag tárlú.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine sa Rialtas a aontaíonn 100 faoin gcéad leis an méid atá á rá agam ar son comharchumann in iarthar na tíre istigh sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus sa tír ar fad chomh maith leis sin.  Anois na harduithe atá tagtha ar íocaíochtaí Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh.  Geallaim don Aire, an 80p ardú sa tseachtain ar dheontaisí Leasa Shóisialaigh, pé acu liúntais dhífhostaíochta nó pinsean seanaoise nó pinsean baintraí nó pé rud é, roimh Lá le Pádraig, déanfaidh an t-ardú a bhéas sa chostas beatha iad a chealú. Cintíonn an cháinfaisnéis sin.  Cé go ndúirt an tAire nach mbeadh aon ardú ar chursaí bia, tá arduithe ar bhia agus ar nithe eile.  Is féidir liom anois céad sompla a lua go bhfuil arduithe tagtha orthu le coicís anuas, abair, ó tugadh isteach an cháinfaisnéis.</P>
    <P>Le roinnt bhliain anuas rinneadh iarrachtaí chun tionscail a chur ar siúl in iarthar na tíre le cabhair deontaisí speisialta ach anois tá cáin ar charannaí, cáin ar pheitreal agus cáin ar ola do na monarchana.  Cén tionchar a bhéas aige sin ar fhorbairt agus ar dhul chun cinn san iarthar áit a bhfuil a lán taistil le déanamh ag oibrithe chun dul go dtí monarcha anseo nó ansiúd, turas mór fada le dul chun caladhphort chun iascaireacht a dhéanamh, an costas ar na hiascairí, cuir i gcás?  An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire aon chabhair a thabhairt d'iascairí gur gá dóibh ola úsáid ina gcuid bád?  Caithfidh siad ola agus peitreal a úsáid chun a gcuid iasc a thabhairt ó iarthar na hÉireann go dtí Baile Átha Cliath nó áit eile agus go speisialta chun iad a easpórtáil.  An mbeidh aon chabhair le fáil acu anois nó am ar bith i rith na bliana? An mbeidh aon chabhair le fáil ag na hiascairí mar cúiteamh i dtaobh na <Col N="1117" /> gcostas breise a chur an cháinfhaisnéis seo ar na hiascairí sin?  Laghdú pá a bhéas ann i ndeireadh na dála.</P>
    <P>Cad a thárlóidh do na monarchana má chuireann an cháinfhaisnéis seo ardú ar na hearraí a déantar ins na monarchana sin?  Má bhí sé deacair ag monarchana sa Ghaeltacht nó san iarthar na rothaí a choinneáil ag casadh go dtí seo, anois leis an cháin bhreise seo an mbeidh siad ábalta earraí a dhéanamh agus iad a dhíol taobh amuigh den tír?  An mbeidh an costas ró-mhór agus an mbeidh a thuilleadh de na monarchana san iarthar á dhúnadh an bhliain seo ná mar bhí anuraidh.  Leoga, dhruid níos mó monarcha san iarthar anuraidh ná mar ba mhaith linne an seo.  Tá níos mó acu tar éis dúnadh ná mar ba mhaith leis an Aire féin.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin tá mé mí-shuaimhneach mar gheall ar an cháinfhaisnéis seo.  Tá mé mí-shuaimhneach mar gheall ar an tionchar a bheidh aici ar an tír ar fad ach go speisialta an damáiste a dhéanfas sí d'iarthar na tíre, do Ghaeltacht na hÉireann agus do na daoine a chomhnaíonn ansin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O.J. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My memory takes me back to some 32 or 33 budgets since I became a Member of this House.  At a time when there was economic progress and stability throughout the world I clearly recall Fianna Fáil introducing some harsh, cruel, unreasonable, unwarranted and savage budgets.  Because of their extraordinary methods of economic planning they imposed unnecessary burdens and severe hardship on people at a time when the world economy was progressing satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Listening to Fianna Fáil speeches when they were in Opposition, I have often remarked that if they had been inspired by the same thoughts when in Government this could have been a reasonably prosperous country.  However, the situation is that Fianna Fáil never gave any serious thought at any time to long-term economic planning and this was clearly evident from the failure of the various economic plans they circulated and launched from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> There is a vast difference between this Government and Fianna Fáil in relation to the method of approach in economic matters.  I remember very clearly what happened some years ago. About ten days before the budget Ministers and Fianna Fáil spokesmen paraded through the country giving an assurance that they would not interfere with the food subsidies.  When there was absolutely no necessity for it they removed the food subsidies in the budget, caused severe hardship to the poorer sections of the community and welshed on the assurance they gave to the people prior to the budget.  When one compares that dishonesty with what happened this year one sees the straightforwardness and the honesty with which this Government introduced the budget.  Ministers have been warning the public that we would have a very difficult budget, that we would have one in which every single member of the community would feel the pinch.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that there is a vast difference between budgeting today and budgeting at a time when there is outstanding economic progress throughout the world.  One would imagine, listening to Fianna Fáil speakers and the special references they make occasionally to the National Coalition Government, that the rise in unemployment has been brought about because of the policy of the National Coalition.  They always fail to mention that in Britain the people there have felt the breeze from the hard economic winds far more severely than we have felt it in this country and that the unprecedented figures in Britain show that their economy cannot be described as progressive or expanding.</P>
    <P>Not since the great economic crisis in Germany after the war has there been such unemployment in that country. Even the great United States of America with its power, influence and wealth has been going through one of the most critical economic periods in its history.  Whilst the great powers of the United States, Germany, France and Britain were severely suffering from the world wide economic depression we had Fianna Fáil spokesmen going around the country saying it was the National Coalition Government who were responsible for that <Col N="1119" /> state of affairs.  They might as well say that the Coalition Government are responsible for the backlash of world wide depression.</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil spokesman who speaks of the rise in unemployment and points the finger of responsibility at the National Coalition Government might as well say that the Government are responsible for the economic difficulties throughout the rest of Europe and the world.  I very clearly recall that the first economic upset we had in the country was brought about maliciously and deliberately by Fianna Fáil.  This took place during a period when there were two by-elections, in Cork and Kildare, and because of their anxiety to hold on to office they deliberately upset the economy of the country in order to win those by-elections.  I recall, under Fianna Fáil, the time when unemployed people in this city marched through the streets and there were so many unemployed in one constituency there were sufficient to elect a Member to this House to represent them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary talking about 1956-57?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I clearly recall during the Fianna Fáil administration in recent years they showed such contempt for the farmers that they left them in the gutters of the streets of this city and Ministers stepped over them.  There must be many Deputies with the same memories that I have. It is quite alarming to hear Fianna Fáil speak of the rising numbers of unemployed.  I want to assure the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and every Member who sits behind him that when they were in office with large overall majorities to implement any ideas they had, economic or otherwise, and at a time in which there was no question of unfavourable economic winds blowing either in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, there were 80,000 unemployed people in the country and at least 45,000 school leavers and others emigrated each year.  This brought it to a total of at least 125,000 people in normal times out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This took place during a period in <Col N="1120" /> which Fianna Fáil had an overall majority and there was no question of world wide inflation or no question of this country feeling the backlash of unfavourable economic winds.  We have seen the cream of Irish manhood denied the right of working in their own country, forced from the shores of the country to Britain or the United States at a time when there was no question of inflation in the country. This was at a time when there was world wide economic stability.  Because of mishandling, misjudgment and the implementation of self-designed, power-crazy and irresponsible policies of Fianna Fáil this economic position prevailed and was allowed to continue. Under Fianna Fáil we had extraordinary emigration which is now non-existent.</P>
    <P>The number of people emigrating from this country today is, perhaps, the lowest on record, simply because there are no jobs for them in Britain and there is a restriction on emigration to the United States, Australia and Canada.  Therefore, people must remain at home.  During many years of Fianna Fáil Government there were at least 135,000 people per year in search of employment and that compares rather favourably with the present figures, having regard to the fact that we have no emigration at present.  The unemployed, under Fianna Fáil were on the very borderline of starvation. At the time they elected a Member to this House they had £3 a week on which to live.  Nobody in Fianna Fáil seemed to worry or care.  The unemployed were not people of influence under Fianna Fáil and they were not to be provided for.  There's a vast difference between Fianna Fáil and the present Government.  It is the aim of everybody to have people in productive employment but if there are factors outside the control of the Government that render unemployment an unwelcome necessity this Government believe that provision must be made to ensure that people have a reasonable standard of living.  It is far from the standard of living we would wish for them and far from the happiness of the security of a good job in their own <Col N="1121" /> country but when people are out of work through no fault of their own and through no fault of the Government they are being provided for in the best possible way that the economic condition of the State will allow. The Government believe in doing that. That is why social welfare and unemployment benefits have been increased in this budget.  The benefits payable to the old have been increased as have those to the unmarried mother who was not even thought of by Fianna Fáil.  This Government believe in assisting those whose influence is limited so that they will not suffer from the effects of inflation or because of present economic conditions.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Government on their foresight and on the Christian manner in which they have put first things first, looking after the old, the sick, the unmarried mothers, the sections of the community which for many years were calling out for a favourable ear and a favourable eye from Fianna Fáil.  I remember the late Dr. O'Higgins and the late John A. Costello tabling a motion for discussion in this House asking for an increase of 2/6d the equivalent of 6 new pence per week in old age pensions.  At a time of great economic stability and worldwide prosperity Fianna Fáil could not and would not provide it.  All of us are very glad to have a Government who are prepared to listen and who are prepared to consider the circumstances of the old, the sick and the unemployed. The late President Kennedy made many worthwhile and sensible utterances in the White House, in Parliament and elsewhere.  He was a man who had a great deal of common sense and intelligence, a man much maligned today by the gutter Press who would not have the courage to publish when he was alive the things they are publishing when he has been many years dead.  He once said that a country that cannot look after its poor cannot long afford to defend its rich. How right the late President Kennedy was.  There is a bounden duty on a Government to look after the poorer sections of the community.  This is something Fianna Fáil failed to do. <Col N="1122" /> Under this Government the poorer sections have been given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are very disappointed with this budget.  When the Minister for Finance was speaking here on budget day one could see the disappointment written on the countenance of each Fianna Fáil Deputy.  The Government were honest enough to tell the people in advance that this would be a hard budget and nobody denies that it is.  Because of that warning Fianna Fáil believed that it would not be possible for the Government to increase social welfare benefits. They were convinced that the Minister would substantially raise income tax and that they would have something worthwhile to talk about.</P>
    <P>Instead of increasing income tax he increased the allowances, about which people had been crying for years.  Despite the harsh economic climate and the severe backlash of world inflation, this was a marvellous achievement by the Minister for Finance.  He increased social welfare benefits not by the paltry sixpence or shilling as in the days of Fianna Fáil but by the largest percentage the economic circumstances would permit, at the same time increasing the income tax allowances of all who work.  Workers have been approaching me asking for such an adjustment in allowances and I want to thank the Minister for this considerable easement of the taxpayers' lot.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of income tax I would be remiss if I did not refer to the co-operatives who as a result of this budget will be liable for income tax.  I could never understand why any profit making undertaking should be exempt.  This has now been put right and many of the big co-operatives and supermarkets will come into the net.  They were in competition with small country shopkeepers and other small concerns which were put to the pin of their collars to exist.  The co-ops had the advantage over them of being tax-free while the small country shopkeeper had to make his returns and pay his tax.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister particularly in this respect because the tax <Col N="1123" /> laws should be fair and just.  If one trading group are obliged to pay income tax no other trading group should be excepted and given freedom from income tax.  That injustice has been put right and income tax is being applied to all without fear, favour or exception.  Nobody likes to pay income tax but a taxpayer will always be fearful that perhaps his neighbour or his colleague is not paying his fair share.  Therefore, the Minister was right in trying to achieve a situation through which all will be treated in the same way.  An unfair distribution of the tax burden would mean that some sections would be hit more heavily than others and this would be most undesirable.  Many such anomalies are being eliminated in this budget and I again compliment the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>From time to time many people complain about the severity of taxation. I should like to hear from Fianna Fáil&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach put this to them earlier&mdash;what their solution would be if they were in power.  They want services increased but they do not want to pay for them and they do not tell us the means they would adopt.  Fianna Fáil are completely bankrupt of any policy.  They have not got one and they are not able on radio, television or in this House to tell the people where they would get the money to maintain the services. The present Government have had to face expenditure of a level unheard of a few years ago.  For example, there is the £157 million for social security. That sum would do a vast amount of work in the Gaeltacht; it would provide a nice contribution towards the housing problem in this city; it would provide an enormous amount of relief in general taxation, and if it were given to the local authorities, £157 million would be reflected in a great many extra workers being employed by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Here we have a new situation in which the taxpayer is obliged to foot a bill of £157 million in order that people may live in safety, that they have a degree of security and that the <Col N="1124" /> institutions of State may be maintained and defended, that the Parliament in which we speak as elected representatives of the people may continue to be the medium by which we express the will and the wishes of the people who send us here.</P>
    <P>It is a sad state of affairs that we should have reached the stage that taxpayers are obliged to pay to the tune of £157 million in order that they may be secure in their homes at night time, so that the people may have the Parliament which was won at very great sacrifice and so that that Parliament may continue to be the supreme authority in the country.  A responsible Government will not allow a situation to develop where sufficient provision is not made for the safety of every citizen and for the security of the State and in order to ensure that the laws passed by the Legislature are put into effect.  In any progressive society there must be a code of conduct and of law.  The code of law for a good society is made in the elected Parliament and it is only Parliament who can enact that code, which is to be obeyed by all without exception as representing the majority voice of the people through the majority voice of Parliament.  It is regrettable that in order to remain a democracy having the institutions of State so jealously built up an Irish Government should have to call on the taxpayer for £157 million as a contribution towards self-protection, the preservation of life and the safeguarding of property.</P>
    <P>This bill is one which Fianna Fáil had not to meet but which the present Government have to meet.  If of necessity the bill has to grow higher there is not a single taxpayer who will have any hesitation in providing generously for the safeguarding of his own life and property, the preservation of Parliament, the preservation of democracy, the preservation of the Garda and the Army.  The respect for the law passed by this House is worth every penny piece of the amount spent.  Let us hope and trust for the return of a period of common sense, of sanity and respect for authority so that this extraordinary imposition on the taxpayer may be <Col N="1125" /> lightened.  It can only be lightened by the taxpayers themselves giving their utmost co-operation, admiration and respect to the forces subject to this House.</P>
    <P>I understand that Deputy Wilson made a reference to the printing of a new Irish-English dictionary in Hong Kong.  If there is any little item about which Fianna Fáil can raise a bit of mischief and endeavour to discredit the Government, they will use it.  Deputy Wilson should have made inquiries before he made an allegation of this kind.  First, it is right to put on record that 97 per cent of Government purchases are of Irish origin.  In regard to the Irish-English dictionary, the total contract was worth about £1,000. It was a hard cover edition for libraries only.  It was purchased for the Talbot Press.  It is right to place on record that the Minister for Education did not give any grant towards the publication of this edition and that not a penny piece of Irish taxpayers' money went for this publication.</P>
    <P>Again, it is right to say that this edition was produced by the Talbot Press for the Educational Company of Ireland.  This is a completely private transaction in which the Minister for Education or any other Minister had no say whatever.  The printing was handled, as I have said, by the Talbot Press, a subsidiary of the Educational Company.  It is also right to say that the type-setting was done in Ireland and that 9,000 hard-back copies were printed in Hong Kong at a cost of £2,730.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>To be within the scope of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill the trade unions and employers in a particular firm will need to agree formally that the introduction of the principle of equal pay in the firm or business would lead to unemployment. The Labour Court will also, after investigation, have to authenticate the agreement of the trade unions and employers.  The agreement of trade unions or workers is therefore necessary before any proposal to defer equal pay can be successful.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of firms involved or the number of women workers who are likely to be affected by the Bill.  My own view is that because of the extremely stringent conditions the number of workers will be very small.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister explain, first of all, what will happen in the event of no agreement being reached?  Secondly, how can he hope to defend the case that will be taken to the European Commission in view of the fact that so little information appears to be available to him as to the number of workers involved in the private sector?  Does it not appear that no research has been done either by him or his Department into the problems that exist in this area?</P>

      <P>No. I think it is better sometimes in the interests of accuracy to describe things as they are.  The exemption gives power to unions in firms where jobs are threatened to avail of the exemption.  It is not for me to say how many firms will avail of this exemption.  That is a matter for the organised workers to say.  In relation to the other part of the question relating to agreement with Brussels, this necessity is of course there and, if the authorities in Brussels think it should not be there <Col N="1128" /> for organised workers, then of course the Act will apply to the full extent.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question regarding the number of women employed in the private sector under the various categories is in the form of a tabular statement and, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate the information in the Official Report.  The information has been extracted from the census of population, 1971, and relates to females at work classified by industrial group.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I should point out that in order to come within the scope of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and thus have a legal entitlement to equal pay, a woman would require to be engaged on like work with men in the same employment.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of women involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures aimed at ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers engaged in offshore oil and gas exploration, call for legislation separate from statutes at present administered by me.  I am, accordingly, preparing draft heads of a Bill to cover the <Col N="1132" /> safety, health and welfare of workers engaged in offshore oil and gas exploration. What I shall be aiming at will be legislation of an enabling character under which I can make a series of regulations governing specific matters including, where appropriate, those of the type mentioned by the Deputy, with flexibility to deal with possible changes that may take place in such matters as working procedures or techniques.</P>
    <P>I have set up a working party on the manpower and training implications of offshore oil and gas development. I cannot, at present, say what this working party might have to report in regard to medical personnel. I shall of course be in contact with the Minister for Health on the matter.</P>

There are two separate issues here.  One, in view of the dangerous work involved on rigs in North Sea oil exploration, a panel of doctors should be drawn up.  My second point deals with the Employment Acts which may be under his jurisdiction now.  Assuming the exploration is successful, how will he proceed in these matters?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the redundancies in question.  When this firm went into receivership in April, 1975, there were 274 people employed but the numbers were reduced through redundancies until there were only 143 employed at the time of closure in July, 1975.  Two hundred and thirty-two of those made redundant in 1975 qualified for redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department have interviewed the redundant workers.  Jobs were found for as many as possible and others were advised about retraining opportunities. However, 131 of the workers made redundant in 1975 are still registered as unemployed.</P>
      <P>I have been in touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding the creation of new jobs and I am informed that, within a five-mile radius of the area, a number of new projects established with IDA assistance will, between them, provide over 700 jobs at full production.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any question of a general change in working hours and the effect of such a change on remuneration would be matters for negotiation between trade unions and employers under collective bargaining procedures.  Working hours are dealt with in the various national agreements, including that in operation at present.  The implication in the Deputy's question that reduced standard working hours would alleviate present unemployment is, to say the least, a questionable one; a <Col N="1135" /> number of other factors have to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to point out that where excessive levels of overtime are being worked it would be advantageous for an employer, where feasible, to recruit extra workers and thereby benefit under the premium employment programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the building and construction industry is the one industry which can quickly generate employment and uses home produced products, does the Minister not feel that, when there are more than 117,000 unemployed, any assistance which will put new life into the industry should be provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy of the major assistance given to the industry in the last two budgets.  The recent budget provided over £100 million for investment in housing.  The previous budgets were also designed to assist the building industry, which is not to say that there is not, as there is in every country at present which is suffering from unemployment, severe recession in the building and construction industry. I would not like to leave the Deputy with the impression that this Government have done nothing to assist the building and construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that to relate sums of money for different years without any reference to spiralling inflation is pure nonsense.  Would he agree that with over 25 per cent of building workers unemployed, and with over 8,000 more unemployed at present than there were last year, it is imperative he should include this industry in the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that we examined it very closely indeed.  There were difficulties of a character which made it impossible to introduce the premium employment programme as devised into that industry.  There is the great difficulty of inter-firm mobility, the seasonal nature of the industry and the added difficulty of applying a base figure which was the foundation of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the difficulty of introducing that into the construction industry. We have had several meetings with the federation.  It is the viewpoint of the people in my Department <Col N="1137" /> who have gone into this very deeply, on my instructions, that it would not be possible to introduce the programme into the construction industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea as to how he might increase the employment in the industry, or reduce the unemployment?  There are now 22,000 building workers unemployed. When he speaks of the money provided in the budget for building, does he realise that Dublin Corporation do not yet know how much money they will get for building in the coming year?</P>

I would say that eight years is very exceptional.</P>

Will the Minister agree that there is a trend of thought abroad that the Land Commission attempt to get back some of the money they paid by setting the land and that when it is eventually handed over it is in a worse state than when they acquired it?  I would ask the Minister not to dismiss my question lightly because it is based on experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am satisfied it is exceptional.  Letting land for tillage is very exceptional. It has only come about in recent times in the west where there has been a direct, and I think a reasonable, request that the Land Commission <Col N="1164" /> should permit tillage in order to ensure a supply of beet for the Tuam factory.  I must say that has my benediction within reason.  I will give the Deputy some figures in this matter. In 1972 there were 129,726 acres on hand while at the present time there are only 108,430 acres on hand.  The work is going on and it is improving. I want to make it clear to the House that I am exhorting the Land Commission, and will continue to do so, to get rid of land as quickly as they can. It is no pleasure to me to see land being held on hands for a long time but one swallow, or even 20 swallows, do not make a summer.  I do not accept that a period of eight or ten years is normal&mdash;it is exceptional.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Bhí mé ag iarraidh a chur in iúl do mhuintir na tíre seo glacadh leis an mBille go fáilteach chun cabhrú leis an Aire agus le pé údarás a bhéas ann chun ainmhithe agus bláthanna atá sa tír seo nó a bhí agus atá ag imeacht go han-tapaidh ar fad a shábháil agus roinnt eile a chur ar ais ina n-áit dhúchais chun go mbeidh an tír i bhfad níos fearr ná mar atá sí anois.</P>
      <P>Before reporting progress on this Bill on 22nd January, I had recorded my welcome for this measure which I regarded, however belatedly, as man's pact with nature.  It is not a condescending or patronising pact of the strong or superior animal for his inferiors but one that arises from the awareness of man now that he must take notice of the fact that day by day, week by week and year by year the fauna and flora in this country have been disappearing at a rate that in some cases indicates ultimate extinction. Unless man takes notice of that fact and takes appropriate measures we will reach the stage where we will be much the poorer.  I said that if the flora and fauna disappear it will not be possible in some cases to recover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that one case does not prove the rule but I indicated what I regarded as some of the problems existing in this respect.  I pointed out my own personal experience, how some years ago in common with other landowners who were concerned with getting the best value out of the land we removed trees, hedgerows, ditches, dykes, shrubberies and copses from our land.  This was done in order to get better value out of the land but in doing this we contributed to the elimination of wildlife.  I indicated in the light of my own experience that were it not for the fact that operating in our area, operating under section 15 of the 1930 Act, gun clubs and game councils made representations to me in respect of the game that might be on my small bit <Col N="1183" /> of land and indicated to me their preparedness to protect whatever game might be there.  Were it not for the efforts of those good people who are doing this in their spare time, voluntary organisations recognised by the Department, the occasional pheasant which is there at the moment would have disappeared.  In those few areas there is what will constitute quite a problem for the Minister in the administration of the legislation we are here discussing.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicates that there is provision for consultation with other agencies in respect of agriculture, drainage and other operations.  I served for a while as a civil servant. Civil servants are no different from other people.  Civil servants are mindful of a statutory obligation that may lie upon them but my experience is that they were not always very responsive to anything that was vague regarding their duties.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may anticipate the preparedness of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Local Government or other State agencies to consult with him, I do not think that in the absence of a statutory requirement they will be prepared to yield to him in certain cases where he can demonstrate that their proposals are antagonistic to or in conflict with what he desires and what might be regarded as the spirit of the Wildlife Bill.  In that I see a weakness in the measures here before us and on Committee Stage I hope to submit recommendations to the Minister which may help to provide a better <i>modus operandi.</i></P>
    <P>This might be regarded as a very big Bill.  It is an amalgam of the 1930 Protection of Wild Birds Act and the Game Preservation Act of the same year.  In assessing the benefit of the new proposal I have tried to extract the provisions already in existence from those now presented to us.  I must admit to a certain disappointment. I refer especially to section 13, which refers to the establishment of a wildlife advisory council.  The reference here is somewhat vague.  My first <Col N="1184" /> reaction was that the Minister intended to proceed immediately to involve all the local agencies, the voluntary agencies to which I have referred, the gun clubs and the game councils, who would co-operate with him in this very important work and that the advisory council represented the acme of that.</P>
    <P>I have studied the legislation and having regard to what is written down and it would seem that there is no guarantee in the Bill that the Minister will establish the wildlife advisory council. The explanatory note indicates that it provides for the establishment of the council.  I should like to see in the Bill a date before which it must be established.  I see in the council the very nub of the matter.  The area of jurisdiction of the Bill extends over 17 million acres of land and water. Successful administration can be achieved only if as many as possible of the people of Ireland are involved.</P>
    <P>In passing, may I suggest that in calmer and quieter times in Ireland, when the mention of a gun will not be as emotive or as fearful as it is now, this would be a matter in respect of which our area of jurisdiction might extend beyond that part of Ireland which at the moment is ours and we could show our co-operation by acknowledging the sportsmen of the Six Countries in the same way as we acknowledge the sportsmen of the Twenty-six Counties and provide in this legislation for an all-Ireland area as against a Twenty-six Counties area. I say that <i>en passant.</i></P>
    <P>We have noticed especially in the last ten years that there is a hunger among the people to be involved. There has been great emphasis and many references to community effort. This is one area where community effort is vital.  It is one area where we must consult with people and organisations. If you want the co-operation in the attainment of any goal it is very sensible to seek co-operation.  Indeed, such co-operation is beneficial to oneself. We hear a great deal about worker participation and we all want worker participation.  This evolves from the realisation that the worker wants to be involved.  He wants some <Col N="1185" /> recognition beyond merely standing beside a machine.  That is understandable.</P>
    <P>If we want the co-operation of the people at large we must involve them in preparation, in discussion and consultation in regard to the ultimate goals.  Apart from that we must give them some power.  This is where I am critical of the Bill.  Section 13 refers to the Minister consulting with the council.  The Minister talks about the freedom of the council to consult with him.  It does not say at any point that there is any obligation on the Minister to do anything the council might request him to do.  I do not think people are responsive to that kind of situation.  I do not think you will get people's co-operation in that kind of situation.  I enjoy membership of certain committees, councils and institutes.  I would not serve on any committee unless I was happy in the knowledge that I as part of that committee had some power.  People nowadays want recognition beyond merely consultative status.</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to refer to section 31 of the 1930 Act which gives power to the Minister to appoint a consultative council.  It does not say that he shall do so.  It merely says he may do so.  That is fairly significant because he never did appoint a consultative council.  Will the same situation obtain under this?  The Bill says the Minister shall appoint a council, but it does not say when.  We will probably agree to the appointing of this council but it is not good government and it is not good administration to expect people to agree to the establishment of what can be regarded as something extremely vital to the whole operation of these provisions without there being some indication of the specific function and powers of that council.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with what I would regard as involvement outside the bureaucratic system.  I am relating my remarks now to what I know was achieved by voluntary organisations in this area and to the traditional antipathy that exists, however unfortunate, between the citizen and institutions of the State.  Here I will admit <Col N="1186" /> unashamedly that 15 or 20 years ago when a gentleman approached me asking for my co-operation in respect of protecting game on my small piece of land the same co-operation would not have been forthcoming from me had I been approached by a representative of a Government Department. However sad that is it is nevertheless true and I think it reflects the attitude of many a landowner much bigger than I am.</P>
    <P>I see in this measure less provision for the involvement of voluntary organisations than existed heretofore. What is required is of course an intensification of co-operation.  Section 15 of the 1930 Act gave power to the Minister to recognise voluntary organisations. It gave to these organisations the right to go to a landowner and ask him to cede his shooting rights. I doubt if an owner would have ceded these rights to a Government Department or to the representative of a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I am striving here to identify in this legislation the recognition which heretofore obtained in respect of voluntary organisations.  Section 14 provides for the establishment of boards to administer any service and provide for future needs.  I cannot see in that section any accommodation for the contribution existing at the moment from voluntary organisations. I cannot see it in respect of the advisory council since I do not know when it will be established and I do not know who will be on it.  There is a general reference to the effect that there will be representatives of agriculture, horticulture, science, the environment, and game and sporting clubs.  I am convinced from what I see here that this council will have no power in the wide world.  I am convinced they will have no power beyond the right to discuss matters with the Minister if they or he so desire.  In these enlightened times I do not believe that people who have respect for their views and their time will be happy serving on such a council.  I do not propose at this stage to develop that point to any great extent but, in the clarification of that point, <Col N="1187" /> I see the success or failure of this legislation.  All the other measures which refer to preservation of certain areas, the protection of certain species of flora and fauna are, as far as I am concerned, conditional on how we can involve the people.  It is the people themselves who must act as conservators and protectors.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to certain offences. In one of the explanatory notes reference is made to members of the Garda.  In some areas where the flora and fauna abound there are no Garda stations.  They have been closed.  How can we rely on the absent members of the Garda to carry out the measures in this Bill?  In the area from Westport to Leenane, a distance of 20 miles, there is no Garda station although there is a certain amount of wild flora and fauna.  Who will protect this, if offences are committed? Will the gardaí come from Westport or Leenane?  I do not think so.  In some rural stations there are only one or two gardaí.  Surely it is not expected that the responsibilities which devolve from this legislation will fall on these overworked gardaí? Therefore, it is necessary that we should indicate whether we intend setting up special boards and will have certain personnel who will have special powers under this legislation. If we are willing the end&mdash;and this is to be commended&mdash;we must indicate the means.  Otherwise, the legislation will not get the respect it deserves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am quoting an extreme case but who will prosecute the unenlightened citizen who lights a fire within a mile of a forest?  Surely it is not expected that a member of the Garda will be available for this work however desirable it might be?  What will happen to a farmer who shoots an eagle because he assumes it is going to take his chickens?  Under this legislation will he have the right to do that?  Admittedly, I have given two extreme examples but I have mentioned them to show that we must have a clearer indication of how the legislation will be executed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> I cannot differentiate, as the Minister has done, between formal and informal education.  For my part as an educationist, there is no such thing. Having said that, I am mindful that it has been the fashion over the years to say that there is a difference between formal and informal education. The Minister referred to the presentday concept of formal school education. We are accepting that in our schools today there is a greater need for instructing people in gerunds, trigonometry, higher and lower maths, than there is about giving them lessons on their environment and life.  That is an approach which we must remove immediately.  Formal education refers to the life of the child as much as it refers to these academic and technical matters which masquerade as education.</P>
    <P>What should be the immediate concern of the Department of Lands in administering this scheme?  In my view, they should consult with the Department of Education with a view to developing further the classes already being held and instruction already being given in environmental studies.  It is described in the national school curriculum at the moment as nature studies.  The child will be much more attracted to that than to difficult lessons about the tuiseal ginideach or the módh coinníollach.  There will be no difficulty in getting his full sympathy.  He will act as the agent. Perhaps the child will help the adult in the realisation of the need which exists for the honouring of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have some difficulty in convincing the farmer of the need and the advisability of postponing the achievement of what might be regarded as an immediate benefit, a short-term benefit.  I am talking about the farmer living in the midst of wild life, the farmer who is fortunate enough to be living in an area where the lark sings in the still clear air. It will be difficult to convince him that he should forgo some immediate gain in the interests of retaining that way of life.  Apart from other considerations, he is now in the position in which I and many other people on the eastern coast were some years <Col N="1189" /> ago.  Without thinking about it we foolishily accepted that nature was infinite and that wild life, fauna and flora, were not finite.  They are.</P>
    <P>If that person were to talk to some of his counterparts on this side of the country where the pursuit of good husbandry has led to the exclusion of the thrush and the blackbird, the cuckoo and the corncrake, the wren, the finch and the linnet, the cowslip, the primrose, the dog daisy and the bluebell, he would realise that the price paid for that was not worth it. The financial gain has now disappeared. In normal times you can recover money.  You cannot make a recovery with the same facility in the matter of fauna and flora.  I appreciate that it will be difficult to sell that to any farmer.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether ample provision is made here.  We talk about asking people and consulting them.  Where a farmer is prepared to co-operate, it would be worth the State's while to render to him appropriate compensation, financial compensation if that is what he requires or desires.  In regard to the operations of the Office of Public Works in arterial drainage, it will be very difficult to convince them that at times there will be an obligation on them to forego what might be regarded as an exceptionally important operation even if, on balance, it can be shown that the short-term advantage would be outweighed by the long-term disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The success of this Bill depends on the placing of restraints and the acceptance of compromise where it can be shown that what is proposed would be seriously prejudicial to what is embodied here and to what I am quite sure represents the aims and the objects of all the people in the country.  I have highlighted the points I wanted to highlight.  I should like to refer briefly to one or two other points which I hope the Minister will clarify when replying.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we read indications of the anticipated establishment of oil refineries.  Oil refineries are necessary and can be accommodated on certain parts of our coastline, but certainly <Col N="1190" /> not in Dublin.  I should like the Minister to indicate what provision is being made&mdash;I know he cannot legislate for what happens on the high seas&mdash;for damage which could be done by oil spillages coming close to our coastline and into our river estuaries.  We anticipate anti-pollution legislation but should we not have something in these proposals which might be regarded as complementary to that legislation?</P>
    <P>Might I remind the House in passing of how certain species of flora and fauna have disappeared and of the references by Irish poets and writers down the years to birds and animals which at the time of writing were in Ireland but which have now disappeared?  I would refer to things philosophical in Ireland as manifested in proverbs in the Irish language.  We visualise a teacher in front of a class quoting the Irish proverb about the gobadán: &ldquo;Ní féidir leis an ngobadán an dá thrá a fhreastail&rdquo;.  Where is the gobadán today?  &ldquo;Céard a dhéanfadh mac an chait ach luch a mharú?&rdquo; We have the cat and the luch, but there are hundreds of references in Irish proverbs to birds and animals which, though not extinct are now very rare and certainly unseen in the countryside.</P>

      <P>Tá sí agat fós, bail ó Dhia ort.  I have a note here to confirm the case I was endeavouring to make for the involvement of agents outside the Minister's Department.  I mention the great work that has been done by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí in the matter of Irish music.  They have done work I think could not have been done by any State agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of the licence to the non-resident, in respect of which I indicated that I hoped we might accommodate an amendment which would not look upon a person from the Six Counties as a non-resident, but in respect <Col N="1193" /> of people who could be correctly regarded as aliens, I should like to know what the position is <i>vis-á-vis</i> ourselves and EEC regulations on that. I presume that has been explored.  I am basing my remarks on what were basically superficial chats with officials in Brussels.  I gather that in respect of any legislation that may be introduced the entire country could never appear to be discriminating against any member of the bloc, in respect of the two types of licence.</P>
    <P>Would it be wise, where the Minister proposes to include sections of other forestry Acts&mdash;it is done here in the interest of wildlife&mdash;to put in stipulations in respect of that?  I am sure the Minister knows that forestry does not guarantee the preservation of wildlife. On the contrary, in respect of coniferous forests it can be shown that it is detrimental to wildlife.  In the event of the Minister taking lands I wonder would it be mandatory on him to plant a type of tree complementary to what is required in this legislation rather than detrimental.  If the Minister proposes taking land, or developing forests of a certain nature, those forests, while they may afford protection for the fox or rabbit are not forests that help the fauna or flora. Would it be desirable to put in a provision in respect of the lands the Minister would take under this Bill guaranteeing that there should be deciduous trees to help rather than destroy wildlife?</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the fact that Deputy Lemass, before assuming responsibility as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, expressed an interest in the environment and wildlife and I am sure the House will benefit from his contribution.  I look upon the Bill as one which will involve the Opposition more on Committee Stage than on Second Stage.  I look forward to the other contributions and the reply of the Minister to my points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to be pernickety I should like to state that we were told that other business was being ordered for today and it was not until lunchtime that I was made aware of the change.  I would have been pleased to have had the <Col N="1194" /> opportunity to sort out my notes, some of which date back to the original Bill.  I have had an interest in this type of legislation since 1961.  In 1962 Prince Bernhardt of the Netherlands, who has since been awarded a Nobel Prize for his work for wildlife and in the environmental field, said at a wildlife fund dinner in London that we were dreaming of conquering space, we were already preparing a conquest of the moon but if we were going to treat other planets as we were treating our own we had better leave the moon, Mars and Venus strictly alone.  He said we were poisoning the air over our cities, the rivers, the seas and the soil itself.</P>
      <P>Having considered the seriousness of those remarks I am sure the House will agree that we have waited long enough for this Bill.  As far as I am concerned there is no question of it being opposed on Second Stage.  During a by-election campaign which was won by the present Minister for Justice, the Government gave the go-ahead to the Minister for Lands to commence work on legislation of this nature.  Unfortunately, there was a change in administration politically and in the civil service, and although good progress was made we found ourselves going through the same argument over and over again.  I am aware of the problems this Minister must have had to cope with to get the Bill approved, and the fact that I am so aware will prevent me being critical of some loose ends I see in it.</P>
      <P>While this Bill was going through the Seanad a large number of amendments were adopted.  Instead of saying that there are many inadequacies in the Bill I should like to state that we are all happy to see the Bill before the House and I hope it will be processed without much delay or difficulty. I recall a person saying: &ldquo;Happy is he who keeps the ancient bargain with the earth&rdquo;, a good saying and if we break that bargain for economic or political reasons unborn generations will not forgive us for our foolishness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a Parliamentary Secretary I was concerned mostly about the national parks.  We had difficulty with <Col N="1195" /> the Department of Lands because we were aware that the pines from the softwood trees could destroy the undergrowth thereby eliminating various animals.  However, life adapts itself to its surroundings.  Man has survived many changes in our climate and atmosphere and we have survived changes in our diet and way of life.</P>
    <P>Now we are asking men and animals to adapt themselves to some 500 new chemical pesticides, about 20 new pesticides appearing on the market each year.  Prior to the Second World War, all insecticides were derived from naturally occurring minerals and plant products.  Now they are synthetically produced; not only can they poison but they can enter the human body and conceivably can prevent the normal functions of body organs in man and animal. In the fifties and probably in the sixties this attack was intensified.  Of the pre-war insecticides, as far as I remember, arsenic was the most prevalent. So far as man is concerned there is a definite relationship between arsenic and malignant diseases.</P>
    <P>The previous Administration recognised the diversity of responsibility with regard to the various departmental involvements.  During the years I have tried to press for a separate Ministry for the Environment. What the present Government received when they took up office was a little more than a declaration of intent.  More work was required at the time in order to get agreement on the final terms of the measure before us. In the interests of all of us we must hope that the Government will get on with the job, no matter what amalgamation or rationalisation measures are required in the governmental structures.</P>
    <P>At present several Departments and State agencies are concerned with the problems of planning and the environment.  The Department of Lands are concerned with forestry, general woodlands, wildlife and forest parks.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is concerned with fresh water habitats.  The Minister for Local Government has <Col N="1196" /> general responsibility for planning control of amenities and so on under the Planning Acts.  However, it goes further than this because the Minister for Transport and Power has responsibility for Bord na Móna and, I presume, for the habitats in the boglands, as well as for the future of the bogs.  He is also responsible for CIE who will be involved with the wildlife on railway banks which are the property of the board.  In addition, through the Office of Public Works, the Minister for Finance is responsible not just for national parks but for scenic history, recreational habitats, the River Shannon navigation, historic, artistic, architectural and archaeological monuments.  An Foras Forbartha have responsibility for maintenance of habitats not covered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or by Bord na Móna, while An Foras Talúntais have responsibility for heath and moorland, items of geological interest and soil types.  It is clear that this division of responsibility cannot be allowed to continue.  I regard the measure before us as only one step in the right direction to overcome the problems that must arise when inter-departmental and semi-State interests come into conflict.</P>
    <P>In the first part of his address to the House, the Minister said the Bill was designed to provide an up-to-date effective statutory framework.  My worry is how more effective we can make it.  I have a feeling that a good deal of work will have to be done on Committee Stage to make it effective, certainly more effective than it is at the moment.  Commercial forestry can destroy the flora and fauna and this could lead to a conflict between the Minister for Lands and other Ministers or the State agencies to which I have referred.  However, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister and to his predecessor for the magnificent work that has been done on the forest parks.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of chemicals, I would regard this as responsible for the elimination of many of our birds and much of our fish stocks. I would point out to the Minister that unless he or one of his colleagues introduces <Col N="1197" /> effective control there will be a tremendous danger, including the fact that many of the chemicals cannot be detected by ordinary scientific means.</P>
    <P>Recently mysterious diseases killed our game fish.  I read that the source of the disease had been detected but subsequently when there was another outbreak I read that there must be another source.  In that regard I should like to tell the Minister that there was a similar problem in Pennsylvania where it was found that nearby orchards had been sprayed with pesticides some of which drained into the streams and rivers.  The authorities there came to the conclusion that the spraying of orchards led to disease.  I am not claiming to be technically proficient on these matters but I have read about them and I wondered if there was a similar source with regard to salmon disease.  If we could regulate the type of insecticide that could be applied at various places, depending on our river stock and on our bird stocks and having regard to our flora and fauna, we could control the amount of pesticides that would go into our rivers.</P>
    <P>Apart from fish stocks being threatened by the pollution of our rivers by insecticides, there are other dangers. Cancer-producing agents could be introduced into the rivers from which we take our water supplies.  In Holland in the fifties it was found that cities getting their drinking water from rivers had a higher death rate from cancer than those getting it from wells. Doctor W.C. Hueper of the National Cancer Institute of the USA said that the danger of cancer from the consumption of contaminated drinking water will grow considerably in the near future.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of living things in the soil and each of them has some contribution to make to the soil.  The common worm, I understand, digs down to the black soil and then comes up and relieves himself.  Darwin said that he adds, I think, a half inch to the the top soil every ten years.  There are thousands of smaller creatures in the soil which are all the time aerating and fertilising and keeping the soil productive. <Col N="1198" /> We can say that they support the earth's green mantle.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that in many shops there is now a substitute for DDT and they do not prescribe DDT as freely as heretofore.  Once DDT goes into the system of an animal or a human it will remain there for some considerable time.  I suggest that there should be certain tolerances and I ask the Minister to ascertain whether these tolerances can be provided under this Bill or whether a separate Bill would be required from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>In many places now, especially in the United States where they have aeroplane dusting, spring arrives unheralded by birdsong.  In this country it seems that rabbits are on the way back but they were almost wiped out by myxomatosis.  Padraic Pearse in <i>The Wayfarer</i> said:</P>
    <P>Sometimes my heart hath shaken with great joy</P>
    <P>To see a leaping squirrel in a tree, Or a red lady-bird upon a stalk, Or little rabbits in a field at evening,</P>
    <P>Lit by the slanting sun,</P>
    <P>Many of the 1916 leaders as well as being interested in humans&mdash;Connolly said: &ldquo;What is Ireland to me without its people?&rdquo;&mdash;were interested in poetry, in culture and in the wildlife of our land.  That is one of the reasons why they got general acceptance even though they lost their struggle from a military point of view.</P>
    <P>In England the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds investigated the deaths of 67 birds and found that 59 of them were killed by seed dressings and eight by toxic sprays.  They reported that 600 birds died in one estate in Norfolk and 100 pheasants died on a farm in north Essex.  In Lincolnshire some years ago 100,000 birds died.  The House of Commons set up a committee and it was in the House of Lords on a Private Member's Motion that action was taken with legislation such as the Endangered Species Act.  Fish poisoning as a result of DDT spraying was reported from the Inland Fisheries in the State of <Col N="1199" /> Maine in 1958, in Vancouver in 1957, in Yellowstone National Park around that time too, in Montana, in British Columbia, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Oklahoma, the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and India.  If that is so, why not in Ireland?  This is something about which we will have to take great care in future.  I believe a skull and crossbones should be displayed on practically every chemical insecticide canister.</P>
    <P>Every meal we eat contains fluorinated hydrocarbons, some of which are stored in our fat waiting to poison us at times of illness or loss of weight. At present our exposure to pesticides is largely unknown, immeasurable and uncontrollable.  The origin of cancer dates back to 1775 so it is not something new on the scene.</P>
    <P>Between 70 and 80 per cent of the earth's creatures are insects, 700,000 of which have already been identified. Their populations are not kept down by ingenuity of man but by natural forces.  It has happened that spraying was carried out to eliminate one insect and other insects then thrived and caused a greater problem than the one eliminated.</P>
    <P>A Canadian entymologist, G. C. Ullyett, said over a decade ago that we must change our philosophy, abandon our attitude of human superiority and admit that in many cases in natural environments we find ways and means of limiting populations and organisms in a more economical way than we can do it ourselves.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell further on the mechanical pesticides except in relation to the provisions of the Bill. The Minister may consider my remarks on this Stage with a view to making further amendments, as he has done in the Seanad.  In the Title the words &ldquo;enable a body...to be established&rdquo;. are used.  I would prefer to see &ldquo;council which will be established&rdquo;. The existing conditions imply no time limit.  The Minister may feel that he wants time to consider the best possible personnel for the council.  The <Col N="1200" /> council should be established as quickly as possible.  I do not see any necessity for the delay provided for in section 1.  This is essentially a Committee Stage and Report Stage Bill. Once the Bill is passed the Minister should implement it as speedily as possible. There has been enough delay, which has not been entirely the Minister's fault.  There was delay on the part of the former Administration also.</P>
    <P>I received some help on this Bill from An Foras Forbartha but I have not the relevant notes with me as I was not aware that the Bill would be taken this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that any moneys paid into his Department should go to the benefit of the Exchequer.  I would ask him seriously to consider setting up a special fund which would enable him or, preferably, which would enable the council to take special action which otherwise would not be possible in the normal course of administration, such as the development which was carried out in Donegal, and to examine places of special interest which in the event of the carrying out of an arterial drainage scheme would be taken out of that scheme and in respect of which the Minister for Lands could pay compensation out of the fund or directly out of departmental funds.  The Minister might examine that suggestion.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of compulsory power which the Minister should have taken unto himself.  I am aware that there is a difficulty about compulsory powers because they might affect the work of another Department.  We want to see the Bill on the statute book.  We want the Bill to have more teeth.  We certainly will try to help the Minister in this matter.</P>
    <P>Out of the fund that I have suggested should be set up the Minister could consider providing scholarships for the study of wildlife and could issue a recognised certificate in this field.  This is a matter for specialists who should be trained by the Department out of a special account for that specific purpose.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that nothing in section 11 shall restrict, prejudice or <Col N="1201" /> affect the performance of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of any function.  This is a weakness in the legislation.  If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries objects to some proposal by the Minister for Lands or by the council prohibiting the use of certain pesticides in certain areas the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries could veto that proposal.  The Minister for Lands should be given greater power under the Bill.  We can consider that matter on Committee Stage when the Minister might explain to us why this right of veto by other Ministers should be allowed or, as is provided later in the Bill, why there should be consultation with other Ministers. He should explain why the Bill is weakened in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands should have the final decision, perhaps after consultation but, in the long run, until such time as it is considered appropriate to appoint a separate Minister for the Environment, he should be given the responsibility of co-ordinating the various interests in these matters.</P>
    <P>I was surprised by some memoranda passing between the Department of Lands and the Office of Public Works at one stage in relation to some trees planted around the Blue Pool in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park.  At the time we had a recession and the Government of the day were doing anything at all to generate economic activity.  I wish this Government would do a little more in that direction.  As a result of planting coniferous trees the trout hatchery was destroyed because of the pine needles falling into the pool. When I saw it the undergrowth was gone and the deer and other wild animals had to go elsewhere for food.  I was surprised later when I went to Boston and found the same man responsible there for the national parks and for commercial forestry in the state.</P>
    <P>In practically every democratic country there is now a Minister for the Environment.  Until such time as we have such a Minister here the Minister for Lands should have the <Col N="1202" /> final responsibility, he should coordinate the various interests involved and he should not give the right of veto to any other Minister. It is he who should put the facts before the Cabinet and get his way.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the wildlife advisory council and he listed some of the major objectives.  I suggest some additions to this list.  What control, if any, should be introduced in the public interest over the manufacture, distribution and use of chemical pesticides?  Secondly, would it not be in the public interest to establish tolerances in respect of food supplies from the point of view of their possible contamination by poisonous chemicals? I am not just referring now to crops.  I am referring to game birds and so on because they too can be contaminated.  Thirdly, what steps should be taken to protect wildlife from poisoning by chemicals? Fourthly, we should find out whether or not the increased use of insecticides has any relationship to the increase in malignant disease.  Lastly, can methods be devised whereby accurate tests can be carried out to determine in the event of unaccountable deaths in game, fish and birds whether or not such deaths could have been caused by water pollution by pesticides and what effective steps could be taken to eliminate such pollutants? If we could extend the function of the council to include matters like that it would go a long way towards improving the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will have a look at these to see if the terms of reference of the council could be extended.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be a specific period, say five years, for service on this council.  That should be laid down in legislation.  I see no reason why members should be paid an allowance. I believe there are dozens, if not hundreds, and maybe thousands, who would willingly give their services voluntarily and freely for the protection of our heritage and our wildlife.  An allowance might be paid to the chairman and the secretary but the ordinary members should not receive any allowance. I believe voluntary workers work from the heart.  Most people in these <Col N="1203" /> voluntary organisations may not, because of their general attitude, have the popular support that the Minister or I would have, but they are sincere people and they are engaged in a job of protecting our environment.  The Minister should list some of these bodies&mdash;An Taisce, the Anti-Blood Sports, the commercial travellers trade union, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and any others he likes&mdash;and say that these will have as of right a seat on this council and not just at the discretion of the Minister. I may have picked the wrong bodies but if those who advise the Minister examine the type of material that comes in to his Department he will easily be able to satisfy himself who will best serve the nation in this field, and for nothing.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I do not quite understand in relation to section 14. Only the Minister for the Public Service is mentioned in the Bill.  Since the establishment of that Department, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service have been one and the same person, but there is no guarantee that that will always be the case.  I realise that nothing much can happen without the consent of the Minister for Finance, but in case this might cause difficulty, the Minister should examine whether only the Minister for the Public Service should be mentioned.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) mentions only the Minister for Finance and this was recommended in the Devlin Report. No order made under this Act should be revoked without some sort of public inquiry.  The High Court should decide the amount of compensation to be paid and the State should be responsible for legal costs.  I wonder if everything in this Bill is necessary.  I realise the parliamentary draftsmen must put in what seems to the layman to be unnecessary material, otherwise lawyers may get away with things.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with arterial drainage so there is no need to go over it again.  My notes refer to the position the various Ministries would have in taking away the type of responsibility which should be held solely by the <Col N="1204" /> Minister as Minister for the Environment <i>pro tem</i>, even if he has not that title.  Some sections mention Transport and Power, Agriculture and Fisheries, Industry and Commerce, Local Government and so on.  This is the type of difficulty I was hoping to see reduced to an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>In all cases we can safely link flora and fauna.  There are other amendments I would like to put down dealing with the two months' provision where, I think one would be adequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider land bonds, although the modern bonds are holding their own.  Previously it was very hard on the people who had to take them.  The Minister would not be making a mistake if he took another look at them.  If a claimant is successful, he or she should have the choice of the method of payment.  Under this Bill the claimant could suffer a loss due to inflation or for other reasons. I do not know how one could write an inflationary clause into section 18 (3) but the Minister could look into this.</P>
    <P>This Bill does away with the old maxim that a person is innocent until proved guilty.  This trend was started some years back with the introduction of the breathaliser test under the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  I do not like to see this happening.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if archaeological purposes should be included in the section which says that the Minister may grant a licence for scientific and educational purposes or if it should stay under the complete and absolute control of the National Monuments Section of the Office of Public Works. In my view, all these matters are interrelated.</P>
    <P>I have the Schedule to the British Endangered Species Bill.  I would not attempt to pronounce many of the species and I could not tell you what most of them are unless I looked them up.  We should compare that list with our Schedules, and perhaps the Department will communicate with me and give me some information about this.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with licenced firearms. I understand that from county to county and from superintendent to superintendent different rules can prevail. <Col N="1205" /> Provided we are satisfied that a person coming into this country is a genuine game-bird hunter, customs difficulties and regulations could be minimised to make the situation as easy for him as possible.  Some years ago I met a Mr. Beale from Australia in the old Moira Hotel.  He had travelled all over the world hunting anything from big game to pheasants. He was giving out about Ireland and all its institutions because his gun was taken from him when he landed. Fortunately he met a TD who knew who to ring up and his gun was released the next day.  He was as happy as Larry then.  It was a misunderstanding about the regulations which got him into that difficulty.  I could not clear it up for him then.  Naturally the Department can clear up these matters.</P>
    <P>The Schedule refers to the protection of certain species not found in this country.  We have no elephants, although we have a few blue whales. I hope the Schedule will cover the byproducts of protected species elsewhere. I have a number of amendments in mind.  I will discuss them with my colleagues.  I have given one quotation from Pearse.  I should like to end with another:</P>
    <P>On Easter Sunday, the 10th April, 1966, the 50th anniversary of the &ldquo;Irish Rising&rdquo; of 1916, an English journalist made the following commentary in the <i>The Observer:</i></P>
    <P>If the poems of Pearse were full of blood and futile heroism, they also spoke of reeds, rushes, the permanence of form which the hare leaves in the grass of the mountain.  Their enthusiasm was for the perishable renewable forms of peasant art, tales, songs, weaving, pottery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As other speakers said, this is more a Committee Stage Bill than a Second Stage Bill.  The section dealing with the council is the kernel of the Bill.  As a representative of the peasant farmers, I believe if the intentions of the Bill are to be implemented, we must have the co-operation of the owners of the land.  In older days, game was not associated with the peasant farmer. <Col N="1206" /> Some landlords held on to the game rights when they sold their land.  For a long time farmers have been fighting for those game rights.  While a number of people who shoot on land are very nice, there is an old person who comes with his gun to a farmer after a hard day's work and makes nothing of him.  People with shooting rights could knock down your wall, or do anything they liked.</P>
      <P>The farmer should have his game rights.  He is prepared to co-operate provided he is asked.  I am not in favour of compulsion.  The first thing we must look for is co-operaton.  We have to strike a balance between the preservation of wildlife and ensuring that the tillage farmer can grow his crops and not have them destroyed by wildlife. I believe the ordinary peasant farmer should be represented on the council suggested in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was born and reared beside a lake which was restocked with rainbow trout.  The local anglers' association consulted the farmers.  They erected stiles around the lake.  They have the full co-operation of the local farmers and everybody is happy.  If they did not consult the farmers, they would not have their co-operation and they would not be able to restock the lake. We did not have any trouble.  The same thing applies to game.  You must have co-operation.  Somebody said a farmer might want to improve his land and this might interfere with game.  There you must strike a balance again.  Game thrive in scrub.  In the west agricultural land is very scarce.  Much of the land in the west is not suitable for agricultural purposes and could support a lot of wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give an example of what can happen.  A gun club was formed in Dublin city and has shooting rights not far from my place.  They took the land for five or six years.  The local people formed a gun club with the full co-operation of the farmers.  They applied for the shooting on the land. Apparently the lease had not expired. I am not faulting the Department but a letter came down which said that while the local club would be taken <Col N="1207" /> into account where possible no preference could be given in the matter of leases.  It is wrong that preference should not be given to members of local gun clubs who have the co-operation of the farmers.  If that is the Department's attitude, I cannot see the Minister achieving what he has set out to achieve in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to preserve wildlife but we must strike a balance.  Preference should be given to the local people. Many gun clubs are doing excellent work, and so are many of the game councils.  I was involved in the question of game when I was closely associated with farming associations.  We succeeded in getting regional game councils set up.  We succeeded in getting representation for the different rural organisations on those councils. We were able to iron things out.  The Bill provides that councils may be set up.  I believe they should be set up immediately.  An amendment should be brought in on Committee Stage setting up these councils and stating how they will be constituted so that we will know from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; that we will have complete co-operation from the people who own the land.  Ordinary small farmers did not own game rights.  Many people who came in to shoot were very nice, but many of them were not nice and got the backs up of those who owned the land.  This is history.  It is there and we cannot take it away.  There is an old saying that what is worth getting is worth asking for.  If somebody says &ldquo;May I shoot on your land?&rdquo;, I do not think there is anybody who will refuse but if he comes in without asking he causes annoyance.  Furthermore, if a man from the Department goes in and tries to acquire the land compulsorily, it is not on.</P>
    <P>In my area there are some people who are hostile to wildlife and I have had occasion to write to the Minister on their behalf.  There are forestry lands owned by the Land Commission on which there are deer.  I know a man who sold two acres of turnips and in two nights the deer had the turnips eaten.  It is a pretty tough job to stop deer.  I am delighted to see that in the Bill you can shoot them now. <Col N="1208" /> You could not do that before.  People want to make a living on their small holdings.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not against this Bill and the Minister's efforts to protect wildlife but farmers must be given the assurance that they will be protected.</P>
    <P>On the Report Stage of this Bill I would like the Minister to indicate the type of board he is to set up and how it is to be constituted.  It is no good the Minister saying he will set up a board at some future date.  We all like wildlife.  Deputy Lemass mentioned rabbits.  I can say that in years gone by my crops suffered from the ravages of rabbits.  I would not kill them by means of myxomatosis, but I remember having to go out in the mornings and try to protect a couple of acres of crops with twine and burnt oil.  One can understand the farmer having a bias against wildlife. He must be consulted so that a balance can be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for the Minister to get land for forestry because land is required by the Land Commission to make holdings viable.  However, as I said before, I did not like the letter which came from the Forestry and Wildlife Section of the Department to a gun club which had the co-operation of the farmers.  I did not mind them saying they could not give the gun club the lease of the shoot, because the lease is not up yet, but a paragraph in it indicated that the club was not entitled to preference.  I cannot understand why a gun club based at home in County Galway would not have preference over a club which was just formed and given a certain name in order to localise it, employing a couple of gamekeepers at home but having no contact with the local people.  This is the type of thing that must be guarded against by setting up the board.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the Minister saying he was leaving open the setting up of the board.  Now is the time to put the board in the Bill, and it should be a representative board preserving a balance between the protection of crops and the preservation of wildlife. I would urge the Minister not to postpone the setting up of this board.</P>
    <Col N="1209" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is one of the most important and comprehensive pieces of legislation to come before this Dáil.  As Deputy Callanan said, its provisions are best dealt with on Committee Stage, but I would like to refer to the work that has been done by the regional and local game councils.  I hope that in the establishment of this board and the advisory council of which he speaks recognition will be given to the magnificent work the game council has done in this area over the past two years.</P>
      <P>I am a little confused as to what the Minister has in mind as between the advisory council and the boards which he proposes to set up.  Does he envisage that the advisory council will supervise the working of the boards in the various areas?  It seems to me there is need for the boards and I would support Deputy Callanan's view that the sooner they are set up the better.  I believe the setting up of these boards is the most important provision in the whole Bill.  Therefore I am a little worried at the Minister's suggestion that the immediate establishment of these boards is not envisaged.</P>
      <P>I note that the functions of the boards relate very closely to the functions of the fishery boards.  In relation to fisheries and wildlife generally, it is time we had a Minister who would be responsible specifically for these two vital areas.  I welcome the Bill and I hope the provisions will be put into operation soon.  I hope recognition is given to the magnificent work done in this area by the regional games councils and the local gun clubs over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. From reports of the debate on the Bill in the Seanad one got the impression that it dealt more with coursing than with conservation and for this reason I was pleased to hear the Minister point out that the Bill was concerned with conservation.  It is worth remembering that the late President Kennedy defined conservation as the use of our resources for the benefit of mankind.  In this regard it seems that some people would turn areas like the <Col N="1210" /> west of Ireland into a kind of reservation where everything would be conserved except people.  In dealing with a Bill of this type I must emphasise that my first duty is to my constituents. Even though the Bill is concerned with wildlife it really deals with mankind.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that development of any kind nowadays will lead to some form of pollution.  In my constituency bog development is taking place and there is a misinformed debate taking place in regard to the acceptable form of pollution which we should have.  There should be some sort of monitoring agency to investigate such a problem, whose findings would be accepted by both sides in such a dispute.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not deal with formal education in his speech.  I agree with Deputy Tunney who pointed out the great opportunities for formal education and an appreciation of wildlife. The Bill should contain some provision for educational tours to places where wildlife abounds.  The educational tours to the city have proved of enormous benefit to young students but they could also learn a lot if they were brought on educational tours of places of beauty.  One such tour could include a trip from Gort to The Burren.  Such a tour would make the students aware of the natural beauty of the area.</P>
      <P>Farmers in my area are very frustrated because of the damage done to their property by deer.  I have written to the Minister about this problem on numerous occasions but little has been done.  A lot of damage is caused by foxes, particularly during the lambing season.  I would welcome any provision in a Bill that would solve this problem.  Remedial action is not being taken at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers are doing excellent work in making their students aware of wildlife and promoting nature study but there is a great lack of film strips to help them in their work.  I am aware that there are fine film strips on The Burren and I have also seen an excellent film by Patrick Carey, &ldquo;Oisín&rdquo;. That film is a masterpiece and would make anybody appreciate nature and the need for conservation.  Teachers <Col N="1211" /> will have to be equipped with more of these aids if they are to promote an awareness of wildlife amongst their students.</P>
    <P>Conservationists in Mountbellew have taken many positive steps in recent times.  They raised wild fowl and built a sanctuary for them.  Such people impress me more than those who write to the newspapers about conservation.  In south Roscommon local farmers, in co-operation with officials from the Department of Lands, have established a wild fowl sanctuary. It is wonderful to see farmers giving 100 per cent support to such projects. I suggest that the Minister have another look at the section which deals with damage to crops by straying deer.  I am not satisfied that remedial action in this regard is taken quickly enough.  Action should be taken immediately a complaint is lodged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot in this Bill and I hope the Minister will be able to implement all its provisions but I have some doubts about that.  In my constituency the landowners are perturbed because the shooting rights are owned by faceless men; they are owned by men who live in London or America.  Those faceless men lease these shooting rights and in many cases those entitled to shoot on the lands cause damage to crops and fences.  It is unfair that a landowner cannot have the shooting rights to his own land.  I have raised this matter with the Department and I have been informed that under an Act these gaming rights can be held by persons other than the landowners.  That is very unfair.  I am in favour of gun clubs if they are properly run and supervised, as they are in the areas I represent. However, the situation with regard to absentee landlords is different because they can send in people from abroad.  Americans can come here and shoot on such land but the owner is not allowed to do so.  If he does, a gamekeeper or some spy will report him and automatically he will be prosecuted. This is an aspect the Minister might examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is very complex.  It will be <Col N="1212" /> difficult to implement but at least it is an improvement.  I would emphasise my point that owners of the land should own the shooting rights.  I do not want absentee landlords deciding who will shoot on the land.  I am told that they are leasing land for hundreds of pounds.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter.  He may be able to bring in some amendments on Committee Stage to counteract this practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): I should like to thank the House and the Deputies who have contributed for the way they received the Bill and for the constructive suggestions made as well as the knowledge they displayed.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad and it was debated there at considerable length.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the unusually large number of amendments made to the Bill in the Seanad. Practically all the amendments were introduced by me but that was done as a result of consultations which I had through my Department and through the officers in the Forestry and Wildlife Section with voluntary organisations who have played a big part in game preservation during the years.  I refer to the regional game councils, the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, the Irish Deer Society and the Field and Country Sports Society.  Again, I wish to express my appreciation for the help we got from those associations and I should like to put on record the close co-operation that has existed between my Department and these and other voluntary organisations during the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt hit the nail on the head in his contribution when he said this was a conservation measure.  It is a measure aimed at conserving fauna and flora.  In doing that we must preserve a balance between the very laudable object on the one hand of conserving for posterity the wild birds and animals, the wild plants and flowers and the importance of agriculture as a sector of the economy on the other hand.  In preserving this balance, we must consider the importance of drainage, of tourism and industry. It is only by preserving a sensible, <Col N="1213" /> reasonable and considered balance of that kind that we will succeed in the aim this Bill has set out to attain.  I should like to assure Deputy Callanan that there is no danger of adopting an attitude that preservation must proceed at all costs and at the expense of agriculture or other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be worth while to repeat what I said on Second Stage in order to dispel any fear or danger there may be in relation to pursuing conservation at the expense of other elements of the economy.  On that occasion I stated:</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the special contribution which the farming community can make towards wildlife conservation by virtue of their ownership and use of a sizeable part of the habitats which are vital to the survival of much of our wildlife. A Bill of this kind inevitably imposes many constraints on many different interests but I think Deputies will find that every effort has been made to strike a reasonable balance between <i>bona fide</i> agricultural operations and wildlife conservation interests.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, in return, farming organisations and those directly engaged in farming will do everything they can to ensure that our wildlife continues to survive but I would appeal to them especially on two counts&mdash;firstly, to keep the habitat requirements of wildlife in mind when planning their agricultural programmes and, secondly, to do nothing which would interfere with rare or threatened species.</P>
    <P>If Deputies go through this Bill section by section they will see that where something is forbidden or is made illegal there is a reservation and a saving clause in respect of <i>bona fide</i> agricultural activities and in respect of drainage.  In this country drainage is very important.  Rural Deputies know that if we were four times as wealthy as we are at present we would still not have enough money to do all the drainage work that is necessary.  Notwithstanding that, we have written into the Bill that where the Office of Public Works embark on drainage operations <Col N="1214" /> they shall consult with the Department of Lands and will take steps to interfere as little as possible with wildlife habitats.  There is no complete prohibition of drainage.</P>
    <P>There is a reasonable approach.  A close study of this Bill will demonstrate that there is every effort made to preserve a balance between the conservation idea on the one hand and the necessary rights and obligations of other sections of the economy on the other.</P>
    <P>This is the first Bill of this nature that has been introduced for 45 years and it replaces the Game Preservation Act, 1930, and the Wild Birds (Protection) Act, 1930.  I would like to say now, when we are removing those two Acts from the statute book, that a compliment should be paid to the people and the Government in those days who put those Acts on the statute book.  The State had just been founded.  We were much concerned with economic difficulties, perhaps political difficulties and maybe law and order difficulties but this was enlightened legislation for those days.  It is all very well to say now that it does not go far enough but 45 years ago it was very enlightened legislation and it served fairly well the purpose for which it was enacted.</P>
    <P>I do not think any irreparable damage has been done to our wildlife over the years.  I think the species have been preserved by and large. However, this legislation is necessary to ensure that no damage will be done in the future.  This Bill has been in the course of being processed for quite a long time.  I concede that it has been worked on for a good many years. That probably was necessary.  Other Departments had to be consulted, the voluntary organisations had to be consulted and then it had to be got into the form of a Bill to be brought before the House.  I am not all that thin-skinned but somebody recently commenting on wildlife in general referred to the dilatory processing of this Bill through the House.  I do not think there is anything dilatory about it. Since this Bill was introduced it has been going through the Oireachtas with very considerable speed.  The Second <Col N="1215" /> Stage began in the Seanad on 20th May.  It continued on 21st May and on 22nd May.  There were three full days given to the Second Stage in the Seanad.  The Committee Stage commenced on 26th November.  It was taken on 27th November, 3rd December and 17th December in the Seanad. The Second Stage was taken in this House on the very first day after the Christmas recess.  We are now concluding the Second Stage and hopefully we will get on to Committee Stage very soon.  I would like to put that on record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney feared that our fauna and flora were disappearing at an alarming rate.  I do not think any irreparable damage has been done.  In fact I think that considerable respect and concern has been shown over the years for both fauna and flora.  I am not speaking in any critical way of Deputy Tunney, perhaps I did not understand him correctly but he seemed to think that it was a pity to remove hedgerows or ditches because by doing so we might damage the habitat of wildlife.  That is so up to a certain point but I do not think we can lay down a hard and fast rule and I do not imagine Deputy Tunney was suggesting that hedges or ditches should not be removed and that fields should not be made bigger.  One could operate with a one-horse or a two-horse plough in a small field but we are now using tractors and it is necessary to make fields bigger.  That is what I mean by a balance between conservation and reasonable progress.</P>

      <P>I agree, but, on the other hand, in the past, resulting from what might be described as bad husbandry a farmer left a headland and and old corner in a field and perhaps did not cut the hedgerows and that was more conductive to the existence of wildlife than intensive agriculture.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Even in the comparatively old days a good farmer was distinguished from a bad farmer by the fact that the good farmer had no headland or no turning ground.  He succeeded in ploughing right up into the backs <Col N="1216" /> of the ditches.  The careless fellow would leave a turning ground which went wild.  The people of Louth and south Monaghan were noted for having no headlands and no turning ground.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> From the wildlife point of view an ideal situation would be if the farmer allowed his land to get overrun with whins and rushes and all sorts of things.  I am not being critical of Deputy Tunney but we must have a balance between good husbandry on the one hand and a reckless attack on wildlife on the other.</P>
      <P>We come to section 13 of the Bill which is its peak.  There seems to be a little misunderstanding about the council which will be set up under this section and the boards which may be set up under section 14.  The council which will be set up under section 13 is an advisory council which will advice the Minister on various things. It says:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall by order establish a body which shall be known as the Wildlife Advisory Council (which body is referred to in this Act as the Council) to perform the functions assigned to it by this Act.</P>
      <P>There seems to be some anxiety lest there will be delay in setting up this council.  I ask the House, as reasonable people, is it likely that a Minister will be slow to set up a council or appoint a board which he has the right to appoint?  I do not think it is. I think the Ministers are usually glad to have the opportunity to set up boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I propose to set up a council under section 13 as soon as the Bill is clear of the House and as soon as I have sufficient advice from my officials. There will be no delay.  The object of the council will be to advise the Minister on the various things that are set out in the Bill.  I think the council will have wide enough powers to advise the Minister on anything that it considers it should advise the Minister on.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Minister is not obliged to accept the advice&mdash;I concede that&mdash;because if he were so obliged one would be setting up an autonomous body like the Land Commission over which the Minister would have no power or control.  The Minister will still be responsible for the implementation of the Bill and he will be responsible in the most effective way possible because he will be responsible to this House in his annual Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed&mdash;I want to make this clear and I do not want to leave anybody under any misapprehension, and I said this in my Second Reading speech&mdash;to set up boards under section 14.  That is simply an enabling section and unless the necessity arises in future it is not proposed to implement that section.  It is purely an enabling section to set up boards if the necessity arises to deal with one facet of wildlife or another.  We can have more detailed discussion of that on Committee Stage if necessary but I am making the position clear on this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 imposes an obligation on all other Departments who are engaging in any activity, whether it is <Col N="1218" /> drainage, industry or any other activity&mdash;the ones that immediately come to mind are the Office of Public Works and the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;that might interfere with wildlife or the habitat of wildlife, to consult with the Department of Lands.  The Department of Lands will not have the right to veto that activity and I do not think it is reasonable that the Department of Lands should have the right to veto it because you would have obstruction; you would have perhaps some necessary development being held up or obstructed; but it is reasonable to assume that there will be reasonable consultation and reasonable reaction from that consultation.</P>
    <P>As regards the enforcement of the Bill, Deputy Tunney and Deputy Daly raised this point which is a legitimate point.  This Bill is a comprehensive Bill that sets out to achieve many objects in relation to conservation and preservation.  It will be enforced, first of all, through the Garda Síochána to some extent.  It will be enforced through authorised officers. By and large, the authorised officers will be officers of the Department of Lands, the Forestry and Wildlife Section, and the Minister will have power to appoint wardens.  I do not want to give the impression and I am not going to give the impression that I will appoint wardens by the thousand or even by the hundred because that is not envisaged.  Furthermore, the gun clubs throughout the country who have done a good job and are doing a good job, will have their own ways of drawing the attention of the powers that be to any breaches of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not understand. Where it is said that we are annulling the 1930 Acts, I thought those Acts were being subsumed into this and <Col N="1219" /> I thought it would be necessary to specify the continuing powers of the gun clubs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): No.  The two Acts of 1930 are gone; they are being repealed under this Bill but many of their provisions are re-enacted in one section or another and one of the things being provided is that gun clubs will have the right to prosecute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Section 15 of the Game Preservation Act, 1930, did not provide for the ceding of sporting rights to the clubs. What it did was to give recognition to the clubs, to give them the enabling power to prosecute offences relating to trespass in pursuit of game. Under that section, the Minister had power to grant recognition for the above purpose.  They are still being recognised in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Okay.  I believe you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): That is broadly how the Bill when it becomes an Act will be enforced. Naturally there will be breaches. Naturally, some of these breaches will not be detected.  The guards will implement the Bill, authorised officers of the Minister for Lands will implement it and where necessary wardens will be appointed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney also made the point that it was unlikely that the general public would co-operate with the Department, that they were more likely to co-operate with a voluntary organisation. That may be so up to a point but the gun clubs will still be there. We are not abolishing the gun clubs and to that extent the co-operation will still go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, one of the big things in this Bill, as distinct from the Act of 1930, is that the 1930 Act did not preserve the habitats of birds and animals. These were not protected at all and that was a big shortcoming.  They will be protected under this legislation and, in co-operation with landowners, we can arrange for refuges and reserves. <Col N="1220" /> We can acquire these from farmers and landowners and we will pay compensation for them.  That is a very big difference between this Bill and the 1930 Act.  Deputy Tunney talked about oyster catchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am told they are there in considerable abundance.  Deputy Tunney, Deputy Daly and Deputy Kitt referred to the question of education.  The Bill does not make provision for any formal education and I believe the best type of education, especially in the field of wildlife, is example.  One of the most progressive steps taken in regard to rural Ireland was that taken by one of my predecessors when he threw the forests open to the public. For many years they had been out of bounds to the people and no one could get into them.  It is probably ten years since the forests were thrown open and I do not think they have been abused.  There are fires but I believe these fires were accidental.  I also believe the forests are enjoyed and appreciated by the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt said arrangements should be made in the Bill to encourage school tours.  It is not necessary to write that into legislation. The forest walk has now become an annual event and I was delighted some years ago to see busloads of secondary school girls having travelled 20 or 30 miles to take part in this walk.  In the Department we have a great deal of literature readily available to schools.  As a matter of fact I sent a circular to practically every school in the country pointing out the attractions of the forests and encouraging people to use them.  We can have another word about this on Committee Stage but I do not think there is any shortcoming in the Bill in that regard or any necessity for a change. <Col N="1221" /> In view of the topicality of the EEC at the moment it is only natural the provision relating to the hunting licence should have been raised.  This is an innovation.  At one time there was a licence of five shillings and of £2.  The five shilling licence enabled a man to carry a gun and shoot vermin.  The £2 licence entitled him to shoot game.  No questions asked.  You went into the local barracks, got your licence and that was that.  We are now introducing for the first time a licence to hunt game.  An Irish citizen who wants to shoot protected wild birds or hares&mdash;this is the first time hares were mentioned since the debate started, with the exception of a reference by Deputy Kitt&mdash;can get a licence from the gardaí but he will be asked to make a declaration that he has shooting rights.  In other words, he must declare that he owns lands over which he can shoot or has authority from some other landowner to shoot over his lands.  The object is to make it more difficult for the poacher.  If he wants to shoot larger animals he will have to come to the Department of Lands and get a permit from the Minister.  A visitor, irrespective of where he comes from, will also have to get a game licence directly from the Minister for Lands.  He too will have to prove that he has arrangements made to shoot over land or that he owns land. I am satisfied there is no discrimination on the grounds of nationality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill refers to a resident and a non-resident and that would give the impression that there is a form of discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): That is better still because it does not discriminate on the grounds of nationality.  For instance, an Irishman resident in the USA will have to come to the Department of Lands for a licence to shoot.  We do not offend EEC regulations unless we discriminate on the grounds of nationality.  I submit we are not discriminating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass raised the question of coniferous forests.  There is an argument <Col N="1222" /> that these are detrimental to wildlife but I am told this view is not shared by naturalists or foresters.  Indeed, an authority in a German university delivered an address to the Council of Europe on ecology a few years ago and he exploded that argument fully.  However, it is the policy now when planting new forests or replanting cutaway forests to introduce hardwood and other species beneficial to a variety of wild fauna and flora where the type of land is suitable. I think the point Deputy Lemass was making was that we should plant more hardwood but that is not as easy as it sounds.  It is not as desirable as it sounds because it takes 100 to 150 years to mature hardwood, or the very minimum would be 75 to 100 years, whereas soft timber will be marketable after 35 years.  The ground where softwoods grow is much inferior to the ground where hardwoods are grown.  It is getting more difficult to acquire land for afforestation than it was a few years ago because land is more valuable today.  I do not agree with Deputy Lemass's argument that conifers are injurious to wildlife.</P>
    <P>I will not go into his contribution on pesticides and insecticides because if I were to do that I would not be observing the balance I spoke about at the beginning.  I hope the day will come when we have insecticides, pesticides, artificial manures and all the things that will not interefere with wildlife, but until that happy day comes, and as long as they are necessary, I am afraid we have to live with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also raised the question a lot of people feel strongly about: that we should have a fully-fledged Department of the Environment. That may be so; there are arguments for and against that but this is not the time to debate it.  At the moment, the Department of Local Government are in charge of environment and to some extent the Department of Lands are also in charge of the environment so far as it affects flora and fauna.  I am on record as saying that I do not think there should be a separate Department of the Environment and I repeat that now.  If there is a change of view <Col N="1223" /> in future, the legislation we are putting through could be operated by the new Department as well as it is by my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan was worried about the setting up of a council.  This council will be set up quickly, although I cannot give the exact week or month. I am all for setting it up as soon as possible.  Somebody, I think it was Deputy Lemass, talked about the compulsory powers of the Land Commission under the forestry legislation to acquire land.  Under the Forestry Act we have compulsory powers to acquire land for afforestation but these powers have been rarely used.  When they have been used it was only to get over title difficulties.  All we are doing here is extending these compulsory powers to cover wildlife and game.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass suggested that the council should have full employment powers.  I disagree with that.  He also suggested that there should be a five-year period.  I imagine that a period will be fixed and the members of the council will be appointed for a certain time&mdash;I do not know if it will be for three or five years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also felt strongly about the payment of allowances to members.  It is not obligatory in the section to pay allowances but it is permissible.  They will have to be paid travelling expenses.  I do not think anybody would object to that.  Whether they will be paid an allowance or not will have to be considered, and if it needs to be thrashed out further on Committee Stage, we will have a discussion on it.  Section 13 is an enabling section to pay allowances if it is thought fit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service is naturally mentioned in section 15 because he is the Minister who regulates the number of civil servants and the conditions under which they are employed.  In my view it is perfectly reasonable that he should be mentioned there.  As I said, it is not intended to set up boards because at the moment I do not think they are necessary but if, in future, there is a necessity for them we will set them up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass brought up the <Col N="1224" /> Committee Stage point about people being guilty until they prove themselves innocent.  All we are saying is that it will not be necessary to bring somebody from the Department of Lands to prove when open season started and ended when it is published for all to see in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>He dealt with the endangered species in England.  Our Schedule, which deals with endangered species and species requiring special attention, can be changed from year to year or from day to day by ministerial order.  There is nothing to worry about there.  I have dealt fully with Deputy Callanan's point about co-operation with farmers.  Deer are now being protected for the first time. Marauding deer can be dispatched by farmers if they are damaging stocks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan raised the point about the Dublin Gun Club and about preference not being given to another. That is a matter for the Estimate but I believe the letter was intended to convey that the shoot which the Land Commission own would be offered for tender and the highest bid would get it.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with Deputy Kitt when he said that if one were to read the report of this Bill in the Seanad one would think it was a Bill dealing exclusively with coursing. The Bill deals with conservation and nothing else.  Deputy Connolly raised the question of shooting rights.  This is a very big question. Most of the shooting rights are owned by farmers but under some of the earlier Land Acts landowners had the rights to reserve shooting rights to themselves and many of them did that.  However, I do not think it is proper to deal with that problem on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points raised.  The Bill is introduced to replace the two Acts of 1930.  It is a very comprehensive measure.  By and large, it has been accepted by the House and welcomed.  I hope we will have an interesting discussion on Committee. We will take Committee Stage as soon as we can.  There is no political principle involved.  If any amendments come from the other side of the House which do not affect the Bill fundamentally, <Col N="1225" /> I assure the House they will be considered.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion :</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to ensure the use of the purchasing power of State and semi-State bodies including the Irish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. to support Irish industry at this time of serious economic crisis.</P>

      <P>It is important to remember that no State money is involved in any proposed contract by Irish Life.  It is important that semi-State bodies subject to discharging their national obligations should have the fullest possible commercial freedom.  In the exercise of that commercial freedom, Irish Life have generally served the national interest well.  Their regrettable lapse in relation to the furniture situation highlights their success and their fine record of investment in and loyalty to Ireland.  Most important now are the steps being taken by the company to redress the situation.  The company are engaged in very delicate negotiations in the expectation that a substantial part of the specialised furniture sought by them will be made in Ireland under licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as we hope, these negotiations are successful, the manufacture of the <Col N="1228" /> furniture here will confer an added advantage of new skills and equipment and opportunity on the furniture industry. Furthermore, Irish Life are arranging for the supply by the Irish market of an additional £200,000 of conventional furniture and £170,000 worth of furnishings.  These measures are to be welcomed.  It is unfortunate that they were not adopted and publicly made known by the company long ago rather than at the end of three months of representations by myself and others to get the right thing done. The Government have acted correctly and will continue to act correctly at all times to secure the maximum amount of work for Irish industry, and will resist very strongly the efforts by the Opposition to denigrate all the efforts by Irish exporters to sell more goods abroad.</P>

      <P>The Minister need not be shouting so much.  He admitted that he was wrong last night.  This motion states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to ensure the use of the purchasing power of State and semi-State bodies including the Irish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. to support Irish industry at this time of serious economic crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think every Deputy should welcome the opportunity of debating this subject, particularly in view of the enormous number of people who are out of work at present and to ensure as well that they make a contribution towards keeping as many of the people who are in jobs permanently in those jobs.  The terms of the motion indicate an area where something can be done by ourselves to ensure against further redundancies, lay-offs and sackings.  If, as a result of this debate, even one order is kept at home, then this debate will have been justified.  I want to <Col N="1229" /> emphasise that point because the Minister made a lot of play about the damage that may be done to Irish manufactures and so on.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure in this direction is very obvious.  The Government themselves operate and advertise a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign; yet Ministers, by their own admission, have not advised their Departments or the State-sponsored bodies under their control to support it.  On the 21st January, 1976, in Question No. 4 I asked the Taoiseach if he had advised his Department and the State bodies under his control to support this campaign, and the simple answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  On 28th January, 1976, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, replying on behalf of the Minister, said he was generally satisfied that State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of his Department were observing a policy of buying Irish goods where possible, and that in these circumstances there was no need for any general instruction to State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I think the discussion that went on here last night and that has been conducted through the media over the past few months shows the need there was for such advice from the responsible Ministers.  It is a sad day that Ministers responsible for the expenditure of millions of pounds of taxpayer's money, while encouraging a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, at the same time will not advise people who are expending these funds to support that campaign. Again on the 29th January, 1976, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in reply to a similar question stated he did not consider it necessary to advise State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of his Department on the lines suggested.</P>
    <P>With all that has come to light in recent months about foreign manufactured goods and contracts, when we are quite capable of having the orders fulfilled here by Irish manufacturers and producers, is it any wonder that we are forced to put down this motion and to ask the Dáil to deplore the attitude of the Government in this regard?  Not only have the Taoiseach and two Ministers not advised anybody under their control to support Irish manufactured <Col N="1230" /> goods, but no Government Minister has so advised them.  There is seemingly no intention on the part of the Government to give any special treatment to Irish manufacturers.  With severe competition from all over the world, with tariff barriers coming down, should we not have ensured that every possible penny would be spent on Irish manufactured goods?</P>
    <P>It is a pity that such information came to light here in the Dáil in recent weeks, that the Government themselves are seemingly not concerned about how the taxpayers' money is spent.  The fact that statistics are available about the amount of Irish money spent abroad on goods and contracts that could have been fulfilled here is what prompted and, in fact, warranted this motion.</P>
    <P>It has been said that our obligations as members of the EEC debarred us from giving any preferential treatment to Irish manufactured goods.  That is a ridiculous suggestion.  Irish producers never looked for any preferential treatment on the home market and the majority of them are competing successfully throughout Europe. All we are asking is that where Irish goods are available and where the quality and price of them is right no regulation can debar them being purchased by Government and semi-State bodies.  Any Minister who states that our membership of the EEC changed our attitude towards buying Irish is introducing a red herring into the discussion.</P>
    <P>In one way or another all the European countries have schemes similar to ours but I am sure they are given a lot more support in their efforts to encourage the purchase of home manufactured goods than we get.  It was nonsense for the Minister to suggest that by having this motion discussed we were allowing some of the British Press to read into this debate the fact that there was an anti-British campaign operating in Ireland.  We are seeking to protect Irish produced goods and we are not trying to downgrade goods produced in other countries. I am sure the British protect their producers and manufacturers, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> I cannot understand why the Government made every effort during the last two weeks to stall a discussion on this motion.  This motion includes not alone Irish Life but every Government Department and semi-State body.  It is important that we realise that many Departments are purchasing goods abroad that are available here and that can compare in quality and price very favourably.  In moving this motion we were anxious to highlight this matter and we were hopeful that the Government would ensure that as much as possible is spent on home produced goods.  While the Government were stalling the discussion on this motion they were holding special meetings and issuing many Press releases.  Prominent Ministers were making statements about the affair but the Government's attitude was to deprive Deputies of the opportunity of voicing their views on the matter.</P>
    <P>Much damage was done to Irish manufacturers and to the country by statements made by Ministers during the last fortnight.  Much damage was done by the attack made by the Minister for Finance on Irish Life last night.  If one is to carry that attack to its logical conclusion then the Minister responsible for that company, the man who appoints the board of that company, must accept responsibility for everything done by that company.  If we had serious Government the Minister for Finance should have sacked the board of Irish Life or resigned.  As the Minister responsible he should accept the outcome. As far as I am aware such an attack by a Minister on a board for which he was responsible is without precedent. I thought the Minister, in the minute available to him tonight, would have apologised for his attack. I should like to quote for the record two headlines in this morning's national newspapers: &ldquo;Ryan Slates Irish Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ryan Disgusted by Irish Life&rdquo;.  It should be remembered that during the same debate the Minister accused Deputies on this side of causing damage to the Irish manufacturers trying to sell goods abroad.  He <Col N="1232" /> also accused us of putting forward anti-British propaganda.</P>
    <P>When one analyses the details one can find that the Minister for Finance was using Irish Life as a scapegoat because he has no alternative but to accept responsibility for the actions of that board.  When one bears in mind the answers given by the Taoiseach and his Ministers when questioned about their attitude towards the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and the fact that they do not advise their own Departments or the semi-State bodies under their control to buy Irish, one can see why when the bubble bursts the Ministers do not accept responsibility and try to hang the coat on Irish Life.  In the past when &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns were activated a letter was sent from the Government to each Department and semi-State body advising them to support the campaign.  This Government did not send such a letter.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that we have such situations arising?  It is not just that one contract, there have been many more.  With regard to almost all Departments who have been queried in the Dáil in the last few weeks, it has been found that money was spent on foreign manufactured goods while goods similar in quality and price were available here.  It is no wonder that this has happened when the men responsible have not given proper advice in the matter.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Minister gave us a few rushed words.  However, in his statement last night he did not refer at any length to the statement made by Irish Life regarding the possibility of having the goods manufactured here under licence.  I do not know why he did not mention it.  He said something about some other purchases that would be made in Ireland by Irish Life.  I understand that the furniture manufacturers met some of the management of Irish Life last week and apparently they were left under the impression that there was a possibility that this contract might be filled in Ireland.  That would be a fine solution to the whole problem. Notwithstanding the fact that considerable pressure had to be exerted <Col N="1233" /> to bring the matter into the open, it would be nice to find that the contract could be filled by the Irish manufacturers who tendered for the work.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, or someone on his behalf, to tell the House if it is possible that the total purchase of furniture and fittings for the Irish Life building could be made in Ireland.  This would be an enormous help to the furniture manufacturers and if it is possible to take this action the Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance, should direct that it be done.  If the Minister does not, if he is willing to accept that the odds and ends still to be purchased will be bought in Ireland, that will be a reflection on furniture manufacturers throughout the country.  It will do untold damage throughout the world and will make things more difficult for the many successful Irish manufacturers who have obtained contracts abroad.  Even at this late hour we appeal to the Government, and particularly to the Minister for Finance, to take whatever steps are necessary.  Even if it costs more money, they should try to have the entire furniture contract placed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Most Departments, when under pressure, admitted that they purchased goods from abroad which could be bought here.  This is a sad situation. When I put down questions regarding support for the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, I omitted one important point.  Possibly there will be further questions put down in order to get the information.  The point concerns the amount of foreign manufactured goods purchased by State and semi-State bodies through Irish agents.  I have an impression that quite an amount of foreign manufactured goods are coming in here through Irish agents as a cover to suggest that they are bought in Ireland.  I have no information on this matter but perhaps in the future we might get details regarding the new office block of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Kildare Street.  Where did the furniture and fittings come from?</P>

It is a simple statement of fact and all of us&mdash;both Government and Opposition&mdash;should deplore the attitude that has prevailed up to now.  We should ensure that in future such situations will not develop where millions of pounds of taxpayers' <Col N="1235" /> money is sent abroad to purchase goods that could be made at home to keep Irish workers in employment. I appeal to the Government to accept the motion and to ensure that its terms are implemented fully in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to talk about three separate things.  First, I will refer to the Irish Life Assurance Company and their actions&mdash;it is specifically mentioned in the motion.  As the last speaker correctly pointed out, the motion is wider than simply Irish Life. I want to speak also about our Community obligations which seem to be misunderstood in the country and in this House, more understandably in the former case than in the latter because Deputies could easily find out what our obligations really were, and then I want to talk a little about the role and policy of semi-State companies because that question seems to me to arise on this motion also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be offering opinions in the time available to me which are not always substantiated by detail of chapter and verse but which I believe that given more time could be so substantiated but sometimes matters, of course, of pure opinion.  I think that what is appropriate for the office of an Irish company of that stature, standing and scale is a style of furniture which is elegant and beautiful and of high quality but which is also in some way an expression of our culture and our tradition and our history. I am not asking for Celtic crosses and curlicues but I cannot help noticing that where countries have built a great reputation for their furniture and built great exports they have developed a style which is their own and I think it is the duty of companies both public and private when building headquarters for themselves in this country to bear in mind not just quality and efficiency but also the expression of the whole tradition and culture of the society that supports them.  Therefore, it seems to me that the basic setting out by the company to use an internationally evolved system which had no reflection of Irish culture and tradition was a mistaken <Col N="1236" /> one.  I think that was an error of judgment and no more than that and I would accept that there could be different opinions on it but I would have wished it otherwise.  I would have wished that it would have been characteristically Irish in the way that, for example, a Finnish firm has Finnish furniture and styles and fabrics and a thing that expresses, without being maudlin or sentimental, what they are. I think also we must affirm the significance of this not alone in relation to a particular order, which is important, which is money, which is jobs, but we have to say that with a tiny economy and, therefore, the individual industries making up that economy are themselves tiny, and that applies to the furniture industry, unless they get orders of this size they cannot develop the techniques of functioning on this scale because one can only learn by doing and, therefore, one cannot evolve a product line which can compete in that area of supply in other parts of the world.  It would have meant and I hope will mean before it is all over the leaping over of a threshold on to a different sort of furniture fabrication in this country.  Therefore, the importance goes well beyond the monetary value of the order.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to the effect of the row that has already taken place and of the public debate, I believe this House must be seized of things but I hope we will always be seized of things responsibly&mdash;I think we very often are&mdash;but the row has just not been here, it has been in the Press and it has been in the media of the Community and it has been in the media of the world.  That is something that is true and is not capable of being escaped from.  It is not, on the other hand, a sufficiently important consideration for me not to say a lot of the things I am going to say in a moment and I think Deputies must be free to exercise their freedom.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that but the point I am making is that <Col N="1237" /> a row like this is inevitably two-sided. We know that we export to live.  There is a consensus about that.  We know that the United Kingdom takes a little more than half of our exports.  We know that we are, for reasons not of our making and it would seem to me bad reasons, unpopular in the United Kingdom.  We know that a pretext will be sought and is being sought in the United Kingdom not just in regard to furniture but across the whole spectrum of half of all our exports.  We know of activities already of one British trade union.  I have had representations, and I have to say this as the Minister for Commerce as well as for Industry, from British interests in Ireland and from Irish exporting interests in Britain, both of them pointing out the potential damage that this does not for a quarter of a million pounds but for half of our exports.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it is essential to put this sort of conflict into context. To me the most awful thing that has happened is that because there was in my view an error of judgement and worse than that, which I will come to in a moment, we have not alone done damage to a sector of our furniture industry to the tune of some hundreds of thousands of pounds but we have put sectors of our exports at risk to the tune perhaps of tens of millions of pounds.  That is much more serious and is foolish and unnecessary.  I want to take this formal and public occasion to say that if we differentiate against the products of other members of the Economic Community and specifically against UK firms we do so on the basis that because of the advantages of closeness and the advantages of the home market the products can be provided better and cheaper here.  We do so on no other basis.  We benefit from free trade and if we are not trying to cheat and if we want some sort of stature and dignity in the world then we accept the pluses and we accept the minuses of tree trade, we accept free trade in its totality.  I will only differentiate against the products of countries with which we enjoy free trade on the basis that our products are as good and as cheap.  As good and <Col N="1238" /> as cheap then our way but not as good or dearer then not our way.  There would, of course, be a certain percentage. I want to affirm that.  If anyone is listening in the UK or in any other Community country or in Brussels or in the Commission I want to say that that is the policy I pursue and I pursue it because I believe it is in the best interests of Irish commerce and it seems to me a duty in the light of the departmental responsibility I hold as Minister for Commerce as well as Industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is going beyond his international obligations when he says that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is so.  We will talk about that in a minute. I want to say also, specifically in regard to furniture, that while we have an import excess in regard to furniture it is an import excess that is diminishing. To put it another way, our exports, and this is mostly, since furniture is so bulky, to the UK, are growing more rapidly than our imports.  We do have not just in the economy as a whole but in the furniture sector specifically an interest in the continuation of free trade.</P>
      <P>I want now to come to my real sense of outrage.  Having heard Deputy MacSharry I would nonetheless express a sense of outrage and a sense of betrayal with the activities of Irish Life not because they chose to place an order in a particular place and not because they made an error of judgment but because I am satisfied from the documentation that they misled the Government.  I am satisfied that representations were made and replies were received to the effect that the matter was still under consideration and was not settled when, in fact, it was settled. I think they were not frank and not open and that is a very serious thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer for others.  I know the Minister for Finance did and I know that I did. Up to now I have been saying simply Irish Life.  I do not know at this moment whether it was the board or whether the board was misled because I do know that there are people on the board who wanted another outcome and I believe that these are things that will come out in the wash.</P>
      <P>Let us face the problem as we see it now.  There are two aspects of it.  One is the health of the furniture industry. I do not wish to reiterate what was said in his very brief time today by the Minister for Finance but it raises a very real hope in regard not just to the £200,000 of conventional furniture or the £170,000 of other furniture, but in regard to the system furniture.  That is a very desirable outcome and for myself I am willing to let the delicate negotiations now taking place continue with the hope of success.</P>
      <P>The other point we have to consider is the damage to our exports, which is potential.  I make it clear for myself that my sense of impropriety arises from the fact that we were misled, because to have produced a set of designs that could allegedly not be fabricated satisfactorily in Ireland was a mistake, but a <i>bona fide</i> one.  The other point seems to me to be very serious and I do not regard it as yet having been settled.  If in saying that and in following the thought of Deputy MacSharry I am breaking the precedent that one must not criticise State companies, in this case I am criticising&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Seriously, we will be able to read the records of the House and see whether I am doing that, whether it is a distortion of meaning or just a piece of lunacy.  I now want to talk about the belief that we can direct semi-State or State bodies to buy Irish.  We have a lovely circular situation that the catch after catch 22 should be called catch 23.  In this matter I want to put on record the <Col N="1240" /> relevant part of the foundation document of the Community, the Treaty of Rome, which also goes beyond the letter of any particular change permeating the thoughts and decisions of the Community in a most extraordinary way.</P>
      <P>Part I is a set of principles.  I shall quote from Article 3 of the principles, from page 179 of the 1973 Official Edition.  Paragraph (a) of that Article deals with various intentions, decisions and activities of the Community and it states that the activities of the Community &ldquo;shall include, as provided in this Treaty and in accordance with the timetable set out therein&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>(a)  the elimination, as between Member States, of customs duties and of quantitative restrictions on the import and export of goods and of all other measures having equivalent effect.</P>
      <P>That is in Article 3 of the main section of principles.  It is the fundamental tenet of the whole Community.</P>

      <P>The point is that every nation State in that Community favours its own industry and agriculture as much as it can.  The moment there is a document, a decision, an instruction, it can be raised and indeed the withdrawal of it can be demanded.  All of the activities have to be informal through understanding, goodwill and endeavour, but they cannot be ordered, they cannot be commanded in Community terms.  People say &ldquo;We know these are Community regulations&rdquo; but the cheat will say &ldquo;That is so but we do not have to do it&rdquo;, and he cheats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been as critical of the Community as anybody in this House and possibly in the country but in financial terms we enjoy an extraordinarily high standing which got even higher as a result of our presidency.  It does us endless good and we defend national interests to the limit of the rules of <Col N="1241" /> the game.  But we will not cheat, get clever or doublecross.  Long may that remain.  To the extent that we can simply reach out and issue orders that is not possible.  There is the further argument that we should give orders to semi-State bodies.  I am saying it is not possible.</P>

      <P>There is the belief that because we have latent intentions of protection, that it is in the interest of the country to buy Irish goods in almost all circumstances. Let me try to define my understanding of the circumstances in which it is right and not right.  I will give a reasoned example.  I do not know if it has been mentioned already, the example of a shipping contract going to Japan.  To have built them in Ireland would have been dearer and would have saddled the operating company with higher costs.  It would have put the manufacturing company in Ireland out of a profit area into an area where they would have had to complete with the Japanese and that in no way could be profit making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view it was in the interests of the operating company, of the Irish manufacturing company and of the Irish economy to have gone to Japan. Provided the manufacturing company had other work, it was in the interests of the whole economy and I have defended it explicitly in this House. I am completely decided that that was a correct decision that can be defended anywhere.  We are entering into an area of high technology.  An Irish manufacturer on a small scale could put up his hands and say &ldquo;We could make that&rdquo;, but the economy and the State as a whole cannot take gambles involving this type of high standards.  We must have products that will be safe, that will be good, that will not be dangerous, and if we do not do this the efficiency of the economy and the ability to compete in a free trade situation within the Community will be finished.  If we could get something out a year ahead of the time originally thought about, that is something.  If we had <Col N="1242" /> a year's delay the cost would be many millions of pounds.  It is not £1 million.  I have a figure off the top of my head which could be wrong and I do not offer it to the House as a hard figure because I do not remember but the figure that I believe one year's delay would cost is £16 million. With that £16 million we can do a whole lot of other things and can defend a whole lot of other jobs.  It is not always simplistically right, even if there is a long delay, even if the thing could be made in Ireland and even if it were the same price and you say: &ldquo;Ah yes, but it will be 18 months later&rdquo;.  It may be the wrong decision to wait for that 18 months. All I am arguing for is general economic sense and balance and judgement.</P>
    <P>Then, if you turn to the economic considerations, we must not force our manufacturers, our industry, our transport, our commerce, our service industries to take on the giants of Europe in a free trade situation with anything but the best equipment because we are trying one arm behind their backs.  They are going to have a tough enough fight anyway.  If you want good morale, then you have to trust the technical judgment of people who are Irish people and patriotic people.  I will name the firm, NET. I know the staff of NET.  I have said over and over and it does not need to be said again&mdash;because NET is a company completely imbued with patriotic sentiments both as regards the future of an Irish chemical industry, about maximum purchasing in Ireland, and about the greatest possible spin-off advantage to Ireland&mdash;that I want hard-nosed technical decisions that neither I nor any of my staff are able to make.  If they say in their wisdom, also in their patriotism and in their economic seriousness, that they are sorry but that it is to our advantage to order something outside the country, then I say: &ldquo;Yes, I am sorry too, but I have to trust your judgment&rdquo; and I trust the judgment of patriotic and able people.</P>
    <P>You see the nonsense it is in this resolution because it suggests first that we can issue instructions&mdash;we cannot &mdash;but secondly that the whole staffs of <Col N="1243" /> the semi-State companies of Ireland, the very bone of our economic development starting with the ESB and working right through, are somehow feckless and irresponsible people with so little confidence in their own skill and their own country that they only want an opportunity when a Minister is not looking to nip across to buy somebody else's product and we have to issue orders to corral them and keep them in line.  That is a travesty of the way these people are. They are good patriotic people.  Mistakes are made.  I was severe about the mistake by Irish Life at the beginning of my speech and there will be other mistakes but to suggest that those occasional mistakes that we can find and enumerate are a general judgement of what the executive staff of Irish semi-State companies and State companies are like seems to me very unfair to them.  They have a task of being efficient as well as patriotic.</P>
    <P>Now I am coming to the third section.  I want to talk about the role of the semi-State companies in the minutes remaining to me.  I offer you a quotation from page 388 of the <i>Irish Economy Since 1972</i> by Professor Meenan, where he says:</P>
    <P>The constitution of the Electricity Supply Board, for example, was drafted on the principle that it should be as autonomous as possible and free from Ministerial control.</P>
    <P>That is true of the ESB and it is true of many of the companies and I say as a Minister that by and large it is a good principle.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I feel let down by Irish Life but I am not going to let that one instance, done by a company which in general has a pretty good record and one company of a whole spectrum of State or semi-State companies&mdash;I am not going to let that be the determinant factor in thinking that we have to draw in the reins suddenly and we have to start issuing orders.  We have a structure which is an interesting structure, which is the State and semi-State thing, precisely because we wanted a bit of freedom from the rigorous controls and atmosphere of a Government Department <Col N="1244" /> but we wanted a thing that was part of the Public Service but not under the immediate control of a civil service atmosphere with people running a civil service.  By and large that structure has served us well and we have the principle of having boards of companies in which we put many people from many walks of life.</P>
    <P>But, think of the circumstances if you are exercised as we all are&mdash;I am not suggesting for a moment that Deputies on the other side are not exercised&mdash;by a concern for the morale and the wellbeing of the semi-State companies.  You have to have good people to go on the board.  You do not want a mickey mouse board. If you do not give them any power, if you keep pulling in the strings, if you keep giving them orders, if you keep breathing down their neck, no serious man will take it.  They need some autonomy.  They are entitled to it.  That is the way the system works well.  Then you get serious men on the board and you get good professional and expert executive staff and they develop some morale.  That seriousness of the people who will take the job on the board and the excellence of the morale and the excellence of the expertise in the senior executive is one of the most important bits of capital any economy has got.  In my experience of almost three years in my relations with companies I will not lightly countenance a system that says: &ldquo;You have to take orders from the Minister&rdquo;.  In this case I want to reach out and shake the guys and say: &ldquo;That was a terrible thing to do&rdquo; but it would be wrong for this one instance to say we must change that system.</P>
    <P>In fact, I think that we do have some defects in our State and semi-State companies, that those defects arise not because Ministers do not have the power to reach out enough and tell them what to do but because, perhaps, they are not far enough away from Government and from Ministers and from political interests.  Ideally, a second level through a holding company that was concerned with efficient management, efficient use of funds, is desirable to insulate the individual <Col N="1245" /> executive companies like the ESB or like CIE or something from direct departmental influence or political influences. There is a tendency here to give in in the face of what is infuriating, to give in in the face of one infuriating instance, to a desire to limit their freedom in a way that is wrong.</P>
    <P>In regard to this particular instance we have said enough sharp things.  I feel let down.  I hope there will be a good outcome from it.  In regard to our issuing specific decrees to State or semi-State companies that they must distort economic processes to the extent of buying Irish, that they must do more than what is economically correct in terms of price or quality, that is legally impossible.  Of course, there is a great deal of exhortation and more than exhortation and these are not things that we are going to put on the record of the House and the moment we did we would be required by the Commission and competing countries to stop doing it.</P>
    <P>But there does seem to me to be a sort of opportunist regression in some of the things that the Opposition have said because they recall the time of protectionism and there are a whole lot of regressive and chauvenistic and protectionist ideas rattling around the country and if they gain enough momentum at a time like this they can do enormous damage.  I am not suggesting that this was in all of the speeches and I am not suggesting that there was not a great deal of substance in what was said but there are echoes of this protectionism which if it gets loose enough is a nice easy catchcry and it can do us terrible damage.  We can have serious repercussions in regard to our competitiveness from forcing people into wrong economic decisions.  We can have serious repercussions in regard to the saleability of products if we seem to be protectionist.</P>
    <P>I do not know quite honestly in my own Department&mdash;I cannot recall at this moment and I offer this to Deputy MacSharry&mdash;whether there is an official letter from me or not but the thought that you buy Irish if you possibly can has been the assumed content of every conversation I have <Col N="1246" /> had with any State company related to me and it is something that did not come from just now.  It is in their whole history and their whole development. To urge that that be put in a more formal way is to urge something that is illegal and damaging and bad for our economic efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If one did not know the facts one would, I think, be quite impressed by what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been saying.  Unfortunately the facts do not correspond with a great deal of what he said and in the course of what I have to say I hope to demonstrate that in regard to some matters where he departed from the facts.  First, however, it is necessary to reiterate the terms of the motion: they are as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to ensure the use of the purchasing power of State and semi-State bodies including the Irish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. to support Irish industry at this time of serious economic crisis.</P>
      <P>I assume there is no dispute about the fact that this is a time of serious economic crisis and I assumed, until I heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there was no dispute about the fact that the purchasing power of State and semi-State bodies ought to be used to support Irish industry.  I am not so sure now that the Minister for Industry and Commerce agrees with that.  One part of what he said would certainly agree with it, but then he took the other road as well, which is not an unusual situation for himself and some of his colleagues in trying to have the best of both worlds.  However, what should be realised in this regard is, first of all, that the purchasing power of State and semi-State companies in relation to our total economy is quite vast and can make an enormous difference to Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, not only the effect of using that purchasing power itself but the example it gives to the private sector is vitally important.  There are other aspects.  One of them was touched on by the Minister for <Col N="1247" /> Industry and Commerce in relation to the furniture industry when he pointed out that if a particular type of process of furniture making, which is not engaged in in this country at the moment, were engaged in as a result of the Irish Life contract, it could have long-term repercussions in regard to the furniture industry and the obtaining of orders in other countries as well as at home.  He was quite right in saying that.  However, when one comes to apply that to the actions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in other areas one finds he acts differently in practice from what he preaches in this House.  Nevertheless, it is indisputable that the purchasing power we are talking about in this motion is enormous and has tremendous potential in regard to Irish industry. What are the constraints in using this purchasing power?  The first one obviously is that we should not allow a situation to develop in which, because we are buying Irish, we allow Irish firms to abuse the situation so that they charge excessive prices or produce a low quality of goods.  Now in practice it has been shown that that problem is not especially difficult to overcome.  That has been demonstated over quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>The other major constraint involved is that we must act within our international obligations.  Here I must say I am very concerned at the simplistic statements we have been hearing in this regard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister primarily charged with this responsibility. He quoted the Treaty of Rome. That is the equivalent of quoting the Constitution as distinct from the statute law on a particular topic.  I think it is reasonable to say that the ideal aimed at in the Treaty of Rome is one thing and the level of achievement at this point in time, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce might well have said, is something different.  To establish that one looks at whatever regulations may exist, at whatever obligations we have taken on.  In particular, within the EEC one looks at what the practice is in other countries.  I would defy the Minister for Industry and Commerce or anybody <Col N="1248" /> else to say that, if we were to conform with the standard of obligation in this regard, the standard observed by Britain and the other EEC countries, we would not have any problems.</P>
    <P>I do not want to develop this theme too much but if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not aware, then he should make inquiries and he will find out some very interesting things about the manner in which obligations of this kind have been observed in the past by such people as the British Post Office and similar State bodies in other countries of the EEC.  Article 3, which the Minister quoted, is a general proposition.  Is that not one example of the inaccuracy of what the Minister was saying? It will be recalled that I intervened to point out that the Minister was going beyond his international obligations in what he was saying.  Just as one example, is it not obvious that the restriction on, if you like, national purchases does not apply in regard to defence equipment?  It does not apply in many countries in regard to telecommunications equipment.  I just mention these as examples.  There are many others.  I say this because I believe it is irresponsible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to put forward, as he did in this debate, an alleged legal position applying to this country, a legal position which, in fact, does not apply and which is being used as a cover up for the failure of the Government to carry out their duties and obligations in regard to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce also referred to the economic aspects of this and he gave us and example, the placing of an order for two bulk carriers in Japan.  He said he would defend that decision anywhere. I do not wish to spend too much time on that but I want to put it on record that I disagree totally with the view expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this regard. When we find ourselves, as we did this year, with a provision in the capital budget for the payment in 1976 of £10.14 million as instalments, just instalments, to Japanese shipyards <Col N="1249" /> for the provision of two bulk carriers it is time we had another look at the situation because what we are doing is buying at a dumped price and for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell us about the patriotism of the officials of various State bodies is simply too much to take.</P>
    <P>The obligations of executives and members of State bodies are laid down in the relevant statutes setting up the bodies and it is not unreasonable that they would view these obligations within the confines of the body with which they are concerned and, in that context, it makes sense if you are running a business like a shipping line to buy your ships as cheaply as possible and to get the best possible terms of credit.  That makes sense to someone whose job it is to run Irish Shipping.  But the whole point of this motion is to bring home to the Government and to the various State and semi-State bodies that there are wider obligations and quite clearly the Minister for Industry and Commerce needs to have those obligations brought home to him because he is defending this decision to buy the ships in Japan rather than have them made in our own shipyards.  The economics involved in buying dumped goods are complex but there can be no doubt and there should be no doubt, above all in the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the purchase of dumped goods, if pursued to its logical conclusion, will lead to the collapse of this economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The placing of that order in Japan was not, to the best of my knowledge, imposed on us by any international obligation.  It was purely an assessment of the economic effect, an assessment which ignored the actual economics of the situation from the point of view of the cost to the economy.  I am speaking now purely in economic terms and ignoring the social aspect of the loss of jobs involved and the cost of social welfare and redundancy pay as against the higher cost of the ships.  I am merely advertising to this in outline because <Col N="1250" /> it is complex.  It is important that we should not allow ourselves to be brainwashed into the idea that because a price quoted is cheaper on the simple comparison that it is in reality cheaper.  A great deal of this debate has been directed to the Irish Life episode.  As I pointed out, this motion is not by any means confined to this episode but there are a few things I must say about it.  The whole business, of course, is a sorry tale.  It has been disturbing to say the least to see the amount of time and effort that has been given to it by the Government to try to cover their responsibility in the matter.  In my view, if the furniture which was required in that case could not be made here&mdash;a proposition which I think is doubtful and is certainly not proved&mdash;I cannot understand why a substitute of the highest standard made here would not have done Irish Life.  To that extent I certainly agree with the comments of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance speaking on this debate last night said on at least two occasions that Irish Life had been less than frank in their dealings with him.  The Minister for Finance was less than frank in his dealings with this House.  He told us that he was in touch with Irish Life about this matter in October&mdash;I think he said first on 14th October&mdash;and that as a result he was in close touch with the IDA, IIRS and, I think he mentioned CTT.  He certainly mentioned two State bodies.  He then went on to allege that the actual decision to go ahead and purchase this furniture abroad had been made by Irish Life effectively on 14th October.  He said that Irish Life deliberately concealed that position from him, the 90 per cent shareholder in the company, and presumably they must also have concealed it from the other State bodies with whom he was in touch and who were in touch with Irish Life about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say quite frankly that I find it incredible that the board of any State company would set out deliberately to deceive the Minister for whom they were responsible and the other State bodies with which they <Col N="1251" /> were working in close co-operation on a particular project.  The Minister in saying these things&mdash;and they were repeated substantially tonight by the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;is in my view making a very serious attack on the standing and character of the members of the board of the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited. Those attacks were made under privilege in this House.  Neither Minister told us whether they had expressed to the people concerned the views they expressed in this House, nor did they tell us what was the reaction of the board of Irish Life, nor what was the story given by the board in response to these attacks. So far as we can get any information on the matter it would appear that at some stage the Minister for Finance stepped in and said: &ldquo;No more public statements.  Anything else that has to be said in public will be said by me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I can understand why he might have taken that line but it is important, in the light of these vicious and unprecedented attacks on a board for which the Minister is responsible to this House&mdash;made not by the Opposition but by the Minister concerned and by one of his colleagues&mdash;that the response of the members of the board should be made known to the House and the public.  There is a great deal about this matter that has been suppressed but it appears that a lengthy report, publicly referred to as a 135-page report, from Irish Life is in existence and was given to the board.  In all the circumstances I would suggest that this document and any other statements the board of Irish Life wish to make in response to the attacks made on them should be made available to this House and to the public.  Until they are, I have to repeat that I find the story told by the Minister for Finance in this regard lacking in credibility. There is a much more likely explanation than the one given by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The position would seem to be that no real concern was shown by the Minister for Finance until this matter was raised in the House by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I say that because if he had <Col N="1252" /> shown real concern things would never have turned out the way they did.  I say that with experience as a Minister. The Minister knew that some people knew he had done something about this at some date in October.  Therefore, whatever he had to say in explanation of what occurred had to fit in with the fact that he had known about this matter in October.  The one he produced suggests that the board of Irish Life deliberately misled him, the Government and other State bodies from the 14th October to the 18th December when the contract was signed.  I must admit the possibility that that is true but I must also say that it is extremely unlikely.  I, for one, cannot accept it without further evidence and without hearing the other side of the story.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government was pretty ferocious in his comments outside the House on Irish Life.  One thing that intrigues me about that is that it appears the Minister for Finance at least, if not other Ministers knew about this.  According to the Minister for Finance, he had been in touch with Irish Life and other State bodies about it in the middle of October and on the 21st November, more than a month later, the Minister for Local Government performed the topping out ceremony on the premises and offered his heartiest congratulations to the architects and designers.  Of course, they are the people who are now being made the villains of the piece.  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government would care to explain that in Navan.</P>
    <P>We had a classic example of double think from the Minister for Finance and, to a lesser extent, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in their approach to this.  You will have noted, Sir that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Local Government, all feel free to attack Irish Life in terms which are quite unprecedented, but any criticism from anywhere else, be it from this side of the House or in the Press, is damaging to the national interest and endangering Irish exports.  It is providing fodder for British propaganda.</P>

      <P>There is one further aspect of the Irish Life matter to which I want to refer.  The Minister for Finance is approximately a 90 per cent shareholder.  There is a grave danger in all this that the Minister could end up by giving up his position, that is, giving up his right as Minister&mdash;I am not speaking of the individual&mdash;in relation to Irish Life.  It is very important that that position, difficult as it is to define, should not be given up.  The Minister will be aware that efforts were made in the past and might, indeed, be made in the future, to induce the Minister for Finance, as Minister, to reduce his role in relation to that company.  I would hope that the Minister, in explaining away why he did not succeed in preventing from happening what did happen, does not also in the process find himself getting rid of certain power and responsibility which he has and which in my view he should retain.</P>
      <P>This motion is not confined to Irish Life.  I mentioned recently in the budget debate, and I want to mention again, the example given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in relation to the contract for the printing of the telephone directory.  It was a different situation.  Two Irish firms were concerned.  What worried me was that when he was questioned about it he said the employment factor was not an issue.  When I referred to this the other day, the Minister for Finance intervened and, as reported at column 695 of the Official Report of 28th January, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not press that point if I were the Deputy.  If the contract had <Col N="1254" /> gone the other way, work would have been sent out of the country which is now being done here.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that I had most indignant letters from people directly involved denying what the Minister said and asking where he got his false information.  I am informed that there is no truth whatever in what was stated by the Minister in that regard.</P>

      <P>I will not pursue that matter.  I am glad the Minister has at least acknowledged publicly that, if the firm in question had got the contract, the work would not have gone out of the country.</P>
      <P>We heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce talking about the furniture industry and referring to the importance of an industry getting into a new area and the implications of that. Listening to him no one would think the Minister for Industry and Commerce personally took responsibility for a decision not so very long ago which was directly contrary to what he was saying.  He adverted to the difficulty which had arisen over a contract awarded by NET in relation to structural steel work.  That contract was worth over £600,000 most of which would have been spent on labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great bulk of the work was structural steel work of a kind which has been done for many years by the Irish firm concerned.  A small portion of it was a new kind of work they had not done before.  The firm consulted with their various technical advisers and specialist consultants and, as a result, they were quite satisfied they <Col N="1255" /> could undertake the work.  If they could not, they would have been in great trouble.  Against international competition they found themselves in the last four, and then in the last two, in the running for this job.  Their price was right and, clearly, since this went on over a period of five months they must have been considered competent to do the job.  At the last moment the job was given to a British firm, not because the Irish price was not low enough, and not because the quality of the work was not good enough, but because somebody thought there might be a little less difficulty in dealing with the British firm.</P>
    <P>This is what this motion is all about. I do not think it is good enough for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come in here and make the noises he did.  When Deputy O'Malley raised this matter in the House on 11th December, as reported at column 1474 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The decision in regard to NET was a difficult one.  I went into the matter thoroughly and I should like to state emphatically that I take full responsibility for the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Later on he said:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;The firm do not employ any qualified engineer although they have a quantity surveyor on their staff&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> That statement is untrue.  Not alone have I been informed that it is untrue, but I happen to know personally one of the engineers concerned, though I have not spoken to him about this matter, nor he to me.  Later on when questioned by Deputy O'Malley the Minister said.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;The firm were offered alternative work in the structural steel area, in their own area of acknowledged expertise, as a compensation for a kind of work they had never done before.</P>
    <P>That statement is untrue.  I wonder who was misinforming the Minister. Was it the people who are giving the hard nosed decisions he was talking about, or the patriotic decisions on which he was acting, as a result of which this Irish firm lost a contract? Jobs for 90 workers for a long period were dispensed with and given to English workers, not because the price was not good enough, but because of the hard nosed advice of people who are misinforming the Minister.  The Government, not the State bodies, are the people who should give the lead.  It is because we deplore the failure of the Government to use the purchasing power of State and semi-State bodies to assist Irish industry in this time of difficult economic crisis that we put down this motion and that we ask Dáil Éireann to support it.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Bantry Employment Situation.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.  It is a vital issue as far as the people of Bantry are concerned. It is unfortunate that we seldom come into the House with some good news to announce and the news from Bantry at present is very bad.  The Bantry Towing Company has served notice that it will have to let 50 per cent of its employees go.  I understand that the security personnel on the island will be halved in the near future.  There is no need for me to spell out the tremendous industrial and economic injection the siting of Gulf Oil had on the town of Bantry. Directly, and indirectly, 250 people earn a living from Gulf Oil, but I understand the Carroll Shipping Company will also have to let 50 per cent of their staff go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that the safety at the terminal, the proper trans-shipment of the oil and the enforcement of the regulations in the harbour are of vital necessity as far as the town of Bantry is concerned.  It comes as a surprise to me to find that the super <Col N="1259" /> tankers can now be attended by only two tugs and yet apparently comply with the regulations laid down by the Minister although the Minister was adamant that four tugs should be used in the attendance on a tanker. The duty of the Minister in this respect is clear-cut and he was aware of that duty in several speeches he made. However, we have a situation where three tugs carry on the job of mooring while one tug stands by at the end of the pier.  As a result of the redundancies that will occur the situation must be remedied.</P>
    <P>Already 70 employees of Gulf Oil have taken a voluntary cut in their pay packet amounting to £17 per week on average.  The present situation is fraught with danger on two fronts, on the economic side there is the danger of jobs lost because of redundancies but, as important, is the downgrading in status of Whiddy Island from a terminal for transshipment to a storage depot.  If any more redundancies occur or any more people lose their jobs ultimately this situation will come about.  Up to April 1975, 40 million tons of oil were channelled through the port of Bantry, an amount greater than the total tonnage of all other ports together.</P>
    <P>As a representative for that town, I cannot stand by and see it becoming a ghost town because of lack of employment for the people there.  Of course, we had all sorts of promises about what would happen in Bantry. We had many &ldquo;paper industries&rdquo;, as I would describe them.  We were told that APCO intended setting up a refinery there.  After an inquiry planning permission was granted for that refinery to be erected on Whiddy Island.  I should like to tell those people who are complaining about a proposal to erect an oil refinery in Dublin that we would welcome that refinery in Bantry.  We would like the Minister to use his powers to ensure that APCO erect a refinery for us.  Another refinery was promised to us&mdash;not by the Minister, I hasten to add&mdash;the Aughaville refinery. Option was taken on some land and land was purchased.  We all know that land is a good investment and that very soon those who buy land are <Col N="1260" /> able to double their money.  With a fanfare of trumpets we were promised that an oil rig platform factory would be established somewhere in the Beara Peninsula but I regret to say that did not happen.  We were told there would be a shipbreaking yard in the Bantry area but I am afraid that is another paper industry.  We were supposed to get two carpet factories in the area but again that did not happen.  The point I wish to make is that the economic future of Bantry depends on the wellbeing of Gulf; it depends on the constant employment given by the Gulf Oil Company.  If there are any circumstances in which they can help out, the Government should do all in their power to retain that industry because it is vital for the economic wellbeing and life of Bantry.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consult with the Minister for Labour with regard to the £30,000 that was allocated for an APCO factory at Bantry. Are we not considered important enough, despite the fact that money was put aside for us?  I do not mind what other area gets a training centre or an APCO factory but if we are to pursue properly our policy in relation to keeping the population in rural Ireland we must provide employment for the people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the news is not good. There were 34 ships a month coming into Bantry at one time but that is now down to 11.  The Minister must accept a certain responsibility for the situation.  When we had the unfortunate oil spillage in October, 1974, the Minister over-reacted in insisting that all ships stay outside the bay.  As a result of that Gulf sent their ships to the Clyde and they are now trans-shipping from one vessel to another, not at the terminal as they did in Bantry.  I have grave doubts about Gulf coming back and using the Bantry terminal for trans-shipping.</P>
    <P>As a result of what happened we have lost the large ships calling into Bantry but, even more depressing from the economic point of view, we have lost the economy accruing from the ancillary services.  I am referring to such matters as storage facilities, boat hire, the use of dentists and doctors, the loss suffered by travel agents in <Col N="1261" /> the area, by taxi owners and, perhaps the most important item, the supply of food for the crews.  On average, there was a sum of approximately £5,000 spent in the town by the crew members of one ship alone.  This loss must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Chair to allow this question on the Adjournment was a correct one in view of the economic climate in the west Cork area.  Unless some positive initiative is taken by the Government that area will be in a serious state.  Many people came to work for Gulf; they purchased sites, they built houses and they established themselves in the area.  What will happen the town of Bantry if those people move elsewhere?  In my opinion jobs provided in rural Ireland are far more important than any grand talk we may have about attracting huge industries, giving employment to 1,000 or 10,000 people.  We know that at the moment it is costing the IDA and the chemical industry £60,000 to provide one job.  Instead of giving brandy to geriatrics we should be giving a little orange juice to the infant industries because that orange juice will ensure the health and nourishment necessary to turn those undertakings into viable industries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am full of admiration for the Deputy.  He has a marvellous turn of phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Employment is a serious matter and, in fairness to the Minister, he is one of the few people in Government who is concerned about it.  Possibly that is because he is a Cork man.  In his wisdom, the Minister produced the Harbours Bill, 1975. I do not know what reactions he got to it.  There is one serious deficiency so far as Bantry is concerned, namely, there are no borrowing powers involved in the Bill.  Therefore, whoever becomes the harbour authority will not be in a position to buy out anybody or to borrow money from <Col N="1262" /> the bank.  We consider the whole future of Bantry is very much tied up with the harbour, with the industries there as well as the ancillary industries that can be established.</P>
      <P>We want the oil refinery Dublin does not want.  We want it in Whiddy Island because we want the ancillary industries that go with an oil refinery. I would prefer to see the people of west Cork employed at home even though there may be a little pollution. It is inevitable that when there is industrial development there is also a certain invasion of the environment and anyone who does not accept that is stupid.  We are prepared to accept that small invasion of the environment. Is it not far better that our people are given employment at home rather than working in the sewers of Coventry or Birmingham? I hope the Minister will use his good offices to try to help in any way.  I hope he goes along to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who before he became Minister was a director of the APCO group to see about the establishment of an oil refinery on the island.  The Minister said that but, perhaps, that was a political gimmick at the general election time. If he still has any say with the directors, I wish he would urge them to establish this industry in Whiddy Island.  I have not had time to study the secret document which was released by An Foras Forbartha about the establishment of the oil refinery in that area.  I hope Whiddy is still O.K. for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I again urge the Minister to take this matter very seriously. I believe his officials may have been in contact with the trade union officials <Col N="1263" /> representing the men working in the places I have mentioned and if he and his office can in any way ensure that no redundancies will occur he will be doing a good service for West Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to give Deputy Crowley the chance to have this raised on the Adjournment.  If what Deputy Crowley has said here tonight is being repeated by him in West Cork and the Bantry area, I am very glad to give the assurance that the enforcement regulations will not be responsible for any unemployment there.  He made four statements, none of which is true.  He said that giant tankers of VLCC would in future be serviced by two tugs.  That is not true. He said that the Bantry terminal is being downgraded to a transhipment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>VLCC have been coming into Bantry Bay in increasing numbers since 1968 but then there was the oil crisis in 1973 and there was a a run down in stocks in 1973 not just in Bantry.  I am talking about the general situation in Europe.  During 1974 even though the consumption of oil products had dropped at the consumer level throughout Europe, there was a restocking into refineries and storages throughout that year in part because of fears of another oil crisis, another prohibition of supplies out of the Middle East and partly because of replacement of stocks that had run down during the crisis from October, 1974 to February, 1975, so that the full effects of the oil crisis were not felt until 1975.  At that stage and during the last year there was a serious drop in the amount of oil being shipped out of the Middle East through Bantry into Europe.  Of course, Bantry was affected by that.  There was a cutback in the <Col N="1264" /> refining capacity in Europe and there is at the moment by between 25 per cent and 35 per cent.  Therefore, the oil was not required by those refineries, it was not transhipped from Bantry, was not ordered by Gulf from Middle East countries and there was a falling off in business generally.</P>
      <P>Added to that, Gulf opened their terminal Bilbao which is similar to the Bantry terminal and that caused competition for Bantry.  All these affected the throughput of oil as far as Bantry is concerned and Gulf say at the moment that it will be lower in 1976 than in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the redundancies are feared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a down turn in business, there is always a danger of redundancies.  There is no danger of the downgrading of the Bantry terminal.  It does not even make sense to talk in those terms because what Deputy Crowley is suggesting is that you put the oil in there and leave it there forever.  What is the point of putting it in there unless they are to tranship it?  It is a transhipment terminal for carrying oil in large quantities from the Middle East, storing it in Bantry Bay and then transhipping it to refineries all over Europe.  I know the Gulf Oil Company are in negotiation with the various unions at Bantry.  Nothing that is being done there will be finally agreed by my Department unless we are absolutely sure it will not interfere with the safety of operations in Bantry.  Deputy Crowley may be sure that in the transhipment of oil, in the handling of the tankers, safety will be assured by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>So four tugs will still be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  There is no question about that.  The Gulf Oil Company have been eight years in Bantry and they have been exceedingly co-operative, under the previous Minister and myself in any arrangements they were asked to make by us to see that the oil and the shipments were handled in a safe manner. That disposes of the Deputy's first two <Col N="1265" /> complaints.  He said I over-reacted by insisting that all ships should be berthed outside the bay.  When Gulf set up in Bantry they did so on an understanding in regard to berthing, unloading and so on.  When the oil spillage occurred in October, 1974, there were ships coming forward full of oil and there was not the capacity to take them.  At that stage we discovered there was a number of tankers berthed in Bantry Bay.</P>
      <P>Officers of my Department put the point to me that this was unsafe and when this was pointed out to Gulf, that ships might be berthed in fog, that they would be moored, that they could not be seen by fishing boats, Gulf agreed.  I said at that stage that they should berth one at the terminal and have one moored off the terminal at anchor pending sonar research by them on the seabed.  That research has now been completed, giving them locations of level safe anchorages. They can be moored at specific points. They have now been decided after the sonar survey was carried out and they have been identified as safe anchorages and four LCCs can park there from now on at specific points and eleven shuttle tankers all at the one time in Bantry Bay.  There was no restriction on the parking of shuttle tankers at any stage.  They could be parked there at any stage.  It was only on the LCCs.  That was for one tanker at the berth, one moored off, and that was relaxed last summer for a second LCC.  In fact, there was no hindrance on the throughout of oil as a result of any action taken by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>So, you over-reacted at first and changed your mind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I did not change my mind.  Conditions were totally different. The sonar survey has now been completed and this is what has identified the fact that there are safe places to anchor and it can be done and I would be totally negligent in my duty if I had not done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> Deputy Crowley says that there are no borrowing powers in the 1975 Bill. That is not true.  The 1946 Act is the Principal Act.  All that the 1975 Bill does is to add Bantry Bay to the list of harbours under the 1946 Act.  The Deputy would want to look at the 1946 Act to see what the powers of a harbour board are under that Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a perfectly simple matter for Deputy Crowley to look at the Act, which is in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>I should say something about the position of unemployment in Bantry.  A turn-down came in the consumption of oil in Europe.  Bantry terminal did not supply one drop of oil into this country. Every drop of oil that went through Bantry was used outside the Republic of Ireland.  The Fianna Fáil Party are fond of pretending that the recession is the fault of this Government.  Positive proof of the Europe-wide recession is the reduction in demand for oil, most of which went through Bantry. Oil is not going through Bantry because of the recession in England and in Europe.  There is not a demand for oil.  As soon as the economy of Europe recovers, Bantry will come back to its own and will play a major part and that will be very welcome.</P>
      <P>I remember 1967-68, when the refinery was being put in there and they were screaming for a harbour authority in West Cork.  I do not remember Deputy Crowley's voice being heard.  I remember myself making a speech in which I said that the people objecting to this were wrong, that it was an ideal location for it, that rather than being an environmental hazard it would, in fact, prove to be a tourist attraction.</P>

The existing plant at the Whitegate refinery is not capable of producing petrol with a lead content as low as 0.4 grammes per litre, and the cost of re-equipping it to meet this standard would put its continued operation in jeopardy.  The adoption of the standard would result in an increase in the consumption of petrol, thus adding significantly to our imports bill.  It would also necessitate an increase in the price of petrol.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind recent figures of consumer price indices in OECD <Col N="1174" /> countries published by the OECD.  A number of steps to check the rate of inflation in Ireland have been taken by the Government during the past seven months.  These included the subsidies introduced in June, 1975, and also the efforts being made by the Government to secure restraint in the growth of incomes.  The success of these measures so far is shown by the growth of incomes.  The success of these measures so far is shown by the fact that the consumer price index in August, 1975, showed a fall of 0.8 per cent, and in November, 1975, showed a rise of only 2.8 per cent.  Over the six months from May to November, 1975, the index rose by only 1.96 per cent.  Only three other OECD countries have had a lower rate of increase than this country in their consumer price indices during that period.</P>

I advised the association then that as the Sacred Heart national school, Ballygall Road, serves both the parish of Glasnevin and Ballygall and as Our Lady of Grace national school, Ferndale Avenue, Ballygall, also caters for infant boys, it is considered that there are adequate facilities available at present to cater for the Violet Hill estate.
