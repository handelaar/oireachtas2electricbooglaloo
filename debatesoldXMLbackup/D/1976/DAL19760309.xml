      <P>The number of staff vacancies in my Department on 1st January, 1976, was 122.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason is because the establishment for the prison service was increased by 111 during the year 1975 and it was not found possible to fill all those new posts during that year.  The figure of 122 has been reduced to 93 since 1st March so the number is coming down steadily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has any plans to help prevent a further increase in the number of under-age persons drinking alcohol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply on 17th April, 1975&mdash;Dáil Official Report, Volume 279, No. 12, columns 2056 to 2058&mdash;to a parliamentary question on the same subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of those who have not that volume to hand can the Minister tell us the nature of the reply to which he has referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying on that occasion that the problem of under-age drinking is a community matter, that it is not something that the law can deter <i>per se</i> and that the main attack on the problem must be made by the community.  In that reply, too, I indicated the legal difficulties of prosecuting for under-age drinking.  It <Col N="1409" /> is an offence in respect of which knowledge on the part of the publican must be proved and it is difficult to prove an offence but in cases where information is available to members of the public, the Garda will be pleased to receive it so that they may be helped to combat the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With a view to assisting publicans regarding the question of age would the Minister consider the provision of identity cards for those between 18 and 21?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated already the fallacy of the suggestion of providing identity cards for those who have not yet reached the legal age.  It would not be appropriate to have such cards but if we were to have cards at all they would have to be for the adult population so that a person who was unable to produce an identity card would be refused a drink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the number of people prosecuted for drunken driving or for being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while drunk is increasing or decreasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant statistics are contained in the annual crime reports of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent report avilable relates to the year ended 30th September, 1974, and it shows that the total number of prosecutions for driving, attempting to drive, or being in charge of a mechanically-propelled vehicle while drunk or while having a blood alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit, was 40 per cent higher in that year than in the previous year.  There was an increase of 98 per cent in the number of prosecutions for refusing to provide a preliminary specimen of breath or for refusing to provide or permit the taking of a urine or blood specimen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have given are up-to-date statistics.  There is no information as to whether they are increasing.  However, the graph has been upwards and this is an indication of intense police activity in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans for bringing forward further legislation in an effort to have a decrease in the figures this year rather than to let them continue to increase each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective deterrent is the knowledge of almost certain detection and conviction. These figures show that the detection rate is extremely high and this situation is the most effective deterrent we can have especially when one has regard to the severe penalty that follows a conviction.  The law, of itself, will not prevent people from drinking and driving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the anxiety of parents regarding whooping cough and vaccination against the disease.  Whooping cough is a serious health risk to children in this country and has caused 21 deaths in the last ten years.  There is a risk factor associated with many medical procedures but the risk factor associated with whooping cough vaccination is minimal compared with the advantages of preventing and controlling the disease.  My Department, therefore, continue to recommend this vaccination.  There are certain contra-indications to vaccination which doctors are well aware of and which are taken into consideration by the vaccinating doctor who makes the decision as to whether any child should be vaccinated.</P>

      <P>It is evident from the increasing attention to environmental questions in the public media, and in the activities of community groups of all kinds that people are more aware of environmental matters and that they are anxious that natural resources should be preserved from pollution.  I believe that there is also a better appreciation of the need to achieve a proper balance between the requirements for environmental protection and those for furthering the development process and the fostering of employment.  I have no doubt that these welcome trends are due, to a significant degree, to the increasing attention which the Government are giving to the environment, as evidenced by the legislative programme, and our involvement in the EEC action programme on the environment.  I have no plans for a survey on the lines referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The rounding up or down of quarterly and six monthly rates has been a regular feature of motor tax regulations and is not designed for revenue purposes but rather to facilitate administration of the system.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to furnish a reliable estimate of the effect of the recent change in the method of rounding up and down, and in particular of one aspect of it.  I would remind the Deputies that in a number of cases the quarterly and six monthly rates are either rounded down from 24p or are exact calculations at units of 50p and that it is only in some cases that there is a rounding up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is not much revenue involved, would the Minister's social conscience allow him to give a <i>pro rata</i> rate for quarterly <Col N="1420" /> taxes on motor cars because it is the workers in the poorer sections of the community who cannot afford to tax their cars for the year who are caught under this regulation?</P>

Those roads have not been brought up to the standard over a long period.  What I have done this year was to give permission to councils, such as Kildare, to spend more money on county roads where, I understand, money is very badly needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the answer was in the form of a tabular statement, therefore he has the answer in front of him.  Perhaps he would like to give the details, because the county manager would be delighted to hear where he will get £3,500,000 to pay for contracts for which he is already committed.  The Minister has not given him the money and has given no indication where he is to get the money.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that last year the Kildare County Council got an allocation of £3,500,000 and this year their request, which was reasonable and well thought-out, was for £800,000?  Is he also aware that this year's allocation is only half the amount given last year, £250,000?  In effect, his decision has placed a moratorium on all development in the county.  He has decided that Kildare shall not grow until such time as he decides they are entitled to more money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The money allocated this year was allocated fairly.  It is 130 per cent more than was given a year before I took office.  I have not enough money for sanitary services and I stated that last year and this year.  There have been tremendous improvements since we took office, but still a great deal needs to be done.  The blame for this will not lie with me or the Government to which I belong, but with successive Governments.  I made this point on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister try to make himself aware of the rather difficult situation that exists in Carrigaline because of the Minister's continued policies over a number of years which have contributed to the collapse of about five builders in that area, creating particular problems for people who had their houses half-built or who are living in estates now not completed?  Does he realise that because of his policies the council have little or no redress in regard to having these estates put in decent livable condition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear the Deputy has again got the facts wrong.  There are ten unfinished estates in the Carrigaline area; three will be taken in charge shortly; five are in course of construction and will not be completed for some time; two have gone into liquidation and the council are negotiating to have the schemes completed by those responsible.  In view of that it is foolish for Deputy Fitzgerald to suggest that because of something I did these people are not having their estates completed.  It is a matter for the council to see that the terms of the planning permission are carried out and it is not my responsibility. No representations were made to me about this but I inquired from the council as the Deputy could have done if he had taken the time instead of putting down a question here.</P>

Rather than bluff me, would he not further inquire as to the accuracy of the fact that in five housing estates in Carrigaline four builders have gone into liquidation because of the policies continued by the Minister which have crucified builders of private housing estates?

      <P>The relevant legislation lays down that the Civil Service Commissioners can accept a person as qualified for appointment only if they are satisfied that he or she is suitable in all the necessary respects for appointment.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in connection with making appointments the Civil Service Commissioners resort to confidential inquiries and so forth including inquiries from former employers, for instance, and other quarters and they undertake that any information supplied to them in the course of their inquiries will be treated confidentially and it would be against the best interests of both employers and employees if there was to be a breach of that confidentiality and in certain cases this could arise.  So, it is not the practice of the Civil Service Commissioners to furnish the information on which they make their decision.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that this candidate went through all the necessary examinations, and qualified for appointment, went through the medical examination and was given every indication right along the line that she was acceptable for this appointment only to be told quite bluntly at the last moment that she was not acceptable.  Is the Minister for the Public Service not attempting to bring a new up-to-date, modern outlook to this whole question of recruitment to the public service and to dispense with the Victorian type of attitude adopted by the Civil Service Commissioners? I understood that was the attitude now prevailing in the Department of the Public Service.  Will the Minister confirm that that is so, that he is hoping to drag the Civil Service Commissioners procedures into the middle of the 20th century?  If that is so would he, if he is not prepared to disclose it to me or the House&mdash;I can readily understand that he might not be prepared to disclose to me or the House details of this case&mdash;not think it fair, reasonable and just that in the circumstances of this case the candidate should be given some indication as to why she was not acceptable in view of the fact that her rejection was at the very last moment, the very final stages of the whole procedure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirements which must be filled by any applicant to the civil service are set out in section 17 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, which is not the middle of the last century but the middle of the 20th century.  The requirements there set out are, I am satisfied, and I am sure the House should be satisfied, requirements that any reasonable employer should ensure are fulfilled.  If the Civil Service Commissioners in the exercise of their statutory responsibilities are of opinion that these requirements are not fulfilled they may not appoint the candidate in question. Unfortunately, cases arise where candidates are successful in written examinations, in interviews and indeed in medical examinations, where general unsuitability or lack of fulfilment of these requirements leads them to be excluded at the end of the examining <Col N="1437" /> process.  The only way in which this disappointment at the end of a build up of expectation can be avoided would be not to give any indication to candidates until all the procedures and all the investigations and inquiries have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the majority of cases this would be most unfair to candidates who like to know as soon as possible whether or not they have been successful so that they may decide on their careers.  It is 12 years since an issue of this kind was raised in the House and on that occasion a distinguished predecessor of mine, Dr. James Ryan, adopted the same line as myself. I consider he was right in those circumstances although he was pressed also to state the reasons and if not prepared to state them in the House to state them to the person in question.  In the interests of the candidates and the people from whom the Civil Service Commissioners must make inquiries it is considered that it is undesirable that information should be given in that way.</P>

      <P>When report No. 13 of the National Economic and Social Council entitled <i>Economy in 1975 and Prospects for 1976</i> was published, the Government indicated that they <Col N="1443" /> regarded the report as a timely and valuable analysis of the position of, and outlook for, the economy.  They agreed with the emphasis in the report on the need in 1976 to improve the competitiveness of Irish goods and services especially through income restraint.  We are in broad agreement that to help the economy to get moving again there should be no increase in incomes in 1976 beyond the final standard increase of the 1975 National Agreement between trade unions and employers.  Members of the Government have on many occasions in the past few months stressed the need for a pay pause. The budget both in the view taken of economic developments and in the forecasts of public expenditure and revenue was based on the expectation that the required measure of income restraint would be forthcoming. In our circumstances there is no alternative to a pay pause.</P>
      <P>Page 5 of the NESC report deals with the recession in the international economy in 1974 and 1975.  I would not disagree with the statements made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of today's reports of 500 redundancies in a food processing industry in the south of Ireland; if he will state the reasons for this massive lay-off; and if he will intervene as a matter of urgency in <Col N="1458" /> an effort to postpone or cancel the redundancy notices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the industry concerned is having difficulties due to shortages of animals suitable for slaughtering and that these difficulties may lead to the lay-off of substantial numbers of workers for a period.  However, the situation is under discussion between the industry concerned and the trade unions and it would be premature to anticipate the outcome of these discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the main cause is the obviously incorrect policies operated in the agricultural sector? Further, will the Minister state if there is any hope that the figure of 500 can be reduced, and what steps he and his Department have taken to intervene in the situation?  Will he tell us what is the actual position now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the National Manpower Service in both areas are keeping in touch with the situation and there are meetings between the unions and the managements concerned.  I suspect that in the general area of agricultural policy the Deputy may find himself somewhat astray.  In the area of his brief in so far as it concerns him, discussions are going ahead between the management and the unions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Minister's reply that he is blaming the redundancies on the shortage of animals.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 46 to 49, to delete paragraph (b) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) In this subsection, a reference to a contract or agreement does not include a reference to a contract or agreement&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  which is a complete grant, transfer, assignment or conveyance; or</P>
      <P>(ii)  which was enforceable by action prior to the 28th day of February, 1974.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5, subsection (6), as amended in Committee, charges tax on a gift made on or after 28th February, 1974, in pursuance of a contract made before that date if there is a <Col N="1465" /> conveyance on or after that date.  The purpose of the present amendment is to limit this to the case where the prior contract was unenforceable before that date.</P>
    <P>The House may recall that we had a discussion on this on the Committee Stage.  In view of the provisions of section 5, subsection (1), the gift is taken when a binding contract to make it is entered into, so that if a binding contract was made before the date of the White Paper, 28th February, 1974, there would be no gift or tax payable. Section 5, subsection (6), as originally introduced, made an exception in the case where the binding contract was made before the date of the White Paper and the assignment conveyance in pursuance of the contract was made after that date, so that gift tax would be charged in such case.  There was an amendment on Committee Stage in regard to a subsequent transfer or conveyance.  I accept this rule could be unfair in some cases and the present amendment proposes that tax will not be charged in respect of a complete grant, transfer or assignment or conveyance. I take it this takes care of the points that were validity raised.</P>

      <P>In page 12, lines 38 to 41, to delete subparagraph (ii) and to substitute the following subparagraph:&mdash;</P>

    <P>This is a technical amendment mainly of a drafting nature.  One of the cases which the sub-paragraph is designed to cover is as follows.  A foreigner leaves a bequest of all his investments to a legatee.  The investments are partly Irish and partly foreign.  The taxable inheritance is the Irish part of the inheritance, that is, the Irish investments. As sub-paragraph (ii) stands, it does not cover this case because it deals only with property &ldquo;out of which&rdquo; property was to be appropriated whereas, in this example, the investments as a whole constitute the property which is to be appropriated to the inheritance.  This amendment is designed to cover that type of case.</P>

      <P>In page 19, subsection (2), line 14, to delete &ldquo;In so far as any gift or inheritance&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Save as provided in subsection (7), in so far as any gift or inheritance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are designed to afford relief to timber comprised in a gift or inheritance taken by a donee or successor who does not meet the requirements of being a &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; within the terms of the defination in section 19.  The relief applies to growing trees and underwood only and not to the land on which they are growing. In section 19, growing trees and underwood are agricultural property and if comprised in a gift or inheritance taken by a person who satisfies the requirements of the definition of a farmer, such trees and underwood may be valued at their agricultural value.  In most cases only 50 per cent of the market value of standing timber would be liable to tax.  If the land and timber are worth more than £200,000 a maximum deduction of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> £100,000 is permissible, but it appeared that the concession made to agriculture and forestry in section 19 may not be available in regard to a large proportion of privately owned woodland in the State because, due to the long period required for the maturity of planting, only persons with fairly considerable private means can afford to hold on to woodland as a long-term investment.  Thus the donee or successor would not qualify as a farmer because his nonagricultural wealth represents more than 25 per cent of his total wealth.</P>
    <P>To assist what would be regarded as a nationally and socially desirable, though often unremunerative, form of industry, the proposed amendment is being introduced.  In the case of growing trees, the amendment seeks to remove the requirement that the donee or successor be a farmer as defined.  This means that any donee or successor who takes such property may have 50 per cent of its market value deducted, or if the property is worth more than £200,000 may make a deduction of £100,000.  It relates to trees and underwood only and not to the land itself.  Woodland has a fairly small amenity value apart from that of the trees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Any amendment which is designed to improve the position in relation to forestry, the growing of timber, is very welcome.  As the Minister said, and as we had pointed out, the nature of forestry is such that it requires a long-term investment without return for a very long time. Consequently any amendment designed to ease the effects of the impact of capital acquisitions tax in relation to such property is welcome and desirable in the national interest. Whether these amendments give adequate relief in regard to forestry is another matter.  I rather doubt in regard to all the circumstances whether it does, but it is welcome in so far as it improves the position.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 4, I asked the Minister whether the reference to subsection (7) is intended to relate to the existing subsection or the proposed new subsection (7).</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): This is desirable because this type of investment is very necessary in many counties in Ireland where forestry would be an ideal type of investment.  It is, however, a most expensive form of investment because of the prolonged period over which it operates.  It takes from ten to 15 years to realise anything out of such an investment&mdash;in other words realisation of one's investment would be in a future generation.  Therefore, all possible encouragement should be given to invest in forestry if only from the point of view of easing the situation in which we have to import such a lot of foreign timber.  There are certain counties in which this type of investment is ideally suited and, if we could get a right development plan for these counties and give them the proper encouragement, this would be a step in the right direction and the Minister is perfectly right in not confining this to farmers.</P>

      <P>a further gift or inheritance taken by the same donee or successor under another disposition made by the same disponer (being the disposition by which that interest has come to an end) shall not be a taxable gift or a taxable inheritance in so far as it consists of the whole or any part of the same property&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to alleviate possible hardship that could arise in cases which are not unusual, particularly in the transfer of farms. Hardship could arise, for instance, in this kind of case: you could have two charges for tax attaching to the same property taken by the same person from the same disponer and the amendment is designed to prevent the property being taxed more than once <Col N="1470" /> should a situation like that arise.  For example, A settles property on himself for life with remainder to B.  The only claim under this disposition will arise when B takes his interest in possession, normally at A's death, on which occasion inheritance tax would become payable.  But if A should surrender his life interest voluntarily to B he has made another gift to B which again would give rise to a tax on such a gift.  As the same disponer and the same property are involved and as A has parted with only the one property it is necessary to provide that the property will be taxed once only.  Under subsection (1) the tax to be paid would be inheritance tax arising on the first disposition on the taking in possession by B of the property.</P>

      <P>Would inheritance tax arise at that stage on the value of what A is surrendering?  What is passing from A at that stage is the value of the life interest to B but B is also getting at that stage the whole property.  What happens then at that point?  Is tax payable on the value of the property as though A had died, plus whatever the value of the life interest being surrendered is, or how is it calculated?</P>

      <P>The inheritance tax will be on the full disposition of the property because, in fact, what would happen would be it would be an accelerated inheritance.  Originally the disposer would be settling property on himself for life with remainder to B. He accelerates it then but, rather than tax him both on the gift of the property during A's life plus an inheritance tax on the inheritance at the end of A's life, we simply charge the inheritance tax on the value of the property, B going fully into possession, of course, when A will leave the property to him.</P>

      <P>As far as the object of this amendment is concerned I would certainly concur with it, but I must confess I find the drafting of the amendment taken in conjunction with the section itself very confusing.  The first line reads:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (2)</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
      <P>The provisions of subsection (1) shall not prejudice any charge for tax in respect of any gift or inheritance affecting the same property or any part of it under any disposition.</P>
      <P>That is other than that mentioned in subsection (1).  Now that is confusing enought but the next subsection starts:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (2)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then what is set out in the amendment applies.  Would it be possible to make this a little clearer?  That would be helpful because as subsection (3) stands it will take a great deal of working out <Col N="1472" /> to determine what precisely is the effect having regard to the fact that it says &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (2)&rdquo; which itself provides that the provisions of subsection (1) shall not apply except in certain circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 23, after line 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The provisions of this section shall not have effect where the second-mentioned interest is taken under the disposition under which the first-mentioned interest was created.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment designed to confirm that section 26 is not intended to cut down the tax payable under a settlement under which property is settled on the life tenant with provision to enlarge his interest to an absolute interest&mdash;for example, on the happening of a particular event, or on his attaining a certain age, or at the discretion of the trustees.  The life tenant may under the terms of the settlement become absolute owner but, under section 20, he will be taxed in the first instance as life tenant only.  If the contingency happens his original tax may be reduced retrospectively under section 20 and, in addition, the absolute interest taken will be taxed but without any reduction under section 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stands, section 26 provides for this situation, because the term of the limited interest expires when the life interest is withdrawn and replaced by the absolute interest; as there is no &ldquo;unexpired balance of the term of the <Col N="1473" /> limited interest in possession&rdquo; for the purpose of paragraph (c) of subsection (1), the reduction provided for in the section would be zero in those circumstances, that is, as was intended, no reduction would be given.  It is considered that this interpretation of the section is too technical to be readily observable and it is considered that the addition of the new subsection will put the meaning beyond doubt.  The section is now clearly confined to a gift or inheritance taken by the life tenant under a disposition other than the original settlement&mdash;that is, normally the disposition of the remainder man who has made a gift of his remainder interest to the life tenant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where section 26 operates, A settles property on B for life with remainder to C absolutely. B is a lady and is aged 50 when she takes her life interest in possession. Tax is payable on 78 per cent of the then market value of the property. When she dies or when her life interest is released or otherwise merges in the remainder interest, the inheritance taken by C, or by any alienee from C, will be taxed under A's disposition.  Section 24 applies to any such premature cesser of her life interest.  The full market value of the property at the later date will be the basis of the taxable value of C's inheritance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a second claim for tax may also arise if B, the life tenant, were to take a gift or an inheritance of the remainder interest from C so <Col N="1474" /> that she is now absolute owner of the capital.  Section 26 applies to this possible claim for tax.  It does not apply to the primary claim for tax under A's disposition on C's inheritance which has been deferred until C, or his alienee, took an interest in possession. If B is now aged 60, the taxable value of the gift or inheritance she takes from C would, if section 26 did not apply, be the whole market value of the capital under sections 5, 11 and 18.  Section 26 permits the deduction of approximately 65 per cent in respect of B's existing life interest, and the remaining 35 per cent of the present value of the funds will be taxable in respect of this second claim to tax.  Any tax payable under the first claim, on C's acquisition from A, will be deductible from the capital before its net value is arrived at for the purpose of the second claim.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Full consideration&rdquo; is mentioned in section 47 (2) in the proposed amendments to section 47 (3), section 48 (4) and in section 64 (2).  For consistency it is advisable to insert &ldquo;full&rdquo; before &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; in this section also, since a sale could be held to be <i>bona fide</i> even if not for full consideration.  An accountable person could make a partial gift of the property to another by a sale at under value and the recipient would not be considered accountable.  The property would, in any event, be charged under section 47, but without the proposed amendment the purchaser could not be called on to deliver a return or to furnish information.  It would be necessary to prepare an official estimate of the tax and to sue for payment under section 49 (4).  I might mention in relation to this that on Committee Stage my colleague, the Minister for Lands, was standing in for me at that time.  This inconsistency was brought to his notice by Deputy <Col N="1477" /> Colley and the Minister for Lands undertook, on my behalf, to make this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having covered this point. He did say something there which I would appreciate if he would clarify, that without this amendment tax would be payable but that it would not be possible to serve a notice on the purchaser and that an assessment would have to be made by the Revenue Commissioners. I am not quite clear why that would be so.  Does the Minister mean, when he says that tax will be payable, that the tax would be payable on the full value of the property as distinct from the <i>bona fide</i> consideration, which was not full value?</P>

The obligation to furnish the information would not lie on the donee, but by putting in the word &ldquo;full&rdquo; this obligation lies as of course there is an actual gift.</P>

      <P>If the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; was not in any way qualified by the word &ldquo;full&rdquo; then the obligation on the donee would not arise in the kind of case which we have in mind here.  Section 35 deals with accountable persons and it is making it clear.  The effect of putting in the word &ldquo;full&rdquo; in this case brings within the net of accountable persons a person who receives a property at less than its full value.</P>

In other words, why would he not be an accountable person anyway, at least <Col N="1478" /> in respect of whatever the consideration was?</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(9)  If a person, who is primarily accountable for the payment of tax in respect of a gift or inheritance (in <Col N="1479" /> this subsection and in subsection (11) referred to as the first gift or inheritance) derived from a disponer, has not paid the tax on the first gift or inheritance, the Commissioners may serve a notice in writing in accordance with subsection (11) on any person who is, by virtue of paragraph (a) (ii) or (b) of subsection (2), accountable for the payment of tax on any other gift or inheritance (referred to in subsections (10) and (11) as the second gift or inheritance) taken by the same donee or successor from the same disponer, and the person on whom the notice is served shall thereupon become accountable for the payment of tax in respect of the first gift or inheritance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are necessary for the protection of the tax and to facilitate recovery thereof from the person primarily liable.  The normal case in which resort would be <Col N="1480" /> had to this new provision is where a donee or successor who is resident abroad takes two separate benefits from one disponer under different titles and there is a personal representative or trustee resident in the State who has control over the property comprised in one gift or inheritance and the property comprised in the other is situate abroad and there is no person resident in the State who is accountable in respect of that foreign property.  For example, A dies domiciled in Ireland leaving property by will to B who lives outside the State, say, in Northern Ireland. A had also placed money in a Northern Ireland bank in the joint names of himself and B and the money passes by survivorship to B.  B has taken two inheritancies on A's death, one under the will and the other by survivorship.  The personal representative is liable under subsection (2) to pay the tax on the legacy under the will but only B himself is liable in respect of the money passing by survivorship because it does not vest in the personal representative.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment gives the commissioners the power to call upon the personal representative to account for and pay the tax on the money in Northern Ireland out of the property he holds for the successor under the will.  The result is that the executor will delay sending the legacy out of the State until the beneficiary has paid tax on the Northern Ireland money.  A similar situation could exist where a testator makes separate wills for his property in different countries with different personal representatives for a common beneficiary who is resident abroad.  The Irish personal representative would be asked to pay the tax on the foreign assets out of the funds held by him on behalf of that beneficiary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is accepting that principle.  He may recall that he did not accept it in other legislation, but I think it is a sound principle.  Could the Minister indicate, if he takes the first example that he gave where A dies domiciled in the State leaving property to B who is resident in Northern Ireland, and in addition to that A had money held jointly with B in a bank in Northern Ireland, and this is the property in respect of which the Minister is trying to ensure that tax is collected, how he envisages that the Revenue Commissioners will become aware of this transaction in the first place?  He will agree that it is quite conceivable that the personal representative might not be aware of it at all.</P>
      <P>Secondly, how does the question of liability arise in respect of property situate outside the State?  Can there be a liability in the country in which the property is situate&mdash;say, in this case, to the UK government&mdash;at the same time and in respect of the same property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary event, if an executor or personal representative is informed fully, he will include the asset outside the State when he is returning a schedule of assets to the Revenue Commissioners here.  In such a case a demand for payment would be made but if the personal representative is not aware of the existence of such an asset I acknowledge that he would be blameless in not returning it in the schedule of assets.  However, the legal obligation would rest on B to pay the appropriate duty, B being aware that duty was payable.  Assuming that B made a return to the UK authorities, liability of payment of capital transfer tax would arise in the UK but because of the double taxation agreements credit would be given for tax so paid against the liability for tax in this <Col N="1482" /> State.  The question of whether the tax is paid in another jurisdiction is a matter primarily for the authorities in that jurisdiction but our right to recover the tax on all assets that exist would be qualified only by the operation of the double taxation agreements.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with the use of the wording &ldquo;duly paid out&rdquo;.  If we are talking in terms of cash such phraseology would clearly be appropriate but if the property was, say, a house &mdash;leasehold property&mdash;would the phrase be appropriate?</P>

      <P>In page 30, after line 32, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Any oath or affidavit to be made for the purposes of this Act may be made&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  before the Commissioners;</P>
      <P>(b)  before any officer or person authorised by the Commissioners in that behalf;</P>

      <P>(d)  at any place outside the State, before any person duly authorised to administer oaths there.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsection (2) of section 37 the Revenue Commissioners may require a return or an additional return to be made on oath.  Of course, the Inland Revenue affidavit is also to be sworn. The amendment facilitates persons who are required to take an oath for the purpose of the Act by allowing the oath to be administered by a Revenue official or a peace commissioner if it is inconvenient for the person concerned to go before a commissioner for oaths. A similar provision exists in relation to death duties, under section 24 of the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891, as amended by section 7, subsection (6), of the Revenue Act, 1898.  That position applied only to stamp duty and as the capital acquisitions tax is <Col N="1484" /> not a stamp duty it is necessary to add the subsection proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 33, subsection (3), line 12, after &ldquo;sale&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or compulsory acquisition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on Committee Stage amendment No. 40 which inserted &ldquo;or compulsorily acquired&rdquo; in lines 2 and 3 of the subsection. The amendment is being proposed in the interest of consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a slight problem in regard to this amendment.  It is an amendment to subsection (3) and that subsection provides that:</P>
      <P>In any case where and to the extent that the property of which the taxable gift or taxable inheritance consists is sold or compulsorily acquired, all unpaid instalments shall, unless the interest of the donee or successor is a limited interest, be paid on completion of the sale and if not so paid, shall be tax in arrear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is to put in &ldquo;shall be paid on completion of the sale or compulsory acquisition&rdquo;. The intention is clear but my difficulty is that I am aware that in regard to compulsory acquisition proceedings it can happen that the proceedings may be completed, that is, that the legal formalities may be completed&mdash;or what will correspond to the closing of sale in the case of an ordinary sale&mdash;<Col N="1485" /> and a considerable time can elapse thereafter before the money is paid over by the local authority.  I doubt if it is the Minister's intention&mdash;if it is it would not be correct in my view&mdash; to provide that a person could become liable for payment of all the outstanding instalments, and so on, on completion of the legal formalities but without getting the proceeds of the compulsory acquisition.  That failure to pay would mean that the outstanding instalments would be taxed in arrear, thereby becoming liable for interest.  The kernel of this is the meaning of the word &ldquo;completion&rdquo; in relation to compulsory acquisition. If &ldquo;completion&rdquo; means payment of the money due there is no problem, but if it does not mean that, if it simply means completion of the legal formalities, there is a problem.  I doubt if the Minister would want the situation to be as it could be if &ldquo;completion&rdquo; in this context means just the legal formalities being completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley has a point.  In my view it is possible to have a compulsory acquisition order made and the local authority going in and using the land.  Then one may have the second stage of assessing the price and the compensation, which is often a very protracted procedure. There have been difficulties about getting the arbitration and the money assessed.  On a strict reading of the section there is a danger of interest for something like that running before the person gets money into his hand or has the ability to pay.  In my view it is necessary to qualify this by reference to &ldquo;money paid&rdquo;.  Under the compulsory acquisition code there is a provision whereby the compensation payable can be less than would otherwise be because the local authority agreed to carry out amenity works.  Very often this means a further delay and there is no final completion until the amenity works have been carried out.  This does not happen in all cases but I am aware that it has occurred.  It would be unfair to the person who had his property acquired if he had to pay interest. Admittedly, there is a provision for the payment of interest on <Col N="1486" /> the compensation money from a certain date but interest payable on compensation money may not be at the same rate as the interest that might be payable on tax.</P>

      <P>I believe it is a low rate of interest in today's terms but there is a real difficulty here and I should like the Minister to have a look at the drafting.  I can see his intention and in my view he is correct in the wording used but there should be something inserted to save an injustice occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a useful debate on this on Committee Stage and I said the Revenue Commissioners would not deem a compulsory acquisition to be completed until the consideration had been paid and received by the beneficiary.  Deputy Esmonde troubles me with the question of the compensation possibly taking the form of the completion of some amenity work which would require physical building.  The Revenue Commissioners inform me that their practice would be to deem the transaction not to be completed until the amenity work was completed which, in the light of experience, would give the beneficiary a considerable period of delay after the time that the terms of the transaction had been settled.</P>
      <P>We often have cases in relation to road widening where the transaction involves the rebuilding of a wall but these are matters which the Revenue Commissioners, using their powers of care and management of the tax, would be able to handle properly in the light of the difficulties which will arise in a particular situation.  I shudder to think of how complex the Bill might have to be to try to deal with all the difficulties that could well arise in situations of that kind.</P>

      <P>What about the situation with regard to compulsory acquisition under the Land Acts where land bonds are paid?  Will the bonds be accepted as payment?  It is all very well if they are 16 per cent land bonds as they are at present, but I can foresee some grave change with sterling doing peculiar things at present and this may affect other interest rates.

Having regard to the fact that land bonds when issued must be related to the interest paid by the State on the most recently issued national loan such land bonds would probably be quite near to par on the open market if sold at the time, all these events being current.  Of late some recently issued land bonds are being sold above par and the holders of such bonds would be welcome to surrender them at par if they so wished.</P>

      <P>Yes, they must be accepted in payment of the tax.  The question was posed whether or not land bonds paid where the Land Commission acquired a property could be used to pay the tax and I replied that they could.  Of course, such land bonds would be as close to par as would make no difference.  Historically issued land bonds&mdash;Deputy Fitzpatrick was contemplating land bonds which might be at a value of 65&mdash;would be surrenderable only at their market value and not at par.  The case at issue is whether land bonds paid for a piece of land could be handed over to the Revenue Commissioners for the <Col N="1488" /> purpose of paying any tax which might arise on the compulsory acquisition and the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 34, in lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;, in the case of real property,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the precedent set in section 42 of the Succession Duty Act, 1853, <Col N="1489" /> the present section, as drafted, emphasised the charge for tax on real property, which includes chattels real. On Committee Stage, subsection (2) was amended to apply to all property. Deputy Colley suggested that subsection (1) should be similarly amended.  Charges on personalty are normally not helpful in enforcing claims due to the informality of transfers of personalty and this is recognised in the amendment which imports a new subsection (3) in this section relating to purchasers who have no notice of a charge for tax.  In view of the protection so given by subsection (3), it is proposed to accept the view put forward by Deputy Colley on Committee Stage, that subsection (1) should apply to personalty as well as to real property.  Accordingly, the subsection now provides that all property, other than money or negotiable instruments which are impossible to charge, will be charged with tax if it is comprised of the gift or inheritance at the valuation date.  The revenue charge will have priority over charges created by the donee or successor.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as provided in the proviso, settled property, whether realty or personalty, may be dealt with by the trustees in strict conformity with the terms and the settlement of the charge will attach to the substituted property held by the trustees.  This will enable the trustees to sell and reinvest settled funds despite the charge for unpaid tax.  It is essential that the property be settled at the time of such sale.  If the successor had taken the settled propery absolutely on the death of a life tenant, it is no longer settled and the charge does not shift to the proceeds of the sale.</P>

I take it that the practical effect is this: All property, other than money or negotiable securities can become liable to the charge for tax, but similarly can be dealt with by way of what is in effect a certificate of discharge disposed of to <i>bona fide</i> purchasers without restriction, and that the same limitations <Col N="1490" /> would apply to all property, whether real or personal.  That is the intention, I presume and the effect of what is being done here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 34, after line 39, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Tax shall not be a charge on property under subsection (1) as against a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser or mortgagee of such property for full consideration in money or money's worth without notice, or a person deriving title from or under such a purchaser or mortgagee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to add a new subsection (3) to section 47 to free a purchaser or mortgagee from the charge if he takes the property for full consideration and without notice.  A person purchasing property or accepting <Col N="1492" /> a mortgage of property will need to ensure that the property is not subject to a charge for outstanding tax. If he does not see to this, he may have to pay the tax himself.  However, it is not considered desirable that every purchaser or mortgagee should have to seek out liabilities for tax.  The purpose of this amendment is to make the purchaser or mortgagee liable only if the fact that there is an outstanding charge for tax would have come to his attention if he had made the ordinary inquiries that purchasers and mortgagees usually make.  Thus, a man buying a house would usually have the title examined for some years back to make sure the person from whom he is buying has the right to sell and that there is no lien held by anybody else on the property.  It is proposed to make the purchaser in such a case liable for outstanding tax only if the fact that such tax could be payable would appear from the examination of the title.</P>
    <P>In the case of personal property such as stocks and shares a purchaser would not normally have notice of a transaction giving rise to a liability for tax and so he would be relieved by the amendment now proposed.  I might add that this amendment is in substitution for Committee Stage amendment No. 46 which appeared on the Order Paper but was not moved.  It differs from the Committee Stage version however in that it covers the case of the mortgagee and it inserts full consideration so bringing it into line with the other sections to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>First, to take the ordinary conveyance of a house or similar property where an investigation is being carried out: will this make any difference either to the requisitions on title which are required or the replies to requisitions required as a result of this amendment?  Can the Minister foresee that there will be any adjustment in that regard? Second, in relation to a different type of contract or sale, possibly of securities or incorporeal assets, sometimes you have inquiries whether there are debts or encumbrances of various sorts on the property.  Will the effect of this <Col N="1493" /> amendment and the section as amended be to require the formal requisitions being made as something in the same way as is customary in the case of realty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recalling from my experience the standard requisitions, there does not seem to me that there would be a need to make any significant change in requisitions.  Heretofore, say in the case of death duties, one would ask in requisitions on title if there was a death on the title, whether death duties had been discharged and would require evidence of their discharge, or as an alternative, adequate undertaking that they be duly paid. In relation to this tax, liability to tax could arise in the event of death and also in the event of a person on the title having received property for less than the full value.  These are cases that are quite within the normal experience of examiners of title and I would not think it would call for any remarkable departure, but obviously one has to look to the title and see whether or not there should be any cause giving rise to the tax and ask an appropriate requisition.  No doubt, as Deputy de Valera is aware, some requisitions are so widely drawn that even if the requisitioner had not alerted himself or herself to a particular issue the reply might identify the liability to tax.</P>

      <P>May I say to the Minister through the Chair that if there was any question of having to inquire about a simple debt, a direction or instruction from the Revenue Commissioners as to what they would require&mdash;these general things that are sometimes sent out&mdash;would perhaps help.  I know it is Report Stage and I do not want to open the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an organisation known as the Land Registry <Col N="1494" /> and I notice the words &ldquo;without notice&rdquo; used there.  There are two sections which provide for dealing with charges.  So far as I know, under the Registration of Titles Act there is no provision for any charge under this Act as affecting registered land.  I think it is fairly specific and is in section 72, I think, where a solicitor usually asks the vendor's solicitor for a declaration that the charges in that section do not affect the land.  I do not know how it is proposed to deal with this but, as Deputy de Valera quite rightly says, it would be a help to vendors and purchasers if there was some <i>vade mecum</i> or guide dealing with this matter.  There may be some provision in the Bill dealing with this, deeming it to be one of the charges under section 72 of the Registration of Titles Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had it at the back of my mind that it had been covered in this Bill.  The Minister said when proposing the amendment that the situation envisaged was that if a purchaser made normal inquiries and did not as a result receive notice of the charge then he was not bound by it.  I take it what the Minister meant by that was, say in the case of the purchase of land or house property, the normal inquiries would be the normal requisitions on title and it is not envisaged that in addition the purchaser would have to make specific inquiries of the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so envisaged. It strikes me that the Revenue Commissioners could not answer such a question if directed by a third party to them&mdash;it would be a breach of confidentiality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even on title matters, the application for discharge of death duties would tend to come from the party having an interest or liability in relation to payment of duties on the property in question, not from the <Col N="1495" /> purchaser from the vendor.  Rather it is the vendor who approaches the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that is quite right.  I think you can have situations in which, perhaps, there are no duties payable.  A subsequent purchaser who had nothing to do with the debt at all may have to get the certificate and produce it to show that no duty was payable at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Colley is correct in that, particularly under this Bill where tax is to be a charge on property&mdash;you are entitled to get a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners, anybody who has an interest in the property is entitled to get a certificate.  I think that has always been the case in relation to both succession duty and estate duty.</P>

    <P>The proviso to subsection (4) is for the protection of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser who had no knowledge of any fraud or concealment of material facts leading to the issue of a certificate discharging the property from tax.  Other accountable persons remain liable for the tax.  The proviso is being amended to extend protection to a mortgagee, to insert &ldquo;full&rdquo; before &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; and to use a better formula to cover the person deriving title from or under such a purchaser or mortgagee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is aware that there has been some difficulty in the past in relation to death duty certificates and getting a clearance.  You get a conditional one if it is the case of a personal representative and if there are any further transactions with the property within six years or within a certain period you may have to get a fresh one; you do not get a final certificate. If there were to be a certificate as contemplated under this, will it be a final certificate or will there be a provision whereby one has to go again because the certificate is only a provisional one?</P>

      <P>Apart from the point already raised there are some interesting changes of wording in this amendment compared with the section. The first part says: &ldquo;... provided that a certificate purporting to be a discharge of the whole tax payable in respect of any property included in the certificate in respect of a gift or inheritance shall exonerate from liability for such tax a <i>bona fide</i>...&rdquo; So far the wording is identical, but where in the original subsection, which we passed on Committee Stage it is stated &ldquo;for consideration&rdquo; we have now changed to &ldquo;or mortgagee for full consideration&rdquo;. That is a substantial change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the point already made, there is an implication about the finality of the certificate that Deputy Esmonde referred to.  The word &ldquo;full&rdquo; may be of some import here because a certificate might be issued <Col N="1498" /> and there might be a reopening. I take it that the word &ldquo;full&rdquo; did not just slip in there by accident.</P>

      <P>I am not making any point beyond spelling out what is in the section.  I am only making it in relation to a possible implication on the point raised by Deputy Esmonde.  This may have been raised before I came into the House.  The amendment states later on: &ldquo;... a person deriving title from or under such a purchaser or mortgagee&rdquo;. That seems to be wider than &ldquo;...claiming in right of the purchaser or on his behalf&rdquo;.  That is another change in wording because in the original it reads: &ldquo;...claiming in right of the purchaser or on his behalf&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wish to commend the Minister on doing this but I do not think there is any harm in adverting to what has happened.  I do not object to these changes.  Does the word &ldquo;full&rdquo; in any way affect the finality of a certificate or would there be grounds for reopening the matter on the change of wording from &ldquo;claiming in right of the purchaser or on his behalf&rdquo; to &ldquo;a person deriving title from or under such a purchaser or mortgagee&rdquo;.  I completely agree that the Minister has covered what he has intended to cover better than he covered it in the original Bill.  I am not approaching this in a purely critical spirit, but at the same time I want to say that the Minister has substantially amended the section, and beneficially so, subject to the point made by Deputy Esmonde.</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 40, lines 1 to 7, to delete subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes the deletion of subsection (4) of section 56.  The section in general deals with benefits taken on retirement or pensions and lump sums payable on the death of an employee.  In the section as initiated subsection 4 was inserted to exempt <Col N="1500" /> payments made by employers in respect of their contributions to superannuation funds or additional funds added by employers to top up such schemes where inflation had eroded the value of the funded benefits.  It was felt also that the subsection would pinpoint the fact that payments in the nature of salary, bonus, sick pay and casual unfunded pensions were not taxable.</P>
    <P>On reconsideration it is considered that the subsection is not required for the purposes mentioned because there is adequate protection in the rest of the Bill for those purposes.  For instance, employers' payments to superannuation would not be taxable as such because no person takes a beneficial interest in possession until actual benefits flow from the fund.  Such benefits so paid out will be adequately covered by subsection (1) as to the employee and subsection (5) as to dependants of the employee.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bona fide</i> payments in respect of salary, bonus and so forth would not normally be taxable because the employee by his service will have given full consideration in money or money's worth.  Additional benefits such as the use of a company house or car would normally be part of an employee's emoluments if shown to arise out of the <i>bona fide</i> contract of service between the employer and employee and would also be received for full consideration.</P>
    <P>In addition to the subsection being unnecessary, it is also desirable to delete it on the grounds that it might exclude a claim for tax under subsection (5), as proposed to be extended by the next amendment.  Any payment on the death of a person under any arrangement for superannuation is taxable as an inheritance derived from the deceased person whose services were the real basis for the benefits to his dependants.  Subsection (4) could jeopardise such a claim by being construed as an exemption of payments made by the employer where the pension was paid directly out of profits each year and not out of a separate fund.</P>
    <P>There is also a possibility that the subsection could be relied on to claim <Col N="1501" /> exemption where a gift or inheritance consists of the proceeds of an insurance policy, on the grounds that the payment of the proceeds was a payment made by the insurance company in the carrying on of its trade.  For all these reasons therefore the amendment is not only desirable but essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to concentrate on what the Minister said.  He said rather a lot so I did not get the whole gist of it.  I believe I am correct in saying that the Minister gave a number of reasons why what was sought to be carried out in this subsection is in fact covered in other provisions of the Bill.  He then went on to indicate two, if not more, reasons why leaving the subsection in could cause difficulty.  One of the cases he mentioned was the insurance company. Would the Minister briefly outline those points again, not the area in which he said the points are already covered but the actual, positive dangers that could arise by leaving in the subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of dangers, depending on which way one looks at them, whether it is in relief of the taxpayer or leaving in possibilities which I am sure the legislators do not intend.  I said that employers' payments to superannuation schemes would not be taxable as such because no person takes the beneficial interest in possession until the actual benefits flow from the superannuation fund. <i>Bona fide</i> payments in respect of salary, bonus and so on, would not normally be payable because the employee, by his service, gives valuable consideration for money's worth.  Additional benefits, such as a company house or car, would normally be part of an employee's emoluments and would be in return for the full consideration of his service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in addition to the subsection being unnecessary on those accounts, it is desirable to delete it on the grounds that it might exclude a claim for tax under subsection (5), as we hope to extend this by the next amendment.  Any payment on the death of a person under any arrangement for superannuation is taxable as an <Col N="1502" /> inheritance derived from the deceased person whose services were the real basis for the benefits to his dependants, that is, the services of the deceased person which give rise to the payment to the dependants.  Subsection (4) could jeopardise such a claim if it were construed as an exemption of payments made by an employer where the pension was paid directly out of profits each year and not out of a separate fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are doing in the next amendment is providing that, where benefit arises in such cases, if there is a liability to tax, the liability will arise out of the benefit being received from the deceased and not from the employer.  This should operate, in most cases, to the benefit of the beneficiaries, because the likelihood is that they would be in closer relationship with the deceased than they would be to the employer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case the Minister mentioned where the benefits were being paid by the employer out of his profits, would the consequences be in the light of subsection (5) as the Minister proposes to amend it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to take amendment No. 25 in isolation.  Perhaps we could move forward for a moment, Sir, with your permission. In amendment No. 26 we are providing that &ldquo;superannuation scheme&rdquo; includes any arrangement in connection with employment for the provision of a benefit on or in connection with the retirement or death of an employee.  This extends superannuation <Col N="1503" /> schemes beyond the normal understanding of that term.  Such an extension includes what I have been describing: a case where a former employer might be paying out of current profits to the dependants of the deceased employee.  If we had not that extension of &ldquo;superannuation scheme&rdquo;, such payments could not be regarded as tantamount to superannuation benefits.</P>

The Minister wants to ensure that payments out of profits to dependants of former employees will be liable to tax in the same way as out of a superannuation <Col N="1504" /> scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 27, holding companies sometimes transfer assets to their subsidiary companies and they do this for good commercial reasons. Normally when this is done section 34 will prevent tax being payable on the transaction.  However, if the companies involved do not include a company to which section 34 applies by reason of having at some time issued shares as a result of a public invitation to subscribe to the shares, it is desirable to make the provision proposed by the present amendment to secure that tax will not be payable on the transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been recognised for some time that transactions of this type should not be taxed because what is happening is that the owners of the assets are taking them out of one pocket and putting them into another and there is really no gift involved. An analogous relief of stamp duty is given by section 19 of the Finance Act, 1952.  An example of the kind of transaction affected would be <Col N="1509" /> where a parent company transfers assets to a subsidiary company for the purposes of trade of the subsidiary company.  A parent company could also make an interest-free loan to its subsidiary.  Cases have occurred where parent companies forgave debts due to them by their subsidiaries. Also, there may be transactions which may not be at arm's length and commercial transactions may take place between two companies in a group, each of which is owned by a holding company.  As Deputies are aware, we have been discussing this in relation to the Corporation Tax Bill and generally we are treating these transfers in the same way.  It could be called a form of group relief.</P>

      <P>The idea behind the amendment is acceptable.  Clearly, the liability which could arise on transactions of this kind between closely associated companies would be unreasonable unless some such provision were made.  The only question I want to put to the Minister about this is on the definition in subsection (3), that is, the definition of companies being associated.  Does that correspond with similar provisions in other legislation?  I think the Minister mentioned the Finance Act, 1952.  Is it definite, and where does this definition correspond with any of the group relief provisions in more recent legislation?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to this Bill cannot really be envisaged in isolation from the other capital taxation measures.  This Bill represents to a great extent what was needed to be done in order to reform the death duty situation.  I say that speaking in general rather than specific terms of all the provisions of the Bill.  In general terms we did not oppose this Bill on the Second Stage or subsequent Stages because the general approach of giving relatively high exemptions, not as high as in the Bill, in relation to what were death duties and are now called inheritance tax, combined with an effective gift tax, constitute the right approach to the reform of the death duty system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the other capital measures introduced, one we considered quite damaging to the interests of the economy; the other, the capital gains tax, we consider to be wrongly conceived as <Col N="1511" /> brought in&mdash;not the capital gains tax as such, but as brought in.  However, this measure should have been brought in first.  It is most urgently needed from the point of view of the Revenue and of the taxpayer.  It is, unfortunately, the last of the Bills.  In view of the urgency of the matter I agree to the taking of the Final Stage of the Bill now, although I would have preferred in the circumstances a little more time to make the final contributions from this side of the House. Nevertheless, I am conscious that this Bill should have been enacted a considerable time ago and was far more urgent than the other measures which came before the House in the form of capital taxation.</P>
    <P>The general principle involved of the considerably higher exemptions from death duties in the case of close relatives combined with an effective gift tax is the right approach.  I feel that the exemptions in this Bill in some cases are too high and socially unjustifiable.  However, the fact that the Bill contains no provisions for remedying the ravages of inflation will probably quite soon remedy the complaint about the exemptions being too high.  Unfortunately, in other categories where it is not too high, but rather too low, already the position will be aggravated considerably, and very soon, because of the consequences of inflation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there was not incorporated in this Bill, which is far more important than either the Wealth Tax Act or the Capital Gains Tax Act, provision to adjust the various thresholds in line with inflation. The Minister has set his face against that, and the consequences of his doing so are already making things felt to some people and will in a relatively short time affect quite a number of people adversely and wrongly.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless there are good features in this Bill, quite a number of them, and we have said so as we went through it.  There are areas in which we are not satisfied with the contents, but it will not be too long before we will have the opportunity to perfect <Col N="1512" /> this Bill and make it more in keeping with the requirements of the people today.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, this measure, while not perfect by any means, is not a bad vehicle for approaching the question of capital taxation.  If it had been, even in its present form, combined with a sensible scheme of capital gains tax, the Minister and the Government would have had a great deal to boast of.  However, they do not have anything like that to boast of.  On the contrary they have a great deal to answer for in the whole package of capital taxation which has been introduced by them and of which this Bill is the last of the current measures.  Because of the nature of the Bill and the technicalities involved many people will not understand for a long time the full implications of this measure.  For the same reason we can be quite certain it will be necessary to amend this legislation, whatever Government are in power. That is inevitable in the nature of the technical kind of Bill it is, the kind of transactions with which it will be dealing. But I can say of this Bill at least, with much greater accuracy than it would be possible for me to say in respect of other capital taxation measures, that it contains greater provisions for good than for bad, and in the context of the kind of measures we have been having from the Government and the Minister for Finance, that is fairly high praise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, and with one exception, I agree with Deputy Colley's assessment of the Bill.  On the Fifth Stage we are limited and not permitted to go into detail in regard to the other Bills which form part of the new capital taxation code.  As Deputy Colley said, part of that code was rushed and in one case misconceived, in our economic circumstances, and the facts are beginning to prove this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree this Bill is a good effort to solve a problem and to bring our inheritance laws up to date, but Deputy Colley is right when he said it will not be quickly understood by people outside and that practice will show up points where the Act will <Col N="1513" /> need amendment.  In regard to the first, it might be as well to say what the Bill does, and in regard to the second, we cannot ever hope that any Bill will come from the stocks in perfect final form: indeed no Bill ever is in final form.  In that connection the most immediate consideration, of course, is devaluation of currency and inflation.</P>
    <P>I said there was one point on which I did not agree with Deputy Colley. I take a different view from him on these exemptions.  I suppose that our society being in its present transitional stage, the Minister is probably right in regard to the scales and Deputy Colley is perhaps justified in the pragmatic attitude he adopted. There are in the Schedule cases where the allowances are perhaps too low but there will be erosion of these allowances because of inflation and devaluation of sterling.  I should not like that it would go abroad that this measure is one of finality.  Though we praised the Minister in regard to parts of this legislation, and although we will not ask him for a further commitment in regard to this Bill in this House&mdash;I am thinking of its debate in the Seanad&mdash;I should not be surprised in the present climate of inflation and devaluation if the rates were increased, but we should like to ensure that at least the parity of the position as defined at this moment by this Bill would be preserved.  Perhaps I am standing on my own when I say that.</P>
    <P>The Bill will go to the Upper House in different circumstances to those in which it came to us.  Indeed there were different circumstances when the Minister proceeded to prepare this legislation than when it came before us. The economic climate was far different then.  If we were now giving the Bill a Second Reading we might take a somewhat different view than we do when the Bill is to all intents and purposes passed.  It is a matter for the other House to take into account the changes that have taken place, and there I leave that point.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in the Bill that I have always felt will possibly be in ease of the administration, the Revenue, <Col N="1514" /> something that is not quite the type of thing envisaged by all the white papers and other documents beforehand.  It is important that people know what this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>Most people have the impression that this is a Bill which takes over the old death duties code and is notable for the reliefs it gives in an area where the former death duty code lay very harshly on certain people and particularly on families.  That the Bill does and that impression is correct <i>pro tanto.</i> However, it is not quite as generally appreciated that this Bill as well as doing these two desirable things, bringing up to date our death duty code, if I may use the words without giving offence to the Minister who claims to have abolished death duties, gives reliefs and tidies up the old uncertainties and makes certain things definite&mdash;all of these things it does but, at the same time, it makes a certain fundamental alteration in the law which has the effect of substantially increasing taxation. That is something that should be realised.  I am not arguing whether or not that increase in taxation is to be justified.  We have said we are generally in favour of this Bill.  That is quite a different matter from appreciating what is in the Bill and the function of the debate on the Fifth Stage is to bring out clearly what we are finally passing.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial change in the law.  Heretofore a gift tax was unknown to our law.  A gift tax is a new tax and it is a new burden on gifts even in the closest family circle, subject of course to the generous exemptions&mdash;I go that far with Deputy Colley&mdash;the Minister is giving.  Nevertheless this is a new tax imposed by this Bill.  The Bill also imposes a new tax called an inheritance tax.  That, however, should not be considered as a new tax in quite the same way because it is simply the substitution of what was essentially the old tax under a new name, with modifications, and again with generous reliefs, reliefs for which the Minister is entitled to credit.  It is important to realise that <Col N="1515" /> basically this is what this Bill does. These are new taxes.</P>
    <P>I come now to my second point, the aggregation of gift tax and inheritance tax.  This is a continuing burden.  I know the Minister will make the answer he is entitled to make and I concede it to him so he need not waste his breath.  The limits of the reliefs make the practicality of what I am saying not so harsh but the fact remains that the tying up together of gift tax and inheritance tax has the effect of extending what used to be the five-year period.  Under the old dispensation, when a person died his estate was reckoned to include&mdash;I am putting this in non-technical and general language&mdash;all gifts and dispositions within the previous five years.  I think the period was extended to seven years in England. There was certainly a good deal of talk and possibly pressure to extend the period to seven years or even ten years here under Finance Acts in the past.  But, although talked about, it was not done and there was strong arguments for not doing it.  The position was that once the five years had elapsed the gift or the asset, or whatever it was, was free and no longer captured or accountable for the purpose of death duties. If I am wrong in that I will be glad if the Minister will correct me.</P>
    <P>A moment ago the Minister talked about being away from practice for three years and I reminded him that I am 25 years away so I could easily make a mistake.  The effect of that five-year period was that at the end of the period the gift or asset, or whatever it was, was free.  The trouble here is it will no longer be five years, seven years or ten years.  It will be the whole period from 1969 until the testator dies, if it is an inheritance, and it is an accumulation until the gift limit is exhausted, if it is not an inheritance.  Is that an accurate summary?  I rather think it is.  Here then we have a Bill imposing new taxation which will operate against the taxpayer in so far as the liability over a five-year period now becomes an unlimited accumulation from 1969 to be captured when the <Col N="1516" /> limits are exhausted in either case and to be aggregated for the purpose of absorbing the allowances in the case of a decease.  Hitherto gifts within five years were taken into account.  Under this legislation all gifts over the entire period from 1969 until the giver dies will be taken in.  I concede that this is compensated for by the allowances.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister, I wonder, get the point?  If the Bill stood alone on the ground of the new gift tax for which it provides and on the ground of this device&mdash;which I do not suggest was meant to be an underhand one or slipping one over but, in the legal sense, a substitution of what you might call the period of life or a period up to a very large sum on gift&mdash;it would be objectionable.  I think we would find this grounds for opposing this measure, were it not for the benefits, the exemptions, the Minister has given.  I freely concede that these measures are sufficient justification here.</P>
    <P>That leads me backs to the point that we support the Bill generally and in the terms which Deputy Colley said, but, as I have said, there is no harm at all in our seeing what we are doing. In a nutshell, what the Bill does is to impose a new tax, to substitute for the old death duties a new type of death duties.  It provides for aggregation over a period starting in 1969 instead of five years.  As against all this, there are very substantial reliefs.  Deputy Colley thinks in certain categories they are too much.  There I have taken the democratic privilege of disagreeing with him, even as a colleague in the same party.  However, I do agree with him that perhaps an adjustment&mdash;and we argued this on another Stage&mdash;for some of the other categories in table III or even table IV, but certainly table III, would have been helpful.  But one cannot have perfection.  For these reasons I might go so far as to take the unusual course for an Opposition of saying it has our benediction, shall I say without the candles or the holy water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not want to spoil it.  In regard to the Bill and its administrative provisions, we should be concerned for the problems of the Revenue Commissioners.  On Second Stage we were concerned about the load on the Estate Duty Office as things were at that time. The Minister has since told the House that the situation has been improved. I would be a little perturbed about a sudden increase in pressure where it might not be possible to deal with matters as expeditiously as we would like, and that is one of the reasons why we are consenting to let the Bill go to the Upper House so that the matter can be disposed of as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Minister to give particular attention to the problems of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the administration of these Bills.  It may be necessary for him to come back to the House possibly with supplementary legislation or something of that nature.  If so, I would like to see the capital code kept intact if possible.  A start has been made here and I think it would be more satisfactory, if it is necessary to deal with some of these measures in another way, that they come in their own right rather than as sections in a Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>We thoroughly disagree with the Minister's policy on the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Gains Tax Bill; we do not disagree with this.  But in the case of all this legislation&mdash;and perhaps I should include the Corporation Tax Bill in this&mdash;this House and the public should appreciate the colossal amount of staff work and able thinking that went into the preparation of these measures.  I believe the Minister will be generous enough to acknowledge that, and that it did not come fully panoplied from him when he became Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have disagreed on and questioned some of the provisions in the legislation.  On this Bill I have queried the aggregation as from 1969.  I would have settled for the same aggregation of gifts from, say, the date of the White Paper with a transitional <Col N="1518" /> provision to keep the <i>status quo</i> as from 1969.  However, even with these differences, I think the whole House could join in a tribute to the people who prepared this measure, which is something that makes this Parliament feel that it has fulfilled its duty in considering and legislating on it.  It is not customary to go further than I have gone here in such a matter.  We take for granted the public service and the expertise that is behind the Minister.  It is our convention that the Minister, who carries the responsibility, gets all the bouquets also.  I hope the Minister will acknowledge, as we would like to acknowledge, the good staffwork that has been done here.  All I would like to say is that it is a pity we are not doing this in more fortunate times.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that, through the fault of nobody in this House or in this country, this legislation is naturally, shall I say, not ringing quite true because of the rapid deterioration in the economic situation in our environment and in our own location.  I do not think there is much further I can say on the Bill within order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): This, as we know, is the last leg of the Capital Taxation Bill. Other speakers have welcomed certain parts of it.  If it stood on its own we would all be welcoming this Bill as a step in the right direction.  This Bill is to relieve death duties.  We must also take into consideration that two other Bills have gone before it as a relief.  We were speaking of a sum of £13 million when these capital taxations first came before the House, but we must remember that two other Bills have already been processed through this House&mdash;the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Gains Bill&mdash;to replace death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many good parts in this Bill, but there are also many bad parts in it.  There is the part that does not make any provision for inflation. There is the part which fails to recognise or give any exemption to productive assets such as agriculture. There is the part which does not fully take into account how a nephew <Col N="1519" /> should inherit.  The allowances made in the Bill for brothers and sisters are appalling.  These are the bad parts of the Bill.  It is very easy to talk about the generous exemptions in the Bill, but, by and large, these generous exemptions will apply to very large holdings. I doubt very much whether there is a lot in the Bill for the mediumsized holding.</P>
    <P>As Deputy de Valera has already mentioned, we are introducing a tax which we have never had before, a gift tax.  There was provision in old legislation whereby many families made provision for brothers, sisters or nephews by drawing up agreements after five years.  Five years was the time allowed, but all these factors have been done away with in this Bill.  The allowance made to a brother or sister under paragraph 3 of the Schedule is absolutely appalling.  We are talking here of an exemption figure of £10,000.  Does anyone realise what the situation is in many holdings throughout this country?  Do many people know that there are many businesses and farms where brothers and sisters have lived all their lives?  It often happened that the eldest brother had to take out probate when the mother and father died.  It has happened on numerous occasions that a brother or sister stayed on with the eldest brother and built up the assets of that business or farm.  When the brother who owns the farm or business dies, the other brother or sister is allowed an exemption of only £10,000 under paragraph 3 of the exemptions. That is ridiculously low in this day and age.</P>
    <P>Other sections give sons and daughters exemptions of £150,000. I do not know how the Minister can reconcile that particular section with the other exemptions.  That aspect is wrong.  The exemptions are too low for brothers and sisters living on the estate.  I am not making a plea for brothers and sisters who have left the business or farm and established themselves elsewhere.  I believe that that exemption is not sufficiently high. I said it on Second Reading and on <Col N="1520" /> Committee Stage that some provision should be made to enlarge that allowance. I am not quite sure how a nephew or niece can qualify.  I know there is provision in the Bill for a nephew or niece who stands in the shoes of the son or daughter to qualify for the necessary exemptions.  I often wonder what criteria would be laid down for this.  Must the nephew or niece be there full-time for a certain number of years before he or she can qualify?  These things have not been spelt out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are many generous exemptions in the Bill.  On this side of the House we have always maintained that death duties created a terrible burden on widows and children after a death, and for that reason a Bill like this is welcome.  As I have already said, if it is taken in conjunction with the other Bills a lot of people might be under the impression that death duties have been abolished.  Of course, this is not true.  We have an inheritance tax which, in my opinion, deals just as severely with the brother or sister as this Bill does.  Indeed, I think they are worse off under this Bill. Before this Bill the brother who owned the estate could make provision for giving part of it to a brother or sister five years before his death.  Under this Bill, the brother or sister living on a farm or a business is worse off than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take a look at this aspect of the Bill.  I have pointed it out before, but evidently they seem to be looking at the social aspect of it, of breaking up holdings for this particular category of people. There is no other choice left for a brother or sister who is left on the holding but to sell it.  Probably that is the intention of the Minister, or maybe it is the social aspect in the Bill, but it would not be my way of legislating. I believe that these people are entitled to the same concessions as sons and daughters.  It is regrettable that the Capital Taxation Bill was brought in at the wrong time.  The White Paper, when it was published about two years ago, came in at a time when there was a downward turn in the economy. By and large, I believe that the long <Col N="1521" /> delays which take place before Bills are introduced and processed through the House, confuses the majority of business people.  It would have been preferable for the Minister merely to have increased the abatements in respect of death duties than to have introduced this Bill.  We have had long drawn out debates on the Government's package of taxation legislation. The two Bills that have been enacted, in particular that dealing with wealth tax, have had detrimental effects generally in regard to the undermining of confidence.  While there are aspects of this Bill that I welcome it contains some provisions with which I do not agree.  For instance, I am dissatisfied with the exemption of £10,000 in respect of brothers and sisters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended contributing on the Bill at this stage but I consider that some points which have been brought forcibly to my notice should be raised.  In particular there is the question of the allowances in respect of brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it abolishes death duties but having regard to the west where, unfortunately, many people have not married, holdings will be passing on death to the category of relatives I have mentioned and in respect of whom the remission is only £10,000.  In the past we may have considered property of £10,000 to be sufficient to classify its owner as rich but at today's values and having regard to the inflation rate, this will mean very little to a person inheriting property and in many cases may involve holdings having to be sold in order to enable the inheritor to pay the duty.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister introduce amendments in the Seanad to deal with this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have asked me what will be the situation of a niece or nephew who inherits a holding but who is not working on it.  These people must be regarded as part of the family but the exemptions in so far as they are concerned are too low.  Would it not be very hard luck for a brother who had spent all his life working on a farm to find on inheriting it that he had to sell it in order to pay the <Col N="1522" /> acquisition tax?  I endorse what Deputy Fitzpatrick said in this regard and I trust the Minister will consider these points seriously even at this late stage.</P>

From what the people opposite have said I gather that they accept now that that system was wrong and are regretful that they had not changed it, especially now that they realise it was without merit, as it developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is astonishing, when one considers the outcry there was against <Col N="1523" /> death duties that the exemption was as low as £7,500 only a matter of a few years ago and that the duty was operating at rates of up to 55 per cent and when the rate which operated in respect of an estate valued at £150,000 was 50 per cent.  As the Opposition have acknowledged generously, under our legislation the tax will not bite even in a case where one individual inherits property of that value.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has been generous in his interpretation of the Government's approach to this matter although I am not sure whether he understood that approach when I recited it originally.  We said that we were providing for these generous thresholds because of the desirability of ensuring that immediate families were not caught in the kind of extortionist taxation system which was in being until we abolished it in the Finance Act last year.  What we are bringing in instead is a form of benign taxation payable by instalment by people in a position to pay it.  We have provided very generous exemptions in respect of nephews or nieces who have been working on a family farm for a period of five years prior to the death which leads to the passing of the property. This provision should cover several of the situations which Deputies Callanan and Fitzpatrick had in mind and if ultimately a son or daughter of the inheritor acquires the property, he or she will be exempt to the extent of £150,000.  Further, in relation to agriculture that would be doubled by virtue of section 19 of the Bill because agricultural property is treated at only half of its market value.  Therefore, the son or daughter could succeed to a farm worth £250,000 without being liable for capital acquisitions tax.  That is an extremely generous provision but brothers and sisters are in a different category and have not received the same treatment.  One could think of hardship or difficult cases but the majority of those cases would arise in respect of small holdings.</P>

      <P>The majority of <Col N="1524" /> Irish farms can be classed as small holdings so it is axiomatic that these cases develop in relation to small holdings but the exemption would not be £10,000 but £20,000 because of the special provision for agricultural property.  The new rates and thresholds are such that such brothers or sisters will pay much less inheritance tax than they ever would have had to pay under the estate duty code.</P>
      <P>I received representations from innumerable brothers and sisters who were worried about their situation but when it was explained to them in several cases they wrote back letters of thanks.  That is not the normal form of letter received by a Minister for Finance and I am sure Deputy Colley will endorse that.  They appreciated the significant improvement we were giving them in their position.  Deputy Colley was correct when he said that it would be a long time before people realised what this measure was all about.  Of course it will be a long time because it will be a long time before the vast majority of families accumulate so much property that there is even £150,000 to leave amongst all the children and still longer time before there is £150,000 to leave to every child.</P>
      <P>The majority of death duties in the past were paid by people in close family situations and our undertaking in the election, the election which gave us the mandate to bring in this legislation, was to bring in a form of taxation which would exempt the immediate family from death duties but would replace it with a system of capital taxation payable by instalments. We have fully and honourably discharged that obligation.  I am thankful to the Lord that the Opposition were not in power because had they been in power over the last three years we would not have had this massive measure of reform.</P>

      <P>We had this commitment from 1973.  Throughout 1973 we worked hard in the preparation of the discussion document, the White Paper which was published in February, 1974.  If it had not been published then there would have been howls from the Opposition because it <Col N="1526" /> had not been published.  Nothing could then have been worse for this country&mdash;I say this without regard to political advantage or disadvantage which might arise out of my saying it or even thinking it&mdash;than the White Paper having been published and the discussion having been opened to have delayed the introduction of the Bill and the finalisation of the taxation measures.  People will always fear the new, they will always fear the strange; they feel that the devil they know is better than the devil they do not know.  If we had not brought in these measures we would have had years of uncertainty, anxiety and upset which would have been damaging.  In truth, there has been no economic or financial loss to this country arising out of these taxation measures.  When they are compared with similar legislation in other countries these taxes bite at much more generous thresholds and the rates are lower than those operable in comparable countries.  We have no evidence that damage has resulted.  In fact, there is evidence of an inflow of capital into the country at a rate which had not previously been experienced.</P>

They can die at ease.  A well-known slogan of the Voluntary Health Board is &ldquo;be ill at ease&rdquo;, but people can now die at ease in the knowledge that whatever they leave behind them will not be grabbed by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the State because we are providing these generous measures of relief which will be to the benefit of the vast majority of families.  I should like to state that 95 per cent of those who were liable for death duties when we came into office will not be liable in future.</P>

      <Col N="1527" /> I should like to thank Deputy de Valera for his generous and well deserved tribute to the officials of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  They have done trojan work.  Naturally, there has been a certain amount of unease, upset and criticism because of the long time it took to process this legislation, but any objective person looking at it must be amazed at the speed with which it was drafted and processed and at the readiness of my advisers to evaluate all suggestions made in this House and outside.  I should like to endorse everything Deputy de Valera said so well.  I cannot say it better.  I not only thank my officials in the name of the House but also in my own name and on behalf of the Government for an exceedingly difficult job very well done.  Nobody for a moment thinks that this is the end of the process.  No man has a right to say to a nation: &ldquo;thus far shalt thou go and no further&rdquo;.  Nobody in this House is impertinent enough to suggest that this is the last of what may be necessary.</P>

      <P>Even if this was perfectly trimmed to every existing circumstance and exigency, times and circumstances will change and there will be a need for alterations.  I hope that whether the obligation falls on us or our successors that Oireachtas Éireann will never allow as unfair a system of taxation as death duties to develop as was left here until 1972. I blame all Administrations for that; I am not making any political point. There might not have been so much outcry&mdash;this has been argued on the other side and I accept it&mdash;if the old system had been brought up to date and reformed more frequently.  The blame there lies on nobody but the legislators and we ought to be humble enough to acknowledge that and, therefore, not to make the same mistake again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to thank the several professional bodies, industrial organisations and trade unions who made representations about this whole package of legislation.  A great number <Col N="1528" /> of people unhonoured, unsung and unknown to most worked long and arduous hours studying this legislation and telling us how they thought it would impact upon business, commerce and private individuals.  The end result is reflected in this legislation of which we can be proud.  I believe that as the years go on the people will thank us for what we have done, no matter what little criticisms the Opposition may for the time being be tempted to utter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it be an instruction to the Committee on the Industrial Relations Bill, 1975 that it has power to make provision in the Bill in relation to (i) additional divisions of the Labour Court and (ii) the repeal of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts, 1950 to 1975.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This motion relates to the amendment I wish to bring forward to make provision in the Bill for additional divisions of the Labour Court and a repeal of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts, 1950 to 1975.  In my opening statement on Second Stage I indicated my intention of having such amendments tabled at the appropriate stage.  The substantive element in this amendment is that it provides for the additional divisions to the Labour Court.  The repeal of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts, 1950 to 1975 is simply a tidying up operation. Therefore, I will make one or two points about the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to permit me to move the amendment providing for the granting of authority to the Minister for Labour to appoint by order, and with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, additional divisions to the Labour Court.  It is necessary to move this motion because the amendments <Col N="1529" /> referred to do not relate to the main purpose of the Bill as originally put before the House in that they deal specifically with the expansion of the composition of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I stated that the widening of the range of protective legislation imposes a heavy additional burden of work on the present Labour Court.  There is a need&mdash;and this has been long agreed by both sides in industry and also in the House&mdash;to have further divisions of the Labour Court.  A heavy burden of extra obligations are put on the court by reason of legislation passed and proposed in this House.  There is the legislative burden of equal pay.  Last week we appointed two equal pay officers.  There will be appeals on their decisions to the Labour Court which will have functions under that legislation.  There is proposed new legislation in that area&mdash;the Equal Opportunities Bill. There is an additional burden of work arising from the agreement with the public service unions that arbitration boards from now on will have a Labour Court presence on them.  That will mean a great burden of extra work on the court.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, has been used much more frequently in the past three years than in any comparable period since it was passed.  There is also the unfair dismissals legislation which will be shortly before the House. All this legislation which gives additional protection to workers, improves our industrial system, ensures that employees work in a better legislative framework and that their rights are guarded, will impose extra burdens on the court.</P>
    <P>There are three divisions at present in the court.  The amendments I propose to move will give me the authority to appoint additional divisions by order to enable the court to deal more effectively with this increasing workload.  Committee Stage amendments Nos. 6 and 7 provide accordingly.  There has been a general demand from the trade union movement for additional divisions of the court.  I am using the vehicle of <Col N="1530" /> this Bill to ensure that we can speedily meet that demand, to see that the Labour Court is enabled to operate more efficiently and to see that those working in the court have a less onerous workload.  For these reasons I thought it appropriate to add my amendment to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a joint labour committee for agricultural workers adds to the problems of the court the largest number of workers since its establishment.  Up to 30,000 additional workers are now under the court's final appeals jurisdiction.  This is the largest extension of the court's activity since its establishment.  For all these reasons I have decided that these amendments should be introduced in this Bill and that with its passage we could look forward to an improved court service available to workers, trade unions and employers, and ensure that there will be less delay in dealing with cases.  It is a habitual criticism made sometimes unfairly, that the Labour Court does not deal with cases as rapidly as people requiring their service would wish. The additional divisions should eliminate that criticism to a large degree.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, it is my intention to exercise powers already vested in me under sections 2 and 14 of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, to provide that agricultural workers may be brought within the scope of that Act by regulation.  As I said, that is a tidying up operation but it will be necessary to repeal the existing Acts which cover the granting of holidays to agricultural workers. In other words, we are bringing agricultural workers under the same holidays arrangements as industrial workers. This is in the direction charted by the decision to set up a joint labour committee.  I thought it best and most appropriate that I give the reasons and the nature of these amendments at this time.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Ceann Comhairle for a direction on the procedure in this situation. On today's Order Paper we have a motion which gives us, in Committee, the right to discuss these extensions to the original Bill introduced <Col N="1531" /> a week or two ago.  I want to know if our approach is a Second Stage approach, and if it will be open to us at some stage to submit amendments on Committee Stage.  In other words, the extensions to this Bill were circulated to us only this morning. This did not give us the opportunity of putting down Committee Stage amendments to the sections extending the scope of the Bill.  What is the procedure in those circumstances?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason for my question.  The opportunity to submit amendments on Committee Stage, by reason of the procedure now being adopted, if we wish to avail of it, does not appear to be open or available to us.  It also indicates that while one cannot cavil at the extra burden of work imposed on the Labour Court, not only by this Bill but by some of the things mentioned by the Minister a short time ago, it leads one to ask seriously how well organised is the Minister and his Department or how much of the activities carried on by the Minister can be described as fire brigade operations.  We have a fairly glaring example of this when at this stage he outlines to us the extra burdens imposed on the Labour Court, the many reasons for <Col N="1532" /> them&mdash;reasons that were known to him and his Department long before the Second Stage of the Bill reached the House.  One must ask why at that Stage the extensions to this Bill were not included in the Bill as originally drafted.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the appointment of equal pay officers last week in reference to a Bill passed in 1974.  One finds it impossible to understand the delay in appointing such officers the need for whom must have been envisaged at that time for the implementation of the Bill.  This is a further extension of it.  One must again ask in regard to the major extension to it, which is the extra divisions of the Labour Court, are we passing legislation that has not been thoroughly examined and that may leave the Minister with more power than we would like him to have, particularly in an area like the Labour Court that must not only appear to be but in fact must be an independent body holding and retaining the absolute confidence of workers and employers alike?</P>
      <P>I shall be pointing out on some sections of the Bill where I believe there is already a little too much interference with the Labour Court and I suspect that this extension would need much more time for its examination and for consideration of the loopholes in detail.  One wonders why it was added now rather than on the Second Stage.  The changing of the Holidays Act and the application of normal holidays to agricultural workers is desirable and something we support.  For the record, may I point out that I referred in my opening remarks to this Bill as being a logical step onwards but I was misreported in some papers as having said it was a radical step.  I did not; I described it as a very logical step, now, that our agricultural workers are approaching a situation where a great deal of expertise is demanded from them, expertise that could be regarded probably as the very highest in certain areas of the country, with specialist application by them to the task of intensive farming and mechanisation and all aspects of modern agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the agricultural workers are not as numerous as they <Col N="1533" /> once were.  The Minister has outlined, in addition to the added duties imposed on the Labour Court under this Bill, the added duties imposed on it by other measures and developments. He has used this motion as a vehicle for doing so.  While we readily accept this, it is difficult to understand why it was not included initially.  The holidays are desirable.  There is another section, amendment No. 10, where the Minister is amending section 5 of the Act&mdash;I presume he did not refer to this in his opening speech.  I do not know what connection, if any, it has with this Bill nor am I raising any objection to it.  But again it demonstrates the sort of fire brigade approach we get from this Minister who refers to many measures, some before the House, some promised to us or possibly threatened on us, as the volume of work going through his Department.  There are already on the books of the House quite a number of measures that have not been concluded.</P>
    <P>Without going into detail I refer to the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill.  A little over a year ago it went through the Dáil and was passed to the Seanad.  A number of amendments were made to it and it has never been explained why it was delayed so long in the Seanad, particularly as we are now approaching another summer, a summer in which young people will face employment problems.  I suppose the Minister has forgotten by now that employment is so necessary for young people and, perhaps because of the existing unemployment situation, in which he is taking very little interest, he feels the measure should not be pursued at this stage.  It is difficult to understand why it has been so long with the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We also have the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill; we do not know if that is coming again or not.  We also have the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975 circulated but not reaching Second Stage yet.  We do not know when the Second Stage will be taken.  I mention all these because I believe the approach of the Department at present leaves much to be desired.  The Minister is <Col N="1534" /> trying to project an image of a volume of work being processed by him, a capacity to bring Bills before the House but we argue that the number carried through the House to conclusion is very small.  The 1974 Anti-Discrimination Bill about which we have had so much hubbub&mdash;it is still going on&mdash;indicates the situation: nobody is sure of the present position.</P>
    <P>Again, I am not quite sure of what we must do if we wish to submit amendments on the extensions to the Bill.  Is such a facility available to us between the time we approve of this motion and the time we begin to discuss the Bill in Committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister uses this vehicle to import into the Bill what one would ordinarily expect to be done by amendment on Committee Stage.  Apart from that, I should like to say on section 5 that there is quite a lot involved in relation to agricultural workers in which the Minister's colleagues might be more involved or concerned than the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>We all know that for many years the number of people engaged in agriculture has been diminishing every year.  The actual absorption of the fall-out from agriculture in manufacturing industry has posed a problem which has reached serious proportions at the present time.  Added to that every year we have the people who have just left school coming on the labour market. It is important to provide every possible incentive to encourage the employment of agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not for a moment suggest that people engaged in agriculture generally should be given an incentive to employ more people simply to get them at a <Col N="1535" /> lower rate.  The wage rate for agricultural workers should be the same as that for industrial workers.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Local Government should try to have some incentive such as the old rates exemption incentive in respect of those over £20 valuation, because they are the people likely to give agricultural employment.  While nobody could advocate that agricultural labour should be at a cheaper rate than industrial labour it is essential when the serious fall-out from agriculture is posing such a serious problem for the Government that no further impediments should be added.</P>
    <P>We know that in industrial employment the tendency is to lay off workers when the particular concern find they are in difficulties in regard to fall-off in profit or lack of liquidity.  Such people try to meet the situation by reducing as far as possible the number of people employed.  This is easier for the agricultural employer than it is for the industrial employer.  The agricultural employer has two alternatives open to him.  He may go in for tillage on a big scale, which requires a lot of labour, or he may go in for cattle grazing only, which requires little labour.  As the labour force becomes more and more expensive the inclination is to lay off workers and go on to grazing which provides less employment. This results in a greater fall-out from agriculture, such as has been happening for some time.</P>
    <P>During the war, when there was compulsory tillage, the number of people who could be employed was remarkable.  In order to have enough bread on the table and sufficient to go around people resorted to tillage. Many people who would not ordinarily be employed in agriculture found employment there.  As soon as the compulsion was over farmers resorted to cattle grazing because it was less difficult and required the employment of fewer people.  Farmers should be given some incentive to employ more people because we are importing much food at the present time which could be produced on our farms.  There is little incentive for the <Col N="1536" /> agricultural community to go in for more tillage when they find cattle grazing simpler and also more profitable.</P>
    <P>This type of legislation barely deals with the problem.  There is much more involved.  I believed that when we went into the EEC and conditions improved for the agricultural community, which it has but not to the extent we anticipated, the agricultural community would make definite progress, that they would be assured of stability of prices and continuity of marketing.  In those circumstances I hoped that the fall-out from agriculture would have been much less and that we might have looked forward to more people engaged in agriculture as a result of the better conditions for agriculture generally.  However, that is not happening.  We are losing a lot by selling too many cattle on the hoof, which does not require much labour content in agriculture. If much more grain was grown as well as more potatoes&mdash;the potato shortage is nothing short of a tragedy in an agricultural country&mdash;and many other essential foods this would be of great benefit to the community as well as reducing our balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>This motion is only doing a one-sided job.  It is making better conditions available for agricultural workers.  It is equating their conditions with those available in industrial employment. There are two different problems here.  One is the desire to get more people into agriculture, which needs a very definite incentive. If farmers were given an incentive through relief on rates of over £20 valuation we could kill two birds with one stone.  There would be much more tillage and much more intensive labour on the farm, and some of the people who are swelling the dole queues would be employed in agriculture. The world is short of food at the moment.  Even though we are an agricultural country we are short of some foodstuffs and are paying exorbitant prices for our food.  The Government might take a look at this rather than rushing legislation at a time when there are so many other <Col N="1537" /> gaps to be filled in relation to this problem.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of agricultural workers.  They were not clamouring for legislation of this kind so far as I am aware.  Many of them have their own arrangements and their own conditions and can dictate their own terms reasonably well.</P>
    <P>In some cases the equation of conditions in the matter of pay and holidays could be counterproductive so far as agricultural workers are concerned, particularly those who work in places where we have intensive agricultural production in tillage, for example, in the Lagan Valley and the Finn Valley in Donegal where we feed most of the rest of the country.  These people often have the privilege of having pieces of land of their own on which they grow crops.  Sometimes they have different perks.  Very often the land steward has a house and he is provided with milk.  The employees also get milk and vegetables, potatoes and so on.  Sometimes it is difficult to equate agricultural workers with those in industrial employment.</P>
    <P>When he is producing legislation to give the same conditions to agricultural workers as are available to those fortunate enough at present to have employment in the industrial side of the economy, the Minister should consult with the Government as a whole, and with a few Ministers in particular, on the possibility of encouraging many more people to find employment in agriculture.  This can be done in a number of ways.  It can be done by the processing of everything possible which is produced on the farm.  That applies to cattle and livestock sold on the hoof as much as to vegetables and food which can be processed before being sold.  In this way we could find a good deal of extra employment.</P>
    <P>This Bill could have the undesirable effect of further accelerating the flight from the land and reducing the number of agricultural workers.  The farmer who has to meet his obligations in paying a particular wage to his workers has the natural easy way out of reducing his tillage, and his <Col N="1538" /> work on arable land, and concentrating on a policy of grazing which requires only, as we used to say in the old days, a man and a dog.  That does not make for better employment.  In so far as that is likely to take place, it could be a disincentive.  The people who can come to the rescue here are the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Local Government who can give relief from rates incentives in respect of male employment on the land to a worth while extent which would encourage the employment of more agricultural workers on the land.  This is an area which would be well worth surveying if it is not under review, at a time when every possible means should be adopted by the Government to find extra sources of employment for the many people who are seeking that type of employment.</P>
    <P>I rose to ask the Minister why this means of amending the Bill is being used rather than an ordinary amendment to the Bill itself.  I do not think I have come across it before.  It may not be an innovation but it is a vehicle which, to my knowledge, has certainly not been used frequently as a means of importing into a Bill something which one would expect could ordinarily be done by an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is more or less related to the latter part of Deputy Brennan's statement.  Did the Minister think that without putting down this motion and without having this motion passed the amendment to section 8 could not stand?  Did the Minister think he would not have the power to do it?  This looks like a little graft on to the Bill.  Did the Minister fear it was new material and, not having been covered on Second Stage, he had not the power in the ordinary way to make a valid amendment?  This is what puzzles me.  Technically, why is the motion put down?  The first part of the motion states:</P>
      <P>That it be an instruction to the Committee on the Industrial Relations Bill, 1975, that it has power to make provision in the Bill in relation to (i) additional divisions of the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> The amendment suggested to section 8 state:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister is of opinion that for the speedy dispatch of the business of the Court it is expedient that there should be added to the Court another division or other divisions he may, notwithstanding anything in the Act of 1969, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, provide for such an additional division or divisions.</P>
    <P>It is the technicality which puzzles me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Originally our intention with regard to the additional division of the Labour Court was that this would be part of a larger industrial relations Bill.  In any fundamental legislation of this kind one has to <Col N="1541" /> proceed very carefully, considering all the interests involved in this area.  One must ensure that any suggestion or proposal will be such that what is referred to as the overall climate of industrial relations will be improved.  I might add we have tested out many proposals, both at meetings of officials of my Department and with other groups.  I am not yet satisfied with regard to certain of the proposals we have been examining.</P>
      <P>The addition to the Labour Court is non-contentious and is agreed by all sides.  I felt it would be unfair to the court and unnecessary also that such a common sense decision as the addition of another division should await the outcome of what may be many more months of consideration of proposals. Therefore, this Bill was a means by which I could get that non-contentious matter passed by this House.  Deputies can query it legitimately but I can assure them that is the reason.  As the Chair has pointed out correctly, the reason for the motion is that it was not in the original table of contents of the Bill and the only means by which I could get it included in the Bill was to adopt the means of amendment.  Of course, there will be ample opportunities for Deputies opposite to consider it further when we are dealing with the Committee Stage of the Bill and they can then bring up any objections they may have.  In fact, I should be surprised if they have any objections to an additional division of the Labour Court because, as far as I am aware, the party opposite are as anxious to see the court have as many divisions as possible to ensure that it is equipped to deal with industrial disputes.  I suggest to Deputies that if there are any difficulties in their minds with regard to this matter we might hear them when we are discussing the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Why the necessity for this amendment?  If you read the Bill it is entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 and 1969&rdquo;.  The Bill goes on to say &ldquo;in this Act&rdquo;&mdash; giving various definitions, the last of which is</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1547" />&ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>We have the amendment saying the Act of 1969 means the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.  Why the necessity for spelling that out in detail when the Act of 1969 would appear to be adequate in view of the fact that the Act of 1969 would appear to be already in the Title of the Bill it is referred to us as being an Act to amend and extend the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 and 1969?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <P>This arises from the extra division we are going to have of the court, if we proceed towards that&mdash;that we should put in the title &ldquo;Industrial Relations Act, 1969&rdquo;, because the Act of 1969 has provision for only three divisions whereas we are looking for a fourth division.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete line 20 and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;for market gardens, private gardens, nursery grounds or sports grounds;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the extension to market gardens, private gardens, nursery grounds and sports grounds.  The definition of agricultural worker and agricultural employer in the Bill are the same as those previously employed in agricultural wages legislation.  Suggestions have been made, mainly from trade union organisations, that certain groups of workers&mdash;gardeners employed in ornamental gardens, public gardens and those employed on golf links&mdash;should be included properly within the definition of agricultural workers.  This amendment provides for the inclusion, within the coverage of the Bill, of workers engaged in agricultural work, what would be correctly described as agricultural work, but whose employers are either public authorities, who work in large gardens of a public character or on golf courses; there are quite a number of workers whom I would like to see included in these provisions.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy about the sports ground aspect.  The Minister referred to golf courses.  In many sporting organisations around the country the work is mainly voluntary. I am satisfied that some of the Government's colleagues are so unaware of the sporting world as to have offended the entire community, particularly the young, when one of them in a TV interview to our amazement condemned competition among young people from the sport point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why the necessity here for the extension to sports grounds?  I would be interested to know if the Minister has any information on the number of people concerned, whether they are confined to Dublin, whether they <Col N="1549" /> are members of trade unions.  I suspect that the Minister's thinking here was confined to golf courses.  He may not be aware that many sporting organisations throughout the country employ a tremendous amount of voluntary assistance, otherwise they could not survive.  Why the difference between Second Stage and now in regard to the inclusion of sports grounds?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy could help me.  I am at a loss to know what his problem is.  He referred to voluntary workers.  This Bill will not threaten voluntary workers. Perhaps the Deputy, who is very forthcoming in his objections to most measures, would enlighten me as to what his problem is in relation to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I believe sport to be so important to the nation that I do not think any group should be singled out.  One finds it hard to accept sports grounds being singled out here for inclusion.  There are many types of hurling and football grounds and coursing stretches apart from golf courses in Dublin and elsewhere. Why are people like stable lads and those working generally with horses not included?  My understanding is that that area needs control. They work a seven-day week in winter and summer and I am at a loss to understand why they have not been included.  Groomsmen are not included.  Is that because of a certain slant of this Government towards that sport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the provisions of this legislation will apply to stable lads and others in such occupations, and if there is a danger that that is not so we can consider legislation to deal with it.  In some respects their work is different from that of agricultural workers but I am advised by the unions concerned, and we are proceeding on that basis, that they will be covered by the operation of this legislation.  I am puzzled by the Deputy's worries about the reference to sports grounds.  Voluntary workers remain voluntary workers and where they have full-time employment <Col N="1550" /> the agricultural rate will have to be paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been complaints.  Deputy Fitzgerald said some may not want to be included. I do not think there is anything in the Bill to prevent people paying more if they want to.  My experience in the past was that it was the minimum wage laid down that was invariably <Col N="1553" /> paid as the maximum wage.  Let us not cod ourselves.  There may be people who are not anxious to be included but I am anxious that people I believe should be included will be assured of a minimum at least.  I understood this Bill was taking over from the old Act under which these people were included.  However, if there is any doubt it should be resolved and, if an amendment is necessary, it should be made.  I understood stable lads and people working on stud farms, and so on, were dealt with by the old Agricultural Wages Board and would, therefore, be included under this legislation.  If they are not then I urge the Minister to ensure they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, it is our understanding that the same comparability that existed under the old arrangement will continue to exist under the new arrangement. That was the basis on which this Bill was framed.  I received from trade unions and other organised workers specific requests to extend the definition of agriculture in the direction I outlined.  That is why we have the change.  Deputy Fitzgerald is worried about the effect where sports grounds and voluntary workers are concerned.  Voluntary workers will not be affected but full-time workers will be affected.  All full-time workers employed in a sports complex will come under the provisions of this Bill.  Be it the GAA, the FAI, golf club, tennis club, or anything else, it will have to pay the going rate for the job.  I have received no requests for an extension to stable boys from trade unions because they do not see any necessity for that. That is why it is not here.  However, certain views have been expressed. I have been impressed by Deputy Bermingham because he represents a constituency which has a large number of stable boys and he can be assured I will look at this very closely indeed and will ensure there will be no room for doubt.  There would be no difficulty in adding that category to this Bill.</P>

I fully appreciate that this Bill could in no way cover voluntary workers.  I merely asked, and it took a very long time to get an explanation from the Minister. I agree that people working full time on a sports ground must be paid to a certain standard.  The condition of grounds throughout the country depend on their efforts, and they are usually paid well above the standard rate, which they deserve because of the way they keep their sports grounds. It is amazing that the Minister, vigilant though he claims to be, should have made two additions here without including this section of agricultural workers.  Maybe there is a valid reason for this, and all I asked the Minister to do was to examine it between now and Report Stage.

      <P>The point is that in the definition section there is a grey area about who is involved in agricultural work.  However, in a later section, section 2, we refer to people who would necessarily be excluded and therefore it would be incorrect to say that St. Stephen's Green would be included, because a person employed by a local authority would be excluded under section 2.

Would the skating rink be regarded as a sports ground or the skiing slopes at Magillacuddy Reeks?  The only issue I would join with the Minister in is that, while the extension is to some extent superfluous, there could be no objection to it.  It is superfluous because it mostly relates to skilled people, but it is more noticeable for what is omitted than what it proposes to add. I refer again to a section of workers who would very much wish to be included and I am glad that because Deputy Bermingham has had a word in the Minister's ear it will now be included.</P>

If there is any doubt about this, they would certainly be referred to by an amendment which I would move.  The reason why I specifically referred to Deputy Bermingham is that his constituency includes many such categories of worker.

If we are inclined to be questioning and doubtful, can one blame us for being questioning and doubtful when we have in this country a Minister for Labour who is three years in office now, who was not aware that there had been complaints from that particular section of our community.  I raised on amendment No. 2 to section 1 the fact that certain areas were mentioned in that.  It may well be covered by the Bill.  It appears that it is not covered specifically under the Bill. Maybe there is a very sound reason why it should not be covered by the Bill, and I want to know again from the Minister if he is prepared to give us an undertaking that he will investigate it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Section 2 is the principal section in the Bill and it has been adequately covered on Second Stage. It is the one that gives agricultural workers access to the Labour Court. Subsection (1) may require closer examination with regard to persons who are excluded.  It does not include a person who is employed by or under the State.  This is where the exclusion of public gardens comes in.  It does not include teachers in secondary <Col N="1561" /> schools, teachers in national schools, a person who is employed by a local authority in any office or employment, and an officer serving the vocational educational committee.  This section is very much bound up with the section the Labour Court will take, which is dealing with agricultural workers and the expertise and impartiality of that section that will be dealing with them. The Minister has frequently referred to his consultations with trade unions.  It is very important also that the opinions of employers in these categories be taken into consideration but the Minister has not reassured us as to whether he has sought the opinions of these people.  I assume that the question of these workers being admitted to the Labour Court will be influenced entirely as to its success on the knowledge which the relevant personnel in the Labour Court will have in relation to the whole area of agricultural employment.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Castleblayney Car Bomb.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to condemn in the strongest possible terms the outrage perpetrated in Castleblayney at the weekend.  I am convinced that this horrible deed served no purpose whatever either North or South of the Border and I express my sincere sympathy with the relatives of the dead man and with those who were injured in the blast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for raising the matter of this bombing incident stems from my concern with the issue of security not only in Border areas but throughout the country generally.  It has been established locally that the town of Castleblayney which has a population of more than 2,000 people, was without a Garda street patrol from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday last and that only one garda was on patrol in the town up to 1 p.m. on that day.  The bomb exploded at about 8.30 p.m. but it is thought that the blue Cortina car in which it was placed had been outside the Three Star Inn for some three hours or so before the explosion.  To say the <Col N="1562" /> least, these facts are disturbing.  In the first instance it is imperative that a Border town, such as Castleblayney, be patrolled and policed 24 hours a day, every day.</P>
    <P>I understand that Castleblayney Urban Council have demanded a 24-hour Army-Garda street patrol in the area.  The Minister for Justice was asked by the council on 27th August last for a strengthening of Garda security in the area but I am told that despite further requests and reminders they did not hear from the Minister on the matter.</P>
    <P>Now, as a result of the car bomb one man is dead, 17 people are injured and damage to the extent of £500,000 has been caused.  The Minister for Justice is the person charged with responsibility in the area of security so the blame for there not being a Garda street patrol in Castleblayney during the hours I have mentioned must rest solely with him.  The Minister, the Taoiseach and their colleagues in Government have been telling us constantly of the millions of pounds being spent on security, both Army and Garda but if what I have been told is true, one must ask where is the security that is costing so much and how could it happen that a car with false number plates, representing the County Monaghan area, was parked in a main street of a vulnerable Border town for more than three hours without any attention being paid to it.  These are very serious questions which are of the greatest importance to all of us but particularly to those who live in towns in close proximity to the Border.</P>
    <P>I am told that the people of Castleblayney are gripped with fear, the fear of indiscriminate bombing such as that which occurred on Sunday. Another Border town&mdash;Clones&mdash;is a ghost town to all intents and purposes for the reason that in the past it has experienced bombing.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that people along the Border are very concerned because the existing security checks in the area are not on a 24-hour basis but consist of occasional spot checks.  Because of this it is possible for cars, such as that <Col N="1563" /> used in the Castleblayney blast, to get through the security net without any great difficulty but at the cost of lives and property in the Republic.</P>
    <P>It is highly desirable that every car crossing the Border be checked thoroughly and that the driver and any other occupants be identified to the satisfaction of the security forces. Unfortunately, because of the way in which the security check system operates, those who wish to cause destruction or to take lives can watch the movements of our security forces along the Border and take advantage of their absence to act with impunity.</P>
    <P>Because of the mismanagement and the inefficient handling of the country's economy the Minister for Justice was forced recently to announce that there would be serious curtailment of overtime for the Garda.  It is logical to assume that those members of the force who were on overtime were fulfilling a necessary and vital function: otherwise, they would not have been on overtime.  However, because of the economic strangleholds which were applied in this instance to the security forces, not only in Border areas but throughout the country, we are now without adequate security.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the Garda authorities have said that despite cutbacks in overtime they have sufficient manpower to meet all situations.  Did they say this so as not to be in conflict with their Minister or with the Government? However, if they mean they are happy with the situation as it existed, for example, in Castleblayney on Sunday last, one must question their notion of adequate security and must ask what they mean when they say they have sufficient manpower to meet all situations. If this situation is considered as adequate policing I can only say to the Minister and the Government that they have brought about a dangerous and farcical situation by reneging on their responsibilities to the people in sensitive Border areas.</P>
    <P>If it is true that the Minister failed to reply to the request and the subsequent reminders of Castleblayney Urban Council in relation to security, one can only conclude that there is a <Col N="1564" /> complacency in relation to the whole issue of security.  I have spoken with those Deputies and Senators here who represent Border areas and I am assured that the situation is as I have outlined.  In his reply I expect the Minister to remind me that the Garda Síochána are stronger now numerically than they have been since the foundation of the State.  While this may be true, I have had personal contact with members of the Garda from many counties and they have told me of their spells of duty in Border towns in recent times, of the fact that they have nothing to do in their off periods and would be happier doing a job of work they believe should be done.  This could have been managed but for the order given by the Minister curtailing the necessary finances to make it possible.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have heard boasts by the Minister for Justice, some of his colleagues and the Taoiseach, that they are a law and order Government. I would prefer, as would many others, to see action rather than hear words. We have had an unbelievable frequency of bank and post office robberies in recent times.  Unfortunately, we have had two and three in one day.  Three or four years ago a bank robbery was given banner headlines on the front pages of our national newspapers but because of their frequency now they are hardly mentioned on the inside pages.  I was disturbed recently to be told that on a night in January in Limerick city there was only one patrol car on duty.  Only one man was on duty, except for those involved in prison duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is ranging rather wide of the subject matter of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I do not propose to develop this any further now but I will at a future date avail of the opportunity of having a general discussion on this area of security.  It has been put to me by people from County Monaghan, and other Border counties, that if there was a Garda foot patrol in Castleblayney on Sunday that patrol might possibly have spotted the car which was stolen in Belfast or spotted the <Col N="1565" /> false number plates on the car.  The patrol would have spotted that if the car had a tax disc it might not have corresponded with the registration number.  It is disturbing that people can park indiscriminately in the main streets.  I am reliably informed, and I am sure Deputies opposite who represent the constituency will agree with me, that but for the grace of God 50 people could have been killed in that explosion.</P>
      <P>The situation is serious.  I will not take away from the boast of the Minister, or the Taoiseach, on law or order if we can see it in operation.  The main fall-down here is because of the overtime ban introduced by the Minister. I understand that the Garda authorities are doing their best but nobody can accept that a sensitive and big town within a couple of miles of the Border should be left, as reported&mdash;this has not been denied officially by the Garda authorities&mdash;with one man on patrol up to 1 p.m. and nobody between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.  If this is so, security is very weak indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to condemn, with Deputy Collins, in the strongest manner all types of bombing and violence.  I should also like to extend my sympathy to the relatives of the man killed and to those injured.  I should like to tell the Minister that it is very frightening to visit a town like Castleblayney, Monaghan or Clones after a bombing or to visit those who were lucky enough to escape with injuries and talk to them of their experiences.  It is also frightening to talk to the people of the towns.  When dealing with a matter like this one must look at the position of Monaghan and the number of small towns in that county that are close to the Border.  Three of the five big towns in that county have suffered from bomb outrages and there was shooting in one village in the county.  One must also consider that the urban area of Clones extends to the Border.  When those who represent that county bear in mind the position of the towns in relation to the Border we realise that security is a problem and that the spot checks being carried out cannot be very effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> We were deeply concerned to read in the newspapers that there was no Garda patrol in Castleblayney on Sunday from 1 p.m.  It should be realised that the most effective type of policing in such towns can only be carried out by Garda foot patrols. I hope the Minister will have this matter re-examined.  I should like to pay tribute to the Garda Síochána for the work they have done since the troubles started in the North.  I should also like to pay tribute to those young gardaí who, when they completed their training, spent many months in Border areas.  Patrol cars are fine to cover large areas or to give chase but a greater degree of protection is necessary and that is why I call for more gardaí to be put on foot patrols.</P>
    <P>We realise the great demand on the Garda and on the Army and the huge bill the nation must face to provide those services but lives are at stake in the Border areas.  Security cannot be counted in cash terms.  The people of Castleblayney, Clones and Monaghan and those living in other Border areas are entitled to the fullest protection possible as they go about their daily work or in their recreation.  The Minister should immediately review the Garda needs and ask the Minister for Defence to carry out a similar review. Sunday's outrage is particularly disturbing when one considers the good relations that existed between the people of all religious and political persuasions in County Monaghan and the good relations that existed with those living across the Border.  The need for proper hospital facilities in that area also arises in that regard. On 22nd October, when he outlined his general hospital plan, the Minister for Health made light of the downgrading of Monaghan County Hospital which is in the centre of the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

      <P>I want to bring to the attention of the two Ministers in the House the importance of proper <Col N="1567" /> hospital facilities in an area in which such tragedies have occurred.  The situation in Castleblayney, Monaghan and Clones would have been more serious as a result of the bombings if we did not have a proper hospital to cater for those injured.</P>
      <P>We all wish to see an end to the bombing but no one can hazard a guess as to when there will be an end to the campaign.  While that campaign is with us we will have to provide proper security for our people and provide the services that are essential following such bombings. I would ask both Ministers to have another look at this because the people of Monaghan are and have been very concerned about the dangerous situation in which they are living.</P>

      <P>The urban bomb is one of the more grotesque manifestations of guerilla war as we know it.  It is particularly deadly because the defences available against it cannot be absolute, and are far from absolute.  This has been proved in Northern Ireland where the people have suffered from this scourge for a number of years.  Happily, we have not experienced it to the same extent and we pray God that we will not.</P>
      <P>Experience in the other jurisdiction has shown that there is no absolute defence against the urban bomber.  That experience has been based on the implementation of differing tactics. There has been the total sealing of towns and centre city areas by security forces.  There has been total sealing of cross-Border roads and random vehicle checkpoints.  None of these has been proof against the urban bomber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> Then there is the questions of the tactics and the measures we can take here using the unfortunate experiences on the other side.  The professional assessment of those whom we trust with the security of our towns and villages is that random patrolling and checkpoints, with some exceptions, are the best defence against the urban bomber.  Recognising that there is no absolute defence, and that the quality of the defence and the extent to which a defence can be successful depends very much on the alertness and co-operation of the, for the use of a better word, civilian population&mdash;the willingness of people to keep their eyes open and report suspicious objects, is the most important part of the community's defence against this atrocious modern weapon of the urban bomb.</P>
    <P>The Border is 300 miles long.  Daily there are hundreds of points being covered by members of the Garda Síochána with the assistance of the Army.  There are numerous crossing points.  This is particularly true of the Monaghan section of the Border.  On other parts of the Border there are physical features which reduce the number of crossing points.  There are a very large number of minor roads and crossings on the Monaghan border. Any suggestion that each of these can be sealed on a permanent basis is not practical.  In any event, that is not the answer because there will have to be some cross-Border traffic and the feeling of the people living along the Border is that there has to be access back and forth, there will be ways and means for determined people to get back and forth without detection.</P>
    <P>I deprecate the political tone which Deputy Collins introduced into his remarks, that is, the criticism of the Taoiseach and me for what we said about law and order.  The desire to use this unfortunate incident to beat us about the head was, in my view, entirely inappropriate.  He mentioned overtime as one of the reasons why there might not be adequate policing in Border towns.  I want to make it clear now, as I did when the curtailment <Col N="1569" /> on the expansion of overtime was announced, that it was not a cutting out of overtime but a curtailment of the amount of overtime which was announced at the time.  That excluded overtime necessary for security reasons and that is still the position. The Garda authorities are aware that where security is involved, there can be no question of curtailment of the use of men on an overtime basis.  It was with that criteria attached that the Government's decision to restrict the growth of overtime was involved. The question of security was specifically excluded.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the level of policing along our Border is adequate for the needs of the area.  That is not to say that I am complacent about or that the Garda authorities are complacent either.  That position is kept under continuous review.  It involves the deployment of men from post to post as the need demands or as the urgency suggests.  The House might be interested to know that over the last three years the number of Garda on duty at the Border&mdash;I do not want to give the exact number which exceeds four figures&mdash;has been increased by no less than 50 per cent. That is an earnest of the Government's intention to see that the Border areas are adequately policed and patrolled.  It would be a matter for the Garda authorities if they feel that vast increase is not sufficient to come to us and say so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific incident in Castleblayney which brought so much tragedy to so many people, it is true that for a period on that afternoon, a garda who would normally be on duty in the town was diverted to other duties, and for a period there was no patrol on the town itself. There was a large Garda presence around the town.  This again brings us back to police tactics and what are the best tactics to defeat the urban bomber.  Should it be patrols on the outskirts of the town or should there be random checkpoints?  Should there be a man on the beat in the town?  This must be left to the professional judgment of the officers on <Col N="1570" /> the spot.  This may vary from town to town, from village to village and from week to week.  It is true that there was no patrol for a certain number of hours in the afternoon. This will have to be looked into to see if it should have happened, did it have a material effect, or would it have made any material difference.</P>
    <P>I understand the particular vehicle was noticed by some civilians.  This brings us back to the point I made at the beginning of my remarks, that the effectiveness and efficacy of any protection the security forces can give can be increased immensely by full alertness and co-operation from the civilian population.  The Garda by themselves can and are doing a great deal.  I want to thank them and the Army for what they have done.  Deputy Leonard expressed the gratitude of the people in the Border areas.  I know I am reflecting the views of all the House when I express their gratitude to the Garda and the Army.</P>
    <P>As I said, on that particular day for a short number of hours, because a garda was diverted not away but off the actual town centre, there was a time when there was not a garda presence in the town centre.  There was a garda foot patrol and a mobile patrol in the town centre from early evening and for several hours before the unfortunate explosion took place.</P>
    <P>I regret that Castleblayney Urban Council were not answered comprehensively in regard to their letter of last August which requested round the clock Garda and Army checkpoints on all roads leading to the town from the Border.  It was a matter for the Garda to decide whether these should be provided.  The better advice is that full-time vehicle checkpoints are not possible because of manpower requirements and, instead, the best tactic is the random checkpoint.  Ultimately the defence of any town lies in the hands of its own inhabitants.</P>
    <P>At this point I want to pay tribute to the co-operation which has been given to the Garda.  Again I wish to express sympathy with those who are bereaved and to assure the people in all the Border towns that it is the concern of the Government, the police <Col N="1571" /> and the Army to ensure that the maximum protection possible will be made available to them.  I appeal to the public for their continued co-operation and ask them above all, to be on the <Col N="1572" /> alert and report anything suspicious as soon as it comes to their notice.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10th March, 1976.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a good deal of consideration has been given in recent years to the problems of the disabled.  It has not emerged clearly that it is necessary to make special legislative provision for these two categories of the disabled and, in fact, present thought is that the needs of deaf and blind people should be considered as part of the general problem of the disabled.  For example, the Working Party on Training and Employing the Handicapped, whose report I have accepted in principle, recommended that, so far as possible, future arrangements for training and employment should not provide for separate arrangements for the different categories of handicap.  I shall, however, bear the Deputy's representations in mind in connection with the development of the services generally for the handicapped.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the insurer in question ceased to renew policies falling due on or after 1st January, 1976.  However, I am not aware of any cases where a former policyholder has failed to obtain cover elsewhere or has had to pay premium increases of the order suggested by the Deputy.  Neither my Department nor the Department of Local Government have had, since 1st January, 1976, any complaints from former policyholders.</P>
