      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill aims to set up a joint labour committee under the aegis of the Labour Court to regulate the rates of pay and conditions of employment of agricultural workers of whom there are 20.000 in full-time employment and 14,000 in part-time employment.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents the first significant legislative measure to be introduced by a government for the improvement of the general conditions of farm workers for more than 40 years; the implementation of its provisions will result in the replacement of the Agricultural Wages Board, established under the Agricultural Wages Act 1936, by a joint labour committee which in its representation will permit farmers and their workers to determine together the future conditions of employment in this important industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint labour committee system of negotiating the working conditions of an industry already operates in respect of 42,000 industrial workers through the medium of 21 joint labour committees.  I am confident that future <Col N="670" /> agreements arrived at by utilising the procedures of this Bill will lead to the elimination of the conditions differential that has been allowed to develop down through the years resulting in a growing gap between the work conditions of the farm workers and those of other industrial employees.</P>
    <P>The improvement of his working conditions is naturally in the interest of the agricultural worker.  I believe, however, that such improvement is also in the interest of the agricultural industry itself.  The changing pattern of economic activity from a rural agricultural base to one in which industries, other than agriculture, account for more than three-quarters of the work force, entails a change in the composition of our manpower.  Such a change in the pattern of economic activity of the work force is observable in most of the European countries as the normal accompaniment of economic development.  The figures of those leaving employment based in agriculture during the past ten years suggest, however, that we are now at a point where the agriculture industry's demand for skilled manpower in the future would be affected should this drain of skilled manpower continue unabated over the next decade.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the remuneration and conditions of agricultural workers must be brought into line with those obtaining in the industrial sector.  The mistaken social attitudes of the past relegated farm workers to a low place in the esteem of our society and have no relevance today because now, increasingly, the importance of each job is measured by its contribution to the development of the national economy. The increasing mechanisation of the industry means that the role of farm workers, always a skilled job, now requires even higher standards.</P>
    <P>Agricultural workers have in the past been generally excluded from the scope of the Industrial Relations Acts which provide the legal framework under which the terms and conditions of certain industrial workers are determined. As a result, agricultural workers have been excluded from access to the Labour Court except in the event of a trade dispute.  This Bill <Col N="671" /> rectifies that imbalance and provides that in future agricultural workers will have full access to the machinery of the Labour Court for the negotiation of their working conditions.</P>
    <P>As I have stated already, the Bill utilises the structure of the joint labour committee and I should like to outline what this involves.  A joint labour committee comprises a chairman and two independent members appointed by the Minister for Labour. It also has an equal number of members nominated by the two sides of industry.  The chairman has a casting vote in the event of deadlock.  It is on the basis of proposals for settling the statutory minimum wages and conditions of employment that the orders regulating employment in the industry are based.  The rates of pay and other conditions finally agreed upon by both sides and adopted as an employment regulation order are enforceable legally.</P>
    <P>I have just referred to the normal composition of a joint labour committee. Having regard to the reservations expressed by the farming organisations in regard to the joint labour committee system I have agreed, following discussions with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to certain modifications of the normal manner of appointment of members to a joint labour committee in the case of the proposed committee for agricultural workers.  I have agreed and the Bill so provides, that the chairman and independent members of the joint labour committee for agricultural workers will be appointed by me only after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I have agreed further that two panels for the selection of employer and worker members of the committee shall be prepared following consultation with the relevant employer/ worker interests and these shall be subject to consultation with, and the agreement of, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I believe that a joint labour committee system so modified will allay any fears that the farming organisations may have.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes special provision for <Col N="672" /> the immediate establishment of a joint labour committee for agricultural workers, thus dispensing, in the interests of urgency, with the time-consuming consultations normally involved prior to the making of an establishment order.  In addition, agricultural workers will in future also be enabled to be parties to registered agreements relating to wages and conditions of employment and will be included among the classes of workers in respect of which joint industrial councils may be registered with the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>As the joint labour committee for agricultural workers will take over all the duties performed up to now by the Agricultural Wages Board, the Bill provides for the abolition of the board. The Agricultural Wages Act of 1936 which set up the board shall cease to have effect on and from the making of the first employment regulation order for agricultural workers following proposals by the joint labour committee. The general inspectorate of the Department of Labour will be charged with the responsibility of enforcing the provisions of employment regulation orders emerging from the committee.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Board has hitherto been responsible for enforcing the holiday entitlements of agricultural workers which are provided for under a number of Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts.  Sections 2 and 14 of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, which governs the holiday entitlements of other workers provide that agricultural workers may be brought within its scope by regulation.  It is my intention that simultaneously with the proposed abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board, and following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, this power will be utilised.</P>
    <P>The widening range of worker protection legislation imposes a heavier work-load on the Labour Court.  The court at present operates in three divisions and it is my intention to take power to appoint additional divisions by order to enable it to deal with this increasing work-load.  I will be introducing an amendment to this effect at Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a logical step in the changing face of agriculture and the changing structure of employment in agriculture which we regard as being our primary industry. If we look at the pattern which developed in our industrial growth from 1960 to 1974 we find that between part-time and full-time agricultural workers we now have 34,000 compared with 88,000 in 1960. This covers the period of our major industrial development when so many workers were absorbed into industry and when the flight from the land got the headlines.  There has been a change in the working lives of the agricultural workers.  We all realise their importance in the community.  There is a necessity for greater expertise.  There is a higher standard in the production of our stock, and crops, and so on. Mechanisation has meant that an agricultural worker has become a man of many parts who has to carry out many duties.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to set up a joint labour committee.  We should look at it on a broader basis.  This Government have dabbled in agriculture.  They go so far, but they do not go far enough. With our high unemployment figure, an effort should be made to create further employment in agriculture.  The premium employment Bill introduced by the Minister last year, after pressure from this side of the House, was extended to include agriculture.  The number of jobs created in agriculture under that Bill was disappointing.  At this stage agriculture is wide open for expansion of employment.  The worth of our cattle population is approximately £106 million less than it was last year. Our cattle population is down by 500,000 head.  This could have a very serious effect on employment generally and, in particular, in the meat and milk processing industries.  Government policy should be directed towards that area to allay any fears there may be about unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time like this, efforts should be made to encourage more tillage in which there is a potentially greater employment content.  In 1960, we had 176,000 or slightly more, working horses.  By 1970 that figure had been reduced to 85,000, or slightly less <Col N="674" /> than half.  The tractor population, if I may call it that, had gone from 43,000 to 84,000.  Those figures must be examined to see what effects they had on the agricultural worker because they placed a greater onus, more responsibility, and more burdens on him.  There should be encouragement, particularly in the smaller farming units, of greater co-operation in the utilisation of mechanised equipment. There is always a danger that tractors may be purchased by farmers who will not work them to full capacity. They are a burden on our balance of payments because they are imported for the most part.  We could have more utilisation of them if a spirit of co-operation was encouraged among local groups of farmers.</P>
    <P>As I said, we should encourage farmers towards more tillage to try to create further employment in the agricultural industry.  In addition to the falling figures of agricultural workers, we have a very substantial reduction in the numbers engaged in agriculture, such as families, and so on.  If we look at the size of our agricultural exports and the contribution they are making to the economy, at a time like this the Government should make every effort to expand employment within the industry and in the allied fields.  The Government's policy at the moment does not indicate that this is the case and, in fact, we are worried that the opposite will prevail.</P>
    <P>As I said, this Bill is a logical step along the road to setting up a joint labour committee for this section of our community.  I should like to ask about some omissions from the Bill. The rates relief for farmers employing agricultural workers is being removed. While agreeing with the sentiments expressed that the level of £17 is hardly relevant at this stage, I understand that the original intention was that it would cover the stamp. An increase in that £17 would have been an inducement to the creation of employment in that field and would have encouraged farmers to absorb more people in employment on the land.  I wonder has the Minister any intention of changing the price of the agricultural stamp.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> There are a number of questions I should like to ask about section 2. Understandably, the Minister is changing the age limit to 15 years, and the Bill now covers those over 15 years.  That poses a question about a Bill we had here a little over a year ago dealing with the protection of the employment of young persons and which is now with the Seanad.  What is happening to that Bill?  We are entering into another summer.  There are demands to have that Bill passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Perhaps the Minister will explain his silence on this when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the Principal Act omits, understandably, the section dealing with the agricultural worker. I should like to know from the Minister the position regarding the agricultural worker who may be excluded under section 2 (a), &ldquo;a person who is employed by or under the State&rdquo;. I should like to know if an officer serving with a county committee of agriculture, even though he is an agricultural worker, is excluded under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a major change in section 5 and it seems to be in line with the Minister's handling of the Labour Court.  It seems to be an effort by him to weaken the powers of the Labour Court.  During the past year we saw the Minister making appointments and reappointments, dismissals and reinstatements to that court.  For this reason one wonders whether there is bad industrial relations between the Minister and the Labour Court and whether this is a deliberate attempt by the Minister to weaken and undermine the powers of the Labour Court.  On Committee Stage I propose submitting a number of amendments to this section.  The Minister's constitution of the joint labour committee is a retrograde step. The 1946 Act proposed the setting up of joint labour committees with the Minister having his appointees and the Labour Court appointing representatives on the employer and employee side, but now the Minister will intervene. He will be incorporating some <Col N="676" /> of the powers of the 1936 Act.  Instead of going forward from 1946 we are going back to 1936.</P>
    <P>I support the idea of the Labour Court having consultations with the organisations concerned but I see serious defects in this section otherwise Paragraph (a) of section 5 states:</P>
    <P>the chairman and not more than two independent members of the committee shall be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries;</P>
    <P>I should like to know the need for &ldquo;Fisheries&rdquo; there.  In my view it should be, &ldquo;Minister for Agriculture&rdquo;. It appears that the Government have decided that &ldquo;Fisheries&rdquo; will indefinitely remain with &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo;. Such a statement in the Bill should merely refer to the Minister for Agriculture.  I have grave reservations about the thinking behind the section.  It appears that the Ministers for Labour and Agriculture and Fisheries will hand out the appointments indiscriminately, as they have been doing, to card-carrying members of their parties.  That is the only reason I can see for the inclusion of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in this section.</P>
    <P>Can I be blamed for questioning the right of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to be consulted in this case when we saw the wholesale sacking of Bord na gCapall, a body that contributed substantially to our horse breeding industry?</P>

      <P>Obviously the Deputy does not have the influence other Members have.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to differ with the Minister but it is obvious he was not listening to my last comments.  The Minister is referring to section 5 (a) but I had moved on to paragraph (b).  There is a distinct departure because in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 the Second Schedule (2) (i) states:</P>
      <P>such number, as the Court thinks fit, of persons (in this Schedule referred to as representative (employers) members) who, in the opinion of the Court, represent employers in relation to whom the committee is to operate, and</P>
      <P>(ii) an equal number of persons (in this Schedule referred to as representative (workers) members)&mdash;</P>
      <P>There is no reference in either of those to the Minister's involvement or the Minister's interference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that there is a definite departure from the 1946 Act in that now the Minister shall submit a panel to the Labour Court and if the person is not suitable for one reason or another to the Minister, or if the Minister feels he should not be on it, he will not be on the panel submitted.  In addition, there will be the consultation with the Minister <Col N="678" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries and the same difficulty may arise there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand where the Minister has power in the 1946 Act regarding the worker or employer representatives. The Minister has incorporated some of the 1936 Act.  Instead of being forward looking he is taking a backward step which does not conform with the powers in the 1946 Act in relation to the setting up of joint labour committees. A different structure is now proposed.  The Minister for Labour has more involvement and he can knock any man's head from that panel if he wishes.  He must also consult with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. I have no objection to consultation with the employer or the worker organisations but I will be submitting amendments on Committee Stage seeking to take this power from the Minister. I am concerned about how the Government will use that power.  I look forward to the Minister's explanation. When he says there is no departure from the 1946 Act I say there is.  We will have an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with a very important section of our community, a section whose numbers we should make every effort to increase.  Under sound Fianna Fáil Government we had for many years seen industry absorbing many workers from the agricultural community.  This has stopped, and unfortunately the trend now is the other way.  There are very many job losses in industry, and we have a high unemployment figure.  We must encourage more and more employment in agriculture, give it every incentive we can, and expand and promote the spin-off and allied industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe our agricultural workers are some of the finest people any country has produced.  I think it was Liam O'Flaherty who, in his writings, compared them with their English counterparts.  O'Flaherty was one of our great novelists. He described them as being one of the finest bodies of men, <Col N="679" /> bearing no relation whatsoever, in no way comparable to similar workers across the water.  Ours were far superior in every respect, with their loyalty, interest, and capacity to be general factotums in many fields, prepared to do any function they are faced with, because agriculture is a wide-ranging industry, and with its increased mechanisation it does create further tasks that were not heard of 20 or 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill.  On Committee Stage there will be a number of amendments, mainly pointing out the dangers that would face us, particularly with a Government such as this one, with the appointments to the joint labour committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, as indeed I do any Bill designed to assist the agricultural community in agricultural production.  This is also an opportunity to make a few comments on agricultural workers as I know them.  I hope the Minister and the Department will have special regard to the very diverse types of individuals that form the general body of agricultural workers.  I very much regret that their numbers are dwindling, and I hope the Government have in their minds the desirability of increasing the numbers of people engaged in agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Fitzgerald in the tribute he has paid to the agricultural workers throughout the country.  What he says is very true, but I hope that the new committee will have regard to the fact that there are engaged in farming and employed on farms throughout the country a certain number of people who could probably be described loosely as being in sheltered employment, who are throw-backs from a previous era and generation and who could possibly be classified as retainers.  I do not say that with any disrespect.  These people are permanently of a by-gone generation, and I hope nothing will force them of necessity to be put into institutions or homes.  I mention that so that the Department will realise that these people exist and how happy they are. Their usefulness in highly modernised <Col N="680" /> farms is doubtful.  Nevertheless, they have given very good service over the years and they become part of a household.  If some farmers were forced to pay them a top class wage they might be tempted to let these people go.  That would be regrettable. I hope the new committee will recognise the position of people who could be described as being in sheltered employment.</P>
    <P>The importance of the agricultural industry cannot be over-emphasised. That there are too few people engaged in the industry is highly regrettable. It is fine to say and to accept that the production of beef is something that this country is ideally suited to, but that is not too entirely labour-intensive. When we consider that in the Community the EEC is certainly not self-sufficient in grains, and consider also the growing importance of agricultural power, a slight shift of emphasis being placed on tillage and grains would be not only in the interest of the national economy but in the interest of the Community economy. We should, perhaps, advocate something in this line.  Year by year agriculture becomes more and more complex. I would like to see the agricultural advisory service endeavouring to cater more for agricultural workers.  I accept that under the Agricultural Wages Board the top rates for agricultural wages were not on a par with those obtaining in industry, even in rural parts, even though it was generally recognised men working on the land in the main had longer hours and heavier work than workers in other industries.  Up to recently the agricultural industry has not been so designed, or the prices obtaining in agricultural production have not been so good as to enable farmers to pay a proper wage, but it is generally accepted that of the 20,000 people employed full-time in agriculture, many of them are receiving wages which are a great deal in excess of the top recommended wage laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board.  It is necessary to pay these bonuses in order to keep top class men.</P>
    <P>I would like to see agricultural committees being asked to provide and <Col N="681" /> place emphasis on more lectures and educational facilities for agricultural workers.  There must be many centres throughout the country where it should be possible during the winter months to have special block type courses laid on for farm workers.  We know farm schools are going well, but 90 per cent of the people attending those are farmers themselves.  It is quite obvious there must be a need for courses in the various husbandries for farm workers, and a certain amount of management, not only crop management, but of feed for pigs and cattle.  Certainly there is need for a course on machinery maintenance. There was an agricultural machinery instruction course each year, to my knowledge, certainly in the midlands.</P>
    <P>Nothing specific has been done to assist the farm workers to qualify themselves in these various fields.  This is regrettable, and a start should be made on it.  If the Department could organise such a scheme whereby a farm labourer would qualify for some type of increment after the successful completion of a course, this would be an inducement and an encouragement. The time has gone when we can be content just to roll along in Irish agriculture. We must at all times aim for the very top results.  The same applies to pig management.  This type of husbandry is changing to the intensive unit.  The people engaged in this certainly opt for it.  I could not imagine people working in a pig unit who would enjoy the work or who would want to be in it.  Nevertheless, there ought to be an opportunity for the people working there to sharpen their knowledge and be up to date with the latest modern trends and with the most up-to-date treatment of ailments which the ordinary pig operative has to be familiar with.</P>
    <P>Another thing that the new committee ought to remember is that the vast majority of farmer-owners, the farmers themselves, presently in occupation of Irish farms, are people who were reared in the thirties and forties, or even back in the twenties, and these people are, in the main, appalled by the rising overheads.  In their formative years they remembered the bailiff and the sheriff, and they are <Col N="682" /> certainly very apprehensive about expenses which increased their overheads. Perhaps this is dying out with the younger generation, but nevertheless there is an element of it there.</P>
    <P>I was quite disappointed when the rate relief, even though it was only £17, was removed.</P>

      <P>I certainly welcome this Bill.  I also welcome the opportunity of putting on record a few thoughts on my own experience as a farmer.  I cannot claim to be a practising farmer because I sleep only a few nights on the farm nowadays, but I still consider myself a farmer. Now that this desirable change has been brought about in the machinery <Col N="683" /> to review farm labour incomes it is an opportunity to mention to the Minister a few points which I genuinely think ought to be taken into account.  Great progress has been made over the years in the industrial wage structure and it is a pity that agriculture was not brought along on the same basis.  Had we been able to do that when the industrial drive was undertaken, it would have forced the economy to bring with it the agricultural economy to enable them to pay proper levels of wage scales for agricultural work.</P>
      <P>Another very important point, one that we need to have foremost in our minds, is the fact that agricultural incomes are based on a family farm income, and this is quite all right. But when the farmer happens to be a widow, then she is at a great disadvantage as she depends very much on farm labour when her family is young.  The unfortunate thing about it is that it is very difficult to have it regulated.  There must be room for greater employment here.  There is under-employment in agriculture.  One has only to drive through the countryside to see the amount of work that is there in every second field.  When one drives through Holland or Denmark there seems to be greater farm maintenance.  It is not possible to spend that kind of money at present on an Irish farm.  The income is not sufficient to hire the labour necessary to do that.  I think the £17 rate relief should have been increased.  I do not want to get back to that but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold the view that our Departments need to be completely re-organised to fall in line with the respective responsibilities emanating from the community.  We need to modernise our grouping of responsibilities so that we can be in line with our counterparts in other countries.</P>
      <P>There should be a register of farm workers compiled by the agricultural advisory service with a view to encouraging farm workers to attend lectures and block relief courses under the social directives, where these could be funded or grant aided from the EEC.  Farm work has changed in many respects.  Many dangerous sprays and chemicals are in regular use and expensive machinery is involved.  Even if there were only a few courses of lectures per annum those who attended them would learn to take the necessary precautions in their own interest. This would be highly desirable.  A start must be made in this direction. It is not enough to leave it to farmers to ask their employees to attend or to release them for that purpose.  The majority of them might not readily agree.  There are funds available through the social fund which could be used to make attendance at such courses attractive.  The only way such courses can be organised is by the compilation of a register of farm workers whom the advisory services can contact and encourage to attend.</P>
      <P>There is another point that I should like to put on record.  In most areas of outdoor work there are provisions for wet time and short time.  This is a concept that is not applicable to agriculture. If cows have to be attended to in time of heavy rain the farm worker cannot wait until the sun comes out the next day to attend to them.  The assessment of remuneration in the case of farm workers must remain different from that in other employments.  There are minus factors and there are plus factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the new joint labour committee will comprise persons who know the very specific problems in regard to agriculture and that they will at all times encourage the employment of farm workers.  If it is found necessary to introduce grants <Col N="685" /> or funds in order to encourage farmers to employ more workers, the possibility of doing that should be very seriously examined.</P>
    <P>I would compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I sincerely hope the industry will be placed in the position of being able to pay a higher level of remuneration to farm workers and that there will be realistic training schemes for farm workers that will be to the benefit of the industry as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting piece of legislation.  It is a natural evolution as a result of the changing role of the agricultural labourer and the change in the methods of agriculture during the past decade or so.  Each farm is now an industry in itself and in its own right.  Account must be taken of the value of the machinery contained on a farm and the amount of electricity consumed on the average farm where an agricultural worker is employed.</P>
      <P>The role of the agricultural worker has changed dramatically during the past decade.  There has been increased mechanisation and improved methods of farming and variations in farming. The agricultural worker is increasingly becoming a specialist.  He no longer works under supervision, as was the case in former years.</P>
      <P>This type of employment is not very attractive, for numerous reasons.  It is, generally speaking, a seven-day-a-week job.  Sunday work is unattractive in most spheres of employment and it is particularly so in the case of agriculture, especially in dairy farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, farm work is a very healthy life and the worker is employed in the best possible environment. However, the number of agricultural workers has dropped substantially during the past few years and in particular during the past year. Many large landowners who employed a number of agricultural workers and provided homes for them on their estates have found it necessary to sell out as a result of the decision of the Government to introduce a wealth tax.  This means that there will be fewer agricultural workers employed <Col N="686" /> as the years go by.  According as the larger estates are taken over for division by the Land Commission there will be fewer persons employed as agricultural workers.  I agree entirely with the previous speaker in his suggestion that there should be a training scheme for farm workers.  They should be trained at an early age&mdash;I would say immediately after leaving primary school.</P>
    <P>The agricultural worker who has proved himself to be skilled and interested in farming should qualify for land from the Land Commission. It is only right and fair that a good agricultural worker who is capable of managing and operating a farm should get land when the Land Commission divide an estate.  The Land Commission should take an interest in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  May I just mention that should this happen it would make the future for agricultural workers brighter?  As far as I know, there is nothing in legislation to prevent a landless man from getting land from the Land Commission.  I believe that the funds of the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be made available to agricultural workers who are prepared to buy land and have saved up deposits.  It should be the aim of this House to make the role of the agricultural worker more attractive and to ensure that there is a future for him in society.  The Minister should make every effort to cut out the differential in wages as between different areas.  I could never understand why there was a difference in the rate of pay as between one region and another.  The agricultural worker does the same work and works the same hours in all regions and there should not be any differentiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Educational facilities should be provided for agricultural workers during the first few years of employment.  I would not even suggest that an agricultural <Col N="687" /> worker should be on an incremental scale of pay but a scheme of education in farming methods and management should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that as far as possible there is continuity of employment for the agricultural worker.  Seasonal employment should be minimised.  It must be very hard on a worker to be employed for nine or ten months of the year and to have to draw unemployment benefit for the other two or three months.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the agricultural workers will now have access to the Labour Court and that under this Bill there will be a joint committee which will permit farmers and their workers to determine together future conditions of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill very much indeed. I speak on it with some authority because I have worked as an agricultural worker and I know what it means.  The Bill is a step forward. Down through the years agricultural workers were separated in every way from the rest of society.  Nowadays there is a lot of talk about equality of pay.  Up to the present the agricultural workers have been a depressed section of the community.  This Bill is not the be-all and end-all but it is a major step forward.  Under legislation and under the Agricultural Wages Board agricultural workers were deprived of several rounds of the national wage agreement.  I am delighted that the Agricultural Wages Board is being abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agricultural workers in modern times are skilled people who have to turn their hands to many trades in the course of their day's work.  They are using large machines such as combine harvesters and indeed servicing them. To be a good agricultural worker now one would almost need to be a qualified mechanic.  There are many such people.  They love the work they do and their remuneration and conditions of employment are a disgrace to our society.  There are agricultural labourers driving large lorries to take beet to sugar factories.  Very soon we will <Col N="688" /> be told by the Agricultural Wages Board that the agricultural workers will go back to a 50 hour week.  Provision should be made before this Bill becomes law for the committee to meet and fix proper hours of work for those people.  Everyone knows that the day of the 50 hours a week is gone but it is still a fact for the agricultural worker in the summer period.</P>
    <P>It is time we got our priorities right and considered those people who are in depressed conditions and working hours in excess of those worked by any other workers.  When we do this I will believe in the sincerity of the people who talk about equal conditions and equal pay in other spheres where conditions are good and wages pretty high.  One hears people talking about conditions in the public service and elsewhere where there is not equality, and I agree that there should be equality in every sphere of life.  Agricultural workers are doing the most important work and are in the most important industry in this country.</P>
    <P>No man should be expected to work a normal week of 50 hours.  We are getting our priorities a little mixed up. We brought in legislation for idustrial workers, to give them a certain amount of holidays, a certain amount of free time and a certain number of working hours after which they would get overtime.  Agricultural workers down through the years were deliberately excluded from this legislation. They were regarded as second class citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows my views in regard to agricultural workers.  I have pestered him day in and day out to introduce this legislation.  Agricultural workers will be able, by Ministerial order, to come under legislation for other workers and any progressive legislation which may be introduced will also apply to people in this category. Employers should be in a position to pay decent wages.  I speak of an area where the farms are pretty big and where people who are classed as agricultural workers are looking after animals valued at thousands of pounds.  They even travel <Col N="689" /> across the channel with them to sales but they are receiving depressed wages and working long hours.  I speak of farmers with 200, 300 and up to 1,000 acres of land who are well able to pay better rates than they are paying.  Those people should, by legislation, have to do the same as their industrial neighbours.</P>
    <P>I worked as an agricultural worker and I am proud of that fact.  Agricultural workers are the finest body of people one could find any place. When legislation was brought in to cover industrial workers very few people protested that agricultural workers were excluded.  Farm incomes have improved and we hope they will improve even further. Farmers in my area employ a large number of people.  They have invested a lot of money in their farms.  Their workers are entitled to a good living. Every Government have a duty to ensure that people in the lower paid jobs are properly paid.  I hope that the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, will be able to ensure that before this Bill comes into effect we will not drift back to the 50 hours a week, the normal summer working hours for farm workers.  People should not have to work a normal working week of 50 hours.  Something will have to be done to ensure that farm workers work only the same hours as industrial workers.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the joint labour committees which are being set up for the agricultural industry.  The Minister should ensure that membership of those committees is spread all over the country.  In most areas agricultural workers are not organised into trade unions.  In some cases perhaps only one person is employed and he becomes rather isolated.  There is provision for consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in relation to the appointment of the joint labour committees.  It is important that all regions have representation on those committees.  It is a different ball game in different areas.  In my area there are big farmers but in many other areas they are small.  Each region should have representation on the joint labour committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> Certain trade unions are organising farm workers and taking an interest in them.  They should have representation on the joint labour committees.  There should also be representation from areas where the farm workers are not in trade unions.  They would then be able to make known the difficulties of the employers and the workers in their areas.  As far as I can see the hours of work under this Bill can be fixed by Ministerial order.  The wages board was supposed to be a democratic board with representatives from both sides and an independent chairman.  I sometimes challenge the independence of people who are supposed to be independent. Sometimes the wages board came out with wages recommendations which did not take into account the national wage agreement.  There may have been people prejudiced one way and some prejudiced the other way on that board.  There were people who should have been independent in their thinking but we later found they were not.  If there are to be independent representatives on the joint labour committees the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or whoever appoints those people should ensure that they are independent.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, which is a major step forward as far as agricultural workers are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting piece of legislation.  First of all, I welcome any move towards the higher remuneration of agricultural workers. It is regrettable that there are not more people employed in agriculture generally.  As has been pointed out already it is our major industry.  We see from the Minister's statement that there are only 20,000 agricultural workers in full time employment and 14,000 in part time employment. There is great potential for employment in agriculture and we should encourage every step to create that employment.  While I welcome the higher remuneration, it is not just a question of more money; there is the matter of conditions also.  People engaged in agriculture work very long hours.  I hope this is being taken into <Col N="691" /> consideration by the Minister.  I hope I am not offending any other profession; sometimes public representatives work very long hours.  Agricultural workers undertake a variety of work and we should be concerned about their conditions and rates of overtime.</P>
      <P>We should also be concerned to have training schemes introduced so that the situation would be improved for agricultural workers.  In-training schemes and special courses should be made available.  Colleges in my constituency have short courses for people engaged in agriculture, and I would hope that these would be developed so that agricultural workers would benefit from them.  There is need in agriculture more and more for specialist skills just as in education. We should be concerned about the education of farmers and workers. I urge that money be made available, perhaps from the EEC, so that these training schemes could be provided. On this side of the House we have always supported steps to encourage employment in agriculture such as the employment premium scheme, and I hope this Bill will go some way towards improving the lot of agricultural workers and encouraging more people to engage in agriculture even though as has been said it is not the be-all and end-all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and see the necessity for it.  This tidying up operation was long overdue because in most cases rates actually being paid were much higher than the official rates&mdash;they had to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the whole agricultural worker situation I should like to dwell briefly on one point that has been mentioned, and that is the training. This aspect has been neglected, and more and more in future we will need qualified people.  We are talking of some 20,000 people, and that is a miserably small figure.  If agriculture were really moving here 100,000 people could and should be absorbed in agriculture alone.  When we really get moving, with the benefits of EEC <Col N="692" /> prices and conditions and with agriculture properly developed, this should be our target.  While we welcome new industries and so on we have this potential within ourselves because actual production in agriculture is nothing like what it should be and the industry is grossly understaffed.</P>
    <P>Education is a very important aspect of the matter, and there is not much point in talking of paying people more if the people and the employment are not there.  We must put that situation right.  Long ago in this House I suggested that a start should be made in the vocational schools with special training for agriculture and a diploma, similar to that given in other industries, given to people qualifying to operate as farm workers. This would get rid of the stigma mentioned by Deputy Bermingham of being second class citizens.  Farm workers now have many skills, and top workers could take their place in a garage or anywhere.  They must be skilled to be of any use on farms.  This legislation is long overdue and is welcomed by the farming community. Good men are treated well.  The only problem is that, as yet, we have far too many unskilled people.  This is no fault of theirs because educationally they were not prepared for this very difficult and demanding vocation. Nowadays I think one must break it down into specialised skills as regards pigs, tillage, dairying and so on, and farm workers must specialise in one or other of those branches if they are to be fully effective.  There is no such thing as a jack-of-all trades in reality. We have been making do with that situation, but in future we will need more specialised people to get the best out of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the loyalty and dedication of farm workers down the years.  They kept this very valuable industry going through thick and thin, often while very badly paid because the finance was not there.  That, thank God, is changing rapidly, and not before time. The Minister for Labour in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government might also consider the <Col N="693" /> proper housing of employees and provide something similar to the old schemes but with better housing facilities in rural areas so as to encourage people back to rural Ireland and encourage young men to go into farming. That would be doing a great social service.</P>
    <P>I think I would agree with Deputy Bermingham in regard to the 50-hour week.  Proper hours must be introduced. This would be for the betterment not only of the personnel but of the industry itself.  I also agree that agriculture must be put into the situation where we can afford to have and to pay skilled full-time employees. Most farms at present are grossly understaffed.  Perhaps the price for produce is such that it does not justify more employees.  The EEC have a big responsibility in this regard.  Prices should improve all around and there should be more emphasis on tillage crops and crops that involve more employees.  To a greater degree, we should emphasise the desirability of a larger cross section of crops.  This is something for which I blame the EEC.  We were almost forced into thinking that dairying and beef were the in things. Anybody looking at the Irish scene will realise that we have a long standing tradition in tillage. There is a far higher labour content in specialised crops, such as horticulture, than there is in the dairy and beef industries.  The EEC gave no help, or made no effort to help, the difficult areas, such as Erin Foods, Batchelors and similar firms, who made trojan efforts to break into the European market.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme is geared to the dairy and beef industries. The horticultural industry should be expanded.  All the east coast, most of the south coast and parts of the midlands are eminently suitable for this type of operation, and nothing is being done and no encouragement is being given.  There are five food factories in this country and none of them is expanding. On the day East Cork Foods Limited was founded a similar firm started in Holland.  We still employ a few hundred people while the firm in <Col N="694" /> Holland employ 4,500.  They got every encouragement and every help.  If we are serious about our sons and daughters staying at home, we must think of them working on farms and in industries related to farming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the swing from horses to tractors and co-operation in the issue of equipment.  I would be a bit sceptical of this type of co-operation.  The use of specialised equipment in agriculture means that we must have somebody in charge of this equipment, which might be worth £20,000 or more.  That is a very big responsibility.  In my view, the more responsibility a person carries, the more he should be paid.  That brings us back again to skills.  There are skills in agriculture, very often natural skills, but that is not good enough.  This problem must be tackled now.  I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to arrange a proper educational course for young people to prepare them to take their place in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy with the structure of the board.  I agree with Deputy Bermingham's point on regionalisation. There is a danger that we might have all Dublin people.  Therefore the Minister should ensure that there is representation from all over the country. Winter classes are not much use.  It is very difficult to get people to attend them.  It might be possible to work in something of a temporary nature through the vocational schools to help the existing work force.  This problem must be tackled from the ground up, that is, get the youths interested in agriculture.  The only way people are interested in anything is to mention money.  If you pay the right rate you get the right skilled people.</P>
    <P>In my opinion there is no future in agriculture for anybody unless he has skills in one or other of the agricultural fields&mdash;tillage, dairying or pigs. He does not need to be a master of all trades, all he has to do is specialise. The opportunities will be there.  We in this Parliament, must ensure that people will be properly trained and equipped for this employment.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the EEC regulations which says that the good agricultural <Col N="695" /> employee should not get land. As a matter of fact, he should be given every encouragement to own property. He should be given the same facilities as everybody else and that applies to farmers' sons as well.</P>

      <P>I welcome this very necessary legislation.  Agricultural workers have given fantastic service not only to the farming community but to the nation as a whole.  Even if the weather is bad, crops must be gathered.  People from food factories help to harvest crops.  Farm workers are very dedicated people.  Crops have never been unharvested because of industrial disputes.  There has always been a wonderful relationship between farmers and their workers.</P>
      <P>If this country is to pull out of her difficulties, we will all have to be dedicated.  As has been said, you do not buy your way out of a depression, you work your way out of it.  The Irish farm workers have always given a lead in this regard.  They have never let the side down.  They have not been complimented or rewarded enough for their service over the years.  Belatedly, they are getting their rightful share of the national take.  I hope that in future many more people will be employed in this very valuable industry and will be given an opportunity to live, earn their livings and rear their families in their natural environment.  This is vitally important.  We, as a Parliament, have responsibility to provide that employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any Bill which will improve the lot of any group of workers.  Therefore I welcome this Bill.  I would like to set down the point of view of the farmer and the farm worker.  I am not talking about the workers Deputy Bermingham mentioned.  In my constituency nobody has 1,000 acres.  I always held the view that that should never exist in a country when land is scarce. In my area we have 50- and 60-acre <Col N="696" /> farms.  The majority of these farmers do not employ anybody outside their families.  If a man is in tillage and has 50 or 60 acres, he employs somebody. In the ordinary way the farmer and the worker work together like brothers.  I want to emphasise that because it is very important.  It is nothing like industrial work where one works for a man one hardly ever sees.  Therefore, I do not agree with the suggestion that there should be separate courses for farmers and farm workers.  In our county committee of agriculture we put on courses for farmers under Directive 161, the one directive from Brussels that I do agree with.  There is no class distinction; farmers and farm workers go to the lectures together.  I agree with Deputy Hegarty that when they have completed such a course there should be some diploma or other acknowledgment that they have done so.</P>
      <P>This distinction between the worker and the boss is inherited from the old days.  I was chairman of the committee that set up the Farm Apprenticeship Board.  We did away with this distinction altogether.  In the training of apprentices the relationship between the farmer and the apprentice was that of student and teacher and not servant and boss. There may be snobbery in thousand-acre establishments where you do not see the boss but, generally speaking, the situation has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in blaming the Agricultural Wages Board for keeping down wages.  They set the minimum rate.  In my area no one will work for the minimum rate.  The older workers might not know much about modern machinery, but they are all paid very highly.  I would like to see a regional line on this, because there is no comparison between the type of worker that Deputy Bermingham represents and that I represent.  I would not like to see an eastern-dominated board settling wages for the west of Ireland. In my area the employer and the employees usually have their meals together. While they would not have breakfast together, they would have lunch or dinner plus a cup of tea brought out to them in the evening <Col N="697" /> and I do not think that is the case with the type of employer that Deputy Bermingham is talking about. The people who are on this board must understand these farming conditions. A man will bring home the tractor in the evening because he has a bit of land of his own; he gets potatoes and various other things from the farm.  Both employer and employee work together, and this has to be taken into consideration when considering wages.  I entirely agree that there should be a proper wage, but my point is that farming in one part of the country is different from that in another part.</P>
    <P>As regards hours of work, I would like to see the 50 hour week abolished, and for the farmer as well. However, this is where the farm worker is in a different situation from other workers.  Take the summertime when there may be four or five acres of hay to be dealt with.  The morning is wet and the farmer and the worker will play cards.  If it clears up at four o'clock in the evening they will often work at the hay until eight o'clock at night.  The industrial worker is not affected by the weather and, having done his day's work, he can leave at the normal hour.  These are the things I would like to emphasise in respect of the operations of the new board.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised as to the best way of increasing the number of farm workers.  I agree with Deputy Hegarty that the EEC policy on dairying and beef has caused a complete switch over from tillage.  On my small farm I did a good deal of tillage until I was elected to this House.  It did not pay to till in this country and everybody got out of it.  However, tillage is the best means of providing employment on the land.  Therefore, there should be a fund which would ensure that when tillage would not pay there would be an acreage payment for employing people.  This would increase employment on land.  Years ago industry was taking workers away from the land.  Now there is a surplus of industrial workers and they should be encouraged to go back to the land.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the minimum wage for agricultural workers was irrelevant, certainly in my area as far as <Col N="698" /> the skilled work was concerned, and I would not like the Agricultural Wages Board to be castigated as a body trying to keep down wages. Many of its members were more interested in the worker than in the employer.  Nor would I like to think that boards would be abolished just for the purpose of changing the personnel of those boards for any reason, and I will not go any further than that.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to regulate the 50 hours by taking off an hour in the morning or the evening.  We must realise every farmer has a seven-day week.  Every farm worker now works on Sundays.  Nobody likes to work on a Sunday, particularly when he sees his fellow industrial worker enjoying the day off, but cows have to be milked and looked after.  In computing the 50 hours I suggest that the time should be tied to some time during the day and not in the morning or the evening.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear these points in mind.  In the west he will be dealing with a set of workers different not only from industrial workers but also from the farming system in Kildare and in the east generally.  The only benefit the £17 allowance had was to ensure that workers would be kept on all the year round, and that is why during the debate on the recent Bill we suggested that the £17 be increased.</P>

      <P>Earlier on this Bill Deputies were allowed to stray&mdash;the wealth tax and other matters were discussed.  I will conclude by asking the Minister to be very careful about the appointment of this board to ensure that they will not be orientated towards the eastern part of the country, but that special consideration will be given to the farming system in the west.  The Minister should also realise the need to have farmers and workers treated with distinction in the matter of education. They should all be educated together without any segretation.  As I have <Col N="699" /> already indicated, I welcome the Bill in so far as it narrows the gap between agricultural and industrial workers.  The latter have done an excellent job during the years on minimum wages.</P>

      <P>I rise to extend a particular welcome to the Bill.  Agricultural workers have been the particular concern of the Labour Party for many years at all levels, branch, constituency and parliamentary.  We have been laying particular stress on a very obvious social injustice, the treatment of this section of our workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> industrial workers. We are, therefore, very glad this Bill has come before the House.</P>
      <P>All of us realise that in the not too distant past the workers for whom we are legislating now were in a position not for removed from slavery and I wish to pay a tribute to the Federation of Rural Workers for the fight they made to improve the lot of agricultural workers.  However, despite all their efforts the lot of the agricultural worker was still inferior.  As the Minister and other speakers have said, the terms of national wage agreements did not apply to them and there were other anomalies as well.  I presume the main reason for this was inability of employers to pay, but this can no longer be the position.</P>
      <P>There is another anomaly in regard to farm workers.  They have no stake in the land, only their ability to work. Like other workers, they are entitled to some sort of stake in return for the exercise of the many skills they possess.  Now, when the measuring and the levelling up has been done by the new board, the wages of agricultural workers comparatively will be at a very high rate.  As well as that, they will have the leverage facility of access to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made to the desirability of providing incentives for such workers, such as training courses and the prospect of land ownership. This is not relevant to this debate but it is a matter that should be given consideration very quickly.  Farm workers are entitled to expect that <Col N="700" /> they will be able to own land at some stage.  They have had a raw deal and while the farm worker was a slave, his wife was the slave of a slave. Women farm workers had a bad time, although it is admitted that there are not a lot of women working on the land.  However, the position of women land workers will have to receive special concern from the joint labour committee so that very obvious injustices will be eliminated.  We look forward, within the terms of this Bill, to a better deal for the workers and for agriculture generally.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>
      <P>It can be said that in Ireland we are all only about one generation removed from the land.  None of us can be unaware of the situation with which agricultural workers were faced down through the years.  My father was an agricultural worker as far back as 1913.  He worked in Deputy Fitzgerald's constituency.  My father told me many times that in those days, at the age of 14, the only free time he was allowed was time to attend Christian doctrine classes in Millstreet Church in preparation for Confirmation. He had to work on Sundays as well as weekdays.  However, like many others, he had enough sense to go into some form of agriculture-based industrial work and he moved to a city where he worked for seed merchants. The workers in those days knew what it was to be exploited so we should not understress unduly the importance of what was the situation then.  This Bill is a tribute to those members of the House who fought strenuously for it.  In the mid-fifties the House refused to support Deputies like, for instance, the late Seán Dunne who spoke eloquently on behalf of farmers or the late James Larkin and his brother Denis, each of whom on many occasions spoke in the House on behalf of this category of workers.</P>

      <P>Yes, he spoke here many times in favour of a change in legislation in this matter. <Col N="701" /> There were many others, too, including the present Ceann Comhairle. There was a historic debate on this subject in 1962 when the now Minister for Local Government introduced a Private Member's Bill.  On that occasion both Deputies Tully and Treacy, who were associated closely with the Federation of Rural Workers, spoke emphatically on the need for change.  There is a tendency for us to forget that it is about 15 years since the last major effort was made to have the lot of agricultural workers improved.  Time goes very quickly so far as parliamentary life is concerned, but it would be remiss of us to fail to put on record our tribute to those parliamentarians who at that time tried very hard to bring about a change in the conditions of agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no cause of regret to me that the Agricultural Wages Board is being abolished.  I do not say that in any sense of recrimination or bitterness. The board cannot be said to have been the most progressive industrial relations legislation that we have had.  Successive Ministers for Agriculture, notably Deputy Smith, refused to accept any suggestion of change.  I expect that Deputy Smith was sincere in his views.  He is a man of absolute integrity but at the time he was reflecting the economic and social attitudes towards the fixing of wages for industrial and agricultural workers.  As the then Minister for Agriculture he reflected, too, the attitude of the Government of the day.  It is interesting to read the Dáil debate on the Second Stage of the Bill that was introduced in 1962.  On 5th December of that year Deputy Smith mirrored the then political view when he said that he recommended a rejection of the Bill on two main grounds: first, that the existing machinery for fixing agricultural wages had proved adequate, had stood the test of time and had benefited very considerably the agricultural worker.  Because, he said, it was fair to both sides, it was acceptable to both employer and employee.  He went on to say that the existing Act had effectively put a floor on agricultural <Col N="702" /> wages and that new legislation of the kind proposed in the Bill would have the effect of leaving in a better position the genuine agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>Attitudes have changed since then. They have changed as a result of sustained pressure.  It has been always the position in this country that the possession of land, regardless of whether it was as little as six acres, gave the peculiar feeling of power, respectability and superiority in the situation of the rabid class consciousness which still exists in Ireland, much as we may deny this to be so. This attitude, particularly for those who did not possess land and who, consequently, were forced to earn a living by working on land owned by others, has always been a source of much divisiveness.  Those who worked in that situation were patronised more than a little down through the years.</P>
    <P>It is fitting that the Agricultural Wages Board should be abolished at this point in time because in relation to the national wage agreements during the past three or four years this board has been totally reactionary.  In saying that I am very conscious of there being representative groups on that board.  Notwithstanding the tremendous improvement in farm incomes in 1972-73 when there was a unique improvement in farming&mdash; admittedly there was a downturn in 1974-75 but there was a substantial improvement in the latter half of 1975 &mdash;nobody, either in conscience or in terms of economic viability, could have maintained that employers of agricultural workers would not be in a position to comply with the terms of the national wage agreements.  It is largely because of the scandalous attitude adopted by the Board that agricultural workers were allowed fall behind in terms of remuneration.  It was the persistent failure of the board to live up to its responsibilities that has brought well-merited justice in its abolition and in the setting up of a joint labour committee.</P>
    <P>It might be said that some groups have dragged their heels.  For instance, <Col N="703" /> it was a pity that the IFA and the ICMSA did not take the initiative on this matter and ensure that the Agricultural Wages Board was abolished. However, they have adopted a commendable attitude now on the &ldquo;vets&rdquo; dispute.  The same can be said of their attitude to other agricultural employees in the professional groupings, but they should have displayed the same degree of concern down through the years in relation to the wages paid to agricultural workers.  An organisation which claims to be national and representative must be seen to be doing these things, even though they may cut across what some people might call the best interests of some of the better off members of their own organisation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the joint labour committee.  I say publicly to the Minister that I hope the compromise&mdash;and it is a sensible enough compromise between himself and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whereby there will be joint consultation on the appointment of the employer and trade union or worker representatives&mdash;will in no way inhibit or delay the setting up of the JLC. With due respect to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, in the context of their reaction over the years to the setting up of the joint labour committee, I do not think they have been particularly expeditious.</P>
    <P>I have not spoken personally to the Minister about the background to this. I have no brief from the Minister.  I have no authority to discuss the matter with the Minister.  It would not surprise me in the least to learn that there was some queer arm twisting over the past three years.  Remember, it has taken this Government three years to do what we wanted to do in the first six months.  It must have taken some unique arm twisting by the Minister for Labour on the Department, and particularly on the senior departmental officials responsible for this policy issue, to get them to change their minds.</P>
    <P>They did change their minds.  It is to the credit of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that he has cojoined <Col N="704" /> with the Minister for Labour on it.  I would be perturbed lest, when it comes to the appointment of the employer members&mdash;there should be no difficulty on the workers' side&mdash;we should find the farming organisations once again saying to the Minister that they have no names to offer.  Now that the Agricultural Wages Board is abolished, they could drag their heels in the setting up of the JLC.  I hope that will not happen.</P>
    <P>I support the concept outlined by Deputy Callanan.  I regret I was not here for all of his speech.  He said farmers and farm workers should be educated together and should work together on the land.  There is a popular assumption that because one happens to be an urban Deputy from an urban area one knows sweet damn all and cares even less about the future of Irish agriculture.  This is a myth which is fostered largely by those who, for other purposes, want to create an urban-rural division in Irish society so that they might not have to face the horrors of urban taxation or the horrors of urban rateable valuation and, therefore, the further they keep this artificial division alive the happier they will be.</P>
    <P>I hope that in relation to agricultural education, training and apprenticeship, farmers and farm workers will be educated together.  As Deputy Callanan remarked, many of them share at Macra na Feirme level and Macra na Tuaithe level.  I know some outstanding young men, some extremely progressive men, who are farm workers and who have a deep and abiding interest in the future development of agriculture.  The Labour Party in this House have a particular interest in this Bill and it is not a narrow interest.  We want to see Irish agriculture prosper and develop in a progressive mixed economy.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that, by eliminating the class discrimination which existed in relation to agricultural workers, this Bill will make a significant contribution.  The employer organisations and the farming organisations should welcome this Bill as removing a source of conflict and a source of discrimination over the years. <Col N="705" /> They can be assured that the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party in an inter-Party Government will work in a constructive manner to ensure that that kind of development occurs.  I know the Minister for Labour has taken many a brickbat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Labour Party introduced a private members' motion in December, 1962, almost in line with the provisions of this Bill I spoke strongly in favour of it.  Now over 14 years later I welcome the introduction of this legislation.  I said at that time that it was very necessary. Agriculture as a whole has suffered as a result of the absence of legislation such as this.  At the time it was a vote of no confidence in the agricultural industry that that motion was not accepted.  Since then the agricultural industry has lost some of its best workers, workers who had a vocation to work in agriculture.  They have been lost to the industry, and it will be extremely difficult to attract into agricultural employment again the type of people who were lost to it and who are needed at present and for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the status of the agricultural worker.  I want to support everything they said in that regard.  This is the most important industry from our own point of view at home and from the EEC point of view.  It is by far the most <Col N="706" /> important industry, and yet the people who work and are employed in the industry have been treated in a very bad way.  Recently we heard a lot about anti-discrimination.  Many of those discussions were heated and feelings ran high about discrimination. I cannot recall any speaker in those discussions bringing to light the discrimination this Bill now proposes to do away with, the discrimination which debarred those working in agriculture from having the same facilities in the Labour Court as every other employee.</P>
    <P>That legislation set a minimum wage rate and in most cases workers in the agricultural industry only receive the minimum.  There were cases where workers received over the minimum rate, but some of them received over the rate because of the supply and demand position of workers in recent years.  Because of that position it was necessary to keep as many as possible working in the industry.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the minimum wage rate was fixed having regard to the ability of the small farmer to pay.  The theory was that the farmers with big holdings would pay more to the agricultural workers than those with small holdings but, unfortunately, in practice that did not always happen.  The question of working hours has been mentioned by many speakers.  It should be remembered that practically all our labour force are on a 40-hour week but agricultural workers must, in accordance with their agreement for 1976, face a 50-hour week in a few weeks' time.  I should like the Minister to arrange for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to insist that the Agricultural Wages Board make one memorable and worthy order before they go out of existence, to reduce the number of hours to be worked by agricultural workers within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I hope this appeal will be listened to by the Agricultural Wages Board.  It is in order that I should put on record the change in outlook of this House in regard to this legislation.  When I spoke on a similar Bill, almost 14 years ago, <Col N="707" /> very few outside the Labour Party supported such a measure.  At that time a Private Members' Bill which proposed measures similar to those contained in this Bill was defeated by 68 votes to 13.  I welcome the change in attitude, and I am glad to see that the Bill is receiving almost unanimous support.</P>
    <P>I hope that under the joint labour committee it will be possible for the agricultural workers to negotiate not alone for rates of pay and working conditions similar to industrial workers but also to negotiate for profit sharing, bonus payments and other things described as fringe benefits which are now part and parcel of the industrial relations scene.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this important piece of social legislation which was long overdue and necessary.  The people it is intended to benefit deserve it because of the important part they played in our economy.  I hope that as a result of this legislation there will be a significant raising of the status of these workers, and of the educational and training facilities necessary for them.</P>
    <P>The formation of a recognised apprenticeship is necessary for farm workers.  An agricultural worker as well as being an expert on agricultural matters, must also be very familiar with and have a good knowledge of electrical and mechanical work.  He must also have a good knowledge of the various chemicals he has to handle. For these reasons it is necessary that he have a reasonable scientific training. The introduction of a recognised apprenticeship scheme would help this important industry in the long run. The Minister is deserving of great praise for introducing this measure. Since his announcement that the measure would be introduced he has not received the credit he deserves.  In my view this is a major turning point. It is a significant piece of social legislation and I hope it will be given a speedy passage through this House.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to replace the Agricultural Wages Board established under the Agricultural <Col N="708" /> Wages Act, 1936.  This has a lot to do with the agricultural worker, a man who is employed full time on the land and who has been a great help in the past to rural Ireland.  It is sad to say that many people have left the land and that many agricultural workers have left farms for the brighter lights of our cities.  The Minister seems to be making a lot of hay out of the Bill and telling us that everything will be bright in the future.  I accept that it is a new Bill but I doubt if the promises made will come about as fast as the Minister says.</P>
      <P>The Bill is being introduced at a time when there will be unemployment in other spheres, the milk and meat processing industries.  The fact that the number of cattle on the land has been reduced will affect the position of farm workers.  I would have liked had the Minister done something positive to help out the people who decide to work for farmers.  In my view there is nothing in the Bill to help such people.  He has left it to the new board to sort that matter out.</P>
      <P>We live in an age where everybody is talking about taking decisions in these matters of appointments from Ministers.  There was a Planning Bill which was before the Dáil a long time, and there was a lot of hay made by the Minister and his colleagues that there should be planning appeals.  Regarding this Bill under discussion we find that the Minister is going to make appointments to this board.  That is something that will have to be opposed. There is nothing wrong in selecting a board, in giving it powers, but there should be men from the employers' side and from the employees' side. These last are union workers and should be well able to do their job.</P>
      <P>Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>(a) the chairman and not more than two independent members of the committee shall be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is taking away power from the board, and that means that the chairman cannot be a person who will <Col N="709" /> attend the first meeting of the delegated members and they could appoint a chairman of their choice.  If this Bill goes through that chairman will be a person forced on them by the Minister. We know what has happened in the last three years.  People have been drafted into ministerial positions from all walks of life.  They are public relations officers, the eyes of the Minister, so to speak, and have no real function. Who will be the chairman?  Is he going to be another one of that set who has helped in some election, has been a good subscriber to some party, a good friend of the Minister's?  The choice of chairman should be left to the first meeting of the board or committee, call it what you like, that they should be in the position to elect the chairman.  However, the section says quite clearly that the chairman and not more than two members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  No matter how good the members may be in labour relations, if they are not of a certain political persuasion they are not going to be one of those three members. There is nothing wrong with the Minister, and I would like to see somebody from his Department on the board.</P>
    <P>The section also says</P>
    <P>(b) the representative (employers) members of the committee shall be appointed by the Court from a panel prepared and presented to the Court by the Minister after consultation with such organisation or organisations representative of agricultural employers as the Minister thinks fit and with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <P>There is something obnoxious in all this, the Minister taking a lot of power on himself. There is the setting up of the board, and discussion is very limited in it, but the Minister says the Bill represents <Col N="710" /> a fair measure to be introduced by the Government.  The Minister has stated that it is going to improve the general condition of farm workers. They will have access to the Labour Court, to other things.  Is that going to improve their lot?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us how the agricultural sector have qualified for the premium?  The Minister should broaden the scope of that and include farm labourers to encourage farmers to employ more on the land.  There is a certain category of farmer who wants financial assistance to enable him to pay a proper wage to a farm worker.  There are others who, because of their large holdings and the way they are running them, are able to pay employees.  But it is the man in between who really wants a little help. Help in that direction would be well directed.  In agriculture fewer and fewer people are being employed each year.  The future for this year is very bad indeed, and this Bill as it stands is not going to bring people back into agriculture.  A person needs money in order to be able to pay out, and the Minister will have to give a little help.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; means a person who carries on the trade or business of agriculture and who employs other persons as agricultural workers for the purposes of that trade or business;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that came in agriculture and the approach to it have changed in many ways.  When the Minister comes to this part of the Bill will he be able to say that the agricultural employer is employing in a particular unit or will he be able to say that they are still agricultural employees?  He could also say they are employed in a business, but I would like him to define what heading these people come under.  When the Agricultural Wages Board was set up that was the situation. If the Bill goes through, many things will be considered while the Government will be trying to make a lot of play out of this.  They are talking about 1981 and 1982, but unless the Minister takes other steps in 1976 he is not going to better the lot of <Col N="711" /> the agricultural worker.  I would prefer that he would say he is going to pay the employment premium to a certain category of farmers.</P>
    <P>There was no mention in the Bill of farmers' sons at home on the land. There are farmers who would love to keep their sons and daughters on the land but who have not enough to give them an adequate sum at the end of each week.</P>
    <P>The farmer and his wife are milking say, 20 or 25 cows.  That is not a great number of cattle, and some farmers have only 15 or 16 cows. They would like their son to succeed them.  I would like to see continuity of ownership of the land from father to son.  On a middle sized farm as we know it today, if a son leaves home and goes to work in a factory he will not come back to the land.  If we could help him under this Bill and try to define some aid for the farmer which the farmer would pay direct to the son on the farm, the medium sized or small farm, I see nothing wrong in that.  The son could be classed as an agricultural worker under many headings.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of talk on all sides of the House as to what is the best course in this Bill to improve the lot of agricultural workers in 1976.  I am sorry that the Minister has taken so much power to himself as regards employment of personnel on the new board.  I think that is going to react, and in time it will have very bad effect.  If you had a Coalition Government one year, Fianna Fáil another year, Fine Gael another year, the Minister of the day would be able to change it.  These things are bad for Irish politics.  When the board meets the members should be able to appoint their own chairman and go about doing their own business without the interference from the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has the monopoly on any board, people question it.  They will say to themselves.  &ldquo;We got nothing from that board.  We had a different political colour&rdquo;.  They will say that no matter who is in <Col N="712" /> power.  I understood that there was an end to that, but I see that it is to be continued.  That is one section I would like to see changed by the Minister.  I am not going to say I am satisfied until I see the lot of the person it affects improved.  There is no sign in this Bill that the lot of the agricultural worker is going to be improved one way or the other.  I would ask the Minister to think deeply about the type of farmer&mdash;and there are thousands of them in Ireland&mdash; who would employ somebody if he got help from the State.  These farmers would love to keep their own son or daughter at home on the land to make sure there was succession to the family farm, and is that not what we really want?  It is very sad to see the old couple at home with the door shut and the son and daughter employed in industry.  Let us help those people.  Even if money has to be raised from central funds, I have no doubt that the Minister will get the consent of the House to do that.</P>

      <P>I first want to thank those Deputies who have spoken in support of this Bill, its task being one of bringing about arrangements whereby agricultural workers and their conditions can relate more closely than heretofore with those of the rates and conditions of work of industrial workers generally.  That is the sole intent of this Bill, and I thank those Deputies who support that intent.  I especially thank the members of my own Party, the Labour Party.  As Deputy Eileen Desmond, Deputy Séamus Pattison, Deputy Barry Desmond and Deputy Joe Bermingham said, it has been a long-term objective of our Party when in opposition to establish a joint labour committee for agricultural workers in place of the old Agricultural Wages Board.  We had not succeeded in the past when in opposition in getting that done, and I am glad I have had the opportunity of meeting that Labour Party objective when in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this debate, Deputies on all sides have spoken of the skilled nature of the work of agricultural employees. Its skilled status has not been acknowledged sufficiently in the past and is not acknowledged at present.  Deputy <Col N="713" /> Bermingham made the point that when you consider the cost of the machinery the agricultural worker deals with in the course of his job you begin to see the kind of responsibility he discharges. If you look at the cost of the machinery he is supposed to both understand and to work with&mdash;to some extent he is even expected to deal with routine breakdowns in such expensive machinery&mdash;you will appreciate that these are the tools of his job in an increasingly mechanised agricultural system and begin to get a truer appreciation of the skilled nature of his calling at present, and would hopefully come to the conclusion that there is no longer any good reason why, in 1976, there should be this separation in the kind of framework under which he operates and that under which industrial workers operate in the State.</P>
    <P>Various queries were raised during the discussion, some relating to the Bill, others not having a direct bearing on it.  Understandably, Deputies used the opportunity to talk about more general topics, such as the state of agriculture and the state of industry generally&mdash;an interesting topic but not quite on the terms of the measure before us.  There was reference to the subsidy of £17 for farmers who employ agricultural workers.  That does not relate directly to this discussion, but that reduction, of course, was abolished in the budget.  It was described as a saving at that time and, I think, a worthwhile saving, but that topic does not relate to the Bill we have under discussion.  It could be said in general that, whilst agriculture is undergoing, like other sectors of our industry, certain difficulties, the future is bright for agriculture and that our marketing position within Europe gives ground for optimism in the future.</P>
    <P>Certainly the state of agriculture now could not be compared with what obtained in that industry years ago.  It is a different situation entirely. Whatever difficulties are faced this year or next year, there is no one who would deny that the future for our agriculture within the European Community, commanding better prices and a more secure future, is totally <Col N="714" /> different than what it was traditionally in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney complained about the method of appointment of the chairman and independent members. That of course is a continuation of the procedures already laid down under the 1946 Act for the appointment of such people to joint labour committees.  The chairman and the two independent members have always been appointed under that legislation by the respective Ministers. As I explained, the only change in this measure is that there is consultation with the Minister for Agriculture before any such appointments are made.  A little reflection will show why this is necessary in the formation of this joint labour committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had read my opening speech he would have seen that that point is clarified in it.  The departure in the formation of this joint committee is that the appointment of the chairman and the two independent members is made in this instance after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture.  I think most Deputies will agree that this was necessary when you consider that it deals mainly with employees in the agricultural industry, that agricultural organisations had some reservations about the wisdom of establishing a joint labour committee.  There was a good deal of opinion in the industry which was more or less satisfied with the old agricultural board that we knew, which is now to be abolished in this piece of legislation.  In the best interests of the industry and in the best interests of progress under the new arrangement, and to allay any fears there might be that the good of the industry was not our concern, because it has been our concern, I <Col N="715" /> thought that such appointments should be made only after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture. That is the departure which I pointed out this morning.</P>
      <P>Now the other points relating to the two sides of the industry, the employers' side and the workers' side. The nominees coming from both sides who would sit on the joint labour committee will be formally appointed by the Labour Court.  It is clear in the 1946 legislation that it is the court that will make such nominations.</P>

I would counsel the Deputy that quoting the procedures of his party when in power has no relevance or bearing on the manner in which this Government carry out the duty of appointing persons to boards.  The Deputy may rest assured that the same concern as we displayed in setting up a joint labour committee for the agricultural industry, which most people will agree is in the interests of the industry and its employees, will be carried through in ensuring that when we receive the panels after consultation with both farmers' and workers' organisations, the people from them will be formally appointed by the court and we will ensure that only persons of repute and interest in this area will find themselves on both sides of this joint labour committee.  The Deputy need not worry about our sense of integrity in that matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked why people employed by the State and engaged on agricultural work are excluded.  They are excluded because their wages and conditions are negotiated by their own joint industrial council and they have in fact benefited practically to the same extent as industrial workers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald made the point that we should encourage more employment in agriculture.  There has been a very serious exodus from work on the land in our economy.  One manner in which this exodus can be stemmed is by ensuring that the remuneration of skilled manpower in that industry is brought into close relationship as soon as possible with that obtaining in industry.  I would hope that this Bill, when both sides get to work it, will help in arresting that decline of skilled manpower in the industry. If the industry does not retain such manpower its future prosperity will be seriously endangered.  Agricultural workers have, of course, been brought in under the premium employment programme.  There was a question asked about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham raised the very important point about the working <Col N="717" /> hours under the wages board.  He asked whether we should make arrangements whereby the joint labour committee will take over the powers of the board as soon as possible and ensure more tolerable working conditions are provided as soon as possible.  I have already explained that we have overleaped the usual time procedure that goes into the making of a joint labour committee.  We departed from the usual manner of establishing a joint labour committee in that we have cut down the time usually consumed in its establishment and set the committee up right away.</P>
    <P>There is this problem that I am aware of and that Deputy Bermingham is aware of.  I certainly will look at the question, and I have looked at the question, he raised in company with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, that is, the question of hours and so on that have been drawn up by the board which is still in being until this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas. I would hope that when the Bill is passed and comes into operation and the joint labour committee sits down to discuss conditions, major anomalies in conditions between agricultural workers and industrial workers can be cleared up as speedily as possible.  It is in the interest of the industry itself that this should be done as much as it is in the interest of the individuals concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all cognate. The substantive amendments in that group are amendments Nos. 7 and 12.  I will refer at the outset to amendments Nos. 7 and 12 so that the House will see what is involved.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 7 is to extend to illegitimate children the age extensions provided for legitimate children.  Henceforth in proceedings for maintenance of illegitimate children under the Affiliation Act of 1930 they will be placed in the same position as legitimate children.  In other words, the normal maximum age of dependency will be 16 years but an extension may be granted up to 21 years in cases where the child is receiving full-time education or instruction and in cases of disability without any maximum age limit.  It was pointed out in the Special Committee that illegitimate children were being discriminated against in this regard.  This amendment is to put affiliation orders on the same footing as maintenance orders. This is the central amendment of this present group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we cannot just stop there because if we do not make further amendments to the 1930 Act serious differences will be perpetuated between the procedures for maintenance of legitimate and illegitimate children and accordingly some substantial changes have been proposed in relation to the 1930 Act and these have involved some quite complex drafting because, <Col N="719" /> of course, the 1930 Act did not contemplate any changes on these lines.</P>
    <P>Now if I may turn to amendment No. 12, it is fair to say that the length of the amendment demonstrates the kind of difficulty involved in amending the 1930 Act.  Ideally, the 1930 Act would be drafted completely <i>de novo</i> but that would have delayed the present Bill and in any event is a matter which would fall more properly to be considered in the case of a comprehensive review of the law in relation to illegitimate children.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on 13th November last in reply to questions dealing with the future provision of rural electrification I am drawing up proposals designed to assist those householders who were quoted capital contributions for connection to the electricity supply under the subsidised rural electrification scheme 1971-1975 but who were unable to accept the terms.  The capital contributions requested represented the buying out of part of the special service charges appropriate in these cases.  It is not intended to assist any other category of consumer or prospective consumer under these proposals.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that revenue deposits which were required in some cases under the 1971-1975 subsidised rural electrification scheme did not represent a buying out of any portion of the special service charge. These deposits were required to provide a guarantee to the Board that any applicant who might accept terms involving substantial fixed payments was in fact likely to be in a position to fulfil these commitments.  Where a revenue deposit was required a consumer's account was credited with this deposit following payment of six two-monthly bills.</P>

I have in mind persons who were quoted supply at the early stages of the 1971-75 rural electrification subsidy and who have subsequently been quoted very high capital contributions outside the subsidy. These people will be denied the right to benefit under the proposed scheme.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in this matter. Does he not consider it unfair that 13 houses quoted £1,000 each for electricity installation will not benefit under the proposed scheme?  Before he introduces details, I would ask him to reconsider&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The report &ldquo;A Study of Suitable Coastal Locations for Oil Refineries in Ireland&rdquo; which was commissioned by me from An Foras Forbartha is intended as one input in the consideration of policy formulation on petroleum matters and I am satisfied that it will be particularly valuable in this connection.  I think it is desirable to add that the consultants had to work within the context of the financial and time constraints imposed on them.  Much of the material in the report is of a highly technical nature and the consultants study is based on such data as they were in a position to obtain. Indeed, as it pointed out in the report, no data at all was available in the case of many relevant matters.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the practice known as pyramid selling has been banned; and, if not, the action, if any, he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation specifically banning pyramid selling. Considerable progress had been made with the preparation of legislation to regulate the practice, but as this legislation has to compete for attention with other desirable legislative proposals, I cannot say how soon it will be brought to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I feel sure that most people by now have been alerted to the undesirable practices associated with pyramid selling.</P>

      <P>On the question of people being alerted to this practice is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this group, who call themselves Golden Products, are advertising in the evening newspapers?  It is only fair to say that generally the advertising departments of the newspapers have issued instructions to the effect that advertisements should not be accepted from people engaged in this criminal practice.  However, some of the ads get through for want of attention or for some other reason. Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the type of advertisement I am referring to runs as follows:</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the firm calling themselves Golden Products are advertising fraudulently in the newspapers and can he tell us if he intends taking any action in the matter?  Is he aware, too, that on Wednesday last some 60 people attended a meeting in a south Dublin hotel arranged by this firm or people associated with them, that during the course of that meeting a woman complained that she had been defrauded of £800 while another individual said that he, too, had been defrauded of an amount of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You are being very patient with me, a Cheann Comhairle.  The matter is of extreme importance which should be ended immediately by the enacting of the necessary legislation.

This affords me an opportunity of saying that anyone who is approached by the firm mentioned or by any firm in similar business should be very careful in their dealings with them and should insist on substantial time for consideration before agreeing to enter into any arrangement.  This practice can be brought to a speedy conclusion if people refuse to participate in it.  In the first instance people participate voluntarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as complaints are concerned, the gardaí in the fraud squad have indicated to us that they had not had any complaints recently of people being defrauded but I should be grateful if the Deputy or his informants would pass immediately to the fraud squad any information they may have.  On the face of it, I would imagine that the issuing of a physical threat would constitute an offence, quite independently of pyramid <Col N="735" /> selling.  I would urge particularly the Deputy's associate who was the subject of a physical threat to bring this matter to the attention of the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main contract in this case, as I stated last week, was secured by an Irish firm.  The sub-tender for fibreglass material received from the foreign firm was 30 per cent lower than the nearest tender of an Irish firm.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="736" /> Both these schools are being financed by a World Bank loan and it is a condition of the legal agreement between the Government and the World Bank that there be international tendering for all projects covered by the loan.</P>

I understand that the terms of the World Bank loan allow for a 15 per cent tolerance in respect of Irish firms.  Can the Minister say whether there was any way by which an Irish firm whose contract was not within that 15 per cent tolerance could have been given the contract.  For instance, could the Minister have approached the European Parliament or any other body on the matter?</P>

I can understand why the names of individuals are not given in Parliamentary Questions but up to now I had not experienced the procedure of omitting the names of schools.

      <P>A scheme on these lines has been in operation since 1966.

This request has had to be considered carefully as the matter in question is of general interest and could be a basis for a deputation from each constituency in the country.  I <Col N="743" /> have also received requests from a number of other sources to meet deputations in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 4th February, 1976, in regard to financial support for residential homes which cater for children in care.  Pending the outcome of the consultations referred to in that reply, it is unlikely that a useful purpose would be served by my receiving a series of deputations at this stage.

      <P>The employment problems caused by the present recession for all sections of our population including young persons are fully appreciated by the Government.  The figures, however, given in the Deputy's question greatly over-state the scale of the problem because they do not allow for the fact that large numbers of intermediate and leaving certificate students proceed to further education and training.  I might add here that the numbers in educational and training establishments are higher now than ever before.</P>
      <P>To keep domestic demand at the highest possible level so as to minimise the effects of the recession and thus maintain employment has been the objective of Government economic policy.  The size of the public capital programme shows the extent of our commitment.</P>
      <P>Because of the open nature of our economy the public capital programme cannot, however large it may be, neutralise the adverse effects for ourselves of the the depressed demand in the economies of our major trading partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the House on 17th February the Community is now reviewing the existing common fisheries policy.  This is because of the major change in circumstances which will result from the creation of 200 mile economic zones expected to emerge from the Law of the Sea Conference.  On 18th February the Commission presented proposed guidelines to the Council for a new Community fisheries regime.  These guidelines will be examined by the Committee of Permanent Representatives and in due course by the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>I have already explained to the House that we are seeking a substantial exclusive band reserved for Irish boats within the 200 mile zone and, in addition, a preferential quota in the remainder of the zone.  I may say that we regard the development potential of the industry in the context of regional development in the Community as particularly important and that to satisfy Irish needs the new regime must take this essential consideration into account.</P>
      <P>I do not regard the exclusive band of 12 miles which the Commission has proposed, with a progressive phasingout of traditional rights, as sufficient from Ireland's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussions at Community level we will be making the strongest possible case for a new regime which will allow for the growth of our fishing industry in a wide coastal band while providing the maximum opportunity for expansion in the outer zone.  I expect that the negotiations on this issue will be fairly long drawn out and because some of our partners have interests which do not accord with ours these negotiations will be difficult. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that we will <Col N="750" /> achieve a regime which will put our fishermen in a position to exploit the benefits of the new 200 mile zone while meeting the reasonable requirements of our Community partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House what exactly the Government are seeking in this exclusive zone?  Are they looking for a 50 mile exclusive limit?  Can he say exactly what the Government are pressing for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government accept that the demand of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation for 50 miles is a reasonable one, and the Government propose to make the best possible case it can and the strongest possible case for the maximum possible exclusive band.  The Deputy can be assured that that will be done and already is being done, but the Deputy will appreciate that this case is being made by us at the very time when the nations which now fish our waters are being constricted or being pushed back from other traditional fishing areas or will be very shortly pushed back from them because of the emergence of a generalised 200 mile economic zone everywhere else in the world, including Norway and Iceland, which will affect them very badly.  At the very time when they are looking for treatment which will let them down lightly at a difficult time, that is the very moment when we are looking for the same kind of treatment which will make things more difficult for them.  So that while, of course, the Government must have the interests of Irish fishermen uppermost in their minds, the Deputy and the House will appreciate that we will be making that case at the most difficult time.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that regional development especially in the west of Ireland must necessarily be closely associated with the development of the fishing industry in that area, and that therefore the uniform application throughout the Community of a 12 mile inner zone could hardly be justified by the Community?  On the contrary, a far greater inner zone in the western area especially would be a <Col N="751" /> reasonable and equitable demand for the Government to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, recalling</P>
      <P>(a)  that serious allegations were made against a Member of this House, the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, by Deputies Robert Molloy and Brendan Crinion, and repeated by them notwithstanding the denials of the Minister;</P>
      <P>(b)  that a Tribunal of Inquiry appointed by the Taoiseach pursuant to Resolutions of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann investigated the allegations and found that they were untrue;</P>
      <P>(c)  that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered the Report of the Tribunal and reported to Dáil Éireann on the 4th December, 1975, that Deputies Robert Molloy and Brendan Crinion were in grave breach of privilege in making the allegations,</P>
      <P>(1)  notes and approves the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the matter;</P>
      <P>(2)  taking into account that the Deputies have publicly admitted that the allegations were untrue and have withdrawn them and have apologised to the Minister for having made them, is of the opinion that the appropriate action which Dáil Éireann should take arising from the grave breach of privilege involved is to express its strong condemnation of the actions of Deputies Robert Molloy and Brendan Crinion and to censure them for those actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> The terms of this motion are self-explanatory and the matter has been before the Dáil recently enough for Deputies to recall the sequence of events.</P>
    <P>The motion is to vindicate the reputation of the Minister for Local Government who, like any other Deputy, is entitled to have his good name untarnished by allegations without any basis in fact.</P>
    <P>On the 12th December, 1974, an allegation was made against the Minister for Local Government by Deputy Molloy which the Minister denied.  On the 25th June, 1975, Deputy Molloy again raised the matter and again the Minister denied the charge.  On the 2nd July, 1975, the Minister made a personal statement in the Dáil denying the truth of the allegations.  Deputy Molloy repeated the allegations in which he was supported by Deputy Crinion.</P>
    <P>On the 2nd July, 1975, the Minister requested the Ceann Comhairle to refer the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  On the 3rd July, the Committee reported that the Deputies concerned would not make any statement to the Committee and in the circumstances they were unable to investigate properly the matter before them.</P>
    <P>On the 3rd July, I moved a motion to establish a tribunal under the Tribunal of Inquiry Evidence Act, 1921.  This motion was passed by the Dáil on the 3rd July and on the 4th July a similar resolution was approved by Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>On the 4th July prior to the resolution being discussed in the Seanad, Deputies Molloy and Crinion apologised in the Dáil and made statements in the matter.</P>
    <P>The tribunal reported on the 31st July and this report was presented to each House of the Oireachtas on the 1st August, 1975.  The report was subsequently printed and circulated to Members of the Dáil and Seanad on the 25th November, 1975.</P>
    <P>On the 26th November I moved a motion referring the tribunal's report to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for consideration and for a <Col N="759" /> report thereon to the House.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges reported on the 4th December that Deputies Molloy and Crinion were in grave breach of privilege in making the allegations against the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>A motion that the report be laid before the Dáil and that the report and proceedings of the Committee be printed was agreed by the Dáil on the 10th December.</P>
    <P>In view of the findings of the tribunal and the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I consider it appropriate that Dáil Éireann should pass the motion which I have moved and I so recommend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it was unnecessary that the Taoiseach should pursue the original motion to set up a tribunal once Deputies Molloy and Crinion had completely and unreservedly withdrawn the charges made against the Minister for Local Government and apologised in a manful and open way before this House. Admittedly that withdrawal and apology were made on the day after the Dáil passed the motion setting up the tribunal and only some short time before the motion was submitted for discussion in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Minister for Local Government was absent from the vicinity of the House on that day&mdash;I believe he was engaged elsewhere&mdash; may have given some justification for the Taoiseach to proceed but he might have postponed the submission of the motion to the Seanad on that day until the following week when it would have been possible to consult with the Minister for Local Government.  It would have been a praiseworthy action on their part had they not proceeded with the motion in the Seanad and moved to annul the motion passed in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> We did not oppose the passing of the motion in the Dáil.  I was the only speaker from this party on that day. I said that the Minister's reputation was entitled to be vindicated, if it was to be vindicated.  I submit it was completely vindicated by the withdrawal and by the apology made by the Deputies on 4th July.</P>
    <P>However, the Taoiseach and the Government did not see fit to withdraw the motion from the Seanad and to annul the motion passed by the Dáil.  The Coalition were determined to have their pound of flesh.  The tribunal was duly established.  It sat and reported and its report is contained in the document PRI 4745.  It comprises in the main two parts.  Part I sets out the facts leading to the establishment of the tribunal and Part II sets out the sittings, evidence and the findings of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 13 in Part I the report states:</P>
    <P>In Dáil Éireann Deputy Molloy said he had been in touch with the three people who had given him the information</P>
    <P>that is the information he alleged against the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Two of them refused to have their names disclosed or to give evidence. The third person had satisfied Deputy Molloy that the allegations made to him by the other two on whose information he had relied were incorrect.  In the circumstances he withdrew unreservedly the allegations made concerning the Minister and James Farrell.  He wished to apologise to both men for any distress caused resulting from his statements in the Dáil. Deputy Crinion endorsed what Deputy Molloy had said.  He withdrew unreservedly the allegations he had made in Dáil Éireann about the Minister and Mr. James Farrell. He wished to publicly apologise to both of them for any distress caused to them resulting from his statements in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 13 of Part II of the report the following sentence appears:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> With the solitary exception of the Locke Tribunal in 1947 no tribunal set up under the 1921 Act has investigated allegations made in Parliament.</P>
    <P>That statement referred to a submission made in the course of the hearing at the tribunal by counsel for Deputy Molloy.  I believe that the Locke Tribunal was in fact the only precedent we had of an inquiry into allegations made in the Dáil against a member or members of the Government or of the Oireachtas.  These allegations, it will be recalled, were made at that time by Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  The tribunal found that the allegations were completely unfounded and, in respect of one of the allegations, it reported at page 18 of the report:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that it is wholly untrue, that it is entirely without foundation and that it was made with a degree of recklessness amounting to complete irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>There was no such finding along these lines by the tribunal in this case but, from then on, since the Locke Tribunal had reported, the then Fianna Fail Government did not pursue the matter further.  They were satisfied once the facts had been established and once the reputations of the members of the Government and of the Oireachtas against whom the allegations were made were cleared. They left it at that.  There was no witch hunt.  But this Coalition were not content to leave it at that even after the tribunal had reported.  Instead, as the Taoiseach has indicated, they brought the matter before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges pursuant to a Resolution proposed by the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann on 26th November of last year.  The matter was discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on 4th December on the basis of a draft report from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  Part of that report is to the following effect:</P>
    <P>That the Committee on Procedure and Privileges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>having considered the report, <i>et cetera,</i><Col N="762" /> and here I resume the quotation</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;report to Dáil Éireann that Deputies Robert Molloy and Brendan Crinion were in grave breach of privilege in making allegations against the Minister for Local Government, Deputy James Tully, in Dáil Éireann on 23rd June, and 2nd July, 1975.</P>
    <P>To that draft report the Fianna Fáil members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges submitted a number of amendments.  Each in turn was defeated by the assured Coalition majority until finally the following amendment was put:</P>
    <P>To add the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>However, in view of the withdrawal of the allegations of the two Deputies on the 4th July, 1975, the Committee recommend to the House that no further action be taken in this case.</P>
    <P>Again, the Coalition majority defeated this, as I regard it, perfectly reasonable amendment.  I submit that the matter might then have been permitted to rest by any decent minded Government.  But no.  The Coalition were determined to exact the last pound of political flesh they could get out of this operation, and so we come to this motion now before Dáil Éireann almost eight months after the withdrawal and apology by the two Deputies concerned.  Apart from the vindictive intent behind the motion I believe that the motion is tabled to divert public attention from the serious economic difficulties this country now finds itself in and from the ineptitude of the Government in handling affairs of State.</P>

We do not propose to pursue an acrimonious debate on the motion.  We propose to show our disdain for the vindictive mentality behind it and for its diversionary purpose and for the waste of Dáil time that would be involved in debating it.  For these reasons we will oppose the motion but, more particularly, as I said at the outset, because <Col N="764" /> it is vindictive in its conception and its purpose, because it is mean and petty and totally unnecessary in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Before business was suspended, I had started to discuss amendments Nos. 1, 2, 7, 12 and 13 together.  I was explaining that the substantive amendments were Nos. 7 and 12 and the others were drafting amendments consequential on these two.  I was explaining that the main purpose of these amendments was to place illegitimate children in the same position as legitimate children and to remove anomalies that would have arisen by virtue of the Bill now before the House if these amendments were not made.  I explained to the House what amendment No. 7 dealt with and I also explained amendment No. 12.  I do not think there is anything further to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the increase of the weekly amount of the periodical payment suggested in my view it does not go far enough. An unmarried mother and child under the social welfare code can get more without going to court than the mother would if granted the maximum the court can award.  If the mother gets an award in court it can count as means against her in her claim for an unmarried mother's allowance.  Thus, the unmarried mother is not encouraged to bring her case to court.  In the short term this might be beneficial to her but surely legislation in this field should concern itself with the welfare of the child.  In the long term if the mother does not bring her case to court, she may be prejudicing the welfare of her child.  Where a mother does not bring an action, the right to bring an action should be reserved to the child when he is old enough to bring a case in his own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal aid is not provided in this Bill to encourage the unmarried mother to seek legal advice on her rights and the legal entitlements of herself and her child.  We are introducing here piecemeal legislation. Recently we signed a convention ensuring full legal rights of property for <Col N="767" /> illegitimate children and undertook to implement the provisions of that convention by domestic legislation.  I sincerely hope this will not turn out like the equal pay fiasco of recent times where in Europe we advocate one thing and when we have the opportunity of doing something at home, we shy away from it.</P>
    <P>There are many who cannot understand&mdash;and I am one of them&mdash;why this domestic legislation is not introduced in this Bill rather than delaying it.  There is no doubt that children of unmarried mothers are, and until our domestic laws implement this convention will be, regarded as second-class citizens.  I would like to see comprehensive legislation brought in to deal with, among other things, the abolition of the term &ldquo;illegitimate children&rdquo;, the provision of full property succession rights to the estates of their fathers and mothers and the legal requirements of corroboration required in court cases.  Provision should be made available for legal aid for mothers in their affiliation cases and the right of representation and legal aid to the children themselves in any legal proceedings affecting their rights.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us when it is proposed to introduce legislation to implement the terms of the international convention we recently signed.  I understand we are under obligation to notify the secretary general of the Council of Europe of the measures taken by us to implement this convention on the legal status of children born out of wedlock.  This Bill presented us with a golden opportunity to have the terms of the convention passed into our domestic law.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 2, I would ask the Minister&mdash;he will have the opportunity in the Seanad&mdash;to omit the word &ldquo;leaving&rdquo; on page 4, line 36.  It has been brought to my notice that there are situations where husbands and wives are living apart, but under the one roof.  This is known as the two household theory.  The inclusion of the word &ldquo;leaving&rdquo; might not deal with the people involved here.  This theory means that although the man and woman are living under the one roof <Col N="768" /> they live separate lives, buy their own food and sleep in separate parts of the house.  I understand this is constructive desertion.  Perhaps the Minister will see if he can do anything about that.</P>
    <P>I have already made the point that the increase in the periodical payment is £3.  I would ask the Minister to look at the situation I have just outlined, that is, that it might, in the short term, be beneficial for the mother not to go to court because she is better off under the social welfare code than the amount awarded to her in the court.</P>

Deputy Collins referred to the mother for whom the amount which the District <Col N="769" /> Court would be able to award would be too small, and my reply was that her remedy is to go to a higher court.  I am saying that the cost factor is not a consideration because costs will be given against the father.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 states:</P>
      <P>That part of a maintenance order which provides for the support of a dependent child shall stand discharged when the child ceases to be a dependent child of the family by reason of his attainment of the age of 16 years or 21 years, as the case may be, and shall be discharged by the Court, on application to it under subsection (1) of this section, if it is satisfied that the child has for any reason ceased to be a dependent child of the family.</P>

      <P>I can see problems, but I am thinking of a boy or girl <Col N="771" /> who would be within a year of completing university education and who would need the grant supplemented. Such a person might have to give up the studies at that time.  Can the Minister manage any discretion to cover this point?  I am not asking him to give the answer now, but he will have an opportunity to consider it between now and the Seanad debate. Section 12 deals with a statement of earnings and subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>In relation to an attachment of earnings order or an application for such an order, the Court that made the order or to which the application is made may, before or at the hearing or while the order is in force&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  order the maintenance debtor to give to the Court, within a specified period, a statement in writing signed by him of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the name and address of any person by whom earnings are paid to him,</P>
      <P>and so on.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the possibility of inserting in line 50, after the words, &ldquo;the attachment of earnings&rdquo;, words to the effect that a certificate of earnings be available.  This might help so I would ask the Minister to consider it for a later stage when the Bill is before the Seanad.  Perhaps I might deal briefly with amendment No. 13.</P>

      <P>This morning I had circulated by hand an amendment regarding the tracing of an employee or a maintenance debtor by means of his Department of Social Welfare insurance <Col N="772" /> number but we can talk about this later.  The Chair has been very lenient with me so far.  Perhaps, when the Bill is before the Seanad, when it is being discussed line by line, the Minister will consider the points I have made.  I am sincere in my belief that the amendments I have suggested would help to give us better legislation, something we all wish for in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Collins, I was surprised to note the number of amendments tabled by the Minister for Report Stage.  However, it was a pleasant surprise because by putting forward these amendments, the Minister concedes that at least many of the points made by Fianna Fáil members on the special committee were valid.  Some of the amendments are identifiable easily and relate to the opinions expressed by Deputies Haughey and Collins and myself on the special committee.</P>
      <P>There is one point in relation to amendment No. 3 which I should like to have clarified.  The amendment reads that the order shall stand discharged when:</P>
      <P>the child ceases to be a dependent child of the family by reason of his attainment of the age of sixteen years or twenty-one years, as the case may...</P>
      <P>Are persons of 17, 18, 19 and 20 years included in this or am I in error in saying that the amendment would appear to apply only to the ages of 16 and 21?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister commenced his observations on the amendments immediately after the division I was unable to hear him because of the noise in the Chamber but it appears that in the context of this Bill the distinction between legitimacy and illegitimacy has been abandoned.  As one who, by way of the procedures of his House, has been endeavouring to bring an end to that distinction for the purposes of the Succession Act, it appears that my hopes may be realised in the not too distant future since there is a flicker of light in this Bill in this regard.  However, if the Minister were to abandon the use of the <Col N="773" /> words &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; what words would he substitute for them?  We are told now that we must not use the words &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; or &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo; but &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;. Perhaps in some such way the Minister might deal too with substitute words for legitimate and illegitimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised.  Deputy Collins was critical of the measure.  He described it as piecemeal and as legislation which does not deal with the succession rights of illegitimates.  This is not a Succession Bill.  It is a maintenance Bill and that is all it purports to be. The scope for reform in this whole area of the family is immense because it is an area which has been neglected, not for the past three years, but for the past number of decades.  If everything were to be dealt with in one Bill we would need a massive piece of legislation and the bigger and more complex is a piece of legislation, the more time-consuming is its preparation and processing through the House.</P>
      <P>I was faced with the decision as to whether to proceed with legislation in a staged manner and that is what I decided on.  This Bill, I hope, is the first of a series of reform measures in the law relating to the family.  I would take issue with Deputy Collins when he describes the Bill as piecemeal. Such a description has a disparaging ring.  The Bill proposes substantial changes in our substantive and procedural law regarding families and the exercise of their rights through the courts.  Therefore, it is a major piece of reform and I reject the allegation that somehow it does not contain enough.  The whole area of family law has been neglected badly for too long.  It requires a lot of reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That allegation comes badly from anybody on the other side of the House.  I have no wish to say this bluntly but now that the Deputy has raised the question I can say that there was not a shred of interest taken by the previous Government in this field.  Not only was that the position when they were in Government but since they have gone into Opposition they have not produced any policy in this area despite the fact that they do not have an obligation to produce a statute and that a broad statement of policy would suffice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get back to the amendments, but since the point was raised I had to deal with it.  The record speaks for itself.  This is a substantial piece of reform which is capable of standing on its own.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Andrews knows, the question of succession rights for the illegitimate is a large problem and raises many legal and social questions that will require the most careful thought and analysis in a cool manner and with an absence of any emotive approach.  This Bill, however, abolishes the distinction between legitimates and illegitimates in regard to the question of maintenance.  It goes no further than that.  Regarding the use of those words I suppose before we could change them we would have to change the English language.  No doubt, though, in time to come we will find some bland euphemism that will describe the reality.  That is a feature of modern life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Education will oblige.  He has tried to change our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Only the undue emphasis on the bloodier parts of it. Deputy Collins was worried about the position of the mother of the illegitimate in receipt of social welfare payments because they were larger than what she could get under the Act for her child and that the Act was really of no benefit to her.  There is no limit <Col N="775" /> to what is provided for in the Act.  If the putative father's means are without limit or very large, the £10 limit mentioned in the Act does not apply because there is, technically speaking, no limit to the amount which may be awarded against a putative father, if the proceedings are taken in a court other than the District Court.  If they are taken in the District Court because of the constitutional requirement to prescribe the jurisdiction of that court in the statute, the limit is £10, but if that limit is inadequate in the circumstances of that particular case, there is no restriction that keeps the parties in that court.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that it is not a real remedy, that, until there is a legal aid remedy, the remedy is not available to go in the higher court. There is a certain merit in that and again this Government have taken an initiative in an area which has been neglected up to now.  We have taken the initiative in the matter of a scheme of legal aid in civil cases and I hope that when the committee which is considering this question reports, we will in due course be able to implement a scheme.  However, as I pointed out, if the particular case is one where the means of the father require that proceedings should be taken in the High Court, quite obviously there will be no difficulty in the way of the mother going to the High Court. The costs will be awarded against the father and neither she nor her legal advisers will be prejudiced by having to go to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins was worried in regard to amendment No. 3 which ends dependency at 21 years and does not cater for a person who is in receipt of full-time education but over that age.  I referred to this point on second Stage.  I felt that there had to be a cut-off point, that one could not provide for it after 21 years, and that it would be unreal to have dependency after 21.  A person of 21 years is mature.  Let us assume that he is still a full-time student and is to some extent dependent on other sources for his livelihood. At that stage having regard to the other sources that are <Col N="776" /> now available to a student, grants and special bank loans and also the opportunity for summer earnings, which is a new feature of student life nowadays. I cannot envisage a situation where a person who has reached the age of 21 would be deprived of the opportunity to finish his education.  I think that having the right to maintain after 21 would involve the courts in interfering unduly in the affairs of parties all of whom are adults.  That in my view would be wrong.  The age of 21 is the proper age and, if one has regard to the fact that the age of majority is likely to come down to 18 years in all cases, the age proposed in the Bill is reasonable and I would not propose to make any change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews asked what happens to the person between the age of 16 and 21.  There are two types of dependency in the Bill.  Dependency normally ends at the age of 16, unless a person is in receipt of full-time education, when the dependency ends at 21.  Thus a person of 17, 18, 19 and 20 is a dependant, if that person is in receipt of full-time education. There is not a gap or error in the drafting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would apprenticeship be regarded as a full-time education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  It has to be full-time education or instruction. It would depend on the particular apprenticeship.  Some apprenticeships are working apprenticeships where the person is in receipt of a wage.  In that instance, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The other type of apprenticeship, for example, the old type of solicitor's apprenticeship where there was a legal barrier to the apprentices being paid, clearly would be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I must say that I deprecate the note of triumphalism in Deputy Andrews' introductory remarks when he stated that he was surprised by all the amendments.  I indicated during the Committee Stage debate in the Seanad that I would consider certain matters.  There were valid points made in the course of that debate and they were no less valid because they were <Col N="777" /> made by the other side.  I would not for one moment attempt to take away from Deputy Andrews credit for certain of these amendments.  Furthermore, other points raised during the debate have suggested additional amendments to me and these also appear on the amendment sheet.  I think all the amendments will improve the Bill, and particularly the amendment with regard to placing the illegitimate and the legitimate child on the same footing with regard to maintenance. This Bill, is, as I have said, not a Succession Bill.</P>

    <P>I practically made the case for this amendment earlier.  It is basically an amendment to help to track down people and get them to fulfil their responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of clarification, I gather that what the Deputy has in mind is the position that ensues after the original order is made, not the question of finding the first employer but of keeping tabs on future employers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Afterwards&mdash;that is basically it.  I believe it would help and it is because I believe it would help that I put down the amendment. If the Minister feels he would need more time to look at it, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment and then the Minister can do something about it in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if I could even undertake to do anything about it in the Seanad because what is proposed here would be quite radical, that is making the Department of Social Welfare an investigative agency in this area and giving them a role which they have not presently got.  It would not be proper for me to attempt to introduce that role into legislation without the fullest consultation with my colleagues and there might be technical reasons which would not be immediately apparent to me but which would be drawn to my attention by my colleagues in other Departments.  I appreciate that much of the efficacy of this Bill depends on being able to keep in touch with employees but the hard reality is that if a defaulter wants to go underground there is no mechanism which can guarantee that tabs be kept on him.  The difficulties of keeping in touch with a defaulter of this type and pursuing him effectively would probably make the whole exercise quite pointless.  This Bill is most likely to be successful in dealing with the person who is in <Col N="779" /> steady employment, who is not going to keep changing his employment and who is not living up to his responsibilities.  The hard reprobate who has no consideration whatever for his responsibilities and is prepared to use every means possible to avoid them would probably still be able to do so successfully.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Collins, and we made common case of this during the debate in Special Committee.  Some procedure for keeping tabs on the defaulting spouse would be useful but I do not know whether the Department of Social Welfare would be the proper authority.  The suggestion was made in Special Committee that the Revenue Commissioners might have records that would be useful.  However, we would be asking bodies such as the Commissioners to take on roles that traditionally are not theirs.  These roles would have a certain investigative content and would carry with that a certain punitive concept as far as the debtor was concerned. These authorities might not be prepared to carry out such a role. Regretfully, I could not undertake that in this Bill I will have anything on the lines suggested by Deputy Collins, but that is not to say that it is a closed subject.  It is a subject that can be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand why the Minister cannot give any guarantee now.  I appreciate that if a defaulter wanted to go underground he could do so and would not be traced easily.  The idea behind the amendment was that if the social welfare insurance number of the person was known a simple inquiry to the Department of Social Welfare would establish if such a person was working. Normally a person has just one social welfare number and it is extremely difficult to get a second number. Now that we have agreement with the Department of Social Welfare in Britain it might be helpful to have the provision I suggested.  I appreciate the point made by the Minister, that the Department of Social Welfare might not wish to become an investigatory body, but there is a pretty <Col N="780" /> lively investigatory team in that Department. The Minister mentioned the possibility of enlisting the aid of the Revenue Commissioners.  Any help would be welcome.  I withdraw the amendment because I believe there is agreement, in principle, between the Minister and Members on this side that every loophole should be closed. If, when the Bill becomes an Act, loopholes appear the Minister will be facilitated by us in any way necessary.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 28, before &ldquo;Where&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Without prejudice to the law as to contempt of court,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the section providing for the barring of the spouse from his home.  Section 21 introduces this new principle of empowering the district court in cases of emergency for the safety or welfare of the spouse or a dependent child to order the other spouse to leave the family home.  If such power is to be meaningful it must have effective sanction to enforce it.  The amendment is designed to make it clear that in cases where under the section a spouse is in contempt of court by breaking an order excluding him from the home, the criminal sanction provided for in the section will be supplemented by the power of the court to commit for contempt.</P>

    <P>During the debate in Special Committee there was mention that the way to provide effective sanction was to give a power of arrest without warrant. While that would deal with the immediate problem of removing the defending spouse, it would not be the answer because the person arrested would be entitled to be released on bail.  Under the law as it now stands it would be difficult to see how he could in most cases be refused bail. While on bail he might come back and molest his family and household again. A more effective way is to make it plain that the present law regarding contempt relating to court orders applies to any exclusion order under this section.  We will have to wait and <Col N="781" /> see how the section works out in practice, see if it is effective and if the sanction provided is working effectively.  The sanction of contempt of court is more effective than the power of arrest without warrant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I found this amendment puzzling in view of the fact that the District Court, which would by necessity hear most of the applications and make most of the orders, has no power of attachment for contempt of court unless the contempt is committed in the face of the court during the hearing.  The High Court has power to commit for non-compliance with its order.  I have difficulty in seeing the necessity for the insertion of the amendment.  Is it contemplated to give wider powers with regard to contempt of court to the District Court?  Will the District Court have wider powers as a result of this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment does not affect the law relating to contempt of the District Court.  The contempt has to be committed in the face of that court, and that is a matter on which there might possibly be room for argument. It would be a matter for a district justice to decide in the first instance.  The amendment does not interfere with the present law as to contempt.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point in Special Committee that he may have to consider an amendment in relation to the situation where there is an appeal from a decision of the District Court where the husband&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further amendment dealing specifically with that point.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 15, after line 15, subsection (5), to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) An appeal from an order under this section shall, if the court that made the order or the court to <Col N="782" /> which the appeal is brought so determines, but not otherwise, stay the proceeding upon the order upon such terms (if any) as may be imposed by the court making the determination&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This deals with the point raised by Deputy Andrews.  The amendment is designed to give added protection to the family of the spouse against whom an exclusion order has been made.  As a general rule a person against whom any order has been made by the District Court may, by lodging an appeal, stay that order and thereby suspend its effectiveness until the outcome of the appeal.  Such a ruling is fair in the normal run of cases but in the case of exclusion orders it might place the wife and children of a violent husband in some peril pending the outcome of the appeal.  The amendment proposes to remove this absolute entitlement to have an order stayed simply by lodging an appeal.  It provides instead that proceedings under the order can only be stayed by a court order on such terms as either the court which makes the order or the court to which appeal is brought may specify.  We can reasonably assume that there might be some cases where it would be appropriate to have the order stayed; they are covered in the section.  So, we reverse the normal position by providing that, unless the court says otherwise, the order will not be stayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been made to me that this amendment seems to take the teeth, as it were, out of the whole legislation.  I will put the case to the Minister as it was put to me.  It is believed that any spouse barred from the family home may defeat the purpose of the section by appealing.  At the moment I understand it may take anything up to two years, particularly in Dublin, for an appeal to be heard from the District Court in the High Court and this being so, any spouse may buy time, as it were, by appealing and could then withdraw the appeal at any time.  I am thinking especially of women and children who are terrorised by a violent husband and father.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The evil that was sought to be cured would not be thereby cured.  The appeal will not suspend the court order excluding the spouse. Under the present system the excluded spouse would be entitled to go back in because the order excluding him would be suspended during the appeal.  This amendment is designed to ensure that the contrary happens in the case of exclusion orders.  The exclusion order will remain in force pending the hearing of the appeal, unless the court orders otherwise.  In other words, if the amendment is accepted and passed and the Bill becomes law, if a District Court makes an exclusion order the husband will stay excluded until the appeal is heard and determined.  He may say to the court that his exclusion is grossly unfair because of this circumstance or that circumstance.  Then the District Court which made the order or the Circuit Court might say: &ldquo;Very well.  There are exceptional circumstances. We will let you go back in until the whole matter is thrashed out on appeal.&rdquo; What the amendment aims to do is to ensure that pending appeal the husband will be kept out. In other words, we propose to give the District Court order continued <Col N="784" /> validity notwithstanding the existence of an appeal.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;An agreement shall be void in so far as it would have the effect of excluding or limiting the operation of any provision of this Act (other than section 20).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is to make it absolutely clear&mdash;I think it is already clear &mdash;that it will not be possible to argue that an agreement relating to maintenance&mdash;that would be a private contract&mdash;either in its express terms or by virtue of the fact that it has been made makes it impossible for a spouse to apply for maintenance under section 4 or for any of the consequential remedies such as attachment.  In other words, it is to make it clear that it will not be possible to contract out, so to speak of the consequences of the Act.</P>
      <P>During the special committee debate&mdash;I am referring specially now to the part of the debate dealing with proposed amendments to section 7&mdash;it was envisaged that a spouse would have the right to apply to the court in such a case and the draft of the section as it stands confirms this.</P>

      <P>This amendment extends the period that the Bill proposes for taking affiliation proceedings from two years to three years.  At the moment there is a period of six months and in the Bill as drafted that period was extended to two years.  There were varying views in the special committee.  Some Deputies thought that even two years was too long and some Deputies were doubtful about six months, as to whether even that was too long.  Other Deputies thought there should be no time limit at all.  As I said, it is essentially a subjective matter, one's instinctive feeling as to what is right and appropriate.  My own feeling was for two years but, as I am a person inclined to have an open mind on things, I had an open mind on this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that in some way we were being <Col N="787" /> triumphant about the fact that he brought in amendments.  The Minister cannot distinguish between being triumphant and a certain pleasure arising out of amendments which arose in the special committee and which have been accepted by the Minister and which he has brought in on Report Stage.  The work put into the special committee by the Fianna Fáil Party, led by Deputy Collins, and the amendments put forward by them have borne fruit.  That is not being triumphant.  There is no great merit to be gained by anyone out of the Bill we are discussing which deals with a social evil which we want to purge from our society.  There is no great merit attached to any party or group for doing what should have been done over the past few years.</P>

Section 8 proposes that in the ordinary way payments will be transmitted to the district court clerk to be passed to the wife and that he will take proceedings for payments that fall into arrears.  The amendment proposes that a similar practice should apply in the case of affiliation orders.  This is in line with general policy to ensure that the regime available under the Bill will be available for both legitimate and illegitimate children.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 9 is a drafting amendment consequential on the extension of the services of the District Court clerk under section 8 of the <Col N="789" /> Bill to affiliation as well as to maintenance proceedings.

      <P>This amendment is particularly long.  Is the Minister in a position to give us a precis of it? Perhaps he would elaborate a little more on the amendment for the benefit of the lay person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment provides for substituting two new sections in the 1930 Act which will be known as section 4 and section 4A.  It is a long amendment and its length demonstrates the difficulties of amending the 1930 Act.  Ideally that Act should be drafted <i>de nova</i> but that would delay the present Bill.  This procedure has been arrived at, that we provide for two new sections in the 1930 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives practical effect to the raising of the age of dependency in amendment No. 7.  Placing the illegitimate child in the same position as the legitimate child means that the illegitimate child has to go back in some respects to the position of the <Col N="794" /> legitimate child.  We want both of them to be on the same plane.  There were certain advantages which are removed in the process of providing equality of maintenance rights between them.  For example, under the 1930 Act there is a rule that an affiliation order would, unless discharged, automatically continue until the child reached 16 years.  That is being changed now.  The amendment provides that an affiliation order, like a maintenance order, will continue until the court discharges it.  That is bringing the position of the illegitimate child into line with that of the legitimate child.</P>
    <P>As a corollary to that change, the court must be given power to reactivate an affiliation order that has been discharged, if the circumstances change.  The same is being provided with respect to maintenance orders. This amendment applies equally to persons whether the affiliation order was made before or after this Bill becomes law.  One can envisage the case where an affiliation order made before this Bill becomes law could have been discharged and in a year's time, when the circumstances change, could be reactivated.</P>
    <P>Another change that is being made in order to bring the position of both types of children in line with each other is that in the amendment of section 4 (1) of the 1930 Act, which provides that sums payable under an affiliation order should commence not earlier than 12 months before and not later than 12 months after the making of the affiliation order.  To ensure that affiliation proceedings and maintenance proceedings will be on all fours, it is proposed that the order will commence not earlier than the time the order is made.  In other words, the position will be the same as between the two types of children.</P>
    <P>The change is in any event necessary because the attachment of earnings procedure requires it.</P>
    <P>A further aspect is that the new section, section 4A, introduced by the amendment, imposes on the parents of an illegitimate child an enforceable obligation to maintain the child over and above the present obligations.  In <Col N="795" /> effect it will impose a similar liability on such parents as is imposed on spouses by section 4 (1), paragraph (b)  of the Bill where spouses are not living together or where one spouse is dead.  If we did not have such a provision the mother of an illegitimate child would be in a different position from that of the mother of a legitimate child because she would have a mainly theoretical obligation to maintain her child.  Where the mother has obtained an affiliation order, no third party will be permitted to take proceedings under this provision unless the father is not discharging his obligations under the affiliation order and the court considers it proper to allow the proceedings.  An example would be where a mother had obtained an affiliation order against the father, the father was failing to pay and the mother had lost interest in or possibly deserted her child.  Here the court could award maintenance to the child on the application of an interested third party.</P>

      <P>There is that risk, but it can be cured and dealt with by the court.  I think our major concern must be the benefit that would accrue to a child who would be in effect defenceless and have no help at all. What we are dealing with is the situation where there is only one parent, a single mother or a deserted mother, who has lost interest in the child.  Unless you give society in the form of the interested neighbour the right to intervene, it is hard to see what other agency could better come along and intervene.  One would expect <Col N="796" /> that the interested neighbour would be the person most likely and soonest to know of the failure to maintain. This whole amendment continues the general policy of putting the two types of children on the same footing.</P>

I indicated that certain discussions have to take place with the law officers to ensure that the procedural arrangements will be in hand when the Bill comes into operation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I indicated the serious threat to our national herd as a result of this dispute between the Minister and the Irish Veterinary Union.  I drew attention to the decline in the national herd in recent times due to the large-scale slaughter of cows and also the export of calves to the Continent.  I indicated also the very real threat to our cattle exports to Britain, amounting to £105 million per annum, as a result of this dispute.  I am convinced that the Minister is not concerned about the eradication of animal disease since he has allowed the TB testing, which was not connected in any way with this dispute, to come to a standstill.  The vets were prepared to carry on this testing but the Minister would not allow them to do so.  In recent months there has been an increase of 100 per cent in lesions found at <i>post mortem</i> examinations in the factories.  On examination it has been found that all these lesions are new which shows that the infection is of recent origin and can be attributed to the fact that the carrying out of the necessary testing has been suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These facts are well-known to the Minister and to his Department but they are not being published.  They are being kept in the little black book in the Department because there would be a national outcry if the general public realised the seriousness of the situation. In the west we have a seasonal influx of young calves from the south at this time of year.  This will be a <Col N="802" /> further hazard and will cause a further spreading of disease to our herds.  At present there are sufficient vets in the country to deal with disease eradication in the areas designated for clearance without the assistance of lay technicians.  If the Government decide to make an attack on disease in the remaining part of the country and if it is found then that the vets are not capable of dealing with the problem I am quite sure that the vets would agree with the employment in some capacity of lay technicians.  When we reach that stage there can be negotiations, but at present I believe we are a long way from that goal.  We must remember that if the volume of Department work for the vets is cut down it will result in the closure of many practices because vets would not have a sufficient workload to keep them going.  This would mean that vets would have to travel longer distances to answer calls and they would have to charge a higher fee for doing so.  This fee will have to be paid by the farmer.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago when electioneering in the Mayo by-election I was told of a case in Belmullet where a vet was forced to leave and join the Department due to a shortage of Department work.  He could not survive in the practice that was available to him. The people from that area have to travel 40 miles to Wesport and Ballina in order to get a vet to treat their cattle and this, I submit, is something that can happen in other areas if it is not possible for the vet to survive in his practice.  It is not fair to farmers, who are the people we are concerned about. There are people who at present have to pay for the testing of their cattle before they offer them for sale.</P>
    <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary telling the House yesterday of the great times farmers were having.  We hear this when the farmers for one reason or another happen to be getting a good price for their stock.  For the past two years farmers have had to sell their stock at sacrifice prices.  We have a responsibility to see that our national herd is maintained at full strength.  A serious decline has taken place in our national herd in recent times.  I hope we will see the end of this dispute <Col N="803" /> before too long.  It is the Minister's responsibility and the whole country is waiting for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has bent over backwards to meet the veterinary people.  We now have the Animal Health Council on which they have representation under an independent chairman.  They should give the Minister's plan a trial.  It is only for three years and if it is not seen to work it can be scrapped.  The plan has been given a trial elsewhere and we should determine whether it can be equally successful here.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious matter for the farmers because if there is a breakdown in livestock sales we could have a repeat of 1974.  I do not think the Minister can be expected to retreat further.  He has the full support of the farming organisations and they are the people who have been sitting in on this dispute day after day.  They went into it with an open mind, like I am doing, and they have decided the Minister has gone as far as he can and that it is now up to the vets to give the scheme the trial period suggested.  The talk about redundancies in the profession is wildly exaggerated.  There will be redundancies in farming if those people do not toe the line.  After all, they are a professional body who should be acting a little more responsibly.  They have been given five representatives on the Animal Health Council, like the farmers, and what we are looking for is harmony between the two groups.  Both are mainly concerned with one thing, the eradication of this terrible disease so that we will be able to take our rightful place in all the European markets.  That is what the Minister's plan is about and I appeal to the vets to act responsibly and to give it a trial.  As I have said, it is only for a matter of three years.</P>

This year and last year very little has been done and if this dispute is not settled all the good work of the past 20 years will go by the board and we will be back where we started.  That is a sad thing to say. We have a deadline to be rid of brucellosis by 1978 and if we fail in this regard it is obvious that our exports will be hit.</P>
      <P>The motion condemns the failure of the Minister to secure a settlement of the vets' dispute which has brought to a standstill the bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis schemes.  It is of vital importance that these schemes be recommenced immediately.  When changes are proposed discussion should take place between the parties concerned.  One can draw a parallel between the vets' dispute and the dispute within CIE regarding one-man buses.  In the latter case the Department concerned have not forced into operation the scheme which was envisaged whereas the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have endeavoured to force through their proposals. CIE are discussing with the unions involved how best the change should be brought about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that the Minister could have taken a line from CIE.  The buses continue to run while the testing of cattle has stopped.  There is a big difference in the type of action taken in regard to CIE compared with the attitude adopted by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Because of his failure to reach agreement with the veterinary union the Minister has brought about a situation in which the farmers are at a loss to know what is the position.  We know that as a result of all this the State has been saved millions of pounds but farmers must foot the bill for tests carried out on their cattle during the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> Is the Minister aware that another result of this dispute is the nonpayment of various grants whether they be in respect of handicapped areas, of the beef incentive scheme or any other.  This situation has arisen in cases where the owner of a farm has died or has transferred the holding to a son.  Because no testing of herds had taken place in the name of the previous owner, the grants are not being paid.  In such cases the Department have been writing to those who applied for grants telling them of this situation.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession are rendering an excellent service.  Last evening, though, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister tried to say that only a few blackguards were holding up the scheme and that these should be prosecuted.  This is a very cheap effort on the part of the Department to endeavour to belittle the profession.  For many years farmers and vets have worked side by side.  Any vets I know are reasonable people.  In order to qualify a very high standard of education is required and, apart from this, there is control regarding the number who are accepted into the faculty.  Therefore, many people who would like to become vets do not find it possible to embark on the relevant course of study.  As I see the present position, the union concerned are taking action for the purposes of safeguarding their future.  Many vets earn very little money for some time after qualifying.  In those early stages they generally work for somebody who already has a practice established. The Minister should bear in mind that some of these younger people may have no income for some part of the year.</P>
    <P>The union have stated unequivocally that if they can be sure of full employment for their members they have no objection to being helped by lay people.  At Kinsale in 1973 the Minister guaranteed the profession that they would be employed fully in their work for the next five years, that is, up to 1978.  Can the Minister give that guarantee today?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he guaranteeing that there will be no unemployment as a result of lay people being engaged to carry out certain duties?  In today's edition of <i>The Irish Press</i> the IVU are reported as stating:</P>
      <P>We have consistently pointed out that should the Department increase the tempo of the eradication schemes to the extent that a greater number of personnel is required than is available in the veterinary profession, we will be quite prepared to work out how additional para-veterinary personnel can be incorporated to expedite disease eradication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister any comment to make on that statement?  The union have told him that a substantial amount of money is necessary in respect of the scheme which is in dispute. It is very urgent from the point of view of our cattle and the whole meat processing industry that we tackle on a much larger scale and more efficiently the whole area of animal disease eradication.  The veterinary union have said that when the necessary injection of capital has been put into this work they will not have the personnel necessary to operate the scheme fully and that at that stage they will be prepared to discuss with the Minister the question of arranging for the engaging of para-veterinary personnel or, if you like, lay people.  There are many tasks in relation to the testing of cattle that can be undertaken by lay personnel.  What was the cause of this stoppage in the first place?  Who decided on a change? Deputy Hussey has told us of the abnormal increase in the number of lesions found during post-mortems on cattle.  Even at this late stage we must urge the Minister to bring together again all the parties involved in the dispute. It is all right for Deputy Hegarty to say &ldquo;stand behind the farming organisations, they are now on the Minister's side&rdquo;. That may be so but can these organisations bring pressure to bear on the veterinary union?  The livestock trade has spoken tonight in favour of the IVU.  Can we expect a situation in which the various organisations involved in the <Col N="807" /> agricultural industry will be fighting among each other while the vet who is at the bottom rung of the ladder will suffer most?  The farming organisations have a big role to play.  Last night we were told by the Parliamentary Secretary that their association were called in to help in the situation. However, my understanding is that they offered their services but their offer was not availed of.  I should like to know what is the position.</P>
    <P>As an ordinary farmer I would say that all farming organisations were wrong when they decided to put their men at the helm in semi-State bodies because, then, they were depending for their positions and for personal gain on the Minister of the day.  We all remember a period in 1974 when cattle were being sold for almost nothing, when there was no one to speak up for the small or the transitional farmer and when no one but this party pointed to the plight of the farmers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the vets, at least the stronger ones, will be able to overcome the effects of this dispute but the farmers will suffer as a result of it. We all know that when a few vets join together in the operation of one big business, they can earn huge incomes but we must not forget the young man starting off in the profession. He is the one for whom I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Is there anything wrong in starting all over again with the scheme, in giving it even a one-month trial?  Let them all come together because if this is to go on and on, it will get worse. There is no good in everybody on the Government side saying: &ldquo;They have the gun to our heads&rdquo;.  Every day one reads the papers one finds that somebody has the gun to the head of the Government, from the way they are talking.  I never heard so much crying in my life; we have nothing but the word &ldquo;gun&rdquo;.  We seem to be gone mad discussing the gun in this country and we have it now even on a discussion on the eradication of disease. The Parliamentary Secretary said that numerous times last night and he said that lay people were taking blood samples in the various hospitals.  I understand that these lay people have <Col N="808" /> to have qualifications and must be well qualified for this work.  I am surprised at him making that statement because these people cannot really be considered as lay people at all.  No parallel can be drawn between the two situations.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to accept responsibility for what is happening in agriculture.  I suppose it is hard to find agreement when you have a Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary with two different approaches to agriculture. One of them campaigned very hard for our joining the EEC and the other opposed it very strenuously. They do not seem to be of one mind at all.  They have two different outlooks and there is no good in a person who opposed something saying that he accepts majority rule.  He will still have his first thoughts at the back of his head.</P>
    <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary saying how satisfied the farming community were.  Coming down to earth and meeting the people is a great thing and I can tell the Minister that there is a grave unrest at all levels. One has only to look at a document published recently, &ldquo;The Cork Marts Newsletter&rdquo; which states that even in two years' time, with the breeding stock gone, we will have 270,000 fewer animals available as finished beef.  Is that not a terrible situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot have them and sell them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You can have them and sell them and keep them in this country, but the cattle are gone and there were never more orphan weanlings before.  Their mothers are dead and gone because there was no policy to enable the farmers to keep them. Never in the history of the country were there so many thousands of weanling cattle and the young cows are gone to the canning factories and sold off.  They are not there to produce this year.  It is our duty to build up the herd and let us not say that we have too many, to go out and get markets, but help when there is a tough period.  No help was given last year and there will be unemployment in the meat processing trade this <Col N="809" /> year and there will be more of it if this dispute is not settled rapidly and fairly.</P>
      <P>The Minister is seeking to put it across that he is saving the country all this money and the Parliamentary Secretary said that £93 million was spent and was not well spent, as he said, on disease eradication.  There is one group of people who did not get too much, the people who had to sell the reactors, whatever kind they were. Those of us who know the rural areas know that the limit put on them was very low and is still low, in relation to the price of cattle and what you have to go if you are buying for replacements. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary did not mean that the people who had reactors were over-paid.  I can assure him that they were not and that they find it very hard to carry on, having reactors this year, maybe four or five more next year and a few more the following year.  The buck has to stop somewhere and it really stops with the Minister who fails to send out the work to the vets.  He promised them in 1973 full involvement for the next five years.  Does he say tonight that every vet has full employment until the end of 1978 at least?  The vets have said that if that be the case, they will discuss with the Minister the people who are to be employed if the workload is too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a big injection of money to create that situation and the Minister knows that as well as I do. It requires a lot of money but it is money which will pay off very well. We are spending money less wisely in other areas and the Minister should state what he is going to spend within the next two or three years.  There is only one way out of the situation, that is, to provide the huge input of finance which is so necessary.  This is 1976 and will we get an extension of the deadline in 1978 to export our cattle?  There is a grave doubt about that.  The British farmers' union are kicking at the moment and they kick on the least pretext.  They say that they are able to prove that our cattle are not disease-free going into England. All that has to go back to the Department and the Minister, as the <Col N="810" /> head, will have to accept responsibility. There is no use in his saying that he has the organisations with him. Let him go down the country and he will find out that many of them are against him and do not believe in these ideas at all.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said last night that the farming organisations were invited in by the Minister but it is very hard for people who are invited in, who are appointed to semi-State boards, to stand up to the Minister.  I think these organisations made a mistake and went completely wrong.  They were very quiet during the winter of 1974 and the spring of 1975 when if you took a cart and trailer into a mart, having sold your own calves, coming out it would be full of calves which your neighbour had been unable to sell.  They were giving them away.  The farming organisations were silent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Now when they are selling them, you are quarrelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister made no provision for the small farmer to carry the cattle.  The Italians codded him in Europe.  They are codding those in the Labour Party who were against joining the EEC.  Thousands of cattle have gone off and they are now saying what they will make in two years' time.  Why could help not be given to our people?  Who said the farmers are well-off?  Who is controlling the price of fertiliser and the price of feedstuffs?  The Minister has said that the farming organisations asked that these be controlled and the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it as well.  Rock sulphate at the moment has dropped greatly in price but there is no guarantee that it will get down to the Irish farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This dispute is at a very dangerous stage when various organisations are getting clung into each other and the good relations which existed between those involved in the cattle trade, the farmers and the vets, are now being jeopardised.  It is a bad thing that farming organisations should tell their members to go against the veterinary profession.  They should, in my opinion, act as mediators.  I appreciate that <Col N="811" /> every Minister wants a mediator to help and there is no harm in having one, but in this case their position was weakened, due to the jobs which some of them had accepted from semi-State bodies.  It is very hard to talk up to a man when he is putting the thumb down in those circumstances.  Let the Minister come to the point.  There is not much between the veterinary profession and himself.  He promised them full employment and they say that if the Minister gives the injection of money, they are willing to consider other people outside the ranks of qualified vets for the running of this scheme, but until that is done, the responsibility lies with the Minister.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to answer questions raised by Deputies Hussey and Meaney this evening.  Deputy Hussey said the vets were prepared to carry on TB testing but were not allowed do so.  This was also stated by Deputy Gibbons yesterday.  That is far from true.  The vets said that if I did not give up the idea of introducing lay technicians they would withdraw from all State work.  In fact, they withdrew from all State work for three weeks before I brought anybody in. They did so because I said it was my intention to bring in lay technicians. He also said that TB lesions were an indication of new disease but that is not a correct statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that our disease levels are well below the acceptable limits in the EEC.  Some of the statements made last night, and tonight, could do immeasurable harm to our exports and that is why I want to make my statement.  I was interested to hear that the Mayo vet was forced to join the Department.  I can assure the House that we have no trouble in getting people to join the Department now.  They are pleased to undertake the Department's work.  There is the great fear being spread around that if we do not accede to all the requests there will be a great shortage of vets. This was tried on in the Mayo by-election where all this thrash was put through the letter boxes but it did not <Col N="812" /> work.  It was also stated that all testing ceased last year.  The fact is that 100,000 diseased cattle were removed last year in the course of testing.</P>
    <P>It has been impressed upon us that we should provide lots of money for disease eradication.  I agree this is extremely important but I should like to remind Deputies, particularly those who have not looked at the Book of Estimates, that we provided this year £17.8 million for brucellosis and TB eradication.  In the last year Deputy Gibbons was Minister £7.2 million was provided and that gives an indication of the way we are thinking about disease eradication.  It was also stated that I promised the vets in Kinsale in 1973 full involvement.  I still promise them full involvement but there is a difference between full involvement and guaranteeing any profession full employment.  I remember a few years ago looking at the situation in relation to doctors when we were exporting 66 per cent of them.  There is no profession where there is absolutely full employment.</P>

      <P>The statement by the Parliamentary Secretary last night that I invited the farming organisations in has been questioned.  I am sorry it has been questioned because when a Parliamentary Secretary makes a statement it should be accepted.  I invited them in and I should like to avail of the opportunity to thank the leaders of the two farming organisations for the immense effort and time they devoted to helping me find a settlement.  I am glad to say that they are fully behind me and I am extremely grateful for that help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The size of the herd, something which has no bearing on the matter at all, has been brought up again. I should like to state that there are more cattle here now than there were when Fianna Fáil left Government and the figures prove that.  According to the Central Statistics Office, between June and January we disposed of no fewer than one million cattle. One cannot have the money in one's <Col N="813" /> pocket and the cattle on one's farm at the same time.</P>

      <P>During the period of this dispute Deputy Gibbons, and the other Members of the Opposition, acted responsibly and I wish to acknowledge that.  The matter was raised periodically at Question Time and my replies were understood and accepted.  However, the timing of this motion is most unfortunate and badly chosen.  Jumping on the band wagon at a time like this can do our exports immense damage.  If the motion was designed for that purpose it could not be better timed.  The references yesterday to disease-laden calves were deplorable.  The fact that they were made by an ex-Minister for Agriculture makes them all the more deplorable.  He must know that this is untrue.  He knows that the Italians were extremely pleased to get 130,000 of our calves last year.  He is also aware that they operate the strictest health control on their calf improts. These calves in the main were from the South of Ireland.  It is easy to attribute this sort of statement to some other organisation and it was <Col N="814" /> in that context that the statement was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good reason for that.  The veterinary profession of whom the Deputy has spoken so highly stated on many occasions that calves under six months are no disease danger.  Deputy Gibbons has a hard neck to talk about disease levels.  One would think he was never Minister for Agriculture and that Fianna Fáil were never in power.  Fianna Fáil were in power for 35 years and in the early 1930s they were being exhorted by the veterinary profession to start eradicating disease but we had to wait until former Deputy James Dillon started to eradicate TB.  To criticise me in view of all this for trying to find a more efficient and economic way of eradicating disease beats the band.  All I can say is that Deputy Gibbons would try anything when he tries this sort of thing.  It would be very easy for me to let things jog along in the old way, things getting worse rather than better.  This course would avoid trouble but it would not eradicate disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons should know this because I can give him figures but figures are not so useful when we make them public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic question that arises here, and most people are now well aware of it, is whether these schemes are to be operated to eradicate disease or to provide employment for vets.  That is the main question.  The people on the opposite side of the House are supposed to be talking for farmers, supposed to be concerned about farmers and farmers' cattle.  There is one thing certain, that is, that they have provided good employment for some vets and I do not begrudge them what they have earned but I am entitled to look for results and I am also entitled to maintain a continuous search for more economical and more efficient ways of achieving results.  I do not think anybody <Col N="815" /> can quarrel with that.  I am dealing with taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>There are two major schemes involved in this issue and there may be others in future.  Deputy Gibbons also referred to the possibilities and what we should be doing and should not be doing.  The first is in regard to TB and this was officially declared eradicated in 1965 but it was necessary to go on testing cattle as a control measure.  In the ten years since 1965 the vets have been paid over £16 million in fees for TB testing.  I want to put it on record that I am not satisfied with the results which have been achieved over that decade. Nobody could be satisfied when reading the figures.  In addition to what has been paid in fees over that period out of public funds another £17 million has been spent on the difference between the purchase price the Department pays to farmers for reacting animals and the resale price paid by the factories for the same animals. The process of testing and removal of reactors must go on but we must somehow improve the methods to ensure better results.</P>
    <P>This is why I am pleased that agreement has now been reached for the setting up of an advisory council to keep the whole situation under a close and, I hope, critical eye and that was my reason for proposing this sort of council: Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, two members; Irish Farmers Association, three members; Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, Limited, two members; Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, three members; Irish Veterinary Association, two members; Irish Veterinary Union, two members; Veterinary Council of Ireland, one member; National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority, two members, when it comes into existence and in the meantime An Foras Talúntais will do the nomination; the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, two members, with an independent chairman appointed in consultation with the council.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to set up such a council as this because it gave full <Col N="816" /> involvement for all the people who had an interest in disease eradication. On that council farmers are well represented, the veterinary profession is well represented and I would hope that it would be an impartial body and would do a first-class job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

      <P>I am satisfied that they are well represented.  I have not approached any of these bodies as yet to find out whether they would be prepared to act but I hope they will be prepared to act.</P>
      <P>The TB question is only half of the problem.  The more immediate problem is brucellosis and the methods to be used in eradicating and controlling it.  The disease is a scourge for farmers and as yet we have not made great progress in getting rid of it. No matter how we set about the job, the cost will escalate rapidly and steeply.  I have been really shocked at the forecasts of the cost of eradicating brucellosis.  The figure last year was £5.5 million.  I am advised that by 1979 this will reach a figure well in excess of £27 million.  I simply do not know where the money is going to come from.  So, the House can understand my anxiety and concern to get a job done that is worth the money. Six counties are already cleared, seven more are in process of eradication and in the balance of the country work is proceeding on a voluntary basis.  As I said, even last year we removed no less than 100,000 cattle when we were supposed to be doing no testing.  As everybody knows, vets do not test cattle for brucellosis.  They simply take blood samples and these samples are tested in the Department's laboratory.</P>

Is this unreasonable?  Over a period of three years the council to which I have referred would monitor the work of these technicians and if at the end of that period the council satisfies me that the technicians were not satisfactory, either on grounds of efficiency or cost then they will be withdrawn.  I have given that undertaking. Deputy Gibbons agrees that technicians should be brought in.  Now he is changing his feet a little bit about how they should be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are well paid. This is a farmer's responsibility and I hope he will take his job seriously in future.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new in this.  Trained technicians are used for routine work in many countries, in fact, I should say in every English-speaking country in the world, and not only in the veterinary field; they are used also in the medical field.  This was laughed at yesterday evening.  The system is sanctioned specifically for blood testing by the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection which the vets have to my proposal is not based on ethical or professional grounds; it is based on the maintenance of employment.  They <Col N="818" /> have said so quite clearly.  The vets, I must say, are not very logical in this because if the prospects for young vets are not good today, a good part of the responsibility lies with their well-established colleagues who between them have corralled all the cattle herds in the country over the years in such a way that a significant part of the TB testing is done now by assistants who receive from the principals something like half the fee which the principals themselves get from the Department.  This deprives the farmer of his choice of vet, it reduces the control of the Department over the working of the system and it effectively prevents the young vet from establishing himself in his profession in the traditional way.  In short, this system which is enthusiastically defended by the union is doing more to destroy the career prospects of young vets than anything I am ever likely to do with regard to employing technicians.</P>
    <P>To sum it up, this is a quarrel I did not seek.  It is doing great harm to the farmers and to the country.  The veterinary profession is very strong and very well organised but I would remind the veterinary practitioners that it is the farmers who own the cattle and it is the taxpayers who provide the money for the schemes.  I want to avail of this opportunity to appeal again to the vets to reconsider their position in the light of what is now being offered, in the light of the fact that these latest proposals have the full support and backing of the farming organisations and in the interest of their own future in disease eradication. I would say to them that so far as I am concerned I will retain no bitterness about this dispute.  I can assure them of my fullest support in disease eradication in the years ahead. I hope they will be fully involved and that they will answer this appeal.</P>
    <P>In its own interest the veterinary profession should take a long-term view of the situation because it cannot afford in the long run to antagonise the farmers on whom in the last analysis the vets rely for their livelihood. Neither should they ignore the interest of the general body of taxpayers <Col N="819" /> who have already provided many millions of pounds and who will be called upon to provide many more millions of pounds for the eradication of those diseases.  Powerful organisations working in vital areas of the economy should be careful not to overplay their hand and I am afraid some such organisations are overplaying their hand.  They can damage the economy but they will sink with it. I do not think that is sufficiently recognised. I plead with the vets to remember this.  Farmers have very long memories and they should not overlook this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons has advocated a high intensity campaign and a major assault to clear the country of the remnants of TB in cattle and to eliminate brucellosis.  On the radio last Sunday I heard him make reference to two trouble spots, Waterford and Kilkenny, where there is still a TB problem.  The Deputy lives in Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>We know who is doing a good job for John Bull.  The Minister has given us no indication as to how we will meet the EEC deadline in 1976.  The Minister has not told us what his plans are if his dispute with the vets is not ended. What are his plans for the eradication of disease?  The Minister told us nothing about these.  In this economic crisis the Government, apart from giving lip-service to partnership, simply stumble along from one crisis to another.  Where is this partnership the Government spoke about where this dispute is concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think so. We must always remember that 60 per cent of our economy is based on the agricultural sector and the livestock industry is by far the largest percentage of that sector.  We have been famed for our livestock exports for many long years.  But that important sector could not be left alone by this Government.  The Minister <Col N="822" /> decides without consultation to put in lay testers on the brucellosis scheme.  That may be all right as far as it goes but the fact is that disease eradication has got a tremendous setback and the blame for that must lie fairly and squarely at the door of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  All the money spent by Fianna Fáil Minister is going down the drain now because the Minister simply cannot shoulder his responsibilities. This is a serious situation where the cattle industry is concerned.</P>
      <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to get down off his high horse and listen to reason from the farming organisations and the veterinary profession. They have done a great deal for the livestock industry and the threats the Minister made ill become any Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Such threats should not be made against any profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It never ceases to amaze me how brilliant the Minister's imagination is.  I should, I think, begin at the end as it were and make some comments on the observations of the Minister and his extraordinary intervention in this debate.  This debate was concerned with the cessation of disease eradication for the greater part of a year and one of the Minister's opening remarks was that the Fianna Fáil Party, and I in particular, seemed to be under some delusion about the importance of the incidence of disease in animals.  His remarks seemed to express satisfaction with the old level of disease in Irish cattle generally in spite of the fact that there has been no disease elimination worthwhile over the past 12 months and he made the extraordinary assertion that the size of the herd is not a relevant factor. This peculiar argument lies in the face of the Government's own statistics which show there was a drop of 553.7 thousand in the numbers of cattle on Irish farms between December, 1974, and December, 1975.  The Minister seemed to be under some kind of delusion <Col N="823" /> that this is not a diminution in the size of the national herd.  He also seems to be unaware of the fact that we were climbing very rapidly to the 7,000,000 mark in the size of our cattle herd in March, 1973, when the present Government took office.</P>
      <P>The Minister reproached the Fianna Fáil Party, with some slight reservations, for our general attitude and accused us of band-wagoning.  He said this motion, tabled in my name, was an effort to jump on some band wagon at a most unfortunate time.  The Minister had half-an-hour or more to demonstrate the truth of his assertion. Of course, the fact is that there is no truth in it.  He did have the decency, however, to admit that the approach of this party from last June or July in the handling of parliamentary questions and otherwise has been a responsible approach and I acknowledge now that the Minister did grant us that much.  But, in the light of that, I take all the greater exception to the Minister's lamentable assertion that our motion is untimely.</P>
      <P>Our motion now is prompted simply by our reluctant arrival at the conclusion that, since nobody else seems to be able to get some movement into this impasse between the Minister and the vets, it behoves the greatest political party in this House and outside it to make that move.  The Minister asserted this motion was an unfair band wagon attempt to derive political capital.  He had ample opportunity to prove his assertion, but he did not find it possible to do that because it simply is not possible to do it.</P>
      <P>When I spoke last night I was at pains to say we hold no brief for the veterinary profession.  My colleagues who spoke subsequently were at pains to do likewise.  What we are concerned about, and what we endeavoured to underline, is that the continuation of this impasse is quite intolerable and must end.  Its ending is the responsibility of the Minister and nobody else's responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not expect the uncouth intrusion of the Parliamentary Secretary into this debate last evening and his unwarranted attack on the integrity <Col N="824" /> of the veterinary profession when, as the Minister says, the relationship between the Department and the veterinary profession is at such a delicate stage and when there is such an insistence on the part not only of the farming community but of the country generally on an immediate end to this unimaginably costly cessation of testing.  Since the Minister did not see fit to amend or correct the ill-informed and ignorant contribution of his Parliamentary Secretary, it must be taken that he approves of what he said.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, having made his unfortunate contribution and having exacerbated the situation to an even greater degree than has the intransigence of the Minister, to be so good as to refrain from further observations until I have finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This party calls on the Minister to make an immediate settlement of the cessation of testing, this abandonment of the health status of the cattle of the country which has been growing over the past 12 months.  The calling together of the animal health council is a very wise move by the <Col N="825" /> Minister.  I accept, with the reservations expressed by Deputy Callanan, that the personnel section seems broad enough to meet the case.  It is absolutely vital to assure the veterinary profession of what they seem most concerned about, that is, the security of the tenure of their lucrative employment. If we are to continue exporting with a proper disease free status, there must be a large scale offensive against animal disease.</P>
    <P>The tuberculosis situation can be recovered fairly easily, although there has been regression in the past 12 months.  The country did have attested status until the breakdown last year. I freely acknowledge that the problem areas are Waterford and Kilkenny which are causing grave concern.  I remember consultations in my time in the Department about the setting up of a special task force.  Whether this task force had actually gone into action at the time of the change of Government is not really relevant, but it was under active consideration at that time.</P>
    <P>There is a need to examine the approach of the Department's veterinary section and the general approach to the control of brucellosis.  I am not happy about the tactics that were in use during our time in Government and which continued until the cessation of work.  The Minister may write these words down in his notebook and use them again if he wishes, but I have no hesitation in saying that the pace of disease eradication was not sufficient in our time.  We should have expanded it at a much greater rate. We must attack this problem now and I do not mean that there should be a mere resumption of work from where it was left off.  We are right up against the 1978 deadline.  In my opinion, there is not a hope in hell that we will make it, but if we can do it or if we show that we are doing our best, the EEC might see some way round this impassable barrier.  Unless we do that, we can give no guarantee or undertaking to the veterinary profession that there will be continuity of employment both for existing members and the young people coming into the profession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> I have always felt that lay personnel are necessary.  The veterinary profession say that under no circumstances will they allow lay personnel to enter the professional field.  Having regard to the numbers in the profession and the rather low intensity of the disease eradication programme as it now stands, I think there is a justification for this attitude.  Until such time as there is a rapid intensification of the disease eradication scheme, there does not seem to be a sufficient case for the use of lay staff for the taking of blood samples which the vets take to be in the professional area.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the very strong convictions they have expressed in this regard, even in the last 24 hours, I suggest that lay staff be incorporated in the task force which will undertake disease eradication in the future and that they be employed in an unprofessional way.  I am not trying to make political capital out of this.  I am trying to find an end to the cessation that is causing enormous damage.  We cannot continue to let the impasse go on indefinitely because it is costing millions of pounds and this amount is shooting up all the time.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the vital time factor.  We cannot hesitate any longer.  The Government on the confession of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, have found it necessary and possible to raise hundreds of millions of pounds to produce a distorted system which makes it unprofitable for many people to work any more. The Government are devoting that money to this unprofitable, wasteful and feckless task.  Yet, they say they do not have any money to devote to improving the health status of our cattle herds.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to impress on his colleagues the need for a reexamination of their values.  Either spend taxpayers' money purchased in votes for the next election by increasing social welfare payments or spend it on what the country needs most&mdash;  the cattle herds.</P>

      <P>The profits of registered credit unions are exempt from both income tax and corporation profits tax.  This exemption is an exceptional measure of relief which does not apply to any other financial institution.  I am satisfied that it gives due recognition, under the tax code, to the important role being played by the credit union movement in the community.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I do not propose to arrange for the further concession suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Many proposals submitted to the Industrial Development Authority are tentative and are not pursued to a stage where all the necessary information required to have a decision taken on them is furnished.  In such cases apart from considerations of confidentiality it would not be appropriate to give information of the kind sought to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the authority that 547 proposals submitted by Irish firms were approved in the period 1st January, 1975, to 31st January, 1976, the latest date for which the information is readily available. The total fixed asset investment involved in these proposals is about £175 million and the grants approved by the authority in respect of the proposals amount to £36 million approximately.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed by the authority that it is not the practice to announce approvals of projects, including the names of the firms involved, except with the prior agreement of the promoters.  Some of the approved projects to which I have referred have been announced by the authority with the promoters' approval but I understand the list is quite extensive and I regret that, in the time available, I am not in a position to furnish the details.</P>
