      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind the increases in cable television rentals which were announced by RTE Relays last August and which came into effect from 1st October.  The case for an increase in these rentals was based on increases in salaries, wages and overhead costs.  The application was considered by the National Prices Commission and the new rentals are in accordance with the commission's recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE have been planning on the basis that RTE 2 would become operational by the end of 1977.  My Department received recently from RTE a comprehensive financial statement containing particulars of the licence fees and capital they estimate would be needed over the next few years for the existing services and to provide a second television service.  A detailed study of this statement is being made in consultation with RTE.  When this study has been completed the matters at issue will have to be considered in the light of the general economic situation.  Meanwhile, I am sorry that I cannot say when RTE 2 is likely to come on the air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said in March, 1976, was based on the best information available to me at that time.  In the meantime the more detailed financial projections referred to in my reply to the Deputy's question have been received from RTE.  Until there has been an opportunity to complete the in-depth study of these financial projections, I am not in a position to say whether or not RTE 2 is likely to be in operation by the end of 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to appear unhelpful, but I am afraid <Col N="278" /> it might be misleading to quote figures at this stage.  The RTE projections are in the nature of a complex package, and these are based on certain assumptions about development of existing services, introduction of RTE 2, revision of past accounting practices, which if introduced would involve a substantial extra charge on current income and so on.  Until decisions can be reached on these matters I would prefer not to quote any figures to the House.</P>

      <P>Technically it would be feasible on certain financial assumptions, but as I have indicated in my reply to the Deputy, these financial assumptions and projections which we have received from RTE require further study, and until that study has been completed I am not in a position to satisfy the Deputy fully on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central)</i> asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if it is his intention to establish a Post Office Giro system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Giro system involves the provision by the Post Office of a current account banking service with cheque facilities.  In considering whether the system should be introduced here essential questions would be whether the service would be desirable in order to supplement the existing banking and remittance services and whether the heavy costs of establishing and operating the service <Col N="279" /> would be warranted.  British experience, which we have been watching carefully, suggests that public support for the service would be slow and that the service would not pay its way for many years.  Before any decision could be taken, through research and analysis would be necessary to assess the potential for the service, the associated costs and benefits to the community, the Exchequer and the Post Office and the wider policy implications. Many of these important issues are outside the purview of my Department, and the matter is not one on which an early decision is practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, due to the recent bank strike, some alternative banking system is desirable?  Would he further agree that the system is working very satisfactorily in the United Kingdom and in other European countries, and would he carry out a survey to see how they are operating their systems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The question whether such a service is needed to supplement the existing banking and transfer services is primarily one for the Department of Finance.  As regards the question of how satisfactory the British experience has been, the British experience does suggest that the launching of Giro would be expensive, that the growth of public support could be slow, and that the service would be unprofitable to the Post Office for many years at least.  If, however, the Department of Finance decide that this service is necessary, then my Department will co-operate with that Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations governing carriage of dangerous substances, including radioactive and fissile materials, in Irish airspace, are the international regulations drawn up by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) which have been given the force of law here by a directive issued under Article 7 of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973.  The packages which may be carried on an aircraft are strictly prescribed and must conform to very exacting packaging requirements.  The regulations as to carriage and packaging are too comprehensive and technical for me to detail now.  On the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board, I am satisfied that the carriage by air of packages of fissile and radioactive materials conforming to IATA regulations should not result in a public hazard.  In addition, airlines are required to notify my Department in advance when it is proposed to carry fissile materials.  Over the past three years seven such notifications have been received and only one aircraft made a transit stop at Shannon.  That particular aircraft carried 100 1bs of uranium hexafluoride.  In the case of the six over-flights the amounts of <Col N="281" /> material on board were very small. There is no evidence to indicate that large quantities are being transported through Shannon Airport or over this country.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is no need to change the existing arrangements for the passage of aircraft carrying fissile and radioactive materials through Irish-controlled airspace or for landings by such aircraft at Irish airports. I have, however, arranged that the question will be kept under continuous review in consultation with the Nuclear Energy Board, who are the expert body established to advise the Government on nuclear energy and matters connected therewith.</P>
    <P>I should add that recent newspaper reports greatly exaggerated the factual position about the carriage of radio-active and fissile materials through Shannon as to the incidence of such landings, the quantities involved and the likely effects of an incident involving the carriage of such substances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these aircraft are not permitted to land at Kennedy Airport and because of this alone surely there is a strong case for not permitting them to land at Shannon?  Would the Minister not agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not so; they are allowed to land at Kennedy Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the newspapers they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to set aside people's fear and concern would it not be better if these aircraft were obliged to refuel or land at service airports, either United States or British, on the Continent rather than at an international civil airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  The implication of the question is that standards of security and safety at civil airports are less than at other airports.  I would not accept that, particularly in the case of Shannon, where I think the personnel are <Col N="282" /> extremely vigilant about these matters. When the plane in question landed it was guarded all the time it was on the ground by gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to convey anything about safety standards; I was dealing with the concern of the people.  Is it not reasonable to expect these planes to refuel at US or British airforce bases in Western Europe because these airports are experienced in dealing with these materials in their military capacity?  I am not saying anything about safety precautions at Shannon but I am dealing with the concern of the people caused by these landings, despite what the Minister says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>These aircraft land and take off from airports in France and from Kennedy Airport in New York and Chicago Airport which is, I believe, the busiest airport in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  But it will not create a great problem to ask them to land at service air bases in view of the fact that we are not a nuclear power at present and that people are concerned about newspaper reports even though these may not be entirely accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is greatly exaggerated.  The packing regulations are so detailed in regard to the carriage of goods like these that frequently the packaging weighs eight, nine or ten times as much as the material involved.  It is not economic to carry these goods by air except in very small quantities.  It is believed that the 100 lbs. referred to which was landed there involved a weight of about a half-ton.  Except in small quantities the cost of transporting such goods by air is prohibitive.  The IATA regulations, to which we subscribe, are subscribed to by many countries and are stringent.  In fact the American Government impose even more stringent regulations and they allow these goods into civil aviation bases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Newspaper reports can do a great deal of harm in that they cause much anxiety where there is no necessity for it.  People who pose as experts and give interviews to newspapers without having the full facts cause far more harm to people mentally and this is unnecessary if people would accept the facts as they are.  The regulations are stringent.  It is recognised that these are dangerous materials.  The Government have an agency, the Nuclear Energy Board, which advises them as regards the safety precautions involved. Not only this Government but all governments have combined to ensure that when these goods are transported from one point to another anywhere in the world it is done under strict supervision and there are very high standards of packaging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware or is he concerned that these packets are only supposed to withstand a 30-foot fall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This all stems, like the questions here and the newspaper comments, from one question put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs while he was lecturing in New York by some lady who was obviously totally unaware of the facts and greatly exaggerated what was going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be forgiven for saying so but I do not think she has any conception of what is going on.  She said that this material was being transported in large quantities and landed at Shannon.  This is all incorrect. There are regulations, to which many countries subscribe, to ensure that if this material is transported-and this has benefits-from one point to another it shall be done safely.  We subscribe to these regulations. They are part of an order made under an Act of the Oireachtas and the Nuclear Energy Board are there to advise me or any other member of the Government as to what is necessary to ensure that there is no danger to anybody in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more danger in walking down a street in Dublin than is involved there.  I think we must make facilities available to people who want to land in this country to refuel aircraft from a safety point of view provided we are sure that the rules laid down by international bodies for the transport of these goods are adhered to.  We are quite satisfied they are adhered to in every case involved here.  Also, a plane flying over the country or a plane crashing outside our airports could be as much of a hazard as one landing&mdash;or perhaps more.</P>

      <P>I have consulted the bodies under the aegis of my Department who are responsible for the provision of transport services between this country and Great Britain.</P>
      <P>As far as air transport is concerned, Aer Lingus are constantly striving to improve their service and are very conscious of the need to keep standards high.  Frequencies in all routes, including cross-channel services, are tailored to demand and are high by European standards.  Special fares and arrangements are designed to provide a wide range of choice for the travelling public.</P>
      <P>As regards surface travel, the B &amp; I Line likewise constantly review their range of fares and special travel arrangements.  The company recently placed an order with Verolme Dockyard for a fourth car ferry which will provide accommodation for 1,500 passengers and will have a carrying capacity of 350 tourist cars.  This new ferry, which will come into service in 1978, will incorporate the latest standards in passengers facilities.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's further information, I understand that British Rail have decided to introduce a new large multi-purpose ship on their Irish services in 1977.  This ship, named <i>St. Columba</i> will operate on the Holy-head/Dún Laoghaire route and will greatly increase capacity for both cars and passengers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>Industrial employment in Longford has increased substantially in recent years.</P>
      <P>The IDA have already approved this year four projects which between them are expected to provide an additional 117 jobs in the town.</P>
      <P>I understand also that a textile firm in the town will shortly, with the help of an IDA grant, implement an expansion programme resulting in the creation of 60 new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> In addition, negotiations are in progress with an industrialist who may locate a substantial new industry in the town.  Because these negotiations are at a critical stage, I cannot give further details at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that despite all this progress there is a long delay in restarting industry in Longford?  It has only been restarted at this stage after a long halt.  The closure of one or two small factories would mean a substantial loss of employment in this area.

An IDA survey has shown that in the relevant catchment area the total employment in 1974 was 900; in 1975, 986; and in 1976, 1,046.  The rise from the first to the second year was 86; the rise between last year and this year was 60.  Therefore, there has been a continuing rise in industrial jobs.  The new plants and the extensions to existing plants that I mentioned were in addition to that underlying trend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will intervene to prevent the proposed 42 per cent increase in the price of naphtha being sold to the Limerick Municipal Gas Company in view of that fact that the cost of production of naphtha at Whitegate Refinery is well below the world price which it is proposed to charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be a question for the Parliamentary Secretary, but as it is put into this part of the Order Paper, I am taking it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of naphtha to the Limerick Municipal Gas Company is settled in accordance with the terms of a contract <Col N="288" /> between the company and its suppliers.  In accordance with section 21 of the Prices Act, 1958, and section 22D of the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1965, the prices involved in existing contracts, or any alteration to those prices in accordance with the terms of the contracts, are specifically excluded from the scope of the Prices Acts. There are therefore no powers available to me to intervene on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the alterations which the oil company concerned seem to make to the prices in this contract are not in accordance with the terms of the contract in the view of the Limerick Corporation?  In these circumstances, can he not intervene in view of the fact that he is not precluded from intervening by virtue of the Acts that he cited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy tells me that they are not in accordance with these Acts I can certainly have the matter examined.  The Deputy will have to realise that if what he has told the House is not in accordance with the facts it will not be possible for me to proceed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the amount of naphtha produced at Whitegate as an inevitable and unavoidable by-product of the refining process is produced at a fraction of the cost that is being charged to the Limerick, Dublin and Cork municipal gas companies and is way below the world price, and that there are no other significant consumers of naphtha in Ireland?  In these circumstances, would he intervene to see that the oil company concerned charges a reasonable figure, bearing in mind the production costs rather than world prices which they are now imposing from a monopoly situation on these three gas companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot accept as fact the statements made by the Deputy.  He suggests, for example, that the only use of naphtha in this country is by gas companies.  This is not true.  This country is in deficit in regard to naphtha and imports it at world market prices.  What is produced <Col N="289" /> at Whitegate is not sufficient for our purposes.  It is used to produce town gas and as a blending component for motor spirit.  The statement in his question that the cost of production of naphtha at Whitegate is well below world prices is completely unsubstantiated. Whitegate is a rather old-fashioned and, by current standards, under-capitalised oil refinery.  I have no figures on the matter but it seems highly unlikely that the cost of production at Whitegate is below the world price.  Whitegate has been providing portion of its production at a price less than the world price to this particular gas company.  To make that up, as they cannot supply the total requirement for blending and gas production, they are importing at the world price.  Hitherto they were in the position of losing substantially on every ton of naphtha supplied to that gas company.  These are the facts as made available to me by my Department. If the Deputy has other facts and if we are wrong, I would be very happy to intervene.  Unsubstantiated charges of this kind do not help.  If the Deputy can provide me with hard information I would be happy to pursue this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy to provide that information very quickly to the Minister.  Is the Minister aware that the output of Naphtha in Whitegate is 4.9 per cent of the throughput of crude but that the actual amount of naphtha that is sent out as such from Whitegate is 1.9 per cent of the throughput of crude?  The reason for this is that the balance is reformed in Whitegate from naphtha into petrol because petrol is a more lucrative market for the oil companies concerned. In these circumstances, how can the Minister possibly make the statement that the oil companies are actually importing naphtha for the benefit of these municipal gas companies at a loss?  If it were so, why would they reform into petrol the bulk of the naphtha which is inevitably produced as a by-product of the refining process at Whitegate?</P>

The position was that while Irish Shell Ltd. were supplying the Limerick Gas Company with naphtha at the rate of £49 and £91 per ton they were purchasing their own requirements of naphtha for use as a blender with motor spirit, at the rate of £74 per ton.  If the Deputy can prove that wrong I will act.  That is a quotation from my brief and I have to depend on the technical information given to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no representations from home manufacturers in regard to the imposition of import controls on tin cans.  Consideration of such a proposal would have <Col N="291" /> to take into account the possible adverse effects on the canning industry.

      <Col N="292" /> The Industrial Development Authority have been making vigorous efforts to attract new industry to the city.  These efforts are being maintained. The establishment of a major industrial project as urged by the Deputy, has been and remains one of the principal objectives of the authority's efforts to attract new industry to Waterford.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, announcements have recently been made about the establishment in Waterford of two new projects.

Announcements are pending in relation to about the same number of jobs. The expansion in six projects in Waterford will account for 300 jobs. We are talking of something more than 600 jobs.  If, at the same time, we can get the reactivation of the project the Deputy knows about or something comparable we will have gone a long way towards solving Waterford's problems.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>The drop in exports from Ireland to the USSR from £9,195,000 in the first eight months of 1975 to £987,000 in the first eight months of 1976 can be attributed to the fact that exports of beef, which made up a very large proportion of total exports to the USSR in 1975, fell from £8.8 million for the period January-August, 1975 to £0.32 million for the same period in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a country with which Ireland has an adverse trade balance the general aim is to seek to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports.  The Government, <Col N="294" /> through Córas Trachtála, have made a wide range of grants, incentives and services available to exporters and these, of course, apply to exports to the USSR.</P>
    <P>Special measures have been taken in recent years to encourage exports to the USSR.  An Irish Technical Week was held in Moscow in April, 1973, in which 11 Irish companies participated and there have been three consumertechnical products presentations in our embassy in the USSR in 1975-6 in which a total of over 40 Irish firms participated.  In addition the first Irish trade mission to the USSR organised by CTT in conjunction with the Irish Exporters Association visited that country in May, 1975, and 21 Irish companies participated.  Furthermore Córas Tráchtála have based an officer full time in Moscow to assist Irish exporters to exploit exports opportunities in the Russian market.</P>

Does this not justify the Minister taking up with the Russian Embassy here or with the Russian authorities this serious imbalance in view of the fact that it is Government buying that is involved as far as the Russians are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I agree with the thrust of the Deputy's supplementary question; it is very disappointing. Secondly, that what I took to be a fairly official situation, namely, an interview with a journalist from Tass in the earlier part of this year, I expressed very clearly and forthrightly my displeasure of the situation then evolving.  I would, however, add for the understanding of the House what may be a helpful clarification.  The beef which accounted last year for £8.8 million out of over £9 million <Col N="295" /> was not commercial beef.  It was beef bought out of intervention.</P>
      <P>What I have tried to do to indicate the general trend, deeply unsatisfactory as it is, is to prepare a table which indicates our exports excluding beef, which are not bought on the commercial market here.  In 1972 those exports were £234,000; in 1973 they were £476,000; in 1974 they were £721,000 and in 1975 they were £1,257,000.  We do not, of course, have a figure yet for 1976, but I do not think it will be any lower than last year and I am hopeful it will surpass it. The point I am making is that we exported no beef in 1972 or 1973, £7,500,000, nearly £9,000,000 in 1975 and very little in 1976.  If you take the beef out, though it is much too low and though I would like to see more action there, there is a rising trend.</P>
      <P>I am very happy to have this expression of opinion from the Opposition because it coincides entirely with my own opinion and I would be very happy to see that those thoughts are conveyed to the place where they may influence purchasing decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's attack on non-purchasing by proposed purchasers in this regard, I would like to ask him if another contributory factor to this could be that outlined by the general manager of CCT recently when he complained about the unavailability of financial resources from the Minister towards assisting in exporting our goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is an accurate representation of what the general manager said and I am not sure he would wish to have that construction put on his words.  However, I can say two things: firstly, this is not a consumer goods problem but a capital goods problem.  The demands made are very large but as far as I am aware we have never lost an order through the unavailability of such export credit guarantees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the Government propose to introduce, in agreement with the EEC Commission, import controls on footwear and textiles in view of the serious unemployment in these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Following various approaches which I made to the EEC Commission over the last two years, a number of measures have been authorised in order to minimise the impact of imports on sensitive sectors of manufacturing industry.  I have, mainly in reply to questions, given details to the House of the measures implemented.  I would refer the Deputy in particular to the reply to a question on 18th December, 1975, Volume 286, columns 2099, 2100 and 2101.</P>
      <P>Moreover, action has been taken by the Community, to which Ireland is party, through the negotiation of bilateral agreements and, in one case, the imposition of unilateral restraints to regulate imports of sensitive textiles and clothing products originating in certain third countries.  For each of the products covered by these restrictions there are annual quantitative limits on a Community basis and also at the level of individual member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has secured the agreement of the EEC Commission on three occasions to certain traiff protection being retained for the footwear industry at a much higher level than would have been the case under the provisions of the Treaty of Accession and the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Because of the continuing <Col N="297" /> high level of imports of footwear this year, the Commission are now looking into the matter again, at my request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the various controls put on both footwear and some textiles over the last two years were minimal and had no significant effect whatever on these markets?  Is he further aware that the figures available so far this year seem to indicate that the imports of footwear during 1976 approximately equal the entirety of the domestic market for footwear and that in these circumstances there is no future for any factory here unless they can go into exporting in a big way which, naturally, they find difficult to do?  In these circumstances, is he prepared to make a genuine and energetic effort to have meaningful and worth-while controls put on for some period to give these industries a chance to get themselves organised and to protect the employment of their workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's decrying of what has been done is both inaccurate and unjust.  Although the demand for specialised controls is one that is easily voiced and easily supported, the Deputy and the country would do well to examine the repercussions of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment figures for the textile industry up to March, 1976, the latest date for which I have figures, had increased in both previous quarters.  Although I do not have hard figures yet of a number of things, such as the Wellman and Burlington openings, there is every likelihood that employment will go on like this.  The other point is that without measures, such as reorganisation, merely putting on controls does two things: it is inflationary because prices in the absence of competition can rise on the domestic market, and it protects people from the necessary streamlining and the development of efficiency which has to take place if we are going to contend in the reality of free trade in the Common Market.  We have taken a number of measures with which the Deputy is familiar.  They have produced some protections but <Col N="298" /> fewer than we would like.  In a number of these areas we remain net exporters and our export performance is quite heartening where there has been attention to quality, design and efficiency of production.  Merely to suggest that the introduction of selective import controls could solve the problem in a country as vulnerable to reciprocation as we are, is in fact not to express the real interests of those industries.</P>
    <P>We are in continuous contact on this.  The secretary of my Department and others are in Brussels today about this as a result of an initiative I started in July and carried further in September and we hope to get more protection.  I have to emphasise that in the long run the thought that we can solve our problems in these areas in any other way than by efficiency and competitiveness is a false belief and is not in the interests either of Irish consumers or of the long term health of the industries themselves. We are horrendously vulnerable to counter-attack by countries close to us.  If we had no dependence on exports in these areas, that would not matter.  It would, of course, matter for other kinds of exports.  Since we have quite substantial and in many cases dramatically growing exports, we are not in a position to call down on our heads that sort of retaliation if we act unreasonably.  We are acting to the limit of what is prudent and reasonable and, in my belief, to the limit of what is in the best interests of the industries themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not contradicted my statement that imports of footwear so far this year at least equal the domestic market.  Is the Minister aware that the footwear federation has not been calling for a banning of footwear imports or for the imposition of heavy tariffs but is simply calling for the imposition of a quota limiting footwear imports to 50 per cent of the domestic market and would the Minister not agree that this is a reasonable request and that, in the absence of its not being met, the federation cannot guarantee the future of any factory within their federation?</P>

Will he agree that he exaggerates in believing such action is likely bearing in mind that the footwear industry here constitutes about 1 per cent of the footwear industry in the Community and that it has no effect whatever on the Community market, on community prices, or anything else, and that other countries which took action to protect themselves and their vulnerable industries were not subjected to retaliatory action and I can instance the Italian Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What he says about the total volume of the Irish industry is absolutely right and were that the only reason we would be perfectly safe.  It is not a matter of volume only.  It is a matter of being able to cite international pretexts because the footwear industry in many other countries is in a similar state and all the efforts of those concerned to protect the growth of world trade have been to prevent the outbreak of an <Col N="300" /> avalanche of protection which, in the long run, would damage world trade and damage most those countries which export the highest percentage of their GNP.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that a substantial new project with an employment potential of 433 jobs was approved earlier this year and this project has already commenced production.  I have also been informed by the authority that they have approved five small projects during the year which will give rise to over 60 further jobs.  There are, in addition, 180 jobs still to come on stream from two other approved projects which started in recent years as these two projects build up to their full potential.</P>

It is a very good industrial project and I would, therefore, consider it would certainly be a matter of years, probably of the order of three years, before it will be in full production.  On the other hand, there is, of course, the coming on of a stream of projects established in the past which are expected to provide 180 jobs during the current year.</P>

There was a firm of 600 maximum which did not decide to proceed, but there is another.  Everybody is sorry that projects like that do not mature and the fact that priority is given to Bray is an indicaion of the recognition by the IDA and by me of the seriousness of the problem.

      <P>I apologise for my late arrival.  I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entitlement of workers to participate in company decision-making is based on the concept of the company as a social enterprise.  In this light the company is no longer regarded as the exclusive property of shareholders: ownership of its physical assets is no longer regarded as conferring an absolute right to exercise control, without taking into account other interests such as those of employees or society generally.  The company is now seen as a social institution, comprising a variety of interest groups such as shareholders, financiers, management, employees, customers and consumers, each of which is indispensable to the <Col N="328" /> company's overall well-being and success.  Industry in the future will tend to be organised increasingly along these lines.  The Worker Participation Bill is designed to provide the framework in the State sector for this evolving situation in industry generally.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation Bill accepts that employees are entitled to participate in the decision-making of the companies in which they work. The seven State companies in which the legislation will operate are viewed as organisations of social enterprise in which the contribution of each individual, whether he or she works at desk or on shop floor, is considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>The debate and discussion on worker participation has been proceeding here for almost a decade now.  I believe that debate and discussion have yielded us all that analysis of ideas can yield.  It is time for principles to be translated into practice, time for theory to be transformed into action. The legislation I am introducing here today would not be possible if this vital discussion phase had not taken place.  In this connection I would like to thank the trade unions, the employer organisations, the Irish Productivity Centre, the Irish Management Institute and other bodies who have played an important part in stimulating interest.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, of course, managerial prerogative has rested on property rights.  Through direct ownership or through power delegated by shareholders, managers have claimed the right to manage enterprises unilaterally without reference to the employees in these companies.  The justification of managerial prerogative has been based on property rights.  That conception has, in recent years, come under attack from a number of directions. The development of a mixed economy with a large public sector has undermined the strength of the case based on private property rights.  In many of the largest private firms, the link between ownership and control is now so tenuous that the property argument is decisively weakened.  So much so that in a number of areas, for example in the payments of redundancy benefits, employees have turned the <Col N="329" /> argument on its head by themselves establishing rights based on their &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of their jobs though we still must wait for employee rights to be recognised fully in our general company legislation.</P>
    <P>Managers increasingly accept that the process of traditional decision-making needs to be justified and demonstrated to be right.  Increasingly it is realised by those who have little enthusiasm for the very idea of worker participation itself that there is no automatic prerogative for making decisions and in turn expecting them to be carried out.  In the words of one recent management spokesman, managers do not have, if they ever had, a divine right to manage.  In other words, we have come to a situation where management is beginning to accept the legitimacy of a different basis of authority, that being one of consent.</P>
    <P>The assumption underlying the quest for improved participative systems is that the total resources of the company must be harnessed if company objectives are to be attained. For this purpose workers' knowledge and ideas can make a valuable contribution to the quality of company decisions if the company structure provides for this.  Genuine participation should make for greater efficiency and more worth-while employment in the sense that the deeper interest and work satisfaction of those who take part in it will be catered for.</P>
    <P>If we are to contribute positively to the body of experience required for developing the company structure of the future, it is imperative for us to develop management structures based on the consent I have been talking about.  A less authoritarian, though no less efficient, management is required for today's workers who are better educated and better trained.  Management based on the hierarchical principle is increasingly becoming an anachronism as the new industrial structures develop.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked: &ldquo;Why were State companies selected for the implementation of this legislation?&rdquo; For many years now I have thought that the take-off point for <Col N="330" /> worker participation in our economy should be in the State sector.  Indeed, as far back as 1968 I contributed an article to a Symposium on Industrial Democracy&mdash;Dr. Hillery, the then Minister for Labour was another contributor&mdash;on the necessity of the development of forms of industrial democracy in the State sector.  Companies in the State sector approximate more nearly to the ideal of the company as a social enterprise, the concept of the company on which I have already said this legislation is based.</P>
    <P>State enterprises have already made a creative contribution to the development of our economy.  Their economic contribution to the general well-being must now be augumented by their now adopting a pioneering role in the development of new techniques of management.  Though the proposals in this Worker Participation (State Enterprise) Bill, 1976 are designed to meet the imperatives of work reorganisation which would in turn contribute to humanising relations in the place of work, the extension of worker participation, as envisaged, must also have a beneficial effect on the climate of industrial relations.  One may speak positively of the achievement of the State sector in economic terms, but even on the most superficial examination, the conclusion is inescapable that industrial relations in the State sector reflect the same level of confrontation observable in private industry.</P>
    <P>Many reasons may be adduced to explain the incidence of industrial disputes in the State sector, but no one who examines the situation can be in any doubt that the large number of unions organising a relatively small number of workers is a contributory factor.  It is true that by means of the Trade Union Act, 1975, I have already sought to alter this state of affairs. The functioning of the legislation envisaged in this Bill will lessen the potential for conflict in a multi-union situation by the substitution of a single electoral list for all workers in the elections to the boards under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The legislation is concerned with worker participation at board level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> That is the area where the most important decisions in a company are made.  Now, for the first time, in seven State companies, boards will be reconstituted to provide for the representation of employees.  It is my conviction that the advent of employees as directors will add a new and fruitful dimension to the working of these boards as a whole.  Employees will have a positive contribution to make to the boards' deliberations, for they will bring with them from the shopfloor a wealth of practical knowledge and experience of the company's operations. As a result, a new grouping in the trade union leadership will evolve, one which will be well acquainted with the realities of the economic situation in their companies, and one which I have no doubt will have a significant contribution to make in the development of economic policy in the State sector.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in July, 1975, I issued a document outlining the main features of my proposals for legislation to provide for the election of employees to State boards.  These proposals were examined by the trade unions involved and were the basis for extensive consultations with other interested groups, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and representatives of managements on the boards concerned.  The provisions in the Bill, as now drafted, are those on which there has been a broad measure of agreement since the publication of the proposals of summer 1975.  It goes without saying that the co-operation and commitment of those affected by the implementation of this legislation is essential for their success.</P>
    <P>The document of July, 1975 pointed out that the seven companies selected for inclusion in the initial legislation satisfied certain criteria which would seem to indicate that they offered the best prospects for effecting a successful adaptation to change.  These criteria included operations of a commercial or quasi-commercial nature, involving a medium to fairly high level of technology and the existence of developed trade union/management relationships, preferably with some experience of joint consultation structures <Col N="332" /> such as works councils.  Deputies will also have noted that while some of the companies involved are relatively compact, others are much more geographically dispersed throughout the country.  There was a deliberate policy decision to ensure the application of the legislation on a national scale rather than confining it to traditional industrial centres.</P>
    <P>The total number of workers affected by the legislation will be in the region of 50,000 covering a wide range of occupations.  The full range of the country's economic life is represented. The operations of the companies concerned include air services, production and processing of peat, shipping services, sugar manufacture and food processing, rail and road transport; electricity generation and fertiliser production.</P>
    <P>Given the innovative nature of the legislation, the Government and I made a conscious decision to confine its scope initially to seven companies. The main reason behind this decision was to facilitate a close and effective monitoring of the scheme in operation to discover what lessons might be learned from its practical application and whether any changes might be called for in future legislation on the basis of this practical experience. Based on the successful implementation of the scheme in these companies, it is my intention to extend it progressively, by way of further legislation, to other State enterprises later on.</P>
    <P>The central purpose of the measure before us is to enable elections to be held in seven State enterprises so that employees can be selected, by and from the work force, for appointment to the boards of the enterprises.  The schedule to the Bill lists the State companies involved: Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, B &amp; I, the Irish Sugar Company, CIE, ESB and Nítrigin Éireann.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Act are brought into operation by means of an order made by me under section 3 which empowers me to prescribe an &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; for the purpose of determining &ldquo;election years&rdquo; under section 6.  For the purpose of the Act, election years shall occur in the year in which the Minister makes the first <Col N="333" /> order under section 3 and every successive third year thereafter.  Not later than the 15th September, in each election year, the Minister must prescribe by regulations the day for receipt of nominations of candidates.  I should like to emphasise, however, that under section 13 implementation of the legislation can be suspended where a majority of the workers so decide.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the secretary of the State enterprise concerned shall be the returning officer for an election or, alternatively, any other person who, in his opinion, is acceptable to the majority of employees to act as returning officer.  Under section 8, the returning officer is required to fix a day called the &ldquo;stated day&rdquo; by reference to which he decides which employees shall be eligible to vote and to stand as candidates.</P>
    <P>Section 9 empowers me, in consultations with the other Ministers concerned, to prescribe, by regulations, the manner in which elections shall be conducted.  In this connection, I should like to assure the House that, prior to the holding of elections, there will be consultations with all the interests concerned&mdash;including management and trade unions&mdash;as to the procedures which should be prescribed for the conduct of elections in each individual State company.  Section 9, subsection (3) provides that where an election is contested&mdash;that is, where the number of candidates exceeds the number of seats&mdash;a poll shall be taken by secret vote according to the principle of proportional representation.  There will be only one electoral list in each State enterprise, comprising the total number of employees eligible to vote.  This is provided for under section 9, subsection (4) (u).</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that every employee who has completed not less than one year's service and who is not under 18 years of age shall be entitled to vote in elections.  Section 11 provides that candidates must be over 18 and under 65 years of age and must have completed at least three years' unbroken service.  I might say, at this point, that these age and service qualifications have been agreed in consultations with both unions and management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> Subsection (1) of section 11 provides that only a &ldquo;qualified body&rdquo; shall be entitled to nominate candidates. Under subsection (6) a qualified body is defined as a trade union or other body recognised by the State enterprise concerned for the purpose of conducting collective bargaining negotiations.  I am convinced that any approach to worker participation must be based on the already existing trade union structure, especially since the vast majority of employees in the seven companies are organised in trade unions.  To attempt to introduce new forms of representation without the support and co-operation of trade unions would be to ignore one of the basic realities of Irish industrial life. For that reason, I am satisfied that the provisions in the Bill about nominations are the only ones which have any prospect of general acceptance and success.</P>
    <P>Under section 13, I have provided an &ldquo;opting out&rdquo; provision whereby a trade union, or a number of trade unions, representing not less than 15 per cent of employees eligible to vote, may call for a ballot to determine whether or not a majority of the work force favours holding an election. This provision, I believe, is an essential feature of the Act.  It is not my intention to impose industrial democracy on workers who do not want it.  Where a majority vote against the holding of an election, it lapses for three years: otherwise, it is proceeded with in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Section 23 empowers me, after consultation with the other Ministers concerned, to prescribe, by order, the number of members of the reconstituted boards, including the number to be appointed under the Act.  Where the total number is a multiple of three, elected representatives must constitute one third: otherwise, the proportion must be rounded upwards to the number which is next to that which would constitute one third.</P>
    <P>Since it is not possible, at this stage, to determine, in advance, the size of the reconstituted State boards, I have refrained from specifying the numbers in the Act.  In order to afford the Government Ministers concerned a <Col N="335" /> degree of flexibility in this respect, I feel the best solution is to allow the number to be prescribed by affirmative order under the Act.  In this connection, Deputies will have noted that under section 4, subsection (4), a draft of an order to be made under this section or under section 25 which deals with quorums, requires the prior approval of the Oireachtas by way of affirmative resolution of each House. This will ensure that there will be no diminution of the authority or responsibility of the Oireachtas as regards determining the appropriate size and quorum in relation to individual State enterprises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially, I want to complain on behalf of some of the members of the party who were present in the House who were expecting a script of the Minister's speech, as is normal in these circumstances. Personally I am disappointed that the scripts were not available.  They have been delivered since, but it is hard to understand why they could not have been ready as this Bill has been listed on the Order Paper for almost a week.</P>
      <P>At a time of economic chaos and economic recession such as we are experiencing, and at a time when even our Constitution is being attacked by those who should be defending it, there is a danger that people's minds will be diverted from the importance of worker participation.  Worker participation means people who are working in an enterprise being involved in decisions being made which affect their working life.  Worker participation is of prime importance.  The Bill before the House is entitled Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, 1976.  It is the first measure affecting worker participation that has been brought before this House and to say the least it is disappointing in its content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one realises that almost three-and-a-half years have been spent, we are led to believe, by a unit of the Minister's Department working specifically on this subject and the implications of this subject, one is amazed at the omissions of this Bill rather than <Col N="336" /> its contents.  I fully support the idea of humanising the workplace and of giving greater incentive and greater encouragement to involvement of people in that workplace at all levels. I believe this involvement must play an important part in our future society, and I would go further and say that the success or failure of modern society will depend to a large extent on how we solve the problem of the interrelationship between employment, remuneration, working conditions, environment, education, health and leisure.</P>
    <P>Despite the recession, we cannot postpone attemps to solve issues of this nature.  The public should be made aware, not only those who work in industry but people generally, that the time has come for this type of involvement to be created at all levels of society, even outside of State enterprise. There is a danger of a lethargic or complacent approach to this question. The Minister, in his opening remarks, said that approximately 50,000 workers had participation in the State companies referred to.  However, it is important that all the workers involved in these companies should be conversant with and interested in the development of worker participation of a meaningful nature.  Such worker participation is not contained in this measure.  This is just a window-dressing operation, an effort by this Minister and his Government to fulfil one of the points in the 14-point programme announced three-and-a-half years ago.  It bears little relation to a system of worker participation which would give individuals within a company proper involvement in decisions affecting their working lives.  What this Bill is doing is giving worker participation in State companies at board level only without taking into consideration structures that exist in some companies and without involving workers at management level.  In building a house you start with the foundations, build the walls and then put on the roof. I submit that in many of the State companies mentioned, the Minister is putting on the roof and from there on he is probably asking companies where works councils are not effectively <Col N="337" /> operating, where workers are not meaningfully involved, to go ahead and put the walls and foundations under it. It is questionable whether such a structure can survive or benefit the employees of such companies.</P>
    <P>In the first half of 1975 our party issued a paper on the subject of worker participation at vital decision-making level.  The paper outlined our views on the works council concept and its involvement from there to board level.  The subsequent documents on the subject issued by congress and by the EEC Commission contained much of what we had outlined, and it is generally accepted by all bodies who have studied the subject that board level participation will not work unless development of participation at the lower levels is undertaken first.</P>
    <P>Much discussion has been devoted to this subject for many years.  Lip service has been paid to it by too many people and by too many organisations and I suspect that people may fear they are conceding certain functions.  I agree with the Minister that the time has come to take action.  I would be the first to agree that you cannot entirely legislate for worker participation, that all you can do basically is to create a climate within certain guidelines and, perhaps most important of all, give encouragement in that direction.  I believe that in this Bill the Minister has missed the opportunity of doing something constructive not only for the workers but for the State companies referred to.</P>
    <P>This legislation leaves a lot to be desired.  I would like to quote from a speech by the Minister delivered on 14th July, 1974, at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' second annual summer course in Cork where, among other things, he said:</P>
    <P>I am among those who would reject any suggestion that worker representation on the boards alone of itself brings significant change in the position of workers in industry or the extent of their influence over the management process.</P>
    <P>He agreed then that confining <Col N="338" /> worker participation to boards of directors was not enough and in view of what he said then it is hard to understand why the Bill does not give worth-while recognition to the bodies, particularly those among the seven mentioned where there has been a reasonable level of participation. Some of it has been very satisfactory and I would compliment those concerned, referring specifically to companies such as B &amp; I and Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann.  As a result of the measure before us we do not know to what extent there will be links between existing works councils and boards of directors.</P>
    <P>On the same subject I should like to quote from a bulletin of the Council of Europe, the second of 1974, &ldquo;Forward in Europe&rdquo;, page 25 where it refers to resolution 564 and says:</P>
    <P>Member States are urged to introduce legislation based on a number of guiding principles.  Works committees must be given full and adequate information on the operation of the company and its financial results.  All firms employing more than 50 persons must have works councils elected by the employees and exerting real influence on decisions. All companies employing more than 1,000 people must have a supervisory board at least one-third of whose members would represent the employees.</P>
    <P>One must see the continuity of this structure.  The great omission in the Bill is that there is no reference to training and education.  Yet the Minister in that speech in Cork referred to the election of directors and stated:</P>
    <P>I am submitting proposals to the Government on the whole field of worker participation including provision of the necessary funds for training and education.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed there, but there is no reference to this very important matter in the Bill.  In this measure there could be a second benefit for the country generally but specifically for the companies mentioned because the Minister is referring to restructuring boards.  I would not be one-sided in saying that <Col N="339" /> not only should there be education and training for the worker directors on those boards but also for the traditional type of director of whom the vast majority were excellent people and had attributes and capabilities or some gift to contribute to their boards.  A few were appointed perhaps because they were political supporters of one party or another.  My greatest objection to such an appointee would be as regards qualifications.  I would not question closely his political affiliations or even the fact of there being a reason for his appointment if I thought he had something worth while to offer.  I would forgive him any such involvement if he had a worthwhile contribution to make.  The restructuring of State boards mentioned in section 23 of the Bill which will be brought about through the involvement of workers gives the Minister the opportunity to provide training and education for worker directors and equally for the selection of members or directors on the other side of the spectrum who should be qualified or selected for some specific contribution they can make to the board and perhaps a certain amount of educational training given to them so that they could best use their qualifications or talents for the benefit of the State company.  There is a second area of benefit for the State bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the omission of any reference to training or education in the Bill.  We have a vast number of people involved in the seven enterprises mentioned and many of those at different levels in the company structure would like the opportunity of being nominated and participating at least in the elections for directors of these boards.  In regard to this educational training I should like to know from the Minister what Government funds have been made available for this purpose, to whom they have been given and to what useful purpose they have been put up to date.  This involvement of the entire work force would at least give the opportunity to anybody among those interested of securing education and training.  Obviously, there are fields with which the majority of workers <Col N="340" /> will not be familiar.  They will have to get an opportunity, for example, of being able to read financial results, budgets, forecasts and projections and know what these are all about.</P>
    <P>I believe many workers in State enterprises would have much to contribute from their practical experience. The danger is that that involvement in State boards alone is not enough because too often those boards are concerned with forward policy-making but the major decisions affecting the conditions of the worker are made at levels of management where we must have involvement in all of those State bodies.  I mentioned B &amp; I and CSE as having reasonably good structures of work councils.  We also have the reports issued by the working parties on Aer Lingus and the ESB recommending first level works councils. There is encouragement in these reports but there is no such encouragement, no such hope given in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to communications. The Bill has a few sections dealing with the appointing of directors, the reconstitution of the board, how these directors are nominated and the nominating bodies concerned.  Then it goes into great detail regarding the operation of the election and the organisation of it. Some of this detail could well have been left to the discretion of the returning officer because he is being given certain powers, powers which I question, yet the Bill goes into a lot of detail in regard to his specific duties in organising the election.</P>
    <P>Yesterday morning I listened to a radio programme on the primary school boards of management.  The point was made that there was no communication between the parents' representatives and the parents.  The reply was given that although they were elected by the parents they had no specific function to report to the parents and were not under any obligation to do so.  I do not want to see a similarly remote appointment of directors completely removed from the workers they are supposed to represent on the board.  If that were the case the system would break down completely. I accept that there are certain <Col N="341" /> areas of secrecy regarding company policy that they would have a duty to remain silent on for the benefit of the company.  I believe the Minister must involve himself in these areas, difficult though they may be.  Unlike the boards of management of the primary schools, he must have specified functions that can be followed by the people themselves.</P>
    <P>The next omission is difficult to understand.  Seven designated bodies are referred to in the Bill.  The appropriate Minister for Bord na Móna, CIE and the ESB is the Taoiseach. The appropriate Minister for the Sugar Company is the Minister for Finance. The appropriate Minister for Nitrigin Éireann is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The appropriate Minister for Aer Lingus and B &amp; I is the Minister for Transport and Power.  I should like the Minister to tell me why many other State bodies have not been involved.  In his opening remarks the Minister said that the criteria followed in selecting the designated bodies included operations of a commercial or quasi-commercial nature involving a medium to fairly high level of technology and the existence of developed trade union/management relationships. Why have Irish Steel Holdings Limited not been included?  They would appear to meet the necessary criteria.  Why have Irish Shipping Limited not been included, particularly in view of the fact that B &amp; I have been included? We had a row in this House last year because Irish Shipping placed an order for the building of ships in Japan. Why not consider worker participation on the RTE Authority?  Some excellent people have been with RTE since its inception and they could make a very useful contribution to the well-being of that authority.  No doubt the Minister has his own reasons for the selection of seven but I find it hard to understand why some bodies were omitted.  I fail to see any difference between B &amp; I and Irish Shipping. I do not know why Irish Steel holdings have not been included when the Irish Sugar Company have been included. For the last six months all the State companies have been listed on the Dáil Order Paper.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to section 11, <Col N="342" /> which stipulates the nomination of directors.  I take the point made by the Minister that it was important that the trade union movement be involved in any approach to worker participation, but I am not happy with the final set-up as a result of section 11.  We are told that the nominating bodies can be a trade union or a qualified body. It appears that a qualified body is one that engages in collective bargaining. The first question one must ask is: are we excluding certain persons in those companies at middle management level?  I believe we cannot afford to do so.  The Minister will say that this is not the case because the section does not stipulate that it must be a union member so nominated.  The reality is that a qualified body or trade union will naturally nominate one of their own members.  One could then ask: is it in breach of section 40 of the Constitution in relation to the rights of the individual?  Are we depriving a number of people who could, of course, if they so wished, join one of the qualified bodies concerned?  They may not wish to do so.  To have it meaningful to all workers no worker must be barred from being nominated, if he is qualified as a candidate for election to a board.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects about section 11 that I am not happy about. For example, in the case of CIE&mdash; I agree this is probably the extreme case&mdash;there are 36 unions representing 17,900 employees and one could assume that three or four members will be elected to that board, but that would be a very small representation for so many workers.  If the &ldquo;constituencies&rdquo; are defined by the trade union or qualified body nominating we must consider if this will give greater strength or chance to the representatives of a big union being nominated. Will the big union have an advantage over the small union in having one of its members elected to a board?  Secondly, is it fair that a big union with a large percentage of the membership should have the opportunity of nominating only one person?  I should like to have the Minister's views on why he did not look at the principle of representation on a different basis, possibly by a certain <Col N="343" /> percentage of the workers having the right to nominate a person.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the concerns mentioned.  In the ESB there are 18 unions and about 10,500 employees.  Those employees are based in Dublin and at least 12 other centres throughout the country.  Did the Minister take into consideration the possibility of ensuring Dublin and provincial representation on that board? Did he take into consideration the possibility of having the various sections of the ESB represented, the generating section, the transmission section, the distribution section and so on?  I am worried that the strong union has a better chance of their representative being elected to the board and that a Dublin based member has a better chance of winning at the expense of a member elsewhere. We can also express a similar view about the sugar company.  Our sugar factories are located in different parts and there are a number of food plants. Was any consideration given of how they would be represented?  I am not confining my remarks to geographical representation.  There are many workers involved and it is imperative that this Bill gets the scrutiny it deserves for the successful development of worker participation in industrial democracy within our society.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil is still in being, I will have an opportunity of going into these points in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I am concerned about the preliminary poll and the necessity for it. I should like to know what would happen if a crank group, anxious to disrupt the election process or the introduction of worker participation, sought support and reached the 15 per cent of the work force needed.  I would not like these people having such an opportunity and I would ask the Minister to guard against it.  The Minister's explanation was reasonable to the extent that some group of workers would be given the opportunity of saying they do not want this.  However, I would hate to see a crank group getting the opportunity of upsetting the operation of this and putting a certain amount of cost on the designated body who must bear the cost of the election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> The Bill went into great detail about election procedures but left a number of points hanging in mid-air.  I am referring to the polling day arrangements and making it easy for workers to cast their votes.  Aer Lingus employees could be in different parts of the world at the time of an election and CIE long distance haulage drivers might be outside the country, certainly they would be far away from their depot.  I hope the Minister will consider giving these people the opportunity of voting at their depot, supervised by the staff of the returning officer.  I was surprised to see the Minister giving so much power to the returning officer.  I am referring to subsection (4) of section 11 where the returning officer has the power to disqualify a candidate's nomination. That subsection states:</P>
    <P>...he shall rule that the nomination is invalid and his decision shall be final and shall not be appealable.</P>
    <P>I question the wisdom of that.  If the returning officer is a company secretary of the designated body and if he is aware of an individual who may have created problems he should not be able to prevent such a worker being nominated. I fear that subsection could be used to disqualify an individual in certain circumstances.  I must stress that I accept the majority of the people involved are responsible.</P>
    <P>That sums up most of my points. I look forward to going into this Bill in more detail on Committee Stage. I want to hear from the Minister on the important section with which I am not pleased.  It is not enough to say that three or four people will be representing, say, the ESB 10,500, CIE 17,900, B &amp; I 1,500, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann 3,500, Aer Lingus 4,000, Bord na Móna 4,200 and NET 10,500 which will grow.  Bord na Móna spread from Ballincorrig to the east coast.  Why did the Minister not give some consideration to representation between certain areas of the country rather than in Dublin and the provinces as I suggested earlier in relation to CIE or the ESB?</P>
    <P>There are many workers who should be represented.  It is imperative that this measure be seen to work effectively and produce results for State <Col N="345" /> bodies and to create better and more harmonious relationships within those bodies.  The Minister is taking an onerous load on his shoulders.  He should not push through this measure without being absolutely satisfied that he selects the best method.  I am not suggesting he does not have good reasons for his proposals but I would like him to spell out for me, in the interests of the success of this measure and of making a worthwhile contribution to the semi-State bodies mentioned, why he did not select other ways and means of nominating.  Many different combinations could be used and it is important that the right one be used from the outset.  If the Minister is happy with his proposal and can explain it to me, that will be all right but, as I said, I would like his reasons spelled out in greater detail than anything he said in his opening comments.</P>
    <P>Communication, training and education are of vital importance to the success or failure of this scheme. Government funds must be made available, if necessary, towards education and training so that these people can take their places and make an important contribution at board level representing the people&mdash;at what area of the shop floor does not matter.</P>
    <P>Let me again refer to the exclusion of certain people.  Nobody should be excluded.  This is a new venture for this country.  It is not as I would like to see it; far from it.  To me the end result has been a disappointment but it is important because it is the first measure of this kind to pass through this House.

      <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue.  The only way we will stabilise industrial relations is by proper communication. One of the ways to communicate is to have workers on the board.  They will know what is happening and management will know how workers are thinking.  This is very important. This is only a start because much has been done in the area of industrial relations.  I listened to the Opposition grudgingly saying that this was <Col N="346" /> something worth while.  Industrial democracy has been operating throughout Europe for over 50 years. Fianna Fáil were in power for a long time but they did not do anything about this.  Therefore, when one hears this kind of criticism from them one must treat it with a certain amount of contempt.</P>
      <P>This Bill must be treated very seriously. In welcoming it, I suggest we look at the whole area of industrial relations and start at the shop floor. Shop floor participation must be encouraged. We should also look at works councils and at what we can do to ensure that there will be the necessary communication.  Then we must look at the board and board participation from the workers' side.</P>
      <P>It could be said that the trade union movement has been dragging its feet in industrial democracy.  In my view, the unions have not put their weight behind it, possibly because they feel it might weaken their power. Any power group, including politicians, are always nervous of somebody trying to impose his view on them.  If we look at this from ground level, council works level and management level and get that three-tier system operating, I believe that would take a tremendous load of the day-to-day operations off the trade union movement.  As politicians we know that if we could arrange for our day-to-day activities to be done by somebody else, we could give more time towards encouraging and developing a better attitude towards industrial democracy, encouraging management to re-equip, to educate workers and to do a series of developments that would increase productivity, profits and wealth in which the workers would themselves participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we like it or not the worker is basically concerned with his take-home pay and how he can improve it.  Both management and unions must concern themselves with improving productivity.  That is an area to which the Minister will no doubt apply his mind.  Obviously, he is doing so even now.  The Minister's Department is monitoring industrial disputes.  With the right type of structure <Col N="347" /> in industry there would be no need for such monitoring.  The possibility of a dispute would manifest itself at an early stage and at that stage it could be taken care of with no dislocation to the economy.  Those countries in Europe which are progressive, where standards of living are high and monetary systems are not being daily devalued, are those countries which over the years have introduced into their economies worker participation.  In these countries there are no petty disputes. The overall concern is with the health of the economy and its continued well-being.</P>
    <P>Over the last 30 years it has been regrettable that at no stage did this country do anything to introduce a progressive attitude towards worker participation in industry.  Opposition Members can say little about this Bill other than that it is a step in the right direction.  Some may say that we have been three years in Government and are only now taking this step.  But this is a whole new venture and I believe that in due time we shall have further essential legislation in this area.  For too long this area has been the Cinderella of industry.  Trade disputes effect us all but so far we have failed to take the whole area of industrial relations seriously.  This is a first step, but it is only a first step.  It marks the introduction of a new philosophy in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>We inherited many good things from Britain.  We inherited their parliamentary system and their legal system.  One thing we did not inherit was their trade union system which was born out of an industrial revolution.  But we, unfortunately, adopted their trade union system and we have had to pay the penalty for that mistake.  It is time we shook off the shackles and evolved our own system designed to meet the needs of our industrial development.  This Bill deals only with semi-State organisations but I believe the message will go out that this legislation is not necessarily intended only for semi-State organisations.  Only when we <Col N="348" /> organise industry on a proper basis with the right types of dialogue between management and worker will we really know where we are going.</P>
    <P>We are a small homogenous nation. We have to work together.  The world is in a state of economic crisis.  Those nations with the right type of approach to industry are standing up to the economic blizzard.  In fact, some are relatively unaffected by it.  I see no reason why we cannot achieve the same objective. We are a young nation and we can evolve proper industrial relations and, in doing so, develop a keen sense of competitiveness and a keen sense of awareness of the problems that face us as against the selfish attitude of always asking: &ldquo;What is in it for me?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is only a first step.  The previous speaker spoke about the education of the workers.  I believe our work force is quite well educated.  I believe they have sufficient intelligence to get themselves elected to negotiating bodies.  I am not too concerned about education. In fact, I would be afraid that anything of that sort would create a privileged class within the work force and only that privileged class would be elected to boards of management.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, our work force are dedicated.  When elected to the board they will be able to look after themselves and the interests of their fellow workers.  If a company is making profits the workers will benefit.  I should like to ask the Minister to talk about the whole question of profit sharing and possibly to consider how he could give the right incentives to encourage profit-sharing.</P>
    <P>This whole area of industrial relations is to do with the right attitude. We must leave behind us the day of the &ldquo;they&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;talking across the table&rdquo;.  We need a new attitude of togetherness to develop our nation in a patriotic sense.  We need to get our industries working efficiently and then talk about sharing out the profits and dividends.  A man who invests his money in a company receives a profit.  Like the shareholder, the worker is giving his time, his life, his sweat to that same company and <Col N="349" /> I believe he is also entitled to receive profit.  The Fine Gael Party have always advocated this and we have had policies on industrial democracy before.  We did not wait until 1975 to bring out a paper on industrial democracy.  The Fine Gael Party have always been concerned about the right of the worker to participate in management, in profits, to give of his best and accept responsibility. Only in this way can we achieve any worthwhile economic goal.</P>
    <P>There was some talk about elections to the boards.  This must be done in the democratic way.  The workers will select, nominate and elect to the board the men they want.  There may be groups who may feel isolated. There are minority groups in our society today who put themselves forward for election to this House but they do not receive enough support to be elected.  I do not think the existence of minority groups can be used as an argument.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said that elected representatives might become remote from the workers.  Any member of this House knows exactly what happens if he becomes remote from his constituents.  The same thing will happen to the worker elected to the board.  Elections will be held from time to time and the workers will have their say.  The people elected to the board will not be elected for ever and I have confidence that the workers will have the good sense to elect people who will represent them well.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a balance of power on boards of management.  It is not enough to have just worker representation on the board.  These representatives must assert themselves and must have a strong voice and should from time to time have control. This might horrify some people but I believe it is only common sense. I have heard it said that one or two workers on a board can be talked down and ignored and this is something we must seek to prevent.</P>
    <P>While this Bill relates only to the boards of semi-State bodies, it is a start towards conducting industrial relations in a civilised way.  There must be dialogue and workers must <Col N="350" /> know exactly what is happening within their industry.  Every year shareholders receive the annual report; how many workers receive a copy?  None of them.  They are not considered to be people who should get these reports.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement is, in my view, the most conservative body in Ireland.  This used to be said of the Church but the Church is much more radical today than the trade union movement.  It is time for trade unions to consider what they can do to give our society a better way of life.  Their obligation is to society.  The obligation of any organisation like the NFA is to the general body of the people and not the self interests of society.  The last speaker opened his speech by referring to constitutional crises and the problems we have today. This Bill is not about constitutional crises or the problems we have today. The only constitutional crisis I can recall is the one we had in 1970 when Ministers were dismissed.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am sorry I had to bring this matter in.  I believe the Opposition are bringing this matter in to suit their own purpose. Fianna Fáil were there for 16 years and did nothing about industrial relations and if they were there another 16 years they would do nothing about the matter.  It took the Coalition Government just three years to bring this Bill in.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation may be described as a first effort to give expression to a subject which has exercised the minds of many people in the past.  This subject, under the broad term of workers democracy, proved very useful as a talking point. But I found, when I was Minister for Labour, that when one gets down to the basics of trying to formulate policy under the general heading of workers democracy one finds hundreds of proposals, all different.  This is one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very much in favour of workers' democracy but perhaps our concept might be different from what others visualise.  We saw workers' democracy, if it could be ideally instituted, as a source of bringing together the social partners&mdash;workers and employers&mdash;in mutual understanding by involvement leading to the benefit of <Col N="352" /> both and eliminating industrial strife, thereby contributing to the general wealth of the nation as a whole.  I would go as far as to say that neither this nor any other nation will ever achieve any worth-while measure of greatness unless there is absolute co-operation between workers and employers to generate the necessary wealth to put the country in the position in which so many other nations find themselves having had that same measure of co-operation.</P>
    <P>Workers democracy, as we see it, is capable of doing this if ideally instituted. Over the years people have seen this in many different ways.  Some felt it was a take over by workers, putting the boss in his box, so to speak, declaring the policy to suit the workers only.  Others advocated different types of workers democracy.  The symposium to which the Minister has referred, in which he took part, contained papers read by eight or nine people all advocating different systems and none quite agreeing on any particular system. Some advocated sharing in the profits, others advocated that shares would be allocated to employees who were a certain number of years in employment, others believed in the bonus system.  Some advocated board membership, which is what we are doing here.  These are only some of the many ways of worker participation which have been advocated.</P>
    <P>While Deputy O'Brien gave a recital of clichés, he made one or two truthful statements.  He said that the trade unions did not evince any particular anxiety to move towards a genuine workers' democracy.  I am not sure if the system we are enunciating now is the best of all that have been advocated by different people over the years.  It is certainly the easiest to bring in.  I am greatly concerned about whether or not it will have the effect which everybody desires, particularly since it is being tried out on the State-sponsored bodies, which are a totally different proposition to the private company and private enterprise.  One could visualise as the ideal situation one where workers participating in a company in which they are employed look on it as their own company, in which they are a part, having a knowledge <Col N="353" /> of all the eccentricities, all the difficulties, the way to success, how better profits could be made, how the output could be improved and unit costs reduced, all redounding to their benefit as much as to the boss's.</P>
    <P>This is real worker participation which could completely eliminate industrial strife and lead to vastly improved output and competitive production capable of competing against other countries who already have the benefit of this type of worker democracy. I am not too sure whether the boys down on the floor will be happy just because there are a few of their number upstairs on the board.  I am not quite clear as to what extent they will communicate with the people who elect them to the board.  How do they report back?  To what extent would the other workers feel they are involved in decision making?  To what extent will they be aware of the progress or failures of the company, or market prospects, of unit costs and of marketing competitiveness, which are the things which lead to the success of a company?  No worker wants to be attached to a company that is failing.  If we are put in a position where we would have part of the responsibility for the success so much the better.</P>
    <P>The election to the board of the State-sponsored companies by one-third the number of directors and the boards being reconstituted by a complexity of trade unions&mdash;which will lead to very much increased overheads&mdash;is not the ideal method of worker participation.  The last speaker referred to workers democracy in other countries.  In Germany where there are three or four unions it is easy to understand them operating a system of worker participation, but compare that with this country where we have almost 100 unions.  The experiment is well worth trying but I am pessimistic of its outcome.  Will it have the effect of creating better industrial relations?  Will it be of benefit to the workers as well as the employers? All those in private enterprises should seriously study and adopt some system of worker participation because if it can lead to their having a continuous <Col N="354" /> flow of production without interruption by strikes, if it can lead to the workers getting a better income and better conditions generally, both parties will be amply rewarded.</P>
    <P>The employer will be in a position to discuss his unit costs with his workers, and generally the whole set up should have that family atmosphere which would only lead to mutual success.  I wonder if the State-sponsored companies are the best companies in which to try this out.  State-sponsored companies are often accused of allowing Parkinson's Law to operate unlimited, and it is a known fact that corporations are not personally motivated by the profit making motive and never fail to overload their organisations with executives.  Complaints have come before this House that the salaries of State-sponsored executives are unknown, and that they are not accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The present Government gave an undertaking before the election that these companies would be made accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General by some means, and the only thing we have got in that respect since, was the promise of an all-party committee which would have statutory powers in relation to State-sponsored bodies.  The members of that committee, as far as I am aware, have not been appointed.  It would be a step in the right direction although it would not completely fulfil the Government's pre-election promise.  Lest the Ceann Comhairle might think I am digressing I am referring to that matter so that the directors now being appointed to State-sponsored bodies could perform the function of examining how the State-sponsored bodies are controlled. They could do a lot to ensure that the necessary economies are effected, that a better system is evolved and they could generally contribute to the improvement of the conduct of the companies to which they have been appointed as directors.  That task would not, to the same extent, devolve on them if they were in private companies, but if they are to take the view that their only interest in the company is to ensure that they get all that is possible out of it, then we will not be <Col N="355" /> achieving in the interests of our worker democracy what has been suggested we can achieve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald rightly referred to education and to training in the knowledge of the task which will have to be performed.  Those of us who are not skilled in a particular direction can hardly expect to take on a job without some training and this would apply to persons appointed as directors. Training would enable them to see that demanding too big a slice of the cake could ultimately lead to the curtailment of the company's activities, could ultimately lead to fewer people being employed, contribute to inflation and generally would not create the industrial atmosphere conducive to the production of wealth, about which we have been speaking.  This is the type of training that the people who will be appointed will require.  While there is nothing in the Bill about that, there is nothing in it to preclude the Minister from having these people attend at the Irish Management Institute or some other such source of information and training to equip them for the important work they will have to do.  If they interpret their role as directors as one of providing worker democracy or worker participation, then they have a mighty task to perform; but if they look on it as a means of promoting the interests of the worker only, irrespective of what effect it might have on the running of the firm, on the unit costs, or on the efficiency of the firm, then they are not fulfilling the best requirements of worker democracy as we visualise them.  It is for that reason that some training should be provided for those who will take on the important role of directors even in the State bodies.</P>
    <P>The method of appointment could be an involved one, and it may be possible to devise a means of simplifying it.  One can easily see how it could lead to jealousies and efforts to put forward candidates in competition with each other, which would not create a good atmosphere among the workers concerned.  A large number of unions will be involved in some undertakings, some of them much stronger than others. <Col N="356" /> In the case of a contest where more than the requisite number are nominated, will the strength of the union prevail to ensure that only their nominees will be accepted?</P>
    <P>To what extent will the returning officer, who will be the secretary of the company or somebody appointed by him, be in a position to have things so arranged that all sections of workers governed by different unions will feel that, as a result of the election of the directors to the board, they are adequately represented? Or will they feel they have lost out? This could present the secretary of the company with a task as great as if not greater than that of seeking to establish proper relationship under the present system with his workers and to obviate industrial strikes in the firm.  The preparation for elections among a complex of unions could lead to a difficult situation.  It might have been better if the Bill provided that somebody else remote from the company would be the person to take on what could be the onerous duties of returning officer.  It is a situation I can foresee as creating a certain amount of strife that would not be to the benefit of better relations between the workers themselves and between the workers and the firm.</P>
    <P>Let us say that two directors have been elected to the board of CIE from among the workers and they participated in board meetings.  There are thousands of employees in different places throughout the country.  To what extent will it improve the industrial relations in the State corporations?  To what extent will it contribute to better relations between workers and management that these two members have been fortunate in securing election to the board for which they will be paid directors' fees for the three years they will be members?  The extent to which it will improve relations will depend on the communication lines that are established between them as representatives of the workers on the board and the workers themselves throughout the country.</P>
    <P>To what extent will they be in a position to convey to their fellow <Col N="357" /> workers who have elected them as board members how things are being done, how losses are accumulating, the extent to which that corporation will have to go to the Exchequer for a subvention to make up the deficit at the end of the year? To what extent will they be able to encourage the workers to make a better effort to eliminate the deficit? To what extent will they be able to pinpoint the weaknesses that lead to the inefficiency that causes a deficit to be there, or to what extent will they contribute generally to the welfare of the whole corporation that will create that mutual agreement and partnership which will lead to the success of the corporation as a whole?  If this success can be achieved, then this experiment in worker democracy will be well worth while.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to visualise that ideal situation developing from the effort we are engaging in here.  As I said at the outset, this is one of the forms that worker democracy can take, but to what extent it can succeed is difficult to see.  It has this definite disadvantage, that directors on the State board will not have the same incentive to co-operate with the board as they might have with a private board.  The private company is established by one or more people who invest a certain amount of money, register a company and proceed to a particular operation &mdash;for example, a manufacturing operation.  In a manufacturing operation particular skills are required in relation to the raw material, and special marketing skills in order to sell the goods.  Of course the indispensable link between the raw material and the marketing of the goods is the quality control to produce a quality that is in standard and price capable of competing with what the other firm is producing.  These are the ingredients which tend to create success for a company and give those who invest their money a reasonable return.</P>
    <P>We are asking the workers to take a greater interest in what the boss is doing, how his investment is being handled.  We propose doing it in this <Col N="358" /> workers' democracy system by having them elect a few members to the board.  Will these members succeed in getting other workers to appreciate the need for absolute co-operation and understanding in regard to the whole conduct of the company leading to its general success?  To what extent will they take an interest in raw materials, efficient methods of manufacture and marketing?  These are the important things which the board must always watch.  The chief executive will report from time to time on where he finds difficulty and where he is meeting success.  The task of the new directors is gigantic and if it can succeed in producing wealth and eliminating industrial strife and improve the lot of the employer and employee through mutual understanding, then it is an excellent and highly commendable undertaking and this is a very important piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>This is only one of the many ways in which workers' democracy may be expressed.  I think it is the least effective of all ways.  It is perhaps the easiest to implement but could have the least desirable effects so far as our concept of workers' democracy is concerned.  Our concept may be different from that of other people. Some may see it as a means for workers to promote their own interests, improve their incomes and conditions. We see it as a means of mutual understanding between employers and employees leading to greater output, more efficiency and more wealth for the nation and a more contented society without which real progress cannot be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien referred to our failure to produce anything like this in our time; that is a common practice when you speak on the other side of the House.  There was no great demand for it.  It is an open secret that if you have real success in workers' democracy the need for trade unionism is vastly diminished.  A successful workers' democracy could get on without any trade union and it is quite possible that may be why there was never any great pressure applied to bring about a workers' democracy except by those who considered it to be a system by <Col N="359" /> which the workers took over complete control and told managers to step aside. That is not our conception of workers' democracy; ours is one of mutual respect and understanding and co-operation and complete harmony between the social partners.  This system is well worth while and its progress will be worth watching.  It will have to be monitored and very quickly it will become evident whether it is having the desired effect which I think would be the elimination or minimising of industrial strife.  It would be too much to expect that putting a couple of lads on the board would eliminate industrial strife but if it can in some way diminish the industrial strife we have been accustomed to, it will have a measure of success.  If they are to have real mutual understanding of problems between the social partners this measure of worker participation is not sufficient. I do not think it would make the boys on the floor happy to know that two of them may go upstairs and sit on the board.  We would need something more.</P>
    <P>A wise manager in private enterprise would call his workers together and formulate his own worker participation system, telling them: &ldquo;We are all in this together.  The more profit I make the more money you will get consistent with our ability to have a sound reserve and to be able to expand and employ more people and produce efficiently and generally earn real success.&rdquo;  Some employers involve their workers to that extent.  It is not unknown in small firms particularly that when an employee has been employed for a number of years and reaches the stage when he can be regarded as indispensable he is given shares and made a director.  I know many such cases and the wise board or employer will do this.  The same applies to all workers&mdash;not those who came in yesterday.  Under this Bill a period of three years' employment is fixed.  I would have that requirement because by that time a worker will know whether within the concern there is or there is not a career for him. If he has made up his mind that he can look forward to security and to the fulfilment of his capabilities and have job satisfaction in what he is doing, having a thorough knowledge <Col N="360" /> of and feeling himself to be part of the concern for which he works, he is then well qualified to be included in any scheme of worker participation designed to succeed and bring the desirable effects envisaged.</P>
    <P>One might say we over emphasise the importance of this legislation but I do not think so.  It gives expression to something that, under the general term of workers' democracy, has been discussed for years in many different ways and about which many people have different views.  Very often it was just something to flog at a labour conference in general terms as the ideal solution to all the ills of the workers. When you got down to basic considerations&mdash;I had to examine it in my time &mdash;you found 20 different types of worker participation suggested to you, each advocate emphasising that his was the ideal one.  This is one system, the least effective one, but it is worth trying. If it has any measure of success in getting us out of the morass into which we have plunged, then it is worth trying.</P>

      <P>I have been preaching workers' democracy all my life.  I have tried to operate the idea on boards of co-operatives but I have not been successful.  Deputy Brennan is correct in that it is important to find the best system.  To have a few boys on the board who might get cocky when they get into the board room is not a workers' democracy.  One-third participation has been suggested for the State companies and that is all right.  I am worried about the method of election and the differences between the various trade unions involved in a company. I refer to the CIE board.  If you are only going to elect a third of the members, their election may cause friction among the workers in such a company as CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the operation of a workers' democracy by private individuals.  I know quite a number of private firms that have a workers' democracy and profit sharing. I remember the case of a man who has a lot of machinery.  I asked him if he worried about his business when he had to leave it for any length of time.  He said he did not worry <Col N="361" /> because it was in the interest of his workers to run the business during his absence.  He said: &ldquo;We do the job together.  We estimate the job and decide the amount of profit we must have to keep the business going.&rdquo;  No matter where that man is his workers know all about the business and what they must do to make a profit.  If the job is completed before the estimated time, the profit is shared between the men and the boss.  That is a perfect system.  I have been trying to have this kind of profit sharing system implemented by the co-operatives.  If the workers' representatives do not show the balance sheet of the company to the workers, they will put the system back years.</P>
    <P>I wish this Bill well, Sir, because it is an experiment.  There are various ways to have an industrial democracy. As Deputy Brennan says, the easiest way is to elect two or three workers to the board of directors.  A man who worked in an institution which was run by a county council told me that after every local election the officials would hold a meeting to consider the characters of the newly-elected members. The important point is that these men should genuinely represent the workers.  When I tried to introduce such a system to the co-operative movement, the trade unions opposed it.  They said it was their job to extract as much as they could for their workers.  This attitude is responsible for the chaotic condition of the country. I remember the workers of Irish Ropes working for three days without pay because their company had financial difficulties.  I have great faith in Irish workers and have always stood by them.  If the man on the floor knew that his company was not going well, he would put everything he had into it.  What has been happening is that the worker has not been aware of how the company is run.  More worker participation in the running of companies would eliminate strikes.  If this system works, there is the danger that trade unions will not be able to play as great a part in our society as they have in the past.  The trade unions played a vital part in getting justice for the workers.  I am a great admirer of Larkin and Connolly.  One of the <Col N="362" /> things I admired about the late Jim Larkin is that he was big enough to condemn a strike in Tuam.  During this strike in Tuam a large quantity of beet was left on the roadside to rot. That is the type of man I like; he puts his country and industry first and looks after his own business after that.  Anybody who does otherwise is not a good citizen.</P>
    <P>I am not biased against trade unions &mdash;I am very much in favour of them &mdash;but some of the trade unions are not in favour of worker participation because they feel they will not be as important in the situation as they are at present.  The demand for worker participation has not been widespread because most workers were only interested in collecting their weekly pay and did not want to know anything about the running of a company.  Such an attitude will have to stop.  Everybody will have to put their shoulder to the wheel in an effort to get the country moving, and that will be a tough job.  I have every confidence in Irish workers and I believe that if they are given the authority to look into the affairs of State companies they will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that our workers are informed about everything that is happening.  If that does not happen, the idea of worker participation will not succeed.  I would not like to see this idea failing. It is up to us all to convince the workers of the importance of worker participation.  I am worried about elections to such boards because there is a lot of rivalry among unions and if the wrong men are elected there will be a lot of bitterness. The rivalry among the unions is as bad as party politics.  I cannot suggest the best system for electing members to these boards but I believe that, if it was left to the workers to elect their representatives, it would be better.  Such representatives would have to be members of a union but an election on the basis I have suggested would be truly democratic.  I am closely associated with many workers and I will do all in my power to get this measure to work.  The Minister would <Col N="363" /> need to be careful about it.  If the men elected to the boards are not the right type of men for the job, we will not get the answer to industrial unrest.  I hope this Bill is the answer to this unrest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">

      <P>Seven State companies are listed in the Bill, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, B &amp; I, the Irish Sugar Company, CIE, ESB and Nítrigin Éireann.  These companies have been in existence for some time and it is only right that workers should have representation on those boards now.  I should like to ask the Minister if he considered adding An Bord Gáis to that list.  That company has just been formed and workers should have been allowed to participate in its infancy and future growth.  The central purpose of the Bill is to enable elections to be held to the seven State enterprises. Employees can be selected from the work force for appointment to the board.  I should like further expression of views as to how people can be nominated.  I would like to see a group of workers being given the opportunity of forming a nominating body so that they can put forward the name of a person they feel would have the ability and talent to represent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all interested in seeing that the best representatives of the workers and those who will be most beneficial to the development of the company are elected to the boards.  We want this to happen so that the companies will continue to thrive to the mutual benefit of all our people.  It is a wonderful opportunity for talented workers to be afforded the opportunity to develop their talents in a wider sphere.  This would be good for the workers.  It is possible that the ideas of such workers would help the company to advance.  A better understanding and harmony in these companies would bring about a reduction in the number of work days lost due to industrial unrest, and that would be very welcome. Perhaps the workers will be able to come forward with some idea which would do away with the alleged <Col N="364" /> abuses of certificates of illness.  The coming together of workers to join with people nominated from other sectors must lead to closer harmony and a better understanding in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope this will be successful and that there will not be any apathy among workers, many of whom have been vocal about the need for participation in the running of the company in which they are employed. Many require more than employment; they want involvement.  If worker participation on the boards will lead to more involvement of such people, it will be a good thing.  Any interaction of ideas or exchange of views emanating from the various sectors of a plant must be good and beneficial.  Thrashed out in a proper light and with proper understanding, and with everybody having as their target the advancement of the company, it would be an extremely good thing.  I hope that these will be some of the prime ideas people will keep in mind.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by Deputy Callanan that the wrong people might become members of boards by default, because they are the most vocal or because of a sense of apathy by most people.  Therefore I ask the Minister to consider the idea of nominating bodies.  Elections are good things and the wider the choice for the work force involved the better.  Is it envisaged that an election might take place in a trade union hall?  Is it envisaged that it will take place on the floor of the plant?  Will it be a postal vote?  What is in the Minister's mind?</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many people involved and a number of concerned workers said that after their days' work ended they get involved in their other interests and many might find it difficult to come back to a specific location to vote.  They hope that ballot boxes will be readily available at strategic points in each company premises.  Why does the Minister not add An Bord Gáis to the list?  I hope this Bill will lead to future prosperity for our companies.</P>

      <P>Any legislation which involves more people in decision <Col N="365" /> making must have a good influence in the industrial sector.  In his speech the Minister said that &ldquo;the company is no longer regarded as the exclusive property of the shareholders&rdquo;.  If that is a criticism of shareholders, we are starting off on the wrong foot.  What we should be seeking to provide in our industrial relationships is a partnership&mdash;the shareholder has his partners and the man on the factory floor has his partners.</P>
      <P>We should try to encourage this sense of partnership which will bring about better industrial relations&mdash;I like to call them human relations in industry.  Today things change so rapidly on the commercial and industrial scenes that we have to be very careful when legislating and take into account various aspects of our society.  Through the constitution of the companies we will provide the best people for the board, whether it be an executive of the firm or a man or woman working on the factory floor.</P>
      <P>Efforts were made by the previous Government to give worker participation on particular boards.  I remember one case where they appointed a very worthy man to the State board. Politically, he was diametrically opposed to the last Government, but to my mind he was one of the finest men in the country.  Because of a great deal of ignorant criticism he was forced to resign from the board.  When I saw the person who criticised that man taking his place on the board of the public concern, I felt very aggrieved that such a noble figure should be sacrificed to petty interests.  The argument put forward was that he had become part of the establishment&mdash;as if we were not all part of the establishment one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when discussing this legislation we will have the sense to ensure that whatever is good in the Bill will be adopted and if there are any parts which will not lead to a happier and more effective industrial scene, we should drop them.  I will go into these points in more detail at a later stage.  I do not know if I welcome this Bill fully, but I welcome it as a gesture, as a step on <Col N="366" /> the road towards better all-round relations and as a more effective structure of worker management.</P>
    <P>This is a small country and we do not have very many capitalists.  We cannot afford not to have an efficient management structure.  We are beginning to get some rewards for the aid we have given over the years to organisations like the IMI.  The Minister is introducing this Bill at a time when, I hope, any person he appoints to a State board will not be driven to resign because of ignorant criticism as happened to the man I mentioned.</P>

      <P>The reception for the Second Stage of this Bill has varied between what Deputy Fitzgerald would refer to as a kind of window-dressing and the Opposition Members who appreciate the relatively new area upon which we are entering with this legislation.  The debate reflects to some extent a confusion as to what is envisaged by the term &ldquo;worker participation&rdquo;.  It is a confusion not confined to this country. We have seen it reflected in the debate elsewhere on the same subject.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan seems to confuse it to some extent with a kind of worker democracy when he talks about profit sharing and so on and, drawing on his experience as a Minister, he talked about the many schools of thought in the area of worker democracy. We should clarify our minds about what is intended here.  The Bill is not intended as a first instalment on the road to worker democracy. It is seen as fundamentally solid progress towards the rescue and development of worker participation from the realms of theory into the realms of practice.  We must avoid the risk of underestimating the direction to be charted.  This is a very significant statutory step on the road to full worker participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made that it seems to be a very long time since an undertaking was given by this Government to legislate in this area.  Directly after the 1973 election I established a special unit in my Department to survey <Col N="367" /> the entire area.  There was a great deal of surveying to be done because we had no previous work to go on. No significant work had been done in this area.  There had been attendance at seminars and discussions but we had very little reliable information on which to proceed.  The first thing to do therefore was to set up a unit which would examine the whole area and see what should be done.  This special unit on worker participation was established and work proceeded.  A survey had to be carried out.  Data and statistics had to be collected with a view to selecting the most appropriate group for designation in this first piece of legislation. We had to eliminate certain companies and include others.  We had to set out the criteria on which we would proceed.  There was the question of geographic dispersal.  There was the question of the range of activities to be included with a bias towards those companies which had a manufacturing base.</P>
    <P>When that preliminary work was done we published our proposals in June, 1975.  This was just two years after we took office, and it is ironic to note that the proposals were criticised then as being hasty and ill-prepared. They were the subject of a good deal of discussion with trade unions and management in the State and semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering here that every Bill emanating from my Department has of necessity to be the product of consultation with both employers and trade unions.  This takes many months of discussion, mulling over the different points, limiting areas of disagreement and preserving areas of agreement.  Even after the most exhaustive scrutiny of the whole area and the selection of the industries we were really only at the start of our work of consultation, and anyone who understands the complexity of this area must realise that we proceeded with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>We are so often behind what happens in Britain in this area of industrial relations that I am glad to report that on this occasion we are <Col N="368" /> ahead, because the Bullock Committee are still sitting and there are no proposals for legislation in Britain as yet. It is a small point but it is something of which I am modestly proud.  We are, in fact, ahead of a government at work in this area long before we started.  That is the background to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The point was made that we should have made provision for the training of those who would become worker directors.  The present position is not one for complete satisfaction but it is worth noting that the Exchequer contribution towards education in this area has quadrupled over the past three years.  We have a long way to go, but there has been this marked improvement in State support of trade union education.  I believe the trade be given in future but, generally speaking, assistance has been given at a quite satisfactory level.</P>
    <P>I accept that Deputy Gene Fitzgerald is somewhat inhibited in his contribution by the kind of policy document he himself is working towards.  Worker participation appears to be the present policy of the party opposite.  The document issued in August, 1975, was put forward as a preliminary discussion document. There is as yet no policy statement by the Opposition on worker participation in industry.  If memory serves me correctly, when this document was published the Irish Congress of Trade Unions declared its ignorance of the document.  Congress had not been consulted.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is irrelevant.  I accept that the Opposition were inhibited in their reaction to the Bill by this discussion document on worker participation in industry, issued in August 1975.  As yet, there appears to be no final Fianna Fáil policy statement on this matter.  What we got from them was a six-page document, including the introduction, setting out a proposal to survey the whole area.  However, the only concrete proposal in it is that advocating the establishment of works councils or joint consultative committees.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the architects of that document were aware that this ground had been covered the previous year by a subcommittee of the Employer/Labour Conference whose discussion documents was published in January, 1974.  Perhaps inadvertently, Deputy Fitzgerald today gave the impression that the Employer/Labour Conference document owed its origin to Fianna Fáil work in this area.  Their policy document was published considerably later.  The Employer/Labour Conference document was endorsed by the annual delegate conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in July, 1976.</P>
      <P>On the type of mechanism we should seek to have in operation below board level, I have made it clear that I would welcome the development of works councils below boardroom level and it is interesting to note that the companies we have selected for legislative treatment here already have such councils. Aer Lingus have a works council and additional appropriate structures are under consideration there; in Bord na Móna we have conciliation councils at each works; in B &amp; I we have a works council; we have plant works committees in each of the sugar company plants; we have joint local committees in CIE.  We do not have any operating in NET.  There is a great variety of numbers and operations in the various bodies working at local and national level in each of the companies involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> This legislation will in no way prevent further development of the joint councils at present in operation and if it is judged appropriate by management and unions in these companies that we should have legislation on these matters, I will not discourage it in the least.  Indeed, I will welcome it.  As much as possible should be done to encourage local committees to operate in each of these companies.  However, at this point I believe it would be preferable that we should not legislate at this stage for the support structures because there is now too great a variety and insufficient agreement on how we should proceed in a legislative manner in these areas.</P>
    <P>Participation in structures below board level should be allowed to evolve in a flexible and pragmatic way with the agreement of those directly concerned and as they develop they should be suited to the needs of each enterprise.  I emphasise that the proposals we have put forward in this Bill have been supported by both sides in the enterprises in which this legislation will operate, that is, the unions and managements in the seven boards involved.  They all support, as a result of the consultations we have had with them, the proposals included in this measure.</P>
    <P>A question was asked as to why the legislation has been confined to seven companies.  The survey unit we established spent nearly two years examining the whole area as fully as possible before we published our proposals for legislation a year ago.  They were concerned to ensure that whatever selection of companies we made should be easily monitored and that when the legislation has been passed the unit in my Department will continue to monitor progress on the application of these provisions, how they operate in practice in the different companies.  We hope to learn from our experience.  To the greatest extent possible, we have tried to minimise the possibility of error in the implementation of the provisions, but as with any theory, once transformed into practice there is quite an amount we can further learn from its operation.  We wanted to <Col N="371" /> ensure that the number of companies this monitoring unit would examine would be a manageable group.  We believe we have achieved this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some companies not included were mentioned here, such as RTE, Irish Steel, Irish Shipping.  My answer is that we wished to select companies that have a manufacturing base.  We wished to have a manageable group of companies.  Those companies mentioned during the debate, based on our experience of the operation of the Bill in the companies selected, I would hope may be included in the next batch of companies to which this legislation could be extended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked about the secretary of a company being returning officer.  The Bill allows outsiders to be appointed, in section 7 (1) <i>(b).</i> Deputy Brennan was concerned that we were confining it to secretaries of companies.  Other arrangements can be made under the Bill.  Concern was expressed that workers' representatives on boards would be remote from workers, once elected.  A point was made that they should have the responsibility to communicate with the workers.  In general, the very vital task of communicating with workers is a responsibility of the entire board, not just the workers' representatives. It would be unfair to give the entire burden of communication to the worker-directors.  That is a job that must be carried out whether there are worker representatives or not.  On the point that they might become estranged from the workers, it must be remembered that they will be part-time and that in between board meetings they will be continuing their ordinary jobs on the factory floor, at desks or wherever they may be engaged in the enterprise.  We are not removing them from the areas in which they normally work.</P>
    <P>In between their board meetings they will continue their ordinary jobs on the factory floor, at desk or wherever else they work in the enterprise.  We are not removing them from the area they work in but are simply giving them the opportunity of <Col N="372" /> becoming worker directors with the support of their fellow workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien referred to balance of power at board level.  It must be understood that we are here arranging for worker directors to be elected to the board but it will be for the appropriate Minister to decide how a fair balance can be struck between the different interest groups and the rest of the nominations to the State boards.  Obviously, the activities of any State board are concerned with more than the workers.  I believe they have a big say, should certainly be consulted and should certainly be represented to the level we have mentioned of one-third. I also believe that consumer interests have a right to be represented on State boards and other interests, such as agricultural interests.  They all have a right to be represented on the boards of these companies.  It will be for the appropriate Minister to maintain whatever balance he believes necessary in the national interest as regards other appointments to the State boards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy asked why we did not include An Bord Gáis.  It would be inappropriate that a relatively new company should be brought into a scheme such as this.  One of the criteria we felt was necessary before we selected a particular company was that there was a well established negotiation position established between organised workers and management.  That is still not be the position in An Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>Queries were raised about polling day arrangements.  I intend to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to provide for postal ballots because this was mentioned in connection with polling day arrangements, and to facilitate overseas employees in companies such as Aer Lingus.  Those travelling abroad on any kind of work should be involved and should be entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Deputy Fitzgerald in relation to the preliminary poll about the danger of a crank group of 15 per cent, being able to call for a preliminary poll.  He saw the danger that an unrepresentative group could <Col N="373" /> prevent the greater majority getting the opportunities envisaged in this Bill.  I am not anxious to suggest to any employee who would be affected by this legislation that once both Houses of the Oireachtas have passed it that it is then a matter of imposing it in each particular firm.  I am anxious to ensure that in each firm there will be a double check, that if there was some opposition to the idea of it being implemented in the firm it would not be my intention that we should implement it in those circumstances. In fact, in a climate where it had less than enthusiastic support there would not be any point of continuing it. That is why I include the figure of 15 per cent as a check group to give them this initial right of consultation, give them the initial right to call for this preliminary poll.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that if a group represented 15 per cent of the potential electorate, that that is a sizeable number of employees.  It must be remembered for their intentions to be carried through the small groups would require the support of a significant body of workers to frustrate the operations of the Bill.  That is the reason why I have put this requirement into the legislation.</P>
    <P>A point was raised about ensuring Dublin and provincial representation on the boards.  It is fair to say that issues such as this are being discussed by the unions concerned.  My impression is that they are making informal arrangements to avoid the eventuality mentioned.  It would be too inflexible in practice if we were to include such criteria in the actual electoral procedure.  It has been necessary in the Bill to give certain requirements in regard to the election, polling day arrangements, returning officers, the criteria used in elections, the method of voting and so on but we can go too far in that direction and stifle any initiative which would make for easier acceptance of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A question was raised as to whether the big unions have an advantage over the small unions.  In a sense I suppose they have.  The unions are nominating bodies.  Somebody asked <Col N="374" /> the question: &ldquo;Is not what we are really after here the best people for these nominations?&rdquo; That is the problem in all elections.  It is also a problem in the context of worker participation.  People have a right to be wrong and the wrong people are often elected.  It is true that the numerically stronger unions would appear to have an advantage but it must not be forgotten that under section 11 (5) a union may endorse a candidate unlikely though it might be in practice, of another union.  My opinion is that whatever the limitations of nomination bodies at firm level the fact is that only the candidates who enjoy support, which we hope would be based on the respect of their peers at work, would be successful, whatever the size of the union which would originally nominate them.</P>
    <P>The point was raised in relation to the question of polling and detail that there are too many details left at the mercy of the returning officer.  Questions have been raised about some of the duties given to him in the Bill.  I have already indicated that certain criteria must be laid down in regard to elections because if we are to have the power to spell out in detail the regulations to be made by me about the conduct of elections in the seven companies, we require spelling out in detail up to a certain point.  That is necessary if I am to have the right in regulations to spell out details, after consultation with the unions and agreements between unions and management.  We wish to ensure, as far as possible, uniformity in all of the companies in which elections will take place.  This poses certain difficulties, as Deputies will realise.</P>
    <P>A question was asked on section 11 as to whether we are excluding middle management.  I should like to emphasise that staff associations are included but also that it is a fact that up to 90 per cent of employees in all of the seven companies selected are organised in trade unions up to and including management level.  It is not unconstitutional to confine the nominations to trade unions.  That is on the best legal advice available. As Deputies know, lawyers often <Col N="375" /> differ about interpretations of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to State-sponsored bodies and made the point that it was not perhaps the most appropriate area for the introduction of this legislation since the bodies concerned are totally different from the private sector.  The seven State bodies designated are all of a commercial nature and are closer to the private sector than perhaps the Deputy would allow.  We chose them with this commercial base so that private industry may learn from their success or lack of it and so that we may have, after some years of operation, systems of worker participation in the State sector which can be voluntarily borrowed in the private sector.  We may also, hopefully, look forward to the development of these below-board mechanisms which support participation structures such as works councils. One could look forward after a few years to the development in the State sector of a functioning board participation, by elected workers complemented by a works council operation which would include workers lower down, and therefore one could see almost a fully functioning worker participation system that could be easily borrowed by private industry. I do not think, therefore, that the industries we have chosen make it difficult for private industry to emulate them.</P>
    <P>I regard this Bill as one of the most significant pieces of legislation to be sponsored by me.  It joins other legislation that I have introduced or will be introducing shortly the overall objective of which is to improve the entire climate of human relations in the industrial sector.  Deputies ask if it will diminish the possibility of industrial disputes in those companies.  That is not the major objective in this legislation but I believe that will be a very beneficial side consequence of the introduction of this legislation.  This is a first step formally to recognise the legitimate aspirations of workers and enterprisers to participate in the making of decisions which vitally affect them, and it derives its primary importance in that it is the first statutory <Col N="376" /> expression in this House of that area of worker participation which we have been talking about for so long.  I have from the beginning rejected the idea of bringing into operation in this country the two-tier board system that we see operated in other countries.  Our traditions will best be served by concentrating first at the unitary board level, since our companies are organised on that principle.  It is important that we should begin with that system in mind.  It is my opinion the area in which we can proceed with greatest rapidity.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have criticised the delay they will appreciate the delay that would be attendant on a different approach.  If I had selected the entire area of private industry and State industry, as does the Opposition discussion document, and come forward with ambitious proposals for the entire area of companies in this country I would have been faced with the problem that our general company legislation would have to be amended. This would mean that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the business community could say to me with great justice: &ldquo;How can you amend Irish company law when in fact the European Community is commencing debate in this area and is formulating one uniform European company law?&rdquo; It is obvious that any other approach than the one I have selected would have lead to interminable delay and would have given no assurance of any progress being registered and would have left us back where we were for the last ten years&mdash;continual discussion with no actual working models that we could learn from.</P>
    <P>I have covered all of the main points that have been raised during the discussion but no doubt on Committee Stage we will return to points that Deputies have raised.  The passage of this legislation will not automatically see the provisions of the Bill being applied in the seven companies selected.  Further consultation with the organisations representing the employees and with the management of those companies will be necessary.  I assure the House if it appears superficially that there has been delay in the production of this legislation, that <Col N="377" /> no legislation in the area of the Department of Labour affecting employers and unions is successful unless it is the product of genuine consultation with all concerned.  The provisions of this Bill have been the subject of the most detailed consultation with those who would benefit from it. It is endorsed by both sides in the State enterprises concerned and I hope that this House will give the Bill a speedy passage.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the vital importance of a developing fishing industry to Ireland's economic development and of Ireland's legal and equitable rights, declares its total opposition to any future European Community common fishery policy which does not reserve exclusively to Irish fishermen a coastal zone of 50 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just before I stood up my colleague, Deputy Joe Brennan, gave me a piece of paper which purports to be a proposed amendment from the Minister. I do not know whether or not there <Col N="378" /> is an amendment.  I was informed some time this evening that the Government were considering putting down an amendment, but I could not get a copy of it, and I do not know whether what I have been given here represents that proposed amendment. If this is the case I must protest in the strongest possible manner for his not allowing us to have note of it considerably in advance of this debate. An amendment of this kind would represent a significant change in attitude on the part of the Minister. However, I shall say no more about it until such time as he may present it to us formally.</P>
    <P>In the first instance I wish to put this debate in its proper context.  Obviously our people generally are very much aware that at this time important eleventh-hour stage negotiations are being conducted on their behalf by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, negotiations which will affect vitally not only our fishing industry but, through that industry, the development of our economy in the years ahead.  For that reason it is essential that we here discuss something which has not been discussed already, namely, the basis of the case on which we rely to protect, first, our fishing industry and, through it our economy. Secondly, we must point out the legal, the equitable and the economic arguments which are cogent in terms of the motion before the House, a motion which accords with the argument the Minister has been making at the Community on our behalf, the argument for an exclusive 50-mile limit for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I should hope that this debate will have the effect of highlighting some points which may not have been presented already by the Minister and will highlight also the common stance on the part of all parties here.  This in turn will strengthen the Minister's position in bringing the negotiations to a conclusion.  We intend the debate to be used for that purpose and we trust that in considering the legal and economic implications of the situation very positive points will emerge.</P>
    <P>In order to put the whole question of this new fishery regime within the <Col N="379" /> Community in its proper context we must recognise that this debate has been brought about by the fact that a new concept has emerged within the past four or five years within the sphere of international fisheries and international waters.  I refer to the concept of the economic zone.  When we signed the Treaty of Accession to the EEC the economic-zone concept as it has developed now&mdash;a 200-mile economic zone for the coastal States such as Ireland&mdash;had not been even promoted internationally although it had been mooted by a couple of countries in South America.  Therefore, our Treaty of Accession in January, 1972, was embarked on in the light of the situation as it was then and that situation did not include the concept of a 200-mile economic zone.  I do not think anybody within the EEC would argue to the contrary.</P>
    <P>The development of this concept had certain consequences both for states which basically were landlocked and for those which basically were coastal.  For basically landlocked states such as Germany, Holland and Belgium, the consequences by comparison with the consequences for this country were that for them coastal states such as Norway, Iceland and ourselves for that matter but particularly those outside the community would take positions which would be in accord with international law but which on their waters would extend the rights of these coastal states to 200 miles.  Obviously, this would limit the rights of other basically landlocked states which up to then had used these waters for the purpose of fishing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Community would have wished that this concept of an economic zone had not been promoted because by having major economic zone areas through their coastal states by comparison with such countries as Norway, Sweden, the US and Canada, the Community would stand to yield more to this new developing international right than it stood to gain.  This new development was promoted from South America, to Canada, to Norway and right around the African coast. The EEC had to take account of this <Col N="380" /> concept and to a very considerable extent to take measures to protect their position or, to put it more correctly, to diminish the impact on their fishing fleets in particular and on their fisheries policy generally.  The situation was summed up concisely for us during a recent visit to the Commission when one of the senior officials there remarked that the Community's proposals represent a sharing out of the misery because to some extent there would be involved an element of misery compared with what had been the situation previously.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, from the Commission's proposals which were published in great detail on 23rd September last, that the first priority so far as the Commission are concerned&mdash;the Minister has emphasised this point&mdash;is to give the Community a negotiating stance with these third countries which are extending their fishery waters by way of the economic zone concept.  Because such countries as Denmark, Norway and Iceland and others are taking this step, it is important from the point of view of the Community countries that have fished traditionally within what will now be the economic zones of third countries that their rights are protected.  In pursuance of this protection the Commission in their proposals stated that in their consideration present circumstances called for immediate action for the Community to protect their legitimate interests in those maritime zones which are most likely to be affected seriously as a result of such extension measures.  Therefore, it can be recognised from the start that the Commission and the Community, perhaps understandably, are concerned as a first priority in this regard to protect the right of access of fleets of member states to third country waters.  Accordingly, they propose that the limit would extend to 200 miles so that the Commission on behalf of the Community could negotiate a <i>quid pro quo</i> so that Britain, for instance, would have rights to access in certain traditional grounds in Icelandic waters, or Norwegian waters, and France similarly and others.  All of this has to be done before 1st January, 1977, because that is the date on which <Col N="381" /> Norway, Iceland, America, Canada and many other countries will be extending their coastal zones.</P>
    <P>We can see the priorities in the minds of the Commission and the European Community.  I readily acknowledge that the Minister has already pointed up this, at least from the manner in which I have interpreted the reports coming back from the European Community.  In the rush &mdash;and one has to acknowledge it is a rush&mdash;to give the Community negotiators a common position <i>vis-á-vis</i> third countries to protect the fleets of the major economies within Europe, the European Community have not looked within the Community itself to see what should be done, what is just, right, legal and equitable within the Community in the first instance, to create a position whereby they can have this common stance against third countries.</P>
    <P>Putting it simply, it seems that Ireland in particular is being asked to give the European Community the mandate the Commission seek through the Council to negotiate with third countries by 1st January, 1977, by making this declaration and, when we have done that and given that benefit to the Community, they will look to the internal regime within the European Community and share out, on a certain basis to which I will refer, what they regard as being the diminishing fishery resources of the European Community.  In other words, as a small undeveloped country, we are being asked to contribute in advance to the European Community what they can only get through us, without any firm recognition of our right to a guarantee for our fishermen and our economy for years to come.  If we were to acknowledge now, without conditions which would protect our fishermen and our economy, that we will give the major extension in the waters off the European shores, those off the Irish coast, and afterwards negotiate, we would be in a very weak position indeed.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes overlooked that it is only through us, as a coastal State, that the Community can have any extension to 200 miles off our coast out into the North Atlantic.  We are <Col N="382" /> the only agent of the Community who can give them that exclusive 200 miles from which will be excluded the fishing fleets of third countries, Bulgarian, Russian, American, Canadian, or whatever.  Fortunately for the Community, Ireland has off its shores a major economic zone which, by making this declaration, we can bring into a new Community pool which would not be there without us as an island state.  The Community have to recognise our major contribution in ensuring that at least from 50 to 200 miles of that economic zone would be reserved for Community boats.</P>
    <P>It has to be stated at this stage that there are certain natural advantages and disadvantages to being an island. For long we have lived here with the natural disadvantage of being an island in terms of the European Community, namely, being on the geographic periphery of the European Community.  This natural disadvantage can be illustrated in very many ways but mainly in the increased transport costs we have to bear both as to the importation of our raw materials and the export of our finished goods.  Being an open economy, Ireland relies more than most&mdash;and on this the Government and the Opposition are <i>ad idem</i>&mdash;on imported materials for our industry, and we rely to a very considerable extent on exports to the Community for the continuing development of our economy.</P>
    <P>That is the natural disadvantage we have <i>vis-á-vis</i> Germany and Holland, and others, who are in the centre of the market and who, fortunately for themselves, have exploited that natural advantage to the point that the Community have always been talking in terms of the regional imbalances which exist between the centre, notably Belgium, Germany, Holland, France, and so on, and the periphery, notably ourselves and probably the south of Italy and now, it seems, Britain as well to a certain extent.  That is the natural advantage they have of being in the centre of the market which they have exploited.</P>
    <P>It does not compensate fully for that natural disadvantage of being on the periphery, but we have a natural <Col N="383" /> advantage of being an island with resources off our shores which the landlocked countries, with all their advantages, have not got.  In terms of the whole principles of the Community, in terms of the principle of the Community's regional programme, that of the eliminating of regional imbalances, in terms of the principles and the motivations of the Treaty of Rome, and in terms of the determination of the Community to move towards economic and monetary union and, through that, towards political union, surely we have a very strong case for saying we should at least be allowed, and not only allowed but encouraged and assisted, to develop our natural advantage.  Our Community partners should be very reluctant, indeed, to deprive us of our present advantage and our future potential so that they can cushion the blow&mdash;and it is a blow to some extent and that has to be recognised&mdash;which these powerful economies have faced as a result of the introduction of this economic zone concept.</P>
    <P>Had Ireland not joined the Community, where would these countries be in relation to the development of this economic zone?  Basically, they would have no rights apart from off the coast of France and Northern Scotland, certainly no rights which would compare with what they will now have within that economic zone, which we are contributing and only we can contribute to the European Community.  On that basis&mdash;and that is why we have mentioned legal and equitable rights&mdash; there should be some <i>quid pro quo</i> for the major contribution we are making to the Community at this stage of the international development of new concepts.</P>
    <P>This is necessary for the record.  I want to refer to the single negotiating text of the International Law of the Sea Conference which makes it quite clear that this economic zone concept which is now being very consistently supported is a concept, as described in Article 45, which gives sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing natural resources, including fisheries, to the coastal states.  Such countries as Iceland and Norway, and many others, <Col N="384" /> will be exercising sovereign rights in relation to that economic zone.</P>
    <P>These are the rights which we are now prepared to share with the Community. In this connection it is important to recognise that if we did not make the unilateral declaration on our part by January, 1977, all the waters to within 12 miles of our shores would be open waters to the fleets of every nation, Russia, Bulgaria and so on. This the Germans, French, Dutch, Belgians and the Danish would have to share with all other nations, because there is no reference in that text of the Second Committee of the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference to a Community <i>bloc</i> of nations as coastal states.  There is no such position. It is a coastal state alone which has the right conferred or proposed to be conferred under the law of the sea single negotiating text.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the legal positions that arise here.  There is one of them which applies to us and us alone.  I refer to our Treaty of Accession to the European Community and particularly to Article 103 of that Treaty.  I say to the Minister that I am glad that belatedly he brought Article 103 into play at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers.  I attended an all-party delegation from this House in Brussels about two weeks ago.  I have been calling on the Minister for some months here to state the legal position which I have raised in relation to the Treaty, to the international law and to other matters, which secure our position.  From the reaction we got from the Commission officials less than two weeks ago in Brussels, it was obvious that the first that they had heard of the argument based on Article 103 was when I presented it on behalf of this party, but as a member of the Commission, to that Commission on that day.  At no stage was there any evidence in their reaction but that this was the first time they ever took account of this very cogent argument.  I am glad the Minister subsequently acknowledged that and used it, but he did it a bit late in the day.</P>
    <P>I have been saying for the last six months that it is our legal position, even disregarding the Treaty, which <Col N="385" /> gives us our strength.  I refer to Article 103 of our Treaty of Accession which caused a significant change of position on the part of the Community officials who were there then.</P>
    <P>It reads:</P>
    <P>Before the 31st December, 1982, the Commission shall present a report to the Council of the economic and social developments of the coastal areas of the Member States and the state of stocks.</P>
    <P>That is obviously a contemplation of a new regime to be introduced by the beginning of January, 1983.  That was what was contemplated on the date of our Treaty of Accession, before the economic zone was ever brought into being.  Before a new fishery regime could be introduced by the Community they would do a survey of the social and economic developments of the coastal areas of the member states and the state of stocks.  This is understandable, because they could not introduce a new regime with all its effects without knowing the existing position of the economic and social development of the coastal areas. Therefore, whatever they would introduce as a new proposal would take account of that.</P>
    <P>The Community, as became clear to us on that occasion two weeks' ago, have not even initiated a survey of the economic and social developments of the coastal areas, much less concluded a report which would enable and entitle them to introduce a new fishery regime of the type they are now proposing.  Then they come to talk in terms of vital needs of areas. How can they talk of vital needs when they have not conducted a survey of the social and economic position of the coastal areas?  I am glad we made this breakthrough and that belatedly the Minister followed it up.  It is one of the strongest cases we have in this area, even relying on the Treaty of Accession, that the Commission are not yet ready, on their own admission under that article, to introduce new proposals.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to how evident it is that they are not so ready.  I refer to page 12 of the explanatory memorandum <Col N="386" /> of the Commission, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is therefore proposed that a Community reserve stock should be established for each of the main species and that the amount of this reserve stock should be fixed each year on the basis of the vital needs of the fishermen in these regions and the extent to which hatches have been reduced below their previous level.</P>
    <P>That is the reference to vital needs. Nowhere in this document is there a definition of what &ldquo;vital needs&rdquo; represent. How can there be when no survey has been done of the social and economic development of these areas concerned?  So we are asked to accept an allocation on the basis of vital needs which are not defined. Then we find:</P>
    <P>The allocation of these should be done primarily on the basis of the Member States' fishing performance in the past related to a reference period to be determined.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the suggestion that the quotas proposed in this document would be on the basis of our fishing performance in the past.  That takes very little account of our vital needs in the present and future.  Over and above that it is totally unacceptable because quotas based on fishing performance in the past do not take account of the developing state of our fishing industry.  These are based on the fact that those countries who have exploited and over-exploited the waters we are now trying to protect will be the ones to gain the advantage. Those of us who have not exploited them in the past, in the sense that we have not almost cleared them out as some others have done, will not be able to gain the advantage having regard to the historical performance basis.  Also we take the firm view that quotas, in any event, cannot be properly monitored or effectively implemented.  Therefore, the Community stance in relation to that is contradictory and it must be pointed out to be so.  They cannot suggest that these quotas should be reviewed at the end of every five-year period, for in a <Col N="387" /> five-year period the whole Irish fishing industry could have been totally undermined with nothing that we could have done about it in the meantime. They must recognise that this is not a satisfactory position for them to take up.  Quotas are also unacceptable to us because they are based on assumed rights of member states as distinct from what I would propose before I conclude, an agreement, a concession, a licence from the member states, to those which would not interfere with the development of our fishing industry and which would ensure that our fishing industry, after consultation regarding the interests of our fishermen and others, would not only be protected but be developed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Council regulation of 19th January, 1976, the recitals setting out the reasons why that regulation is introduced and laying down a new common structural policy for the fishing industry have no reference to this.  The Minister will know what I mean by &ldquo;recitals&rdquo;.  The need to develop a new structure for the fishing industry is pointed out but nowhere is there any reference to the special need there is for coastal regions and for development of coastal regions or to the undeveloped coastal regions which should be central to any future European Community fishery policy.  That is a Council regulation of 19th January this year.  I do not know whether the Minister entered any <i>caveat</i>, doubt, restriction or whatever to that regulation when it was being passed, but it seems that on the face of it it is there to protect the Community fishermen as a flock and is not in any way geared towards protecting the interests of coastal states or of inshore fishermen of our coast.</P>
    <P>There is Protocol 30 to our Treaty of Accession, and it is well to refer to it at this stage.  It binds the high contracting parties to recall that the fundamental objectives of the European Economic Community include the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the people of the member states and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the <Col N="388" /> backwardness of the less-favoured regions.  That is quite clear as a special protocol recognising our position.  On the basis of that I agree to recommend to this end that the Community institutions implement all the needs and procedures laid down by the European Economic Community Treaty.  Unless that Protocol is to be totally ignored, here is a clear case where the regional imbalance and the economic disadvantages of Ireland are spelled out and are evident.  Equally clear, the Community's obligations to us must be ensured to a new common fisheries regime.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Gallagher, will be dealing with the actual fisheries aspect but in the short time at my disposal it is important that I refer to what seems a reasonable position for Ireland to adopt having regard to our rights under international maritime law and under the Treaty of Accession.  At least the Community must conduct the survey they are obliged to conduct before they introduce a binding new regime.  I do not know why we should be asked to suffer as a nation at this late stage of the day simply because the Community have failed to do this, that is, if they were ever asked to do it. I suspect they were not asked to conduct this survey until about two weeks ago, until we attended.  I should like the Minister to let us know if he has asked the Community during the last six or 12 months to do this survey.  I doubt it because the reaction of the officials in the Community when I mentioned it was that this was a new point that would have to be considered.</P>
    <P>We support the Government's position and that of the nation generally in calling for an exclusive 50-mile zone. In doing so we will be conceding to other member states what they would not otherwise have, namely, exclusive rights from 50 to 200 miles.  It is important to recognise that the EEC countries in any reference period in the last five, ten or 15 years, have probably taken more than 75 per cent of the catch from what will now be the new 50-mile limit we are proposing.  I cannot speak for the fishermen but I think they recognise that they could not fully supply the market in Europe on their own, even if they were given <Col N="389" /> an exclusive 50-mile zone.  To that extent it appears we have a position where we can negotiate very effectively, namely, that our exclusive right as a coastal state be acknowledged.  We are not asking for 200 miles&mdash;although other coastal states will be doing that at the Law of the Sea Conference&mdash;but we are asking for 50 miles and that we would do in relation to fisheries what we are doing in relation to exploration in other areas, namely, negotiate licences to be reviewed annually with the fishing fleets of certain member states in designated areas within the 50-mile zone.  These licences would be reviewed at the end of each year after consultation with the vital interests of the fishermen and those connected with the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>There is ample precedent for this position also in the single negotiating text of the Law of the Sea Conference which has been adopted.  That precedent will be found in Article 51 (2) of that text which states:</P>
    <P>The coastal state shall determine its capacity to harvest the living resources of the exclusive economic zone, namely, 200 miles, but where the coastal state does not have the capacity to harvest the entire allowable catch it shall, through agreements or other arrangements, and pursuant to the terms, conditions and regulations referred to in paragraph (4) give other states access to the surplus of the allowable catch.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (4) clearly indicates that such surplus can be agreed by negotiation, by licence, to specific fleets in designated areas and the cost of this licence would be of benefit to the national economy, as would happen in exploration areas.  This is what Iceland is doing at the moment, not within 50 miles but within 200 miles.  That country is bartering its surplus catch in an economic exchange of other products that are crucial to the Icelandic economy, as they would be crucial to us.</P>
    <P>This would guarantee the development of our fishing industry.  Secondly, it would ensure that any decision would be taken in this Parliament in relation to any development or further extension of licences, having regard <Col N="390" /> to the needs of our fishermen and the economy.  Thirdly, it would be fair, reasonable and equitable so far as the EEC is concerned in ensuring that the market would continue to be supplied.</P>
    <P>Some arguments have been made about the difficulty of policing an area of 50 miles.  Commission officials recognised&mdash;some even suggested&mdash; that it is easier to police an extended zone than a narrow zone, despite what the Minister for Defence has said, for the simple reason that if a boat comes in from a long distance to within ten or 20 miles of the shore it will take a longer time to get out.  It has been the experience of Iceland that it is quite practicable to police the extended zone they have introduced because of the time it takes a boat to get in and to go out.  It has also been the experience of Iceland&mdash;a smaller economy than ours&mdash;that they have been quite well able to police the waters, sometimes with trawlers that were converted for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has been doing so much on our behalf in the Community&mdash;subject to the qualifications I mentioned&mdash;should have been so totally and utterly undermined by a Minister of his own Government when he was negotiating.  The Minister for Defence freely conceded, wrongly as it happened, that we could not police a 50-mile limit.</P>
    <P>As a result of some of the arguments on the legal issues and on the basis of international agreements which have been presented to the EEC, I believe there has been a change of stance which will enable our Minister to negotiate effectively to give us the minimum guarantees for our fishing industry and for our economy and to share with the Community what they would not have were it not for us, namely, the benefits our economic zone can confer on them.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>At the end of the motion to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or otherwise guarantee the future development of the fishing industry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is a senior counsel and he should know very well the consequences of the motion he is proposing here.  He should realise that at a critical time when the Minister for Foreign Affairs is negotiating on the fishery question he is binding him and the other negotiators hand and foot. We must give the Minister some freedom and flexibility in his negotiations. Everybody admires the Minister and the stand he has taken in negotiating our fisheries development within the Community.  Surely as a senior counsel Deputy O'Kennedy will not assert here that the Minister's hands should be tied in the very week that the negotiations are moving towards a critical period.  It is quite reasonable then to add this amendment.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that so many people are interested in the development of our fisheries now.  During my more than 25 years' membership of this House I have again and again stressed the importance of our fishing industry, and I have asked this House to take more cognisance of its potential than it has done down through the years through the different Governments.  I welcome very much indeed the public attention focused on fisheries during this year.  I welcome in particular the attention the national and provincial Press have given to the industry, that they have made it quite clear that this is an industry that has been forgotten and that it is about time to rectify our errors of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also that a number of fishery organisations and people who are not directly concerned have added their voice in support of our claim which has been put forward by the <Col N="392" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Government have made their position quite clear again and again as to where they stand on this question.  Only yesterday at a very pleasant function where a very well deserved award was made to BIM by a European management committee, the Taoiseach addressed himself in particular to this question.  He made the Government's viewpoint quite clear, that our policy is firmly the policy being pursued by Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Europe at present.</P>
    <P>While we welcome all the support, vocal and otherwise, that the industry is getting, I cannot see what purpose this motion is intended to serve.  I am not saying Deputies are not entitled to put down a motion in this House and to address themselves to this vital question, but, as I say, the negotiations are at a delicate stage.  As far as I know, everybody agrees with the stand being taken by the Government by their main negotiator, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and we are exceptionally fortunate that we have a man of his capacity to lead our negotiating team.  He has put a great deal of work and industry into this matter and has made himself conversant with all aspects of it.</P>

      <P>I stated at the outset that I always held that fisheries was an important industry in this <Col N="393" /> island country, that a great deal of our hundreds of miles of coastline was not being developed, that there was so much additional employment particularly in depressed areas for our men if we were to invest more money as this Government are doing, in the industry. First of all, we have the men on the high seas catching the fish, then the men on the shore processing the fish, another group selling it and transporting it, another group building boats. Therefore, this industry was generating a great deal of employment in many different directions.  Anyone coming from a seaport town such as I come from can see that day in and day out. It was for that reason that I and a number of other people drew attention to this in the 'sixties and 'seventies in particular when we were negotiating our entry to the EEC.  I stated then and I state now that we made vital mistakes at that time.  We did not attach to that industry the importance it was entitled to.  We more or less ignored it.  We accepted this common fisheries policy of the EEC, and everybody knows what is entailed in this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could have brought a number of Dáil Reports along with me and quoted statements that were made during that debate at that period on the fisheries question, but I have not made a habit of bringing forward quotations that are available to Members of the House if they wish to look them up.  However, this is the text of our proposal.  This is what we had been talking about in the 1970-71 period leading up to the signing of the Treaty.  It was said at that time by speakers who are now in Opposition that we had to take it or leave it and that there was nothing we could do about fisheries.  I assert again that it was wrong and that we could have drawn attention to what fisheries meant to us as an island country, that we could put ourselves more or less on the same plain as Iceland as far as fisheries were concerned.  But as I say, fisheries were overlooked.  It is all there in that documentation.  That is not my documentation but the official documentation of the Department of that time which was largely ignored. <Col N="394" /> What did we do in our negotiations, and what does this document say we tried to do?  I hate to be putting such statements forward here in Dáil Éireann when our Minister is carrying on the negotiations so effectively, but when a motion is put down by the Opposition party, a Deputy must address himself to it factually and give a factual appraisal as to what he thinks is the position, particularly in my case as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>What we sought then was to be left alone.  You could use that term to describe the kind of application we made.  It was an attitude of &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, leave us what we have for ten years.  Allow us this derogation for ten years; allow us this 12-mile coastal limit with all the historic rights of six countries to fish in the outer six miles&rdquo;.  I never believed in that kind of system.  While quotas may sometimes be necessary I am always doubtful as to how certain you can be that, if you give a country a quota of 1,000 tons of herring, that country will not catch 2,000 or 3,000 while maintaining that it has not exceeded its quota.  I and the Department see those difficulties but at the time of negotiations the question for review then was&mdash;it is amazing to think of it now&mdash;decreasing our limits and free access.  The emphasis was on free access.  Every Irish fisherman was scared at the time but he was doubly assured that he need not worry, that &ldquo;once we get in everything will be all right&rdquo;.  There is nothing in this document to bear out the claim that any case at all was made in support of that contention.  Anybody looking back on the case we made for an island country could only conclude that we should hang our heads.  That is the position as I see it.</P>

      <P>I said then and <Col N="395" /> I say now that the view Fianna Fáil had in mind at that time was to delay the common access policy which was in operation in Europe.  They were afraid that if they mentioned fisheries it might delay our rush into the EEC, that it was only a hindrance and should be kept out of the way.  This is my interpretation of our negotiations at that time.</P>
      <P>That is water under the bridge; the Government here are changed and it is now up to us to try to rectify the mistakes made in our negotiations in the past and in our terms of accession. Were we not then in as good a position or in a better position to demand extra rights for our fishermen?  I do not like talking of spilt milk; we must deal with the present position.  The people in the two Departments directly concerned with our fishing associations have worked and are working, so to speak, day and night in Dublin and in Europe to give the best possible advice and support to the leader of the negotiating team, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  My view is that it is essential for our fishermen to get the widest possible exclusive band.  I know of the ruthless overfishing of our waters even inside the 12-mile limit by foreign boats, boats of member states of the Community and boats from outside it.  We know what happened in southern Ireland quite recently when we had this big Russian boat hauled into port by our Naval Service, to whom I offer my appreciation of their work.  With 101 employees on that boat one can visualise the amount of fish it could take up if solely engaged in fishing.  A few days before that we had a Bulgarian boat.  How many other boats have we around our shores?  Even if you were to concede that some of them are fishing outside our band, they are fishing within 12 miles of our coast.  They are doing so this year; they did it last year and did it seven, eight and nine years ago. That position in our fishery waters did not come about today or yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite evident to anybody with any reasonable knowledge of the fishing industry that as an island country we should get the widest possible exclusive band.  I emphasise the term <Col N="396" />&ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; because once you give away quotas&mdash;if the system worked honestly so to speak it would be all right, but I am informed that it may not&mdash;you may be in difficulties.  To get the widest possible band is the first task and it is a major one in view of the opposition of other Community members.  That is the task assigned to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should take unilateral action like Iceland, Canada, Norway and other countries. The obvious answer is that we are now members of the EEC.  Eighty-three per cent of the people said we should become members.  I respect their decision which was the most decisive ever given in this country by the national electorate. At the same time it took away from us the right of unilateral action. It is the Government's stated policy that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must act within the Community.  I do not think that either Government or Opposition Deputies think that we should wreck the Community.  We are trying to get the best possible arrangement and agreement on fishery policy. It is only fair to say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will be speaking for himself later in this debate, will do that but he must do it in negotiation with other members of the Community and he must not take unilateral action.  To do so would be to go against the expressed view of the majority of our people.</P>
    <P>The Government are pleased to have the support of the Opposition. They welcome everybody's support on this issue.  This industry is being viewed with the concern it deserves at present.  We know it is vital to get this wide coastal band.  I should like to see the Minister returning with a 50-mile coastal band which would be exclusive, but as Deputy O'Kennedy knows we must negotiate with eight other countries.  We became members of the Community for that purpose.  I take the Opposition to task on this question because the home-work was not done on fisheries before we signed on the dotted line, before we accepted to continue as we were for a period of not more than ten years until alternative arrangements were <Col N="397" /> made.  The alternative arrangements implied were arrangements to depress the band we already had.  Mention was made of bringing it down to three miles.</P>
    <P>I have given the House the reasons for the amendment.  I have stated the Department's policy.  We welcome all the support we can get and the coverage this matter is getting in our newspapers. A heavy burden is being placed on the shoulders of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has to meet eight other Ministers whose interests differ from ours. In view of the laxity of our approach to our accession negotiations he has to bear this burden.  This amendment is justifiable in that it gives the Minister some power in the negotiations.  If the House were to pass this motion in its raw state it would deprive the Minister of negotiation rights.  We can all be sure that the Minister will do his best for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in protest to the manner in which the amendment has been circulated.  I am at a loss to know the meaning of the amendment.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain it to us.  It seems that there is some notion on the part of the Government to forget the concept of a 50-mile exclusive limit.  This is the only reading I can take from the amendment.</P>
      <P>There was no necessity for the Parliamentary Secretary to attack our spokesman in the way he did.  We are trying to strengthen the hand of the Minister in the negotiations.  It is important that all the people, particularly the fishermen, should know where we stand in this matter.  In his speech the Parliamentary Secretary has shown his ignorance of what took place at the negotiations on our entry into the EEC.  He should remember that we were able to obtain a derogation clause at that time as a result of pressure from our representatives.  This gave our fishermen ten years to develop the fisheries and gave us time to make our case for better conditions.  We had no choice but to accept the common fisheries policy which was already in existence.  The Minister himself has accepted this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister defended it during the campaign.  We have always maintained that the common fisheries clause has been unfair.  We have argued along these lines and will continue to do so.  We realise the importance of the fishing industry to the economy, especially to the more backward areas where development is so necessary.  We are in a unique position in that we are on the edge of the Atlantic and in a position to exploit the fisheries.  From a weak base our fisheries have expanded considerably. We are now expanding and in a position to go further afield.  This cannot take place unless we get the 50-mile limit.  In the past our fisheries have not played a full part in our economy. The nation now realises how important this industry is.  To give some recent figures, our catches for 1975 were 76,000 tons and were valued at £9 million.  The export value of that catch was £14 million.  That is a very important figure because in ten years we have increased the value of our catches tenfold.  It shows that we are expanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost 12,000 people are employed in the fishery industry; about 7,000 full time.  Investment by the State in the various sectors&mdash;boat building, processing and harbour development&mdash;while it is not what we would like it to be, has been considerable.  If we do not gain the concessions we are looking for, this investment will have gone for nothing.  An encouraging feature also is that the expansion has taken place in areas where employment is necessary, on the north-west coast, the west coast and south coast.  It has taken place in areas where it would be very hard to establish any other type of industry to bring employment to the people.  For instance, in County Donegal 15 per cent of the labour force there are employed in fisheries.  That is significant and there is no reason why Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry and parts of Cork should not have a similar number employed in the fishery industry in the <Col N="399" /> years to come if the opportunity to expand is given.</P>
    <P>This is an area where the regional fund of the EEC could be used to good advantage.  It would also help to create employment and stem emigration from poorer areas along our coast.  To exploit our fisheries to a greater extent it is necessary that we should have larger fleets, that we should have better processing and handling facilities, have a proper handling structure, improve our harbours, provide adequate protection and improve research and educational facilities. In this regard one would imagine that in our EEC context we would be entitled to assistance as a developing nation from the various funds the Community have available for under-developed areas.  At present the policy in relation to fisheries, if one exists, seems to be geared towards restricting operations in the member states.  This policy works against a developing industry like ours.  For example, with the FEOGA grants they have decided that boats over 80 foot in size will not qualify for such grants.  That is a clear indication that the EEC are set against any further expansion in the fishing industry, something which is detrimental to our aims and what we should be doing with this vital industry.</P>
    <P>Those concerned about fisheries are aware that conservation is important and if we are to have any proper conservation we must have complete control of our own fisheries.  We all know that the bays of other member states have been cleaned out with the result that there is no fish there at present.  Those states are acting as pirates in trying to clean out our stocks.  If we do not get a 50-mile limit and are not left in a position where we can conserve these stocks, we will have to forget about any future expansion and any further expenditure in this area.  It has been argued that we would not be in a position to police or protect a 50-mile fishing limit.  There are many ways we can look at this and, having had the experience of studying the situation in Iceland, I see no reason why we should not be in a position to police our waters effectively.  We have been told that it <Col N="400" /> would cost £60 million to provide the necessary boats and planes to carry out this protection, but I should like to state that in Iceland they have four patrol boats, one plane and one helicopter.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Kennedy stated, the boats they use for the protection service are not warships or as good as our boats.  However, they proved quite effective in the recent Cod War and in policing the 200-mile limit which the Icelandic fishermen now enjoy.  They have an effective way of dealing with all nations fishing in the vicinity of their country.  By international agreement they have listed the boats from other states likely to be fishing in their waters.  In the case of Great Britain they have listed the names of the boats, the tonnage and registration.  At given times any one of these boats, should they decide to fish near Iceland, must give their bearings to support ships who in turn communicate with the Icelandic coast guard service.  In this way the Icelandic authorities know the bearings of each boat and can, therefore, ensure that these boats keep to the international agreement and will not go into the Icelandic zones.  The position is that, if one of the trawlers listed breaks an agreement, it has to leave the waters and they lose their licence.  They are not allowed to come back.</P>
    <P>During our visit we went to the control room where this operation was carried out.  Listed on a chart in front of us we could see the number of boats fishing in specific areas on that day. The authorities were very proud to be able to tell us that they had caught a German trawler which had broken the agreement and they did not even bother to escort it into port or arrest it.  All they did was to inform the German authorities and the trawler lost its licence and in future will have no right to fish in the vicinity of Iceland.  It would be quite easy for us in a 50-miles context to have a similar type of agreement with the EEC member states.  This way we would find it fairly easy to police our fishing areas because it would be only necessary for our planes to make occasional trips to the coast to spot infringements.  If <Col N="401" /> we followed the example of Iceland this operation could be carried out very easily and effectively.</P>
    <P>We in this House have been trying to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary and on the Minister for Foreign Affairs the need to prepare for the day we are now reaching.  We realised how difficult negotiations would prove and asked the Ministers concerned by way of parliamentary questions to make provision so that they would be prepared for the 50-mile fishing zones. Earlier this year I asked the following question:</P>
    <P>...asked the Minister for Defence if he will consider setting up a coastguard service to protect this country's fishing stocks.</P>
    <P>The reply was:</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to change the existing arrangements under which fishery protection was carried out by the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>On 25th May, 1976, I put down two parliamentary questions to the Minister for Defence as follows:</P>
    <P>...asked the Minister for Defence the strength of the helicopter service in Ireland; and if he will consider having a number of helicopters permanently engaged in protecting Irish fishing grounds.</P>
    <P>The second was:</P>
    <P>... asked the Minister for Defence the plans, if any, his Department have to improve the existing fishery protection service.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph of the reply said that a fishing vessel was being constructed and would be delivered in November, 1977.  It went on:</P>
    <P>There are eight helicopters in the Air Corps.  They will, as heretofore, carry out &ldquo;sweeps&rdquo; of particular areas from time to time at the request of the Naval Service, but it would not be feasible to have any of them permanently engaged on fishery protection duties.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in this matter of protection of our fisheries we were trying to forewarn the Minister and to prepare for the 50-mile limit.  On the 26th <Col N="402" /> May, 1976, I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as follows:</P>
    <P>... asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will introduce legislation to enable the courts to increase substantially the penalties for fishing by foreign trawlers in Irish territorial waters.</P>
    <P>The reply stated:</P>
    <P>An increase in the penalties for illegal fishing by foreign nationals within our exclusive fishery limits is one of a number of proposals for amending our sea fisheries legislation which I am considering at present.</P>
    <P>To date we have not got any new legislation and the position is that fines on foreign trawlers are completely inadequate and they can fish inside our territorial waters at will.  In the negotiations for extending our limits we should take a look at present base lines.  At the moment the base lines follow the contour of the coast.  This means that with the present 12-mile limit, and indeed six miles in many instances, foreign trawlers can come very far into some of our bays; for instance, they can come in practically midway into Donegal Bay.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the negotiations which are going on at the moment will consider the possibility of using different base lines and in this way he would be providing a far wider fishing area for our fishermen.</P>
    <P>There has been on the Order Paper for quite a considerable time a motion in my name and in the name of Deputy Molloy about this very important matter.  I believe this is a very important aspect of these negotiations and we should not lose sight of it in the present situation.</P>
    <P>Iceland have used this type of base line, one which goes from the outer points and the contour of the coast has not been followed.  This is a big advantage and would be of tremendous benefit in our case as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The following statement gives for each county the present (a) basic weekly time rate of wages paid to forestry workers for a 40-hour week; (b) weekly rates of wages (excluding service pay) paid by county councils to road workers for a 40-hour week; and (c) minimum weekly rates payable to adult male agricultural workers under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) (No. 2) Order, 1975.  These rates apply to a 44-hour week in the period November to February inclusive and to a 50-hour week during the remainder of the year.  Under a new Agricultural Wages Order which will come into effect on 22nd November, 1976, the minimum weekly rates will be increased by £3.50. In the case of forestry workers an incentive bonus is payable in addition to the basic weekly time rates.  The interim National Wage Agreement, 1976, is included where applicable.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed disability benefit from 13th April, 1976, to 22nd July, 1976. Benefit was not payable as she did not satisfy the contribution condition which requires that not less than 26 contributions have been paid or credited in the governing contribution year from July, 1974, to June, 1975. The claimant was employed in this country for only 13 weeks from 10th April, 1975, in that period.  Prior to that date she had been employed in England and inquiries made to the Department of Health and Social Security there disclosed that she opted not to pay the ordinary rate of contribution under the United Kingdom Scheme.  Consequently, there were no contributions paid in respect of her employment in England which could be taken into account for the purpose of her disability benefit claim here.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was examined on 1st September, 1976, by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  His own medical certifier certified him as fit to resume work on 13th September, 1976, and payment of disability benefit ceased as from that date.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made a repeat claim for disability benefit from 4th October, 1976, on a medical certificate certifying the same ailment as that on his previous claim.  In these circumstances a further medical opinion is being sought before deciding his claim. For this purpose an examination by a medical referee has been arranged for 1st November, 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if a person (name supplied) in County Offaly will qualify for a subsidy under his Department's scheme; and if so, the amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that in September, 1972, the person in question was quoted, but did not accept, terms for connection to the electricity supply which involved the payment by him of a capital contribution.</P>
      <P>It would seem therefore that, if the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1976, is enacted in its present form, the person in question will qualify for subsidised connection.  However, it is not possible at this stage to say what the subsidy would amount to in any particular case.</P>
