    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out yesterday, we are not taking full advantage of the very valuable assets we have.  If we acted in the right way it would add considerably to our income by way of hard currency.  Too much of our agricultural produce is going to Britain and after feeding the animals the British purchase from us <Col N="732" /> they earn the hard currency we should be earning.</P>
      <P>If we organised the raw materials available to us to sell to the best advantage, and if we produced the maximum amount of cereals that would feed us, it would be possible to have a further 20,000 jobs available. As I stated yesterday, we are selling meat everywhere for the prices that are going but we are not building up a market that we could hold in difficult times.  We have the kind of meat that is more acceptable than that from South America, New Zealand or Australia and we should develop that part of the industry as we do with our salmon and fishing industry.  We should have processing plants that would ensure our products go directly to the shops, rather than shipping the half sides of beef as we do at the moment, thus allowing other countries to earn additional money by carrying out processing work.</P>
      <P>What we are doing at the moment is not the best policy for the future and a setback is bound to come. History has proved that the cattle trade does not keep going steadily. When it suits the Common Market countries, particularly the heavily industrialised nations, they will turn to the cheapest markets or not use any meat at all.  We should be building for the day when we can consume our own agricultural products.  Our population is steadily increasing and the time will come when we will not be so worried about selling to other countries.  All our natural resources should be designed to give the maximum employment here and, while it might suit some people to sell for the quick £, our aim should be to produce the maximum number of jobs and to get the most advantageous prices, particularly in hard currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a large reduction in our cattle population and there must be plenty of scope for the growing of more cereals, particularly barley.  If we can prepare in a way that is acceptable to other countries we will be able to provide more jobs here.  From a study of the subject, I am convinced that at least 20,000 jobs could be found in the area of meat processing, <Col N="733" /> milling and the growing of more crops.  In addition, more fertilisers will be used and this will also help the employment situation.  With the land we have available we should not have to import raw materials for feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>There is a certain retrenchment in some of the products we produced in the past.  For instance, the production of chocolate crumb is down and this would not have happened if we followed up on the markets that are still available for this product.  There is one European firm&mdash;one I hope will locate in my county&mdash;that is interested in the production of chocolate crumb and the finished product for the European and the United States markets.  The undertaking concerned is an Italian-German company.</P>
    <P>More funds from Europe should be invested in this type of production.  It is amazing that our organisations which are trying to attract and build up industry do not go after this type of industrialist.  We appreciate the funds we get for the heavy industries which must import heavy steel and so on but we should be making maximum use of the raw materials we have such as milk and its by-products.  There seems to be a lack of push in this direction and the Minister should have it explored.</P>
    <P>I often wondered whether the IDA have personnel who are closely related to farming because such personnel would be able to see the advantages of this type of business. This type of induction is necessary within that organisation.  The same applies with regard to fishing.  Personnel interested in fishing should be involved in that organisation so as to push that industrial arm to the maximum. Time is running out and this industry will not be very attractive in the future unless something is done.</P>
    <P>Our sheep numbers are falling rapidly and are dangerously low.  In my area young people are not prepared to carry on the job their fathers did in looking after sheep. They are not prepared to climb around the mountains looking for sheep and with the low returns from <Col N="734" /> sheep rearing they are more attracted to the more lucrative jobs.  This is serious for the development of the Scotch breed.  In the past we have been engaged in crossing the Scotch ewe with the Border Leicester and eventually getting the Suffolk breed from that type of cross-strain but if we lose our mountain sheep we will be in a serious situation.  The recent directive by the Department changing the dipping position to one dip per year has not helped this situation.  I approached the Minister in relation to this and he graciously agreed that dipping certificates would not be required this year but some thought must be given to the future.</P>
    <P>The Department must bear in mind that mountain sheep farmers must sell their lambs in August or September but if this dipping certificate is necessary before that they cannot sell their lambs because dipping will only commence in October and continue up to February.  Those farmers will be deprived of the subsidy which was intended to keep them in sheep breeding on mountain holdings.  The Minister should design the lamb subsidy schemes so as to cater for those farmers.  In my view the scheme which makes it obligatory on sheep farmers to have a dipping certificate cannot work.  I can recall what happened some years ago when we had a heavy fall of snow in the mountain areas of my constituency.  The snow lasted for a couple of months and in Kerry a lot of the sheep were lost. Sheep farmers were not able to follow their sheep.  The sheep were snowed-in in gullies and cliffs.  I followed a rescue party and discovered that the only way they could trace the sheep was by looking for a hole in the snow on the cliffs created by the breathing of the sheep.  On that occasion of the 20 or 30 sheep lost only eight survived and they had the wool eaten off each other. This is the type of hardship sheep farmers must face.  They make every effort to save their flocks and any scheme to help them must be tied in with the conditions under which they farm.  If the Department hold that the dipping scheme must apply to them it can only result in more sheep farmers <Col N="735" /> going out of this business.  With our sheep numbers steadily falling that would be a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will help the sheep farmers and not restrict their actions.  The disadvantaged areas scheme has been of tremendous help to mountain farmers in my area but some anomalies exist.  A big number of sheep farmers live in the electoral division of Kiltallagh, near Castlemaine. They farm very small holdings but have been excluded from this scheme.  The electoral divisions of Kiltallagh, Kilnanare, Milltown and Droma should be brought into this scheme.  On the other side of the valley in the Buffer district, there is exceptionally good farming land and that area is included but for some unknown reason the electoral divisions I have mentioned, particularly the Milltown district, are excluded.  That scheme would be of great help to those farmers.  Two of those electoral divisions are very mountainous and the others, by virtue of the type of land and the number of small holdings, are equally disadvantaged.  The Minister should endeavour to have them included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Pig production is developing, something that pleases me.  I have always been associated with pig production and I contend that a scheme should be devised to help individual farmers produce more pigs.  I know substantial grants exist at present.  A farmer who can produce 200 to 300 pigs annually can make a reasonable amount of money but there should be a stabilised price for feeding stuffs. The heavy costs of feeding stuffs is one of the big drawbacks in pig production. The price of feeding stuffs has increased considerably in recent years.</P>
    <P>There should be some method of control to keep the price stable as far as possible so that people could and would invest to develop this arm of agriculture.  This would encourage the production of more cereals, provide more jobs in manufacturing this material as well as helping small farmers to keep a son at home who could not be supported otherwise on <Col N="736" /> the output of the small holding.  It could bring considerable numbers back to the farmyard pattern.  I emphasise this because I am not satisfied that we are working in the direction that would give maximum employment in agriculture generally. There would be considerably more jobs if our whole outlook was guided in that direction.  We appear to be sitting down because everything is selling well.  Our advisory bodies are quite satisfied with the way things are going but things do not continue going unless you think ahead in order to be able to direct output properly and keep on selling more and more, increasing the number of jobs and the money needed to continue development.</P>
    <P>I believe we could go back to this pattern.  Some 50 or 60 years ago yellow meal was the basic feeding stuff here.  Everybody produced pigs and poultry which were a great addition to the farmer's normal output. There is no reason why we cannot have the same pattern today if we can get people to see the advantage of it.  The same applies to our cattle. It should be possible to stall-feed or farmyard-feed some of the cattle so as to have a regular supply all year around.  It is too easy to fatten them on the grass and it has the disadvantage that they all come on the market in October and November.  This happens in every other country also and there are surplus cattle on the market at that time.  If we are to maintain a steady input for factories&mdash;and we must do this if we are to develop the processing of meat down to the small packets in which it should be produced&mdash;we must train and educate farmers and producers in this system. The farmers and the country would be all the better for it.</P>
    <P>Horticulture is in a rather poor state.  It is amazing that last year we had to import potatoes, and ordinary crops of which we were never short, cabbage and so on.  This is another side of agriculture that seems to have no output and does not inspire the enthusiasm it should arouse.  One wonders what our Department are doing.  This is an activity that should <Col N="737" /> be developed to the maximum.  Perhaps the present educational system is at fault.  Many students who get their intermediate and leaving certificates think there are white collar jobs everywhere for them.  This problem should be examined because the jobs are not there.  Many of these young people, even in my own area, will not do ordinary jobs; they will not go behind counters because they have leaving certificates.  They end up in Britain where they will sweep the streets and work afterwards in the building trade because they come up against stark reality and discover that while the leaving certificate is good in itself it is not the be-all and end-all. There is a problem in that regard.  I see it affecting industry in my own area.</P>
    <P>There should be an overall plan because if agriculture is to be developed there must be sufficient people available to produce the goods and develop the country as it can be developed.  Educational and agricultural development should go side by side and unless we have a broad plan to cover that objective Departments will be competing against each other, doing their own jobs and not thinking in an integrated way as they should think for the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We are very lacking in the production of honey and a considerable amount of it is imported.  Again, blame must be attributed to our agricultural experts and advisory services who can secure this type of development. That is a job they should be directed to do.  It seems that it is human nature to consider that when things are going well in a certain direction one's job is done but I think these aspects should also be examined. It should be the job of the Department to explore all these possibilities and find out from their advisers in the field why this type of agricultural effort is not pursued.  There must be reasons.  It would not be very difficult to get those reasons from the advisory services who cover every field in the country.  They should know why people are not producing necessary horticultural crops, not producing <Col N="738" /> honey and not doing many other things that can be done.  One can only suggest that because of the low level of effort put into this side of production, the utilisation of the advisory services must be suspect.</P>
    <P>I have asked many people who are on the dole in my own area of Killorglin why they have not been growing potatoes, or producing turf. They come into our business premises to purchase coal and gas.  While I am on the selling side, it hurts me to see raw material there that could be developed and used if people were prepared to put the effort into it.  The answer I get when I question them is that they cannot get any labour.  I said to one man: &ldquo;You do not need labour to cut enough turf for yourself. You have a bog in the corner of your land, solid low banks. If you go out only at eleven in the day and take the newspaper and a chair with you you can still cut 200 or 300 sods a day in a certain time and you will have enough turf cut for yourself.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;To hell with that.  There is no future in that.&rdquo; This is the situation which we face.  We have energy lying idle which should be producing the material that will save the import of fuels and so forth that are so costly and certainly should not be sold on my side of the country.</P>
    <P>Our thinking is all wrong in this direction.  We look for grants to have the roads and drains cleared but then the Department say they have no money.  The money should be provided for this to try to help because this all comes within the agricultural sector.  The production of fuel is a vital part of the smallholder's way of life and saving on imports of coal and other materials is necessary to the nation because we have to find the hard currency to pay for this material.</P>
    <P>I may say here the Department are concerned with doing only their own minimum job.  Good as they may be, there is no integrated outlook over the whole field to see that everyone is dovetailing and getting the maximum that should be got.  Rather Departments are competing with one another. So long as they get their own job <Col N="739" /> done they are not concerned with others.  At Government level and in all organisations in this country we need forward thinking if we are to get over the top and make our place in the world with the great products we have.  We must get the outside world to realise that we have meat and different agricultural products fresh from the land that would be accepted on the tables of Europe.  We have to ship as quickly as we can to the British markets because they are slowly developing towards making themselves self-sufficient and while that is on the way we should be equally pushing into outside fields in order to be able to sell the materials we need to sell there to enable us to purchase the material we want inwards. In view of the present state of the pound, it is not advisable to be selling to Britain for sterling when Britain are able to sell our cattle afterwards into the European markets for hard currency.  As I have stated, we import products many of which we do not need at all because Britain has not anything else to give us we have to take whatever she pushes our way.</P>
    <P>The time to deal with the overall pattern is now.  Time will be slipping by.  We have had very good years in agriculture but they will not always continue.  This is the problem because the world can be over-supplied with machinery and heavy industrial goods and industrialised nations can sell that machinery and they will not buy anything from us or anybody else.</P>
    <P>We have to keep this outward impression. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have a very difficult job and a big job but they have to think ahead and keep looking into the future and think of what is likely to happen in nine or ten years' time and whether our directives are helping us towards attaining what we should attain in that period.  If this is critical, it is not meant to be entirely critical of the Department.  They are doing a good job.  They produced a very useful document here but now is the time to consider this overall pattern.</P>
    <P>When I was in Europe I spent a lot of time going to the farming areas to <Col N="740" /> see the way of life there and what they were doing.  In spite of everything we have not a difficult job.  We have expertise, we have better farms, better production, better climate, but we lack that overall drive, that overall thinking to organise our farmers into the type of production that would suit them.  This I think lies at the feet of our organisations of agricultural people both out in the fields and here in Dublin.  It is time to get together to plan for the future, not to be living in what is happening today because what is happening will not keep happening.</P>
    <P>The best field for mass production still lies with the smallholders, if we can get them organised or get them to start that type of production or to harness their efforts into producing something.  I have found all too often that the advisory services pass them by because they have enough up-to-date farmers and they are able to keep their books right and able to convince the authorities that everything is going well.  The productive farmer, the good farmer, is moving away and the small man is left behind.  Unfortunately, he is getting depressed about this but it does not mean a terrific future for himself, particularly with costs today.  Advisory services should be turned in on those people now and let them forget the better farmer.  Let him plough his own furrow.  He has had full advice all too long.  Let us see what can be done with those small people.  They can produce root crops. They can do many different things that will help the nation to produce animal feeds and help with horticulture and so forth which can find a ready market outside.</P>
    <P>Milk appears to be on the increase. I have stated that we should be examining the possibility of developing it into finished products.  I again ask the Department to get their advisors and technical people, particularly if they have them out in Europe, to examine the possibility of getting outside firms in here with the skills to turn our milk into an acceptable finished product.  Certainly milk goes up and down in price from time to time but there are many by-products <Col N="741" /> produced in other countries which we should be able to develop here and attract the industrialists and which would have the advantage of tax free concessions.  It is a wide field and one in which I understand there is vast development taking place in America. If we leave it all in the hands of the IDA&mdash;who see only the necessity of creating an industry&mdash;it will not be as effective.  I do not know whether there are personnel within that body who are <i>au fait</i> with every aspect of farm production and the necessity for the advancement of that type of raw material.  Perhaps there are but we have not seen any great productive effort arising from their excursions abroad, if that is the term one should use.</P>
    <P>There is vast potential in the overall pattern of agriculture.  I am convinced that it holds potential for at least 20,000 jobs and, perhaps, even more, if we but followed up the processing of our agricultural raw materials.  It would provide jobs for people in rural areas in particular because that is where such raw materials exist.  I would ask both the Minister and his Department to give this very serious consideration.  If we could but unite the effort of every Department for the benefit of this great arm of our industry then we would have a chance of getting somewhere.</P>
    <P>Our farmers are advancing.  Our young farmers particularly are doing a tremendous job.  I see them in my own area.  They take two nights a week off for leisure when they take their wives with them.  This appears to be part of today's pattern and, I believe, it is a good thing because they work very hard for the remaining nights of the week.  I notice them working at 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock and even 10 o'clock in their farmyards milling grain and so on.  It would be easy to lead these young farmers into the type of effort that would produce commodities of a quality one might not get too easily in other parts of the world.  It is the job of the Department to lead these industrious, energetic young farmers to undertake the type of work that will best serve the country.</P>
    <P>I said yesterday that our external <Col N="742" /> trade amounted to £1,441 million, of which agriculture amounted to £596.2 million.  Of that £366.2 million went to Britain and £175 million to other countries.  Here lies the job for our developers.  The faster we get away from this dependence on the British market the better it will be for ourselves.  Our imports reached a total of £1,700 million, a difference of £259 million.  We must get more material into Europe to enable us earn the hard currency which will assist our industries.  Agriculture is the main channel through which we can get such hard currency.  Every bit of material we can get into Europe must earn hard currency for us.</P>
    <P>At present Britain are getting our cattle into Europe.  It is a well-known fact that, under their subsidy scheme, they purchase so many animals at the beginning of the year.  If they can, they like to get three- or four-year-old cattle and carry them on their farms for 12 months.  They are supposed to hold such fat cattle for two months after they have purchased them on the Dublin markets.  But they take them and reship them the following morning for export to Europe, to Germany and Holland.  This is the job we should be doing.  If we have the fat cattle and we have to export them on the hoof, why cannot we export them direct?  Why should we allow our cattle to go out through that channel and lose the hard currency they should be earning for us?  Surely our agricultural people in Britain must know this is taking place.  We must halt that practice now and step out on our own.  Perhaps cattle exporters here who were involved in that type of procedure in the past do not want to see their way of living hit. I suppose it is understandable that they would try to channel things to serve themselves but that is not serving the nation.  That is why we must take a hard look at what is happening, get the best out of anything we have to export and ensure that it is to our advantage.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the farmers in my own area&mdash;not big farmers by any means, 40 or 50 acres, some a bit more and some a bit less&mdash;who are <Col N="743" /> doing a tremendous job.  They have a great way of life.  I like their outlook on life.  They have energy, courage and ability.  They and their wives very largely make up the clientele of singing pubs on Wednesday and Sunday evenings.  That is a good thing because, all too often in the past, the wives were left at home while the husbands went their own way.  Now the husbands and wives seem to share the farming activities.  There seems to be a great unity of purpose.  With real thinking, guidance and leadership, we could get our young farmers into the type of production and activity necessary for the country as a whole.  Such guidance and leadership can come only from those Departments which have the farmers interests and their future at heart.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Department and the Minister to involve themselves in this type of thinking in regard to our agricultural arm because this is the best seller in the country.  We have the energy and ability, but our farmers need leadership and advice to devise new markets and new methods of production.  Above all, farmers need leadership and I am not at all happy about the way this is being provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his address yesterday the Minister gave the House and the country a factual appraisal of our premier industry.  It was pleasing to learn that the industry is exceptionally healthy and that progress can be reported in all fields of agricultural activity.  The Minister deserves a great deal of credit for this position and so do the Government.  I am aware of the many visits the Minister has been paying to EEC centres to discuss different aspects of our agricultural industry.  As a result, many improvements have been made in agriculture generally.  In saying that, I must include the departmental advisers because they give the Minister great help, particularly on technical details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, the picture today is most favourable.  It is only right to make that statement because if it were otherwise, as it was in the latter part <Col N="744" /> of 1974 and early 1975 when cattle prices were not as good as we would have liked them to be, the Minister would get a great deal of stick from the Opposition, as if he alone were responsible.  I have no doubt that the proximity of the by-elections is responsible for the absence of some Deputies but neither have I any doubt that the absence of Deputies from the Opposition benches indicates that they have no meat to chew on this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>During the life-time of the Government, the Opposition have been destructively critical of agriculture and this has contributed to unfavourable reactions in some important sectors, such as the pig trade.  The memorandum submitted to Deputies yesterday is a most constructive document which indicates comprehensively the activities of the Department.  It will be of immense help to Members and to outside organisations interested in farm development.  It would be an advantage to have copies of the memorandum in the hands of every farmer and every other person interested in farm development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is heartening to read in the first page of the document the advance made in our agricultural exports.  In 1975 they were increased to £596.2 million, from £393.4 million in 1974, a very marked increase which carries with it increased farm incomes.  The figure means that farm incomes have increased far beyond the inflationary trend that operates.  The dairy industry is probably the most important in the development of our agriculture and we see from this document that marked improvements have been made in it.  In 1975 the average price paid to milk suppliers was 30½p per per gallon as against 23.8p in the preceding year.  The quantity of milk delivered to creameries last year was 628.8 million gallons as against 575.3 million gallons in 1974.  Last year the value of milk delivered to creameries totalled £190.69 million as against £135.54 million in 1974, another marked increase which must have had <Col N="745" /> a significant impact on dairy farming and in the homes of dairy farmers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the beef and live cattle trades the picture is similar.  Trade was exceptionally good and we are all very pleased with it.  A lot was said in the course of the debate about cattle numbers, that as a result of the Government's policy there is a serious decline in cattle numbers.  The facts do not bear out that assertion.  We see in the memorandum that the total cattle population here in 1965 was 5.359 million, in 1970 it was 5.957 million, in 1973 it was 6.370 million, in 1974 it was 7.214 million and in 1975 it was 6.927 million.  No one could say that that is a serious decline.  The number in 1974 was much higher than average by virtue of the state of the market, particularly the export market, in that year when prices were at a low ebb and producers were not anxious to dispose of their cattle.  That decline ended in early 1975 and naturally there was a rush of sales.  That was only to be expected.</P>
    <P>We must examine and give some thought to why this position came about in 1974.  My view is that the restrictions imposed on the sale of young cattle, calves and weanlings in 1973 were ill-advised.  I am aware that all the farming organisations and the Opposition were vehement in their opposition to the sale of our young stock.  I gleaned from Deputy O'Connor's remarks today that he is also against the sale of young cattle.</P>
    <P>What is the reality of the situation? A farmer has so many cattle but requires some money and therefore he must sell some.  He is the best judge as to the type of animal which it would be in his best interest to sell. Whether he opts to sell a yearling, a two-year-old, a dairy cow or a young calf to get the required money, is his own business.  While we may, through our advisory services, advise him on what we think best, the ultimate decision must rest with him.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the 1973 restriction gave rise to the glut of 1974, and was responsible for the peculiar state of the market and the difficulties our <Col N="746" /> farmers had providing fodder for cattle in the winter of 1974.  At present we export calves in accordance with our EEC commitment. Neither the Department nor the State have any right to intervene.  It is to our advantage that we have this export market for calves.  The price this year was quite good.  Were it not for this export market, the figures for calves would have been far less than those which obtained in the calf selling season just passed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies in 1974 and in the early part of 1975, commented on the fact that Irish buyers were not able to compete with foreigners purchasing our livestock.  What was wrong with that?  If they could not afford to buy them, let the outsiders buy them.  If our fatteners in the midlands were in favour of keeping calves and weanlings here, the way to do that was to compete on favourable terms with the outsiders.  As they were unable to do that, I do not see why a farmer should be asked to sell at a price which is far less than he would get under free competition.</P>
    <P>Cattle prices are of exceptional importance. While I agree that it would be more advisable to try to keep our young cattle at home, fatten them, process them here, thus giving employment in our meat factories, and sell them in their processed state, that cannot be done in all cases.  Our processed cattle numbers are quite significant.  It is pleasing to all that those numbers are still improving.</P>
    <P>The dairy man can look with thanks and appreciation to the Department and the Government&mdash;and particularly the Minister&mdash;for their handling of this industry since 1973.  The prophesies which emanated from the Opposition benches in late 1973, all of 1974 and part of 1975, have not been fulfilled.  It is fortunate that the position is so.  I hate to say it but I detected a gleeful atmosphere in the Opposition benches during the 1974 period.  Whether on the Government side or on the Opposition benches every Member should be only too pleased to see that our major industry is progressing.</P>
    <P>The sheep trade as outlined in the <Col N="747" /> Minister's statement is progressing quite well.  Whatever difficulties arise where the EEC are concerned, the Minister is making every possible effort to ensure that these obstacles will be removed or at least minimised. Anyone who reads the paragraph in this memorandum dealing with sheep will be satisfied that a good job has been done by the Department.  Sheep farmers need have no worries.  Their interests are being looked after carefully and diligently.  Pigs are another important money maker on the farm. The number of pigs has increased. The figure stood at 880,200 in December, 1975, which was an increase of almost 100,000 on December, 1974. Breeding sows have increased from 88.7 thousand to 100.9 thousand in the period December, 1974 to December, 1975.  During discussions on the pig industry on several occasions in the past few years gloomy pictures were painted by some members of the Opposition who said that the pig trade had declined so much that it would not be too long before it was wiped out.  Fortunately, these prophecies have not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The pig trade, as the figures indicate, is looking quite bright at present. While big combines, co-operatives and so on, can be very helpful so far as regularity in the flow of pigs to factories is concerned and in keeping pig numbers at a reasonably high level is concerned I am rather worried about people who produce pigs in small numbers to help supplement their incomes. That sort of piggery is certainly on the decline and the Department will say and the experts will say that it is not economic now to keep pigs in small numbers.  Small numbers could be defined as a man keeping two, three or four sows and fattening 25 to 40 pigs at a time.  It is a pity because I would like to see our pig industry spread out to a wider number of people.  I would like to see the position that used to obtain, when prices and profits were not as good as at present from piggery earnings, where you would have a share of pigs on all our farms.  In Cork in the not-too-distant past there were pigs on almost <Col N="748" /> every farm.  That position does not obtain now and it may not come back.</P>
    <P>Grants under the farm modernisation scheme are reasonably generous but the standard set and the capital required by small farmers to avail of them are too high.  It is very difficult for small people to get the credit necessary in order to build piggeries or other farm buildings.  It is all right to tell us what the Agricultural Credit Corporation are doing and how generous they are in lending money. Whatever kind of yardstick they apply for measuring the credit worthiness of an applicant is, in my opinion, applied rather rigidly and small farmers who badly need money for development are turned down.  That is not an infrequent occurrence.  We read about the money that annually they pass on to so many farmers throughout the country but I maintain that in some of these cases the applicants could get the money from other sources if they were so pressed.  I maintain that the principal job of State agencies, such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, should be to help the smaller people to develop their holdings by providing money towards the purchase of farm machinery, farm buildings, cattle, or land development.  From my experience, the Agricultural Credit Corporation are too rigid in their attitude in so far as determining applications from the small farmers.  I have no hesitation in making that statement.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to poultry and eggs is that poultry have disappeared from the farmyard.  Whilst the picture is quite bright, as set down in the memorandum, the number of people engaged in the industry is far less than it used to be.  I remember when in my part of the country the income from poultry could amount to 30 per cent of the income of small and medium size holders.  Putting them back into the farmyard is something which is not likely to happen. Taking cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry together, it is pleasing to note that prices obtaining are quite good at present and, more important, the prospects for the future are exceptionally bright.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> The next item I should like to deal with is the fact that £25 million of the sum for which we are seeking approval is to be devoted to consumer subsidies on milk and butter.  We have had consumer subsidies operating in different periods in the past.  We all appreciate that agricultural commodities, essential commodities such as milk and butter, are rather costly to the housewife in the city and town. Personally I was never in love with subsidies, and I have not changed my mind.  The subsidies which seem to have the general approval of the House, and for which the Opposition were clamouring over a long period, undoubtedly help a percentage of the people.  It would be very hard to determine the percentage who are hard pressed to buy commodities such as milk or butter.</P>
    <P>To a large section of our population, subsidies do not make much difference.  Those who have reasonable incomes could afford to buy those commodities without subsidies.  A case has been made that, because of the subsidies, more milk and butter are consumed.  I do not know whether that is so.  If this system were not in operation, and if we had this £25 million at our disposal, which is a sizeable sum of money, we would be able to help people who need help to buy those commodities, and the balance of the money could be utilised in a more gainful way.  In making that statement I am expressing my own personal view.  Several people in my own party would disagree with it.  I have taken particular note of this matter down through the years and I have come to the conclusion that subsidising milk and butter for people with large incomes is not too wise, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>The moneys expended under different headings by the Department, as outlined in the Minister's statement, are sizeable.  The net provision for the farm modernisation scheme, including the scheme which the EEC scheme supersedes, is more than £13 million. Of this sum, over £6 million is included for the lime and fertiliser subsidy, as compared with an expenditure of £4.4 million in 1974.  There is an impression <Col N="750" /> abroad that the farm modernisation scheme is financed mainly from EEC funds.  Many people, even those not engaged in agriculture, believe most of the money for this scheme comes from European funds, and that we should be more generous in our determination of applications, and so on, because we are spending someone else's money.  Of course, that is not so.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the factual position, the total money paid for this scheme in 1975 was £3.4 million, and we expect to be recouped from EEC funds.  Under the farm modernisation scheme the EEC pays 10 per cent and 90 per cent is the Irish taxpayers' money.  It is no harm to mention that fact in view of the erroneous impression which has been created in some areas about the origin of the funds expended under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced the provision of £17.5 million, an extra £1 million, for cattle headage schemes in the coming year.  This is a sizeable sum which is being paid to the severely disadvantaged areas.  There is an increase in the maximum figure of from £300 to £348.  Undoubtedly this kind of payment is beneficial to farmers in the severely handicapped districts.  It is confined to the severely handicapped districts and those outside those areas feel rather annoyed that their areas are excluded.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to define borders having regard both to the criteria laid down by the Commission and to the availability of money for the payments of grants.  Last year the Irish taxpayer had to pay 75 per cent of the amount necessary but this year that is reduced to 65 per cent.  On a number of occasions the Minister has dealt in the House with the question of extending the severely-handicapped areas.  Such an extension would be difficult and if all the claims made in this regard were to be conceded we would be in conflict, perhaps, with the EEC regulations governing this scheme.  In addition, we would have to find the extra moneys to finance the scheme, a scheme which is very generous so far as the people in these areas are concerned.  However, I have much sympathy with those living in <Col N="751" /> severely-handicapped areas.  Coming from one such area I am aware of the difficulties involved.  Because of the indifferent nature of our climate and its low productivity, it is difficult for people in these areas to make a living.  That is why they must have these Government aids.  Another factor mitigating against these people is that it is common in such areas for the milk season to come to an end in October and it does not recommence until early May.  Apart from the grants paid to these people the Government are paying out a good deal of money to them under the unemployment-assistance schemes.  In these circumstances it can be said that farmers in the disadvantaged areas are being looked after very well by the Government.</P>
    <P>I should hope that within the not-too-distant future a system will evolve whereby part-time farming will be recognised and that a man will be enabled to find some supplementary employment within his own area so as to supplement the income from his farm.  It would be my wish that the moneys being devoted now to payments under the social assistance schemes would be channelled to supplementing any fund for the provision of such part-time work because farmers, whether young or not so young, would prefer to be able to supplement their incomes by part-time work rather than to have to avail of the system that operates now. However, until such time as this change can be brought about, we must continue to operate as at present.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned regarding the EEC directives in respect of the farm modernisation scheme whereby it is laid down that a man must derive 50 per cent of his income from farming and must devote 50 per cent of his time to that work in order to qualify for a grant within the terms of the scheme.  That is all right in respect of those who are in good employment, professional people and others, but it is a different story so far as the small man is concerned, who may endeavour to get a few days' <Col N="752" /> or a few weeks' work on some scheme. He is the type of person who should not be discriminated against in respect of the farm modernisation scheme.  Our whole effort should be aimed at developing more industrial employment in the severely-handicapped areas.  Initially this type of development might not be viable but in the long term it would be a much better proposition than the paying of social assistance which, while of much benefit to those who receive it, has no return value.</P>
    <P>Regarding disease eradication the provision in respect of TB and brucellosis is £17.8 million or £7 million more than the 1975 figure.  We are all disappointed with the rate of progress in this field.  The cost of disease is alarmingly high in relation to agriculture.  It would be very difficult to put a figure on it.  Before there was any question of a dispute with the veterinary profession I said here during debates on previous Estimates that progress in disease eradication, particularly in regard to TB, was unsatisfactory. Millions of pounds have been spent on this programme but I do not think we got value for it.  However, I hope that when testing is resumed we will be more watchful so as to ensure that we get value for our money.  People are puzzled that, although this disease is declared eradicated, it manifests itself again. This is a matter which should interest everybody concerned so as to ensure that it will not be necessary for this type of eradication scheme to continue for ever.  It is a worrying factor.</P>
    <P>I have made my views known in this House on the present strike. There is no need for me to repeat them except to say that the proposals submitted by the Minister are exceptionally generous.  We have another problem which applies to other activities as well as to agriculture.  We now have people with expertise in a particular field claiming that unless their demands are met they are going to stop work.  Of course, this is not at all unusual at present.  I do not believe we can survive that kind of pressure.  The State has only a certain amount of money.  The Minister for Finance has the difficult and thankless <Col N="753" /> task of trying to get money to meet our requirements.  We have demands for increased public services as well as demands for reduced taxation.</P>
    <P>There are courts and tribunals to determine private disputes.  We should have some kind of tribunal to determine the disputes which arise so frequently all over the country.  All sections of the community are pressing claims for a bigger slice of the cake than they are getting at present. If one section got more than their entitlement the other sections would have to take a smaller share.</P>
    <P>We must be more watchful about disease eradication including sheep scab.  It is the business of the Government to ensure a return for the money that is expended on disease eradication schemes.  I mentioned at the outset that agriculture was doing well at present.  From our point of view, the co-operative movement is making a significant contribution to the economy.  Yesterday Deputy Gibbons was critical of the co-operative movement.  If the co-operatives are as bad as Deputy Gibbons says they are, they should be restructured.  A case has been made that this Government are trying to undermine the co-operative movement by taxing it unjustly.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Government are fully behind the co-operative movement and it is our business to ensure that all co-operatives work efficiently.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Gibbons' statement is taken at face value, it would seem that co-operatives are not efficient.  The aid given to co-operatives by this Government should not be overlooked.  Since we came into office in March, 1973, the IDA have paid £6.9 million to co-operatives for development purposes. Therefore, far from trying to undermine the co-operative movement, the Government have shown their faith in the movement by the generous funds they have given for development.  The co-operative movement appreciate the Government and know that we are favourably disposed towards co-operation for the benefit of all.  Some people are trying to make trouble by making statements which do not bear scrutiny <Col N="754" /> and which are not factual in regard to the measures in the Finance Act.  Some people think that co-operatives should not be taxed.  The co-ops are getting all the advice that can be given.  The Department are always ready to discuss their problems with them.  Any moneys to be collected from the co-ops will be ploughed back into them threefold.  It is not a question of collecting this money into the Exchequer and not putting anything back into the co-op movement.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to the Department, and to the Minister particularly, that the hard work of the Department is bearing fruit and that all farmers, big and small, are doing reasonably well.  I hope now that part of their increased income will be passed on to their employees. Farm workers are becoming smaller in number due to the introduction of farm mechanisation and I should like that those of them who are left will be treated fairly, on a par with their industrial counterparts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The last few sentences of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech gave us an indication of the new strategy being employed by the Government in relation to the many disputes there are at the moment.  When he spoke about the situation in regard to the co-ops he said that some people were stirring up trouble, that their statements did not bear scrutiny, that they were not factual.  That is their strategy in relation to most of the disputes there are at the moment&mdash;that certain individuals are stirring up trouble, that their statements are not factual.  In other words, everyone is out of step except the Government.  If the Government had listened to some of the things that are being said by people outside Fianna Fáil, people who are just worried about day to day affairs, the Government would not have got themselves into the fix they are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in the country grave concern at the taxation imposed on the co-op movement and I feel that this, above all times, is the wrong time to do it.  It is the time when trade unions throughout the country are crying out for extra employment, and the co-ops could provide the base on which such <Col N="755" /> employment could be built, if they were encouraged.  The Parliamentary Secretary made great play of the £6.9 million that has been given to the co-op movement.  The IDA could give that amount to one industrial firm by way of grant.  A lot more could be and should be done for the co-op movement to encourage their members to continue the vast expansion they have been doing in recent times. It is significant that another co-op have gone in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Although I did not hear the speech of Deputy James Gibbons and I am not, therefore, in a position to agree or disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary's thinking on it, I have heard Deputy Gibbons many times talking about the co-op movement and I feel the Parliamentary Secretary has been rather hasty in suggesting that what the Deputy said was a complete and utter condemnation of the co-ops.  What Deputy Gibbons would have said is that some of the co-ops need to have their management looked at.  That could apply to any company.  Some of the co-ops will definitely have to get their management structures looked at.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have given us a glowing picture of the state of agriculture.  I agree that agriculture is not doing so badly, but if we take 1974 into consideration as a base, they would need to make ten times more because many of them lost heavily in 1974.  Indeed some of them suffered losses from which they have not yet recovered.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now in a position that he must work within constraints imposed by the CAP.  He was given very lavish praise by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I congratulate the Minister on doing his job but he was selected as Minister to do the job and we all expect him to do it.  The Parliamentary Secretary prefaced his remarks by saying they were personal remarks. He gave as the reason for the slump in cattle prices the restriction imposed on the sale of young cattle in late 1973.  He left out one reason&mdash;some might say a much more relevant reason&mdash;and that was the fact that <Col N="756" /> there was a considerable importation of cattle through East Germany into the EEC from Poland.  This was allowed to go on for some considerable time and the Minister for his own reasons, reasons of which we are not aware, did not see fit at the time to use the veto.  He did not do that until, in my view and in the view of the farming organisations, it was much too late.  That is the major reason why our cattle dropped to such a low price in 1974.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme has just finished its first year of operation. It is highly significant that the vast percentage of the grants due in west Mayo were paid around November while a considerable number due in the section of the county I represent have not yet been paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I contradicted this emphatically but apparently what I said is not accepted by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister listen?  What I am going to say may ease his conscience a little.  In fairness to the Minister, there would appear to be some minor fault in the case of the grants still outstanding.  From my experience in checking it would appear the greatest difficulty at the moment is the fact that the herd number is in the name of another person.  In many cases it is in the name of a deceased person, generally a husband.  This should be a minor administrative difficulty and it is one that should be ironed out very quickly because a great many grants are still unpaid.  They are due to people who need them.  In many cases they were applied for by the widow of the deceased in whose name the herd number is.  I would ask the Minister to discuss this with his advisers to see how this difficulty can be overcome. It is bound to recur every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a particular irritant where the beef cattle incentive scheme is concerned.  An applicant is waiting for a cheque and, instead of a cheque, he gets a letter from the Department asking him what he is doing with the milk.  This information should be obtained at the time of inspection.  It is very frustrating to a person expecting <Col N="757" /> money to get a letter looking for information that could so easily have been obtained at the time of inspection.</P>
    <P>A matter the Parliamentary Secretary passed over very neatly was the considerable decrease in cow numbers. This is a matter of concern to all.  It is imperative that our breeding herds are kept at the maximum level so that we will have sufficient good stock. One of the reasons we joined the EEC was so that this industry would prosper. There has been an almost 50 per cent increase in the export of live cattle.  While we will always have this particular kind of export we should continue to encourage the export of carcase beef.  This is very important from the point of view of employment.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat discouraging at various jumping events around the Continent to hear Michael O'Hehir commenting on the fact that a successful Italian, German or British rider has won and that the horse was bred in Ireland.  The grant to Bord na gCapall is £647,000.  I think it is too small.  I do not say this by way of criticism but rather with the hope that some scheme will be devised to keep our best horses at home so that, when they win, they will win for Ireland.  There are not many Michael O'Hehirs around to let us know where particular horses are bred and this is the best advertisement we could have for the industry.  Again, it is very hard to stop a person from selling a horse for which he is getting a good price and to ask him to sell it to the Irish Government or to anybody else for a lesser price.  However, if we can expand the leasing scheme, we would then have the best of both worlds and would continue to hold the best horses for ourselves.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable talk recently about the need to revise the farm modernisation scheme.  I do not know the exact figure, but I think the number of development farmers in Mayo is only about 3 per cent.  There is an immense number of very small farmers there whose living is solely from the land and who have to rely on social welfare payments to make up <Col N="758" /> the difference between what they receive from their very small holdings and the income necessary to maintain them.  I would ask the Minister a question on something which possibly would be more appropriately addressed to his colleague, the Minister for Lands, but which he has mentioned in his speech, and that is, in an area like Mayo where there is such a small percentage of development farmers, would a small farmer who is not a development farmer be entitled to obtain land from the Land Commission where a neighbour has given up land under the retirement scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes, if it made him viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the problem because it would not make him viable; the holding would still be small and it is a question of trying to discover what would make a man viable.  I would ask the Minister&mdash;and I know he is sympathetic towards this &mdash;to take into account the anxieties of the farming organisations and the committees of agriculture about the terms of the farm modernisation scheme.  While I realise he will have to engage in very tough negotiations to get these terms modified, I would beseech him to co-operate with and to co-ordinate the fight that these organisations will be putting up to get the terms of this scheme more suited to areas such as I represent.</P>
      <P>I will refer briefly to the veterinary dispute.  This has taken up a considerable amount of the Minister's time and he has tried very hard to find a solution.  I would ask him to keep all channels open and not to make any pre-conditions about future talks with the vets, because this dispute will strike at the very heart of our economy unless a settlement is reached in the very near future.  We have only 18 months left to become TB free, and it would be a tragedy if, because of a lack of effort on anybody's part, our best asset went by default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary has left, because he said he was not satisfied that the best value had <Col N="759" /> been got from the money spent on eradication up to now.  It is not enough to say that.  He should spell out exactly why he feels this was so.  He may have been expressing a personal opinion; if so I accept that, but if that opinion is helped by any records or any dealings he might have had with the Department, then the country should know in what way the Department feel they have not got value for the money spent.  I do not think statements like that will help in any way to settle this dispute.  I would ask the Minister to continue the efforts I know he has made in the interest not only of the agricultural industry but of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I had what was to me a most distressing experience five or six weeks ago.  It involves a case in which I have been in touch with the Minister and in which, unfortunately, he said he was unable to help.  A man told me that 15 years of hard, painstaking work had been wiped out in a short period of three months by brucellosis. This man had always reared his own replacements and, as he said himself, foolishly he bought one animal, and the result is that his whole herd, built up over a lifetime, is now wiped out. Apart from all the long years of work, the maximum he can get&mdash;and I stress the maximum&mdash;for a replacement is only £200.  This is happening at a time when in Ballina mart animals somewhat similar are fetching between £300 and £400.  I know there are constraints on finance but I would ask the Minister to raise this figure if at all possible.  In a letter in 1974 he said it was a considerable figure but I should like to stress that the maximum was £200 and that price was paid in very few cases.  I could not see any inspector in 1974 allowing the maximum figure for replacements.  The reality of the situation is that very few farmers will be able to replace stock taken from them unless the figure is raised considerably.  I should not like to find myself in similar circumstances again because the sympathy I could offer was of very little use to the person and it was a poor substitute for the ending of a lifetime's work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> Perhaps the Minister might comment on the idea prevalent that animals who have aborted should not be taken off the land on the principle that when new animals are brought in they can pick up the germ that is still on the land much easier than the other cattle.  It appears that every second year cows will calve normally and the idea is growing that the animals should not be taken.  I admit I have no expertise in farming but personally I do not think this idea should be allowed to grow.  I have seen the effects of brucellosis on human beings and they are not very nice.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned a matter that is the cause of some concern, namely, the possibility &mdash;and one can only stress possibility &mdash;of rabies coming to this country. With the Minister, I should like to congratulate the officer from his Department who spoke on the radio this morning regarding this problem.  He dealt with the matter in a factual way and he described the dangers that can arise from carelessness.  I should like to stress to people who may be going abroad on holiday not to take their pets with them.  It is much better to be without a pet for a fortnight than to be without a child for the rest of the parents' lives.  I saw the BBC programme that was mentioned this morning and if it were shown on RTE it might go a long way towards discouraging people who have the attitude that such a disaster could only happen to somebody else.  The anguish of the mother in the film would do much more if it were shown on RTE than anything I or anyone else might say on the subject.</P>
    <P>Not long ago I saw a pound of butter that was packaged in Northern Ireland but on the label were the words &ldquo;Produce of the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  If the label was correct that butter was exported from here to be sold at a lower price in the North and it could come back into the Republic under the EEC rules at a price considerably less than what a person would pay for it here.  Frankly, I cannot see any way that this can be ended but it seems foolish that we can <Col N="761" /> export butter at a price considerably less than what we pay in our shops and people near the Border can cross into the North of Ireland and buy 30 or 40 pounds of such butter.  When this happens our own butter is left on the shelves of the shops and supermarkets.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Parliamentary Secretary made great play of the food subsidies.  He mentioned a figure of £25 million.  He qualified this by saying that it was his personal opinion but he felt the money could be put to better use although he was unable to quantify the percentage of people who would benefit.  The women who were in the public gallery some weeks ago would be able to tell him how hard pressed they are.  This subsidy is badly needed.  I hope the view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary is a personal one and that he was not engaging in kite flying to test reaction.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I referred to the farm modernisation scheme and the efforts being made in the west to modify it somewhat.  If it was modified on the basis of the small farm incentive bonus scheme it would be more beneficial to the majority of farmers in my area.  Those farmers have proved that once they have specific set targets to meet they are able to make progress.  They proved this while operating under that scheme.  In this regard I should like to mention that the instructors of the various county committees of agriculture did excellent work.  I should like to congratulate the instructors of the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture on their work, example and encouragement in operating this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned winter farm schools.  Such schools have been operating in Mayo for many years.  In referring to the various matters dealt with by the Minister the Parliamentary Secretary passed quickly from sheep.  That did not surprise me because the sheep population has gone down drastically in recent years.  The number of sheep has reduced from 4,260,400 to 3,796,000.  I am aware of the efforts being made by the Minister to improve this position and I should <Col N="762" /> like to see him redoubling his efforts to ensure that sheep farmers get a fair crack of the whip and that this trend is arrested.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary devoted a lot of time to the pig industry. While he did not give us the sheep figures, he quoted the figures for pigs. He told us that the number of pigs has increased but he did not go further and tell us that the number of pigs slaughtered in 1975 was less than the number slaughtered in 1974, and less than the figure for 1973.  The document circulated by the Minister to Members stated:</P>
    <P>The reduction in pig slaughtering in 1975 was brought about by the high level of sow slaughterings in 1974 which in turn was caused by the severe difficulties then being experienced by the industry, i.e. high feed costs and adverse market conditions on our main export market, Britain.  However, as indicated above, the national pig herd is now being rebuilt.</P>
    <P>I hope the lesson learned from this will be taken into account and that we will not in the future hear the Minister using the word &ldquo;sows&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;pigs&rdquo;.  One of the difficulties of the pig producer is the peak and valley periods.  This has affected the small producers.  Too many of them got their fingers burned and would be reluctant to go back into this business.  Many pig farmers in my area have the buildings but they feel that the rewards are not worth the risks involved.  If the Minister encourages such people to return to pig producing, he will have done a good day's work.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about a farmer having one or two sows but I do not think we will ever return to that day again.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a difference of opinion on the method under which grants are paid.  The Minister said they were being paid as a flat percentage of the cost but I should like to know if it is the estimated or actual cost, as certified by receipts, that is involved. I have had a number of complaints from constituents that, even though they produced receipts to inspectors <Col N="763" /> stating that the cost of materials and labour came to a certain amount, they got considerably less than they felt they should get.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of off-farm employment and hoped there would be a considerable amount of it in the not-too-distant future. He was repeating what my colleague, Deputy Seán Flanagan, said as Minister for Lands many years ago.  This is something we should all like to see because it would be a tremendous benefit to the industry in that the farmer would not have to wait for money; he would have ready cash coming in weekly and would be able to put more into his farm.</P>
    <P>My complaint about the Minister's speech is that it was a general report on the past year, almost like a report to a board on the activities of the year.  It also gave the expenditure it is hoped to meet in the coming year but it set no standard or goal towards which the industry should direct itself. There was an absence of any definite target, no real indication as to where this major industry is going.  This is not good enough in times like these and this is what has been responsible for the peak and valley periods we have had in the industry, responsible also for the lack of confidence in the industry every so often and the overconfidence at other times when people jump on what appears to be a bandwagon to produce what appears to be a worthwhile commodity and by so doing create a glut.  This managing director's report, as we might describe it, reflects the situation of our major industry, which needs leadership and a goal.  It needs a complete development plan; it has the potential, the raw material and the techniques and it is still, and will be for a considerable time to come, our most important industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the manner in which this document &ldquo;Main Activities of the Department&rdquo; has been produced and it is rather a pity that it should not be more widely circulated.  The debate on this Estimate each year is one of the <Col N="764" /> most important we have in this House. We know the importance of agriculture to the economy.  Development of the agricultural sector offers the best hope of economic growth.  I say this because of its contribution to employment, incomes and exports.  About 40 per cent of the work force depend on agriculture and 25 per cent are indirectly employed in farming, so that really agriculture is the dominant export industry accounting for about 40 per cent of our total exports and therefore must have a great bearing on the economy.</P>
      <P>The gain from agricultural exports is considerable because of the low import content.  An example is the direct and indirect import content of livestock which is less than 10 per cent. The ratio for manufactured exports is more than 40 per cent and sometimes as much as 70 per cent.</P>
      <P>When we joined the EEC the benefits to agriculture were foremost in mind.  We expected incentives that would result in greater growth in agricultural output in real terms.  But, unfortunately, the growth rate now in the 1970's is little, if any better than in the 1960's.  This is a pity because agriculture has the potential to double the present output and it is important that we should move in that direction. One wonders what can be done to increase output.  The amount of land under grass is about 90 per cent, so that any real growth we would be likely to see must come from the livestock sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard it is disturbing to see the export of calves from this country. It is a good thing to have an export market.  The Minister on the question of exported calves mentioned that under Community rules the Government had no authority to restrict this. The price being paid at the moment by the Italians for our calves is in the region of £40 per head.  It would be more to our farmers' advantage, in view of the good prospects for beef, if they were to hold these calves themselves because, apart from the likely profitability for the farmers concerned, we should consider the difference between exporting these calves now at £40 per head and exporting <Col N="765" /> them in two to two-and-a-half years' time when they could possibly be worth something in the region of £300.  The beef processing plants here need all the animals they can get, and indeed these plants have made a considerable investment in increased capacity in 1975.  Therefore, the more calves we export now the less fat cattle we will have for the factories in two years.  This, of course, would mean increases in processing costs and it would reduce the employment opportunities for our skilled labour, something that we would not want to happen in these rather difficult times.</P>
    <P>While I refer to the question of calves, the 1974 cattle prices caused farmers to lose a certain amount of confidence in beef production.  There is now a need to restore confidence in the profitability of beef production. We know that cattle numbers have fallen and they are not going to recover overnight, so to avoid the under-utilisation of the land, and also for economic reasons, there is every justification for increasing our tillage acreage.  Indeed on a recent occasion some months ago when the Minister was in my constituency of Carlow with An Foras Talúntais he spoke very forcibly on this matter of increasing our tillage acreage.</P>
    <P>With reference to the dairy industry, prospects are good and the benefits of increased milk production are numerous.  Apart from the direct benefit to the dairy farmers themselves, the processing has made the greatest contribution to employment growth in the food sector.  I say this because in recent years about 30 per cent of the total employed in food processing are working on milk products, and expansion in the region of 10 per cent per annum in milk production is a reasonable target.  The reason I mention this expansion is that it means a big capital investment for our farmers.  Naturally they must borrow large amounts of money for any major development programme which they may undertake.  I would like to see the option given to those concerned of repayments over a period of, say, up to 20 years.  Certainly, there needs to be more flexibility regarding terms and conditions <Col N="766" /> of loans in those circumstances where such a large amount of money is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech mentioned a figure of over £6 million for lime and fertiliser subsidies.  I would be seriously concerned that there was importation during this present year of a number of inferior quality fertilisers which were sold to, I suppose the word we should use is unsuspecting farmers.  I would suggest to the Minister that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should insist that on all imports of fertilisers coming into this country his Department should get one month's notice at least of the importation and that they should be given full details of the analysis of the products to be imported. Failing these regulations being complied with importers should not receive the fertiliser subsidy.  Why should the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries subsidise inferior fertilisers for use by our farmers especially when one realises that some of these fertilisers cost in the region of £100 per ton?  Surely our farmers are entitled to be supplied with nothing but the best?  It is with that in mind that I draw the Minister's attention to that fact.</P>
    <P>Coming from a sugar beet growing constituency&mdash;the sugar factory being located in my own town&mdash;one feels the Minister should be congratulated on his efforts in that respect during the past three years.  During 1974 the Minister secured an increased basic sugar quota of 182.000 metric tons for the period 1975-76 to 1979-80. That compared with 150,000 metric tons previously.  I know there was a fall in our beet acreage in 1974 but that has now been rectified and the prices being paid for beet are rising substantially.  The minimum price per ton back in 1973 was £7.49.  This year it is £15.49, an increase of 107 per cent.  That is the type of progress needed, with our farmers getting reasonably profitable returns for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the Minister on behalf of our farmers, in Brussels and elsewhere, since he assumed office have been widely acclaimed.  Great <Col N="767" /> credit is due to him for the manner in which he is carrying out his duties at home and abroad.  He is recognised as a fighter for our farmers' rights and I believe our farmers and people recognise him as such.</P>
    <P>The question of the veterinary dispute was mentioned earlier.  I know the Minister is doing all he can in this respect, and I am sure will continue to do so.  It would be a pity if this matter could not be resolved at an early date in the interests of all concerned and of the economy at large.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the question of rabies.  I listened with interest to an officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries this morning.  While his comments were very enlightening, it was horrifying to think what can happen as a result of this disease.  I know that every precaution will be taken by the Minister and his officers to ensure that we are kept free from this horrible disease and the dangers of people bringing in pets will be publicised.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the officials of his Department are doing a fine job. I could not let this occasion pass without placing on record my appreciation of the courtesy and help I have received from them over the years whether it be in Dublin or at local level.  They are well known for their civility and assistance.  As long as we have people like that, the Department cannot fail to bring the sector with which it deals, agriculture, to greater things in the future and I believe there is a great future for our farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading the Minister's address to the House one must feel that he has been lucky that the past year has been such a good one for the agricultural industry.  Indeed that is as it should be if our country is to continue to prosper.  The Minister's statement was a long one but what attracted me most were his comments to the effect that, for the first time since we joined the EEC, the agricultural industry has become market-orientated and that in this <Col N="768" /> situation a farmer's decisions as to whether to undertake extra drainage, increase his stock, change his marketing system or otherwise intensify his activities will depend on the price he gets on the market place.  While that is absolutely true, to my mind it is not sufficient; it is not laying the emphasis in the proper place.  I am restating the obvious when I say that the sale of an article is the most important factor.  Probably that is more important than the price.  In other words, if a farmer or anybody else finds himself at the end of his productive line with an attractive price but unable to get rid of his product, then there is no incentive for him to continue his activities.</P>
      <P>When we were advocating our entry into the Common Market we were led to believe&mdash;and indeed we led others to believe&mdash;that, once we were in, there would be an endless market for our agricultural produce.  I recall a very well-informed member of the agricultural hierarchy indicating that there would be a very considerable beef deficit over the next few years.  I saw this as an end to the problem of the farmers in my constituency.  I felt this would be the incentive that the farmers needed down the years, that they would be able to break with the British market and whatever they produced would find an outlet at a guaranteed price.  However, this did not prove to be correct.  It is true to say, irrespective of what remarks are made from time to time about farmers, that if they get the return for the work they do at least 90 per cent of them will produce the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we entered the Common Market we found that the market we believed would exist, and which we suggested to the public, was not there. We found that at times imports were allowed into the EEC.  This is understandable if agricultural products were scarce in the EEC and prices were rising and going above target prices. This is not the whole story.  As I understand it, the situation is that in the negotiations on the other side for industry and markets of all kinds the agricultural industry is also used as a bargaining point.  It has happened that <Col N="769" /> we had to allow agricultural produce into the EEC in return for getting out manufactured goods, which seems reasonable enough.  About 12 months ago we had to give something on the agricultural side so that we could import uranium from Australia.  I tried to focus some attention on that at the time but I did not succeed in getting anything done.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have pointed out that the Minister has a difficult time in the negotiations in Brussels.  I have to accept that this is the situation.  I feel it is important, therefore, in a debate like this that Deputy Carter and I as well as other Deputies who represent rural communities should come into the House and indicate definitely what we believe is to the advantage of our constituents.  When the Minister is negotiating he would then be able to say to the people on the opposite side of the table &ldquo;That is all right, but I have 100,000 people at home who want something different.  If I do not ensure this for them I am not representing their wishes&rdquo;.  In this way the Minister will strengthen his position. I suppose one answer to this is a gradual erosion of the situation to our advantage so that the market for agricultural produce and particularly the beef produce of the EEC will not be open to any outsider until such time as it is obvious we cannot supply the market ourselves.  I believe it will be a long time before that happens.</P>
    <P>The farmers should be able to receive a guarantee that everything they produce will be sold for an adequate price.  I can probably be told that the intervention system guarantees that whatever is produced will be taken up.  This is true but it does not solve the problem I am putting before the Minister.  It has happened that the producer did not get adequate compensation for what he produced.  The intervention system is there but our experience of it is that when there was a glut of meat in the country it was anything but satisfactory and edifying.  At that time the middleman made huge profits but producers made no profits whatsoever.  I urge the <Col N="770" /> Minister to ensure that this will never occur again.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the Minister has some inter-departmental committee sitting trying to find a solution to this problem.  I regret he had nothing to say about it in his statement in the House yesterday.  We were assured some time ago that a report would be brought in soon.  I hope the result of this report will ensure that, if ever such a situation arises again, the producer will be the first person to get his just reward for the work he has done and for the produce he has produced from his land and that the middleman will be the last to get his cut out of it. I believe that if this situation is brought about the farmers will do what the Minister and any understanding person believes they will do, that is, produce an ample supply of food at an acceptable price and continue to do so.</P>
    <P>It is not the ideal thing to come into the House and say that the price of beef or the price of anything else has been increased over that of 12 months ago.  The ideal thing to say is: &ldquo;You will get a reasonable price for whatever you produce.&rdquo; I believe the more reasonable the price the higher the consumption of the product will be.  Beef is one of the products which suffers as a result of increase in price because consumption falls.  If the price for beef remains stable and does not increase excessively more people will eat it.  Figures published recently indicate that the Irish people are the lowest beef eaters in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I believe the nub of the agricultural policy as it affects Irish farmers is that the EEC markets, irrespective of what the other pressures are, should be kept for the agricultural community of the EEC.  Industrialists may think otherwise, but then farming is so totally different from industry that it should be treated in a special manner. I believe this is the most important message for Deputies to convey to any Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that Ministers inquiring into the agricultural policy made certain observations about it.  The agricultural policy of <Col N="771" /> the EEC has given some security and stability.  The Ministers agreed that there were regional imbalances throughout Europe which must be corrected.  The headage payments probably go some way towards doing this.  The mountain sheep scheme also helps, but I believe much more needs to be done.  The area in which I live, the Drumlin belt, which comprises Leitrim, Sligo, the bottom of north Roscommon and part of Mayo, is naturally deprived because its soil is not as good as that of a large part of the country.  This is very obvious. When one moves around the country and one sees the differences, economically and population-wise between parts of the country, one must eventually come down to the fact that it is due primarily to the land and the situation of the people who have been living on it for the last few hundred years.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to me that something more could be done for those soils by suggesting a different type of winter farming and by providing more coverage for housing of one kind or another.  From time to time I have suggested specific schemes for this purpose but got no encouragement even though, I understand, it is done in other places.  When one sees the way these lands are cut up and rutted as a result of poaching, even a person with the least knowledge of farming must realise that the obvious thing to do would be to get the stock off the land and on to a more sheltered surface.  This would preserve the land for better use in the spring and summer.</P>
    <P>This is another way the Department could help rectify the regional imbalance that exists in my constituency. One hopes money will be made available for this purpose.  In the past it was believed that much could be done by draining the land.  It has been proved that drainage does not achieve the optimum amount one would like. When the technicians are agreed on this, there is an obvious compulsion on the Minister and the Department to think of something else and do it, thus making a further contribution <Col N="772" /> towards correcting this imbalance.</P>
    <P>Part of our county, especially south Roscommon, the flooded area of Clonown, have been left out of the headage grant scheme.  To my mind this was an obvious area for inclusion. Reasons why it was not included were given; they seemed to be mostly financial.  One hopes they will be included this year.  Previous speakers referred to the delays in paying the grants.  My experience is more or less the same; people did not get them for one reason or another, due to documentation or a change of herd owner.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months there was one aspect of this problem which I felt was heartbreaking to some people, not very many fortunately.  Some people sent in their applications to be included in the headage grants but their applications did not arrive in the Department at all, or arrived late.  It is very hard luck that a person whose application arrives a day or two late should be deprived of a grant.  It may be too strong to say it is unjust, but it is bordering on the unjust.</P>
    <P>We have been told that there must be a final date for such schemes.  That is acceptable.  For this reason I believe there is an obligation on the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and any other Departments that provide a final date for their schemes, to ensure that applicants are aware of those final dates.  Written into the application form should be something to the effect that they should get a certificate of posting when they post their documents.  This would take the blame off the Department and the people who make the applications.  The Department at that point would be able to say that that was a genuine application which had been lost in the post, and they could make some provision to deal with its acceptance.  There is a tendency to assume that applications that do not arrive at the Department were not sent in in time or that they were forgotten about.  That works the other way too.  Yesterday I pointed out to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries that a grant they sent out last March has not yet arrived.</P>
    <P>Every citizen must find sometimes <Col N="773" /> that letters do not arrive at all or arrive late.  Fortunately there are not many people involved in this.  Because there are so few, and because there are some genuine applicants among them, in my view the Department should have another look at this and ensure that people will not be deprived of something to which they are justly entitled.</P>
    <P>With the advance of the dairying side of agriculture, it is surprising to find that the production of condensed milk seems to have ceased as a dairying activity.  My attention was drawn to this by a very alert constituent. The figures and subsequent information elicited indicates that his information and observations were true.  It is extraordinary to find that this activity has ceased at a time when we are looking for outlets for milk and when we have to import condensed or evaporated milk.  I am glad to see that, as a result of this man's activity and of questions, some efforts are being made to revive the industry and provide another outlet for milk.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he will seek an increase in the grants payable for sheep.  I am told this is absolutely essential.  If it is not done, the sheep industry will suffer another decline. The Minister indicated that this has still to be negotiated with the EEC.  It is well to put it on record that my constituents are interested in this subject. They have pointed out that not alone are the grants for selling the product not sufficient, but the grants for mountain fencing are not adequate. The cost of wire and posts has gone up.  The cost for the use of machinery has also increased.  They have suggested that here too increased grants must be made available.  I hope the Minister will see his way to do that some time in the future.</P>
    <P>We all regret that the dispute which the Minister has with the vets is continuing. It is hard to understand exactly what the difficulty is.  Many people have made suggestions to settle it which have proved to be of no avail.  At one stage the vets indicated that they were prepared to accept the lay testers on the basis that <Col N="774" /> their clinical involvement would be greater.  How exactly this involvement could arise is difficult to understand but I took it at the time that if a herd was found to have certain animals in it which were affected by brucellosis instead of waiting a period to decide whether to test the animals again a vet would walk amongst them and decide which animals were doing well and which animals were not, and that those animals which were not doing well would be tested.  What contribution that would make to the reduction of brucellosis I do not know but looking at it from the medical point of view one would feel that it would make some reduction, whether the cost would be justified or not.</P>
    <P>I recall the case of one herd owner who had an out farm, and when he was using his home farm he had no brucellosis but unfortunately he transferred his cows to his out farm and in his next test his cows had developed brucellosis.  He was offered £200 but he did not want to part with them. I join with the others in asking the Minister to see to it that the price of those animals is increased, because if the farmer had to replace the animals it would cost much more than £200 and unfortunately there were three or four concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a cost involved here for the State and one wonders is there any way an insurance company could be asked to interest itself in a scheme such as this, on the basis that a herd would not be offered for insurance until such time as it had been tested and proved to be disease free, and that it must continue to produce tests of disease freedom over a certain period of time, perhaps more frequently than is necessary for export, that the premium would be geared to take up the extra price over the £200 or £250, that the State would pay the basic £200 or £250 and that the insurance company would come in with half the remainder.  In this way herd owners might be encouraged to insure their animals.  Having heard this man's story I feel that the veterinary services should be organised in such a way <Col N="775" /> that as soon as it came to their notice that this man's herd had become infected on the out farm they should be able to send out personnel who would investigate not alone his farm, but every farm around it, for the presence of brucellosis.</P>
    <P>A more frequent story is that an animal was brought somewhere and was taken into the herd.  Once such a case is revealed personnel should be ready to move out immediately and trace that animal not alone to his previous herd but to the stock with which he came in contact, perhaps being taken in a lorry or mixing in a mart.  By doing this intensively and conscientiously over, say, a 12-month period I believe much could be done to break down the chain of brucellosis spread throughout the country.  It would keep under observation people who are breaking the law and taking cattle from one place to another, thus helping to spread the disease. There has been an allegation that brucellosis is spread by badgers and foxes.  This brings up the question of providing incentives to kill those animals.  There is some incentive, perhaps it is not enough.  Perhaps it should be increased within the area which is free from brucellosis.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious to everyone that irrespective of how soon the Minister settles his problem with the vets it will be very hard to catch up with the backlog.  The work that I am suggesting would involve lay people and it would involve vets.  Perhaps in this way it would provide the vets with an incentive on the clinical side and they would be prepared to divest themselves of the more mechanical side of testing.  Possibly the lay testers could do a preliminary test and the final test for export could be done by the vets.  In this way the work could be divided.  There would be more work for everyone.  It would probably involve an increased cost to the State at the beginning but over a long period it would lead to a reduction in the cost to the State.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the farming problem is the fact that co-operatives are to be taxed in the next financial year.  In the beginning one was of two <Col N="776" /> minds about this, until one learned that even though they were free of tax on certain of their activities, they were not free of tax on other activities. Those were the activities in which they were competing with the local business people.  On the agricultural side freedom of tax is a very important incentive and it is one that should be preserved.  One would like to think that the Minister for Finance would change his mind about this next year. It is obviously in the long run a tax on those farmers whom it was never intended should be taxed when it was introduced first.  But judging by the reports that are being made available all farmers will eventually be caught in the tax net.  The co-operatives' profit, one would like to think, would find their way back into the pockets of the farmers.</P>
    <P>Looking at some of the figures which have been produced in relation to farmers' costs, one must agree that this is necessary.  The figures that were produced in January, 1975 indicate that in 1974 the percentage increase in farming costs was 37.8 per cent.  This was a colossal increase. Last year they were down to about 20 per cent.  Our figures are higher than other countries in the EEC which seem to be only about 10 per cent to 15 per cent or less.  It is hard to understand why the costs to our farmers in 1974 should be 37.8 per cent.  Were they so far behind in investment and development that they had to put in this increased cost to catch up with their colleagues on the Continent, or are there more middlemen in this country supplying goods to the farmers?  Are the co-operatives not doing this?  It is obvious that they should provide outlets and cheaper goods to the farmers for their production. I would like this theme to be developed and to have an answer to it.  One would like to think that the co-operatives instead of recording profits would in fact plough some of those profits into the reduction of farming costs.  If this were done the money would not be there to tax. Even if it were, it would escape the tax net in a justifiable way.</P>
    <P>These are my observations on the <Col N="777" /> Minister's statement introducing the Estimate for his Department.  The Minister should ensure that, in future, so far as possible, the agricultural markets of the EEC are kept for the farmers of the EEC.  This includes our own farmers.  If at any time a difficulty in regard to prices arises again, he should ensure that the increase does not go to the middlemen but to the producer.  The fact that cow numbers have fallen by 116,000 and overall cattle figures have fallen by 280,000 suggests there will be a scarcity in the coming year or two.  If this is so, it will be quite reasonable to import extra meat to meet the demands in the EEC. Probably prices will then increase and we will have an increase in numbers in three or four years' time. Whoever is Minister then will have to be on his guard to ensure that, if the people are encouraged to produce extra, they will be amply rewarded for doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate covers the activities of our largest State Department. The Minister's introductory speech and his notes dealing with the activities of the Department convey a good deal of information.  We are always grateful for notes of this description.  They help us to recall some of the points we want to make as representatives of rural areas.</P>
      <P>I welcome whatever increases are taking place in general output.  When one talks of exports, one immediately thinks of beef, milk, milk products, pigs, and so on.  It is understandable that we should have an increase in exports at this stage.  I hope that trend will continue.  The ramifications of the Department are many.  We must examine what can be done to provide better leadership.  I am not saying the Minister is not providing all the leadership he can possibly provide but, since we entered Europe, there has been a tendency for the Minister to have to divide his time.  This is a very serious aspect of organisation.  The Minister has to give a great deal of his time to European affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers engaged in this type of activity should consider upgrading the <Col N="778" /> status of their Parliamentary Secretaries, who have to attend in this House in the absence of their Ministers, to a standard which would ensure that the House would have as much confidence in the Parliamentary Secretaries as in the Ministers.  I am not saying any Minister holding the portfolio of Agriculture and Fisheries will not be worked to the bone.  He will, and beyond it.  I have heard former Ministers say they would prefer to run any three Departments of State than the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, even allowing for the fact that the Department have one of the best backups in Europe.  I know this from my experience as a Deputy. We have a wonderful backup at central and local level in this Department. To make them more efficient and to provide better leadership, this whole aspect of the division of duties of Ministers should be considered.</P>
    <P>We all know costs have risen greatly in the past few years.  It is a regrettable fact that they will continue to rise as time goes on.  Apparently, farmers have taken advantage of the package deal provided by the ACC late last year or early this year for a series of loans to farmers.  The ACC had a target of £1 million in mind.  It seems farmers have confidence in the future because they are looking for more than £1 million.  I believe to date applications to the ACC have gone far above the £1 million mark.</P>
    <P>The price of steel used in farm buildings is to go up.  Apparently British Steel complained in commercial circles that their product was being sold too cheaply and have now decided to increase their prices.  To avoid as much of the increase as possible, it would be a good thing if the technologists in the Department considered to what extent steel could be replaced in the construction of farm buildings.  We have many other products. We have Cement Ltd.  The Department's advisers should provide information to farmers on the type of material to be used in the erection of those buildings, since farmers have to go into debt to erect them and pay a fairly high amount of money to service the loan and so on.  We must try <Col N="779" /> to cut costs to the bone in the matter of farm buildings.  As we all know we are underdeveloped, so to speak, in regard to farm buildings.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that, even in respect of the smaller units, there must be a concentration on better housing if we want to preserve grass, to have earlier and later grass, better silage and so on.  In some counties winter lasts for almost two-thirds of the year especially, as Deputy Hugh Gibbons said, in the drumlin soil areas where it is not possible to put cattle out to grass particularly in a year when there is a very wet winter and a very late spring.  Therefore we should be able to plan our production in a way that would avoid the necessity of putting cattle to bad grass too early.  Otherwise the cattle leech the soil so that it is not capable of producing further grass.  This happened in the past especially in 1964 which was a bad year in relation to markets and so on. Regardless of whether moneys borrowed from the ACC are utilised for the improvement of grassland, for the enriching of land, for the development of housing or for the purchase of nitrogenous manures, we must keep an eye at all times on the question of cost, because the more we develop the greater will be the cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons referred, too, to the orientation of the farming mind towards markets rather than towards aids.  We should all welcome this trend which involves many elements, but in this regard we have fallen down in the past in relation to the question of co-operativism.  When one speaks of co-operativism in agriculture one thinks in terms of co-operation on a basis other than on a very narrow front.  There is widespread opportunity for co-operation but now that we are in Europe we might be said to be almost late in this regard.  However, now that this question has come to the forefront, let us consider the extension of the co-operativism we have. It might be said that, apart from dairying, co-operation in agriculture is non-existent, although in the west there are various extensions of the co-operative movement.  These have <Col N="780" /> been led by the Department and have proved to be very satisfactory in relation to the generation of money and the wise use of it.</P>
    <P>To this extent this type of activity is to be welcomed, especially in the smaller farming areas.  Speaking of the definitions &ldquo;small&rdquo; and &ldquo;large&rdquo; in relation to farmers it is my contention that we should talk about farmers generally, all of whom are contributing to the national product.  Let us forget about trying to put one section of the community against another.  We have farming organisations whose whole time is spent on this sort of argument and counter argument, but one should deplore those bogus organisations which purport to speak for farmers but sometimes misrepresent them.  I am not speaking of the large and well-founded organisations such as the IFA, Macra na Feirme and the ICA.  Rather, I am speaking of organisations set up for the purpose of misleading individuals.  If farmers wish to join an organisation I advise them to join a national organisation, such as the IFA or Macra na Feirme in which there is plenty of leadership.  All farmers, be they large or small, should be in some such organisation.</P>
    <P>The year 1975 could be regarded as a good farming year despite the fact that it was one of the driest periods on record.  What was regrettable about the year was our failure to deal with the distribution of the potato crop. The acreage under potatoes last year showed an increase on previous years. This resulted in increased production but it was a shame that we did not take advantage early on of the alleged scarcity and invite the Sugar Company or some such organisation to buy all the potatoes on the market at harvest time when the going price was about £50 per ton and then to release them to the market at a later stage.  It is a reflection on us that in times of shortage, alleged or otherwise, we have more spivs than has any other country in Europe, people who are ready to take advantage of any such situation. Our laxity in regard to potatoes last year is all the more regrettable when one realises that this crop is a major part of our staple diet.  In any <Col N="781" /> event, we should endeavour to ensure that no such situation will arise again, that we will not allow the spivs to regulate the market price which in the past year has been a scandal.  I recall a statement made by the North Dublin Growers to the effect that they could have produced potatoes last year and sold them at £50 per ton whereas they were sold afterwards for prices three times as great as that.  This sort of situation should not occur in what is basically an agricultural country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department feel that planting, particularly of small areas, in a neighbourhood which the Forestry Division is anxious to acquire for the expansion of an existing State forest is likely to prevent the creation of a viable big forest which would have economies of scale and management, and so on.  The disfavour with which the Department view the planting of small plots beside a large State forest is implicit in the absolute discreation which the Minister has and of which applicants are warned in the Department's explanatory leaflet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that at all.  I could not accept the Deputy's description of the Department's policy.  I refer the Deputy to a speech made by a former Minister for Lands, ex-Deputy Michael Moran of Castlebar, on the 15th October, 1960, in which he very strongly reprobated the very practice which our present Minister is equally trying to discourage.  As long ago as 1960, the policy as expressed by the then Minister was that he thought it should be readily appreciated that the planting grant scheme would not achieve its purpose if it were allowed to interfere with the proper development of State forests. The then Minister said he felt bound to draw attention to the fact that planting grants were payable under the Forestry Act of 1946 solely at his discretion and that there were bound to be some situations of the kind he had described, which was on all fours with the present one, in which the interests of orderly unified planning would force him to withhold grants. That policy has been pursued ever since by the Minister in charge of that Department and is not being departed from by the present Minister.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question last week I stated that I was satisfied with the results of the farmers retirement scheme, which came into operation two years ago.  I would refer the Deputy to this reply where I gave details of progress to date.</P>
      <P>The inflow of applications continues to be satisfactory.  The level is not as high of course as in the initial stages but, as with any new scheme, many of those who applied for consideration at that time did not have a genuine intention of participating.  Those making application now however are fully aware of the conditions that have to be fulfilled and accordingly they are more likely to be genuinely interested in availing of the benefits.</P>
      <P>The question of adjusting the annuity to take account of increases in the consumer price index is at present under close examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that, having regard to the fact that since November <Col N="784" /> last there have been only 120 applications, we may take it that the number is lagging, and that unless the terms are made more attractive this scheme will disappear within the next 12 months or so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's judgment is that the flow of applications is satisfactory. He would not accept that the scheme is grinding to a halt, as the Deputy appears to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that since the inception of the scheme there has been a total of 1,200 applications and that in the last six months only 100 applications have been received?  One could deduce from that simple fact that the scheme is not as attractive as it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <P>No.  The Deputy knows very well that any new scheme always attracts large numbers of applicants initially, partly representing a backlog of people who would have availed of such a scheme had it been there and partly consisting of people, as the Minister says, who did not properly appreciate the implications of the scheme.  That hump is now subsiding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I am. There is a criterion applied to the provision of rural kiosks, which is that creditable revenue of about £250 per annum should be available. Creditable revenue in the call office telephone in Newtowncashel is not sufficient to provide the kiosk.  It was only £64 in the 12 months ended 30th June.  That is about 25p per day, which is far less than would be adequate to justify the provision of a kiosk, and people in other areas where the revenue is nearly sufficient to justify a kiosk would have entirely justifiable complaints if they were not provided with kiosks. However, a kiosk could be provided under guarantee by the local authority against loss in its provision and maintenance, and if there is strong demand for that, I suggest it be taken up with the local authority.</P>

Is the Minister aware that the IDA owe the company £5,500 in equity capital, which is the balance of the equity capital they agreed to subscribe but, because of the technical problems which arose from the incorrect advice given by the IIRS, the IDA decided not to put up the balance of the money, which is about £5,500?</P>

      <P>I do not accept the accusations of the Deputy that the IIRS gave false information in this case.  I am in a little difficulty because the solicitors to the company have <Col N="793" /> said they are going to sue the IIRS and I would not like anything I have said here to influence in any way their decision in that regard or, indeed, any further legal proceedings that might come about as a result of this.

But if there are proceedings they could take six to 12 months to dispose of and in the meantime the company is gone irredeemably, and this is a company with valuable contracts which has patented a new form of hydraulic saw which was highly successful until the IIRS intervened and then unfortunately severe mechanical problems arose and it is only now the company are in a position to overcome them.</P>

It is his objective to give as much information as is available and, as was stated in an answer in this House in November last year, the statistics in the Department are not so organised&mdash;this often happens in various areas&mdash;as to enable a reply to be given to the Deputy.  I shall certainly convey to the Minister the Deputy's dissatisfaction with that state of affairs and his desire to see statistics organised on a basis that would enable the information to be supplied.

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was referring to various aspects of the working of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and trying to indicate some of the matters which may affect this Department now and for the future.  The present year is a good period, as was last year, for the sale and export of beef.  Unlike the year 1974, a good deal of progress was made in 1975 and up to now in the promotion of beef sales in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, we are entering a period of over-supply in beef.  There could be a demand for cheaper beef, and once more the problem of intervention arises.  It is apparent that in certain parts of Europe the market for beef is wilting, especially in Italy where a good deal of confusion exists regarding imports there.  I would expect that the Minister will keep an eye on our trading relations with the Italians.  Due to a crisis in their economy, there is an embargo on imports and this extends to beef as a product.  Regrettably, the embargo provides for the operation of a 50 per cent deposit scheme there which extends over a period of three months.  There is no return on the money which is invested in the product and, therefore, the customer <Col N="802" /> stands to suffer and the market will tend to wilt.  There are other signs, notably in the British market, of a trend towards trying to buy cheaper beef and they are looking at all aspects of this matter.  We would want to be fairly active in trying to place our exports of beef in the best market. There could be a glut of beef, notwithstanding the fact that we have not the numbers available which would bring about a glut on our part but there are considerable numbers of beef cattle elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If this trend develops, it could seriously affect our prospects in the coming year.  I do not propose to make it a bone of contention on the floor of this House, but when a big country accepts the status of a partner in the Community it is highly questionable whether imports or essentials like foodstuffs should be taxed&mdash;because it is, in effect, a three months' tax; it is an embargo and the money is held for three months&mdash;and whether the authorities in Europe should permit such arrangements.  I suppose the Governments concerned will argue that domestic conditions are forcing these arrangements upon their countries, who are in financial difficulties.  However, if conditions like that continue for long, it could well bring about an imbalance in the sales of beef and could force intervention to the fore again.</P>
    <P>While intervention was thought up as a means of evening out the marketing of certain commodities, and while it could be said to have achieved some of the aims for which it was set up, it can be abused and, in certain circumstances, it could cause a serious imbalance in marketing conditions if allowed to continue unchecked.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of a sheep policy in Europe.  I assume the French, who are leading members of the European Community, are not too keen on a sheep policy, but if it is desired to keep up the numbers of sheep, there will have to be leadership in this regard.  There is no such thing as an intervention policy for sheep in Europe.  I am not querying that aspect of the problem, but it is a pity that there is no arrangement <Col N="803" /> at European level which would provide that the sheep-producing countries would know at any given period what the short, medium and long term position would be for mutton and lamb exports.</P>
    <P>It is a matter which affects us very seriously and regrettably in recent years we have not depended to such a great extent on sheep as we did in the past.  The price of beef has been so buoyant that we have rather forgotten about sheep and this is a pity.  In a much more depressed period than now I argued that we should always try to provide a balance.  The export of mutton and lamb was very valuable in the past and that situation could recur. No matter how well we may do with regard to sales of beef we should try to encourage the expansion of the sheep industry.</P>
    <P>According to the statistics given by the Minister, the acreage of certain crops has fallen and this applies to wheat and barley.  We should not allow this to happen no matter how good the market may be for other products. The Minister should encourage farmers to extend the acreage under barley, wheat and other cereals.  We are very bad at providing fodder for livestock. We always go in for early and late grass but sometimes we may have bad weather extending far into spring. We are not very good at producing catch crops which could be a great standby to supplement the grass we produce and to feed cattle when fodder is scarce.  Many farmers are debating these matters but I am afraid there may be a communications gap here.  Last night I listened to a debate on milk production and the points made were most enlightening not only with regard to feedingstuffs but also with regard to herd management.</P>
    <P>When we consider production we must also keep our exports in mind. In his statement the Minister said we should become export-orientated.  It may be that this did not happen in the past.  There are a number of elements that make up a good export-orientated programme for primary products.  I am not only referring to the Department or to governments when I say this.  There should be more reliance on <Col N="804" /> discussions at farmer level and it should be approached in a co-operative way.  The Department could provide a lead in this direction.  I suggest to the Minister that he might consider having a series of lectures by experts in his Department who have studied the markets.  These lectures might be held at regional level.  I am not in favour of producing mountains of paper.  There are mountains of paper in Europe as well as mountains of other commodities.  The right thing to do with a mountain of paper is to put a match to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's point about the desirability of becoming more export-orientated. I presume he has discussed it with his experts.  The question arises how can we get people actively involved. I suggest we should try to do it in a practical way by contact, by sending out a few experts to the regions to encourage the producers to think in terms of exports.  I am not blaming the producers or anyone else for not doing this already.  We have had a peculiar history with regard to the sales of our primary products.  We were in the shadow of a paternal neighbour who had enormous resources, who wanted cheap food and who could put the screw on us at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not spend much money as an investment on our herds and we did not think up other methods such as those operating in central Europe. It should be remembered that in central Europe they have not the resources we have and they rely on catch crops to help out the other main feeds they produce.  We have only come to realise that silage has wonderful attributes and we are only discovering ways of making better silage.  However, there are other foods that can withstand the test when it comes to producing beef and milk. We should consider all those aspects in our efforts to get a better return for our producers.  We have never thought in terms of producing a cheaper article because the State was <Col N="805" /> always ready but the State will not be there in the future.</P>
    <P>We should reconsider our whole approach to marketing.  With our entry into Europe we got rid of the idea that Britain was our only market for our foodstuffs.  Britain is still a good customer but at a better price. I accept that there are snags involved in selling to other European countries but we can surmount them.  I should now like to deal with the farm building improvement scheme which will cease to operate shortly and the cattle headage payments scheme and the beef incentive scheme.  A considerable amount of money has been set aside for these schemes.  The headage payments scheme is not working well in practice.  It was decided to operate this scheme on the basis of electoral divisions, but there should be a better way of applying this scheme.  I have had occasion to write to the district offices in connection with this scheme and, although my query was dealt with speedily, the payment was not made to certain farmers on the grounds that they did not apply on time or that the application was mislaid. There should be a more equitable way of administering this scheme because it is not working well at present.  The many complaints about it are well founded.  The Minister should re-examine its operation.</P>
    <P>In my view good work was done under the farm buildings improvement scheme.  It was a simple scheme and many farmers extended their farmyard income as a result of it.  I know of farmers who were in receipt of unemployment assistance and built up a farmyard income as a result of the encouragement provided under the scheme.  I do not think the new scheme will work as smoothly.  If it applies to certain categories of farmers, it will create difficulties.  From our experience we know that the rules of the scheme were too severe for many farmers and they were not able to attain the status of a development farmer.  Has the Minister thought of modifying these rules?  In considering matters like this one must, firstly, consider the objective of achieving a certain standard of farming and, secondly, one is inclined to look to the <Col N="806" /> past and become sentimental about the farmers with small holdings.  For that reason it is a difficult matter to discuss without becoming scatter-brained about it.  However, we should have a simpler set of rules to coax the farmer with a small holding who would have difficulty in achieving the status of development farmer.</P>
    <P>We cannot have all development farmers.  We started late in our efforts to change our farming pattern.  The Germans are well ahead of us in evening out their farming system.  The last time I was in rural Germany I noticed that they were providing the man they were taking out of production with the usual perquisites such as a pension and they were encouraging the man coming in&mdash;not with a great deal of subsidies&mdash;by allotting him roughly the equivalent of 40 acres to bring him up to about 80 acres.  We may not be able to achieve that sort of pattern but we should be able, over the years, to achieve a more adequate acreage and with proper application, work and management we could create the sort of pattern which would be reasonably successful here.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we should have such a fall in cattle numbers because this can create imbalance.  We should take all possible steps to counteract this and encourage expansion of the national herd, whether through direct beef aids or aiding the cow herd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not forget we gave the incentives which were very good ones.  We should have had a smaller number of cattle because we had operated an enormous scheme of TB eradication.  This was one reason why we had fewer cattle.  We had many different diseases.  We still have them and the sooner we get rid of <Col N="807" /> them the better.  But we have now a market which, I suppose, was never so buoyant before.  I hope it continues. Before the Minister came in I was referring to things that could cause a drop in this market.  I hope that does not happen.  At the same time we should again encourage the building up of the national herd to a level surpassing anything we had in the past.  We have the scope to do that now.  We are not using the amount of nitrogeneous manure that other countries use to boost their grass to carry more cattle.  We are not careful enough in handling our grass, not careful enough in dealing with disease and this is one reason we shall find it very difficult to eliminate brucellosis finally.  It will cost us relatively much more than the eradication of TB.  Farmers must be disease-conscious before we can be rid of it finally.  I regret they are not so conscious.  I do not know what measures could be taken to make them more acutely aware of the damage which an animal affected by brucellosis can do, not only to neighbouring herds but throughout the length and breadth of the country. This is happening with the knowledge of people who should be alive to the consequences it can have.  How often do we see cattle dumped in canals and in other places where they die?  A person who would do that in other countries would not only be prosecuted but persecuted.  It is a very serious matter and I regret to have to say this in a Parliament which represents a primary producing country producing the best beef in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if there is a market in Europe or elsewhere for meat products with added value attached and, if there is, how long it would last, how much and what kind of added value could be added and what price should we aim at for the finished product.  Many elements enter into this and I am not sure that there is a great deal in it&mdash; perhaps there is.  It is said that vacuum packed meat in England commands one-fourth of the market there.  This meat is different from what I was referring to.  I am referring to beef that is specifically treated to have added value made up of a high content <Col N="808" /> of elements that would make it attractive to the palate.  If it is true that one-fourth of British consumption is of vacuum packed meat some co-operative society here should investigate that aspect of the market.  I am thinking of a co-op that would be able to research the matter from the ground up.  We should have reached the stage now when we would not ask the Department to do this sort of work for us.  If we have good co-ops engaged in the handling and processing of beef they should be able to research this possibility and research the market also.  This, I think would conform to the Minister's ideas about market orientation.  It is no use talking to the man who is unorganised about market orientation until he has leadership which should come from his co-operative society.</P>
    <P>I notice the land project is to be discontinued, as is the farm building scheme.  We hope that the schemes which will be supplanting them will be equally as helpful to the farmers, because those schemes were a great help.  The agricultural advisory services continue to be a great source of education to the farmers in each county.</P>

      <P>At this time, on a nice, quiet summer afternoon I feel like saying a few words on this important Estimate, and if the spirit moves me perhaps more than a few words.  Being far removed from the <Col N="809" /> hustle and bustle of by-election work it is an opportunity that I seldom get to come in to speak on an Estimate. As the Minister is aware, we have a very busy Whip's office and to find time to come down to talk in the House is not easy.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to say a word or two about the timing of the debate.  It is unfortunate that this debate takes place at this time.  It is something like two or three years since we had a debate on this Estimate, the most important Estimate that comes before the House, and it is unfortunate that it is used now at a time that there are two by-elections in progress and when many of those people who would like to talk on this Estimate are away in the hills of Donegal or some such place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a feeling the Minister provided the opportunity to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government and to the Chief Whip to the Government, to come along with this Estimate to keep the House going for a couple of long days and to avoid divisions and for no other purpose really, and that is unfortunate. Were it not for the fact that a certain fast and very comfortable CIE train left the rails about five months ago I also would be in Letterkenny or somewhere in the hills of Donegal campaigning at this time. Unless we are able to round up somebody else, and I doubt on my side if I can do that, or unless somebody comes in on the Minister's side to speak for another few minutes this evening, the debate finishes and the Minister will get in.  I do not begrudge the Minister getting in and I want to make that perfectly clear, but it is unfortunate that those rural Deputies who would like to speak on this Estimate are not here now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had from the Minister a very long and far-ranging speech.  We have also issued by his Department a very valuable document on the main activities of the Department.  I would like at this stage to begin where Deputy <Col N="810" /> Carter finished by paying tribute, and it is right that we should do so, to the staff, from the secretary down, of the Minister's Department and to the staffs of all local departments all over the country.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is very farflung. It is a very wide-ranging structure, and certainly we have always got excellent co-operation, excellent attention from all officers and officials of the Department both at central and local level.  This should be taken fully into consideration when the proposed restructuring of the agricultural education services and of the local agricultural committees and all of these bodies is being considered at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech naturally refers to a reasonably good farming year in 1975.  At the moment with weather conditions as they are and crops looking good the outlook for a reasonably good year in 1976 is also there.  We must remember that in the previous two years, 1974 and 1973, we had what might be considered disastrous years for farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not 1973.  That was the best year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>1973 was not all that good either.  To some extent it was good, but certainly 1974 was a very bad year as far as agriculture was concerned. At this stage I am not going to go into the reasons, the whys and wherefores for that, but unfortunately that appears to be the pattern of Irish agriculture over quite a number of years.  There are good years and bad years.  We cannot, I agree, blame the Minister for quite a lot of the bad years.  Weather conditions, as everybody knows, play a tremendous part in agriculture and in the outcome of agriculture and whether we are going to have a good year or a bad year.  If you have the wrong weather at particular times of the year certainly that will affect the outcome as far as farming is concerned for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I mention this at all is that I feel that since we had a good year last year and hopefully will have a good year this year, we should not regard everything in the garden as <Col N="811" /> rosy.  There are difficulties and problems. There is no question about that.  Everybody realises and appreciates that, but when we have a bad year we shout and growl and bawl our heads off about the difficulties of farming and all the rest of it.  When things are going well in agriculture, when we get a good break, a good year, we should get down to the task of planning for the future and for the development of agriculture in the future.  A good year is the proper time to do that, to set our targets, to set our sights, to prepare and plan for the future and now is the time when we should be doing that.  It has been said that the Minister did not refer to planning and development for the future.  Be that as it may, the good year is the time to be doing it.</P>
    <P>I come from Wexford, a constituency which to my way of thinking is an ideal one from the farming point of view as far as this country is concerned and possibly as far as the world is concerned.  We have a mixed farming economy there where the growing of cereals, of root crops, horticultural produce, the dairy and beef, pig and bacon and sheep industries go hand in hand.  The Minister will agree that Wexford farmers made an amazing success of that type of farming.  At present in Wexford we are probably producing most of the country's wheat, a large percentage of the country's barley, of beet for sugar production and, at the same time, carrying on a tremendous dairying and beef industry. We have a huge sheep population and an excellent pig and bacon industry. Wexford is the ideal farming community where farmers work hard, long hours and are prepared to put everything into the land in order that they get the best results from it.  On any one farm one may find tillage and beef and milk production.  That is the ideal type of farming for this country.  It is hard work.  They are very industrious farmers who put a lot into it but who, in turn, reap a lot from their labours.</P>
    <P>Wexford farmers have shown what they can do in horticulture.  I was rather disappointed to learn from the Minister's statement that so little cash <Col N="812" /> is being made available to that industry. In Wexford we produce thousands of tons of strawberries each year. Other fruits are grown also.  Horticulture plays a very large part in the farming economy of that county.  A man with a small acreage&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;can go into horticulture and make a good living from it.  Wexford has shown the way in this respect.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable talk in the course of this debate about market aids and so on.  In the past we were too inclined to depend on market aids and too little on increasing production&mdash;seeking greater returns from the land and from our cows.  We are told we have the lowest milk yield.  If it is correct, it is a pity. I remember a few years ago in Wexford when the amount of barley or wheat taken from an acre was very low.  It has since been increased, in many cases doubled and, in some, more than doubled.  It is very important to increase production rather than seeking more aids and higher prices and, in turn, pricing a commodity out of the consumer market.</P>
    <P>I was rather enchanted by something Deputy Carter said during the course of his contribution.  Referring to the shortage and very high price of potatoes during the past year, he said we had more spivs to the square mile than any other European country. One questions the accuracy of that statement.  Certainly in times of shortage, as has been the case with potatoes during the past 12 months, it is amazing how people can appear on the scene and make good money out of that shortage.  For instance&mdash;reverting to strawberries for a moment&mdash;I remember seeing beautiful strawberries being sold last year at 10p, 12p and 15p per punnet, with a pound or more in each one, in Enniscorthy town and many other areas of Wexford.  I saw the same punnets in shops not far from this House at double that price and, in some cases, treble&mdash;30p, 40p and 50p per punnet.  Perhaps our producers, or the co-operatives who act on their behalf, would be able to do something to market this type of produce themselves, especially horticultural <Col N="813" /> produce, vegetables, and fruit in particular.  If farmers through their co-operatives or other organisations were able to market those items in our cities and major towns, it would cut out all those spivs to the square mile about whom Deputy Carter spoke.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the disadvantaged areas scheme.  We had a chat with the Minister across the House recently in this connection.  I think it was Deputy Allen who had a question down about the Macamores. I do not want to get into that argument again this afternoon.  The Minister told us then that he had done everything in his power to have areas such as that included in the scheme, apparently without success.  Sometimes, and I accept this, it is difficult to have accepted by the EEC some things we think should be accepted.  I would ask the Minister to give that area very special consideration, to see if there is anything his Department can do to remedy the position there.  As the Minister is aware, it is a huge area of land under sea level which means that it is certainly disadvantaged.  A huge job of drainage is required to be done there.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say on that day recently in the House that that area at one time had produced some wonderful crops of wheat.  In a fine year with not much rain the area will produce good crops of wheat.  It is true to say also that because of the manner in which it produced wheat and other products in the past it is one of the highest valued areas in the country. While some of the best farmlands in Wexford at present are valued at 50p per acre, an acre in the Macamores can be valued at anything between £1 and £1.50 and, in some cases, more.  Perhaps the Minister would examine whether or not anything can be done to provide a suitable scheme for the drainage of that area.  There is sufficient land involved to make the exercise worth while.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise with the Minister is the question of An Foras Talúntais.  We have in Wexford two very valuable branches of the Agricultural Institute, Johnstown <Col N="814" /> Agricultural College and the fruit research station at Clonroche outside Enniscorthy town.  I would like the Minister in his closing speech to deal with both. Some farmers recently asked me the cost of running Johnstown Castle, the expenditure side and the income side, and the same as far as the research station at Clonroche is concerned.  I realise that the Minister's Department pay an overall grant to An Foras Talúntais who deal with those particular research stations and agricultural colleges.  There is no doubt about the value of Johnstown Agricultural College to the farming community and also to the agricultural community of a much wider area than Ireland.  Remarkable work has been done there since this college was established.  They deserve the thanks and praise of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Another question which was raised very often during the debate was the cattle population.  I do not want the Minister to tell me now as he told Deputy Carter, that we had fewer cattle during the final year of the last Fianna Fáil administration.  It is too easy for Ministers&mdash;it happened three or four times today&mdash;especially during Question Time, to refer back to numbers, expenditure and so forth, four or five years ago.  Things have changed immensely since then.  The value of money has fallen by about half and the whole approach has changed.  We are in a different situation.  It would be as easy to go back to the good figure as the bad but nobody goes back to the really good figures.</P>
    <P>In relation to cattle population we have heard Members of the House saying they are amazed at the drop in the cattle population in the last 12 months.  It is easy to say that, but it is not so easy for the farmer who has cattle, whether they be cows, bullocks or calves, to refuse the good price when it is going.  It is always very tempting to sell when the price is good because the fear is always present that the price will drop drastically.  That is the danger all producers see.  The Minister and the Department, as well as everybody else, must do everything in their power to encourage the farming <Col N="815" /> community to keep cattle stocks up. If we let them go down too far the future of the cattle industry is in jeopardy.  People are in agriculture to get the best price going, but the danger in selling when top prices can be got for cattle, calves and cows is that we will run down our cattle population to such an extent that it will endanger the whole future of the industry.  I am sure the farming community and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are keeping a careful eye on this.</P>
    <P>There is a long statement in the Minister's speech on disease eradication. I am sure everybody agrees with him on this.  There is a very urgent need for disease eradication.  The dispute going on between the Department and the vets is a tragedy.  I do not know how it will be brought to a conclusion.  This dispute must be ended quickly if the whole future of the cattle industry, the beef and dairy industry, is not to be destroyed forever. We were given a certain period of time to eradicate disease.  We could not possibly meet the deadline.  The longer this dispute goes on, the less chance, if any, we have of meeting that deadline.  I appeal to both sides to end this dispute as soon as possible. It may call for sacrifices on both sides and it may call for a change of position. I appeal to the vets, the Minister and the Department, in the interests of the future of the cattle industry, which is so important to the country, to bring this dispute to an end immediately.</P>
    <P>The EEC policy on agriculture has been mentioned in the Minister's speech and also by every speaker in the course of this debate.  It is only right that Deputies should mention this because the EEC plays such a very important part in the agricultural business of the country that we must take note of it.  We must do our part to ensure that EEC agricultural policy suits the country.  I would hate to think what the £114 million Estimate would be if we were not in the EEC. I am, like the Minister and everybody else, worried about all the food that is going into intervention, all the beef, <Col N="816" /> milk powder and milk products going into Europe.  It is hard to understand when there is so much hunger in the world that there is so much stock-piling of food in the European Community. I may be soft-hearted, and that is no good as far as the hard-headed commercial interests of the world are concerned, but there must be an easier way of disposing of huge stocks of food stuffs than by putting them into stores, piling up thousands and even millions of tons of the finest food and letting it deteriorate or eventually selling it off at half its value to the Russians or somebody else.  I admit this is a big problem. The intervention method helped our farming community to a great extent but there must be some way of disposing of the huge supplies of foodstuffs piled up in Europe to the starving world we read about every day.</P>
    <P>I know, like the previous speaker, that the old scheme of grants for farm buildings and farm improvements will finish in September.  I fear quite a lot of farmers are not conversant with the farm modernisation scheme or with the methods of securing grants to improve their holdings.  There is need for much greater information about this, as far as this is concerned.</P>
    <P>Sheep have figured very considerably in this debate and in the Minister's speech.  In Wexford we produce a huge number of sheep.  We had a very good export market in lamb from Enniscorthy, from a local factory. However, since France apparently were allowed to breach the EEC rules as far as the importation of lamb and the use of lamb is concerned, that market is gone.  That is something the Minister will have to try to see restored to this country. He will also have to ensure that French importers play their part in the Community as we are doing.</P>
    <P>Poultry and eggs have not figured very much in the debate and there are problems there.  Rabies was mentioned by the Minister.  This is a very important topic at present.  I looked at a programme on BBC television one night during the past week. It was frightening to realise that this disease could so very easily be <Col N="817" /> imported into Britain and from Britain into Ireland.  This is a horrible and disastrous disease.  The fear of this disease should be brought home to every human being in the country.  A person who illegally brings a cat or a dog into this country should be dealt with very severely. I am sure the Department and our people at the points of entry are fully aware of the dangers involved if rabies was brought into this country. It is horrible to think it could be brought in so easily.  I suggest that RTE broadcast the BBC programme or a similar programme to bring home to our people the dangers involved in this disease.</P>
    <P>Research in agriculture is very important. In no branch of Irish industry is it more important to have scientific research than in agriculture.  I am delighted to see this type of research being carried out in many of the Department's schools, colleges and institutes all over the country.  It is from this type of scientific research that we will get the improvements and developments needed for our crops, animals and fruit.  I want to refer now to horses.  I do not know if the Minister mentioned them in his speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in the notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about his speech.  I did not have time to go through the notes, although they are very valuable.  Horses are very important to this country.  We in Wexford have quite a number of horses. Some areas in my county produce good hunters and other horse stock.  Of course, we would not like to think of competing with our friends in Kildare. It is a pity that the ordinary farming community do not appear interested in keeping ordinary farm horses.  In my view, it is important that every county should produce horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not giving them enough money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably right too, and when Deputy Malone speaks after me perhaps he will look for that money for Kildare.  It is important that we do not forget the horse.  We talk about oil, the Arabs, <Col N="818" /> the possibilities of being cut off from oil, the price of oil and so on.  I am sure in a few years' time the horse will come into his own.  I am not talking about horses for Lester Piggott, for races in the Curragh or Leopardstown, or beautiful hunters.  I am talking about farm horses.  We should do something to produce good farm horses.</P>
      <P>Again, I appeal to the Minister and the Department to look more to the future, to plan for the future and to plan for a much better way of life on the land.  This is very necessary because agriculture is one of the most important and essential industries of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking generally, I should like to thank Deputies, especially those on the opposite benches, for the constructive spirit in which they offered their comments on my Estimate.  I said &ldquo;speaking generally&rdquo; because there were exceptional lapses from time to time that I hope I will be able to deal with.  This is all the more noteworthy as we are discussing an area of activity where opinions are strongly held and widely different.  Since I do not recollect that major policy issues were raised, I should like to concentrate on some of the more important points of substance to which Deputies have referred.</P>
      <P>I remember Deputy J. Gibbons started off on a rather light note and quoted a verse from &ldquo;Brian O'Lynn&rdquo;. The Deputy has done this on previous occasions and I had to remind him that there were more verses than one in &ldquo;Brian O'Lynn.&rdquo; The one that he quoted was:</P>
      <P>The bridge fell down and we all fell in</P>
      <P>But there's ground under, says Brian O'Lynn.</P>
      <P>This was the verse the Deputy thought was appropriate to the present time and to the state of Irish agriculture just now.  I can remember another verse that might be appropriate to the time he was in office and during the Fianna Fáil regime when it was said that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> Brian O'Lynn had a house to be sure</P>
    <P>He had the sky for a roof and the ground for a floor</P>
    <P>He had a way out and he had a way in</P>
    <P>There's nothing like freedom, says Brian O'Lynn.</P>
    <P>The sort of freedom that the people had at that time was to leave the land as fast as they could and they exercised that freedom.  During that whole period they left the land at the rate of 11,000 per annum.  The figures will show that they left at only a fifth or sixth of that rate last year.  Last year was probably the best year in the history of this country for people not leaving the land and for people starting farming.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that I had an adroit way of handling figures and that the good cheer that I was obviously demonstrating was absolutely and completely without foundation. He then went on to the theme that many speakers emphasised on every occasion when they spoke, that is the enormous drop in cattle numbers during the past year.  Just to put the record straight I had to remind some of the Deputies as they spoke that we had more cattle at present than when my predecessor left office.  That is a fact.  I am not saying it for political reasons except that it has been said over and over again that there has been a drastic drop in cattle numbers. You cannot sell cattle and have them on the land at the same time. Never in our history did we sell 2,235,000 cattle in the one year. There were two features about this that were exceptional.  Last year we sold 600,000 cows.  We have to regret that so many cows were sold, but it represents about 300,000 cows over and above normal selling.  This is presented as the greatest disaster in history.</P>
    <P>It is easy to explain how it occurred. I think we got cow numbers up more by retaining cows that would normally have been culled in the past few years. We kept them until they had a couple of extra calves, then we had a bad period in 1974 and the people then said that this was the time to get rid <Col N="820" /> of the uneconomic cows, milch cows to begin with, old cows, and the cows that were most likely to get disease and would have to be eradicated anyway. Also the man who previously kept a few beef cows or single sucklers felt in 1974 that he lost a lot of money, and it was brought home to him that this was not the way that he would get an acceptable income from a small farm.  I would be glad if anybody opposite who has been dwelling on this whole business of the drop in cattle numbers can tell me how a farmer with up to 50 acres can live by producing beef and get an income that will keep him in existence. I have never seen that.  We lament this change more than we should lament it.  The figure is continuously thrown at me as an indication of absolute failure of present policies in agriculture. I can come back and say that a greater indication of failure occurred between 1969 and 1973, when tillage acreage was reduced by a third in the country as a whole.  I have been told that tillage acreage went down last year.  Of course it did.  It should not go down.  I have spent a lot of time on every public occasion exhorting people to get back in to tillage because I hold that at present there is no softer life that a farmer can have than tillage.  I talk particularly of grain, and also of beet.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that we had a record acreage and a record crop of beet last year and we have a quota that Commissioner Lardinois said we would never produce in this country.  I am very proud of the fact that it was produced last year.  Not only was it produced but this year we had far more applicants for contracts for beet than we could accommodate. That is a very healthy sign and an indication that the price of beet is good and that it paid the farmers well last year.  What is the hesitation about going back into grain?  I simply cannot understand it because with present day equipment it simply means that there is a couple of weeks' work in the spring and not more than a couple of weeks' work in the harvest. We can do in two days with big combines what used to take two months to do before.  The ability to take grain <Col N="821" /> as it comes off the crop in bulk is something we should all be pleased about.  We all saw the long queues of lorries and sacks getting saturated out in those queues and out in the fields for so long.  That is gone now. Grain growing has now been made a simple process and we have higher yielding varieties, more knowledge about growing grain and good contractors in most parts of the country. These contractors should be encouraged to stay in existence.  It should be a very important part of advisory work, of co-op work, and of farming groups, to see that work is organised in such a way that contractors can remain in existence and provide a first class service for farmers.  There is no doubt that there has always been a tendency in this country to spend far too much money on machinery that costs thousands of pounds and is lying in sheds or in many cases out in the rain rusting.  The cost of this type of equipment increases with every day that passes.  I will never cease to appeal to farmers for their own sake and for the sake of the country to go back to more tillage. This is the only way they will get an income.</P>
    <P>I talked about the man with up to 50 acres.  It is not realised that no less than 66 per cent of our farmers have under 50 acres.  This is the man we have to be concerned about.  This is the family farm.  This is the farm most prevalent here.  Of course there will be areas where tillage cannot be done because of the type of terrain. They are the exceptional areas.  Tillage can be done in most parts of the country.  Indeed, there are other parts where it could be done if many of the fences which have existed over the years were removed, and if the space Deputy Browne and Deputy Carter talked about were in use.  That day is gone.  These fences must be removed and that can be easily organised.</P>
    <P>We have a shortfall of close on half a million tons of barley in this part of the country and across the Border there is a shortfall of one million tons of barley.  We are guaranteed an outlet for barley.  We have a particular marketing advantage in barley, and the price is good.  I cannot understand <Col N="822" /> when farmers are planning what they want to do, why they do not spend more time thinking about barley.</P>
    <P>I was on cattle numbers and I should not have left them because something else was a bit exceptional about disposals last year.  I said we disposed of 2,235,000 cattle.  This is referred to almost as if it was a dead loss, a terrible thing to happen, as if the people who sold them did not get the money and put it deep into their pockets or into the banks.  That is where that money went, or into the development of their farms.  I wish more of that money had gone into the development of farms and I hope it will in the future.</P>
    <P>The other exceptional sale was the export of 83,000 calves to Italy and 56,000 young cattle.  No doubt they were exceptional exports.  As I have explained to the House, there is absolutely nothing I could do to prevent those exports.  We were glad to have them when they started.  I was being told by Deputies on the other side of the House that calves were being sold for a £5 note.  Some Deputies went further and said farmers were forgetting they brought them to the market and were leaving them behind, or giving them away for £1.  In those circumstances we were very very happy to have the Italian market.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Connor who said we were far too dependent on the British market and not enough was being done about continental sales.  In 1971, we were selling no beef to Italy.  Last year we sent 136,000 tons of beef to Italy.  That indicates that there is development of the continental market.  We sent substantial quantities of beef to other continental countries as well.  We have to consider how far we want to push beef and why we pushed beef in the past. The reason is very clear.</P>
    <P>The beef incentive scheme was introduced in 1969, I think, because milk had become an embarrassment and because of the cost of subsidising and selling milk.  Otherwise we would have to give it away at the time.  It was to get people out of milk that the beef incentive scheme was introduced. The great mistake was that it was assumed it was possible for farmers <Col N="823" /> with 50 acres to get an increase from beef production.  It was never possible. If that type of farmer is getting out of beef and into something more intensive, good luck to him.  That is the only way he is likely to have an income. Ten per cent of our total land area is tilled.  In Wexford, as Deputy Browne said, 26 per cent of the land is ploughed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>About the ideal, I would think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is scope for more in Wexford.  This indicates the scope there is throughout the country. While doing this you make more money and you create more employment. You have more feeding for cattle, pigs and cows.  This is important. We can go a long way in improving the feeding of cattle.  One of the great benefits if we are producing pigs is to have our own feed on the spot.  This will be of tremendous advantage.</P>
      <P>I was reminded on several occasions about the drop in sheep numbers.  Of course I am sorry to see sheep numbers going down.  There are obvious reasons for it.  There has been no stability in the sheep trade because the French market has been opening and closing, with nobody knowing when it would open and when it would close.  Immediately it closes the price goes through the floor.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons said we were all trying to make the French the Aunt Sally when the real villains were the British.  I am sorry he is not here. He went on to say that at the Dublin Summit held last year during our presidency, an undertaking was given for more imports of New Zealand lamb. There was no protocol or no arrangement about the import of lamb, restricting it or otherwise.  Never once was it mentioned at the summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no restriction we can put on the import of New Zealand lamb. There is no way we can keep it out. The sooner Deputies and people generally appreciate that fact, the better. They are more or less accusing me of not taking measures to keep out New Zealand lamb.  There is a duty on New Zealand lamb and it cannot <Col N="824" /> go beyond 20 per cent.  That is the only restriction which can be operated against New Zealand lamb. People should appreciate this.  If they can market their lamb competitively carrying that import duty, that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons said we would have had a common organisation of the market long ago were it not for the attitude of Commissioner Lardinois.  That is not right.  I want to put the record straight.  Deputy Gibbons said this was because of his feelings of favour towards the British at all times.  I want to put it on the record that, were it not for the support I got at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers from Commissioner Lardinois, I would not have got an undertaking that some sort of interim arrangement would be arrived at before August or the end of August&mdash;I cannot remember exactly.</P>
    <P>I got that undertaking because of his support and because of his anxiety and concern to have an interim arrangement leading to the common organisation of the market by the end of 1977.  It is only right that we should say this.  I have had my own disagreements with Commissioner Lardinois, but, on many occasions he has been extremely helpful to us.  He was one of the greatest defenders of the common agricultural policy and of securing from the budget sufficient money to run the common agricultural policy.  He will be a great loss in Europe when he goes at the end of this year.  I consider it necessary to say this publicly.</P>
    <P>Regarding the future of sheep all I can say is that we are promised some sort of interim arrangement.  I am not very hopeful that it will be a satisfactory arrangement but if it is not such that it will be a decided advantage to us, we will not accept it.  In those circumstances we would then proceed to pursue the French by way of the court case with which we are ready to proceed at any stage but there is nothing more we can do. We have made quite an effort to stabilise the market for sheep meat by facilitating in every way exports of sheep and sheep meat to such places as Tunisia and Libya.  I have <Col N="825" /> had long discussions with the Tunisians in an effort to get agreement from them in relation to their taking carcase lamb from us.  They have agreed to do this.</P>
    <P>There are live exports and carcase exports to these countries and I am glad to say that prices so far this year have been good, a fact that has been admitted by speakers during the debate.  However, if we are to instil confidence in the breeders they must be assured of stability for some years ahead.  The production of sheep and lamb is not an easy line.  It is a job which requires a lot of skill.  The task is made more difficult in mountainous areas.  These difficulties have resulted in fewer people being interested in breeding sheep.  The situation is somewhat like milk in that respect except that the production of milk can be undertaken in more comfortable circumstances.</P>
    <P>I was reminded, too, of the drop in the pig population but this picture is changing and we should be encouraged by the fairly rapid increase taking place in the breeding herd and in the numbers of pigs being delivered to the factories.  We are hoping for a return within a year to the high levels we had in previous years and in this regard we are giving every possible encouragement to the people concerned in the industry.  We shall never be able to say to people that there will not be a period when the margins will be very low or non-existent because that sort of situation is bound to occur again.  The attitude in the EEC is one of fear because this is a production line which is suitable for factory-type production.  The problem is that the cycle is short and pig numbers can increase very quickly if there is an absolute assurance of a profit element at all times.  If people stay in pigs they will make a profit.  Pig production is one very real way of rendering smallholders economic and of giving them an income sufficient to provide them with a reasonably comfortable standard of living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that more people will find the courage to become involved in the industry, to get in at a level <Col N="826" /> of about 20 to 30 sows and to proceed from there to fattening the progeny. Every effort should be made to maintain pig production as a farm enterprise. It is not my ambition that people would aim for the very large units of 600 to 1,000 sows.  There are some such units and this is not a bad situation because those involved lead the way in standards and find out new ways of more economic production. These people have an example to pass on to those who are in the business in a smaller way.  At Athenry the Department are providing valuable courses in training for the management of these units.  It is our wish that there be an increasing demand for such courses because there is a great future for the industry if the whole business is undertaken properly.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Gibbons was speaking of the awful happenings of 1974 he said something which I could not understand and, in particular, which I could not understand coming from an ex-Minister for Agriculture.  He said that during that year there was a total absence of activity in the Department. That was an extraordinary statement especially in the the light of all the tributes that have been paid to officials of the Department during this debate.  I endorse all of those tributes.  I can only regard what was done in 1974 as a miraculous effort to save a situation that was extremely bad.  Officers of my Department worked far beyond the call of normal duty in order to have quantities of beef taken into intervention in a situation in which there was no organisation in existence and where the task had to be undertaken and carried out within a period of a few months. During that period between 400,000 and 500,000 cattle were taken into intervention and last year no less than 500,000 cattle were put into intervention. That involved an enormous effort.  When our own stores were filled we managed to have the cattle put into intervention on the Continent and we did the same in the UK while in the last analysis we put the beef in freezer ships.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances it is a disgrace for any responsible Deputy to <Col N="827" /> say that during all of that time the Department stood idly by.  Unfortunately, there were remarks in the same vein from other Deputies.  For instance, we heard that the feed voucher scheme was a total failure whereas it was a real success for the unfortunate people who had small store cattle.  It was that scheme that helped them to keep their cattle throughout that difficult period and the fact that there was a fraud at the end did not take from the value of the scheme. I am glad that in the first instance it was possible to persuade the fresh meat exporters to participate in the scheme and that we were able by one means or another to get the money needed to continue financing the scheme while it was still necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion bemoaned the fact that there was a fall in cattle numbers and that it was not possible to get stores.  He complained that he did not find it possible to get store lambs in County Wicklow, something which he had always found possible before. I am sorry the Deputy is not here because I wished to tell him that the Wicklow farmers have found a way of fattening their lambs rather than fattening Deputy Crinion's pocket, as happened in the past.  The smallest decrease in sheep is in County Wicklow. This is due to the trouble taken to ensure that the people who produce the lambs get the maximum profit possible.  Deputy Crinion in making these remarks is not expressing concern either for the country as a whole or for small farmers.  I know where his concern lies.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with a development in relation to milk production. It might be said that the Opposition's contributions to this debate have shown a remarkable degree of agreement as between them and us in relation to farming and agriculture.  Of course, when we get down to party politics we sometimes forget and say things which should not be said.  A good deal of nonsense has been said about policies.  Any person who has been close to this game for some time knows the lines.  Farmers do not need <Col N="828" /> spoonfeeding.  All you have to do is to provide facilities and they will see where the profit is.  Unfortunately, you cannot jump in and out of anything in farming and hope to succeed.  You must limit your number of enterprises if you are to do it properly.  I have been exhorting farmers&mdash;and I am thinking of the 100-acre and under farmers&mdash;to intensify their operations. If these people are to get an acceptable living on the land they must intensify. I believe it is there for the taking.  The way to do that is by milk, pig production and tillage.  We should concentrate on these areas because the evidence is there to prove that farming at that level will not provide an income from ranching and producing dry cattle or beef cattle.  It is great to be able to say that we have exported so many cattle and got a good return for them.  It is great for the farmer who can carry it when he is doing more intensive jobs.  But milk production has been increasing.  Last year we had an overall increase in milk production of 9½ per cent.  What is more pleasing about it is that we got a 13½ per cent increase in the west. In the first four months of this year the increase in the west was 32 per cent.  While it is difficult and expensive to start in milk production, it is obvious that the people in the west and the small farmers, are getting the message.  Indeed, the people in Wexford are getting the message in relation to milk production.</P>

      <P>They now have the advantage of the most modern equipment and advice on milk production. While their yields are still low in Wexford, the scope is enormous.  They were not able to produce suitable milk for use in their cheese factory but now the quality of milk is second to none.  We want to see this type of development in areas where milk was not previously produced.  It encourages me to see the increase in milk production on the small farms in the west.  Deputy Gibbons travels a lot to Europe and is doing very good work there, but he is not fully in touch with the situation at home.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate it. He does not seem to know that the current position in relation to milk processing is that in all but one milk processing centre there is more milk than they are able to handle.  Milk is almost an embarrassment.  A year or two ago there was excess capacity in each processing factory and a large amount of money was spent on new buildings and equipment, but I am very pleased that they will have to move again to cope with milk production at peak periods.  The ways and means by which milk production can be increased and improved have been mentioned by some Deputies.  Deputy Gibbons said there was a very substantial decrease in the number of milch cows.  We have evidence that there was a small drop in the number of milch cows but we have had a very substantial increase in milk production. This may have been due to better weather conditions but last year we had a drought for most of the year.  I believe the increase in production is due to better feeding management and earlier calving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons stated wrongly that producers are not taking an interest in production or providing advice.  They are concentrating on expanding production and improving quality in the various catchment areas. They know where they stand from testing milk as it comes in.  I know from speaking to the managers of many processing factories that they <Col N="830" /> are giving the necessary advice to producers. The Department have asked the advisory services in all milk producing areas to make a point of advising where necessary to ensure successful production and the cleanest possible product.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a panic in Europe about almost every farm product.  My advice to Irish farmers is to ignore this and to go on producing.  The problem we are creating for Europe is a small one.  We are not going to swamp Europe.  I should like to pay tribute to Bord Bainne for their milk marketing programme.  We have not yet had to put even a pound of butter into intervention.  Very few countries in Europe can make that claim.</P>

      <P>We had to put milk powder into intervention this year for the first time and we may have to continue putting it into intervention.  Before the end of the year we may have to agree to make some contribution towards the cost of marketing the surplus. It has been agreed that some arrangement will have to be arrived at but we are as well able to take it as any other milk producing country in Europe.  As one of the Deputies said: &ldquo;We have some place to go; we have scope.&rdquo; And we have some place to go, unlike the Dutch, whose yields are now so high that they have no scope for expansion.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that, in a statement which I made in the Dáil in October, 1973&mdash; Volume 268, of the Official Report&mdash; I said that grants would not in future be made for extensive reconstruction or improvement of one-teacher or two-teacher national schools.</P>
      <P>Doolin national school is a two-teacher school, and an application for a grant towards the cost of the installation of a water-flushed system of sanitation, together with smaller improvements, has recently been under consideration in my Department.  I am advised that the total cost of all the works suggested would be in the region of £5,500.  The provision of water-flushed sanitation would account for over £4,000 of that amount.</P>
      <P>I regret that I am not in a position to sanction a grant for improvements of so costly a nature, but I would be prepared to consider the question of allowing a grant towards the cost of such works as might be deemed essential for the continued operation of the school over a period of years.  I am arranging that the Commissioners of Public Works will advise my Department in that regard.</P>
