      <P>I would like to raise on the Order of Business the matter of the Special Committee on the Wildlife Bill and to direct your attention to what happened at a meeting of this Special Committee yesterday afternoon.  When the Committee came to consider section 8 of the Bill, a vote was called. The voting procedure had commenced, a member of the Committee had voted, when the Minister in charge of the Bill, the Minister for Lands, and the Chairman of the Committee proceeded to have some further discussion about the matter, with the result that the time at which the Committee had decided to rise approached and the vote was not proceeded with by the Chairman.  I would be anxious for your guidance in regard to this matter.  We, the members of that Committee on this side of the House, would wish to know if it is in order for them to raise it with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and get a direction as to the validity of the proceedings of yesterday afternoon.</P>

      <P>The Committee were set up by the House and the Ceann Comhairle has no control <Col N="1036" /> over the conduct of their proceedings. I have no knowledge of the matter raised by the Deputy other than what appeared in the Press.  The Ceann Comhairle does not review the actions of chairmen of committees, and if there is dissatisfaction with the rulings of a chairman of a committee, the appropriate procedure is for the matter to be raised with the chairman and ultimately in the House here by way of motion, if deemed necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan):</i> I wish to say a word on this; I do not think the Chairman of the Committee is here. As you know, the Wildlife Bill was cleared by the Seanad last year, and the Second Stage of it was taken here on the first day the Dáil resumed after the Christmas recess.  The Committee Stage was fixed for early in February, and it was then referred to a special committee.  The Special Committee met for the first time on yesterday fortnight and it was arranged then that amendments to the Bill would be tabled by last Thursday, and that the Committee would proceed to deal with the Bill yesterday.</P>
      <P>The Committee met yesterday at 4 p.m. under the chairmanship of Deputy John Grattan Esmonde, and proceeded to consider the Bill.  It is of significance that no amendments had been tabled by the Opposition with one solitary exception, an amendment in the name of Deputy Michael P. Kitt.  We dealt, as Deputy Haughey said, with a number of sections.  I thought it was section 6 we had reached; I have not the Bill with me, but if Deputy Haughey says it was section 8 I accept that; it is not material.  That is the section that deals with the submission of a report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy said 6 and I said 8, so we will split the difference and accept 7.  There was no amendment down by the Opposition and there was a fairly lengthy discussion on the section.  The Committee had agreed, at the request of the Opposition, not to proceed beyond 6 p.m., and when we reached <Col N="1037" /> about 6 p.m.&mdash;I cannot be certain to a matter of seconds or even a minute &mdash;agreement had not been reached on the section, and the question arose as to a vote.  It was the first vote that had been taken by this Committee on the Bill before them, and, indeed, it was the first occasion on which some of us had been present at a meeting. I speak subject to correction.  The Chairman had not actually put the issue to the meeting, but it is correct to say that the Clerk of the Committee did call Deputy Brennan's name notwithstanding the fact, I think, that the Chairman had not put the matter formally to the Committee.  A point of order was raised by me as to the method of taking a vote at a Special Committee, and the Standing Orders were read.  It was then just after 6 o'clock and the Chairman of the Committee adjourned the meeting in accordance with a previous arrangement at the request of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point.  A Cabinet Minister had some latitude in making a long statement as to his version of what happened. The position is that at the Committee when a vote was called it was quite evident that the Opposition were in the majority on the Committee.  The Minister and, I regret to say, the Chairman, a Deputy of this House for whom I have considerable respect, connived to prevent a vote being taken.  Between them they succeeded in interrupting the taking of a vote on this section of the Bill.  Voting <Col N="1038" /> had commenced, Deputy Brennan had voted and it became apparent to the Minister that the Opposition were going to defeat the section.  Therefore they embarked on a procedure to upset the taking of a vote.  I maintain that they by their behaviour brought the whole proceedings of this Special Committee into disrepute.  I am asking you to take serious note of this situation.  I want to ask you specifically if you would be prepared to have this matter dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>As I have already said and I reiterate, the Ceann Comhairle does not review the rulings given by other occupants of the Chair either in the Dáil or in Committees.  It is essentially a matter for the Committee itself and ultimately for this House which set up the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you be prepared to accept that if the normal procedure of voting at these Special Committees is to be interrupted in this way the establishment of the Special Committees serves no purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have to reconsider our approach to these committees in the light of what happened last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to explain that this was the most obvious piece of filibustering for a purpose during which one Member of the Government parties went out to try to raise the forces and the Minister himself asked what means there were of summoning back people.  He was obviously perturbed and aware.  The Chairman dithered&mdash;I can use no better word&mdash;in calling for the vote. In all other cases when a section was being put he was very quick to get it through.  In this case he absolutely dithered unnecessarily and said, &ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo;.  Finally he said there would have to be a vote, and for the Minister to say there was not a vote called is ridiculous.  It was a most obvious piece of contriving to <Col N="1039" /> prevent a vote taking place.  We could not possibly consider further meetings of this committee until we have some apology or further arrangement from the Chairman.</P>

    <Title>Draft Regulations by Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 5) Regulations, 1976, and Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporter's Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1976.</P>
      <P>The effect of the regulations before the House in draft will be to raise the level of fees payable in respect of animals presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The increases will vary according to the type of animal.  The fee for cattle will be increased from 5p to 45p per head and that for sheep will go up from 0.625p to 8p per head.  In the case of pigs the increase will be from 1.25p for a pork pig and 2.08p for a bacon pig to a flat rate of 12p for both types.</P>
      <P>The present rates are still at the levels fixed in 1930 and 1935 when the Acts first came into force.  Over the years due to increases in salaries, inflation and the need for more intensive supervision of procedures at meat and bacon factories, the cost of veterinary supervision has risen enormously.  In recent years the cost has escalated steeply and the point has now been reached where receipts from fees no longer bear any relation to the cost of providing a veterinary inspection service.  The proposed increases will raise the fees to more realistic levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that with the great development in our meat industry the volume of animals presented for veterinary inspection has increased.  This has resulted in some increase in receipts but, notwithstanding this, the position in 1975 was that the cost of veterinary supervision of meat and bacon factories <Col N="1040" /> was about £1.6 million, whereas receipts from fees were about £100,000 only.  Obviously this completely unbalanced situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>At the new rates now proposed, the fees are calculated to yield about £500,000 in the current year and about £700,000 in a full year, on the basis of the present levels of slaughterings. The recovery of the full cost of veterinary supervision must be the ultimate aim, but I took the view that an immediate increase in fees to the extent necessary to equalise receipts and costs would not be warranted at this stage.</P>
    <P>While the increases now proposed may seem fairly substantial, they should be viewed, not in relation to the existing rates of fees which were fixed some 40 or 45 years ago, but in the context of present-day livestock prices.  A finished fat bullock is now worth £300 or more, and the proposed new rate of fee amounts to only 0.15 per cent of that price.</P>
    <P>I also have in mind the amendment of existing legislation so as to enable the fees to be collected monthly instead of half-yearly, and to increase the fee for horses to the same extent as that for cattle.  These changes cannot be effected by order and so I propose to introduce legislation at a later stage to enable them to be made.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make it clear that the proposed increases relate only to animals presented for slaughter at licensed meat factories and bacon factories, which are supervised by my Department.  They do not apply to slaughterings at premises catering for the home market only, which are under local authority supervision.  I will now ask the House to approve these draft regulations.  Before I sit down I would like to say that it was brought to my attention yesterday that it was inconvenient for Deputy Gibbons to be present this morning because of a meeting of the European Parliament.  I was asked could this be changed to next week or the week after.  I would at all times wish to convenience Members attending the European Parliament, because on a number of occasions in this House I <Col N="1041" /> have spoken about the importance I attach to their work.  Unfortunately, the request came too late and the Seanad is also sitting to consider the same matter, so I can do nothing about it.  I regret this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's apology for not being able to facilitate our spokesman on Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Jim Gibbons, in relation to this motion. It is appreciated that the Minister, when possible, goes out of his way to facilitate Members in many respects. With regard to these draft regulations which propose increasing veterinary inspection fees I should like to state that we object strongly to them.  The Minister's statement is blatantly noticeable first, for its absence of any reference to consultations having taken place on the matter with anybody and secondly for its absence of any reference to an application having been made by him, or the Minister for Finance, to the National Prices Commission to justify his 800 per cent minimum increase in fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone to them and it has been agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reference to that in the Minister's statement.  I am unaware of any reference in any report from the National Prices Commission of this application having gone before them. While not doubting what the Minister has said I would like to see proof that this application went before the National Prices Commission.  I would also like to see the comments and observations of that body on the application.  In connection with the Minister's failure to have consultations with interested parties on this matter, we all recollect the Minister, and members of the present Administration, making a great issue out of well-worn phrases and catch-cries, useful at the time, about open Government and full consultation with all concerned in anything and everything before decisions are made. Perhaps the Minister has now forgotten that he and his colleagues <Col N="1042" /> were loud in their comments on the importance of open consultation with organisations and interested people before making decisions. Apparently, this has now been forgotten but it might be resurrected again in the not too distant future when the Minister and his colleagues go before the people again.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell us if he consulted the major farming organisations, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association or the IFA, about this monstrous percentage increase.  What advice did these organisations give the Minister on these increases?  Were they asked for their advice or is it fair to say that they are only consulted by the Minister when he wants to use them to his own advantage?  During Question Time yesterday the Minister relied on the IFA Sheep Committee and the advice they gave him.  The Minister is smiling because he knows how correct I am about this.  The Minister was pressed by Deputies John O'Leary and Charles Haughey on questions dealing with sheep dipping and when he found himself on a hook from which he could not get himself off he told the House that this was the advice given to him by the IFA Sheep Committee.  The Minister told us that nobody, other than such a committee, would be in a better position to give him advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>He got fleeced by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not get fleeced yesterday.  It is a pity that the Minister is not able to say today that he had consultations with them or obtained their views on the action he is about to take in this regard.  I would have thought that the Minister would have had such consultations before hitting us with an 800 per cent increase this morning.  The president of the IFA, Mr. Lane, according to <i>The Irish Press</i> this morning stated that his organisation, which represents the vast bulk of farmers, was not given the courtesy of being asked to discuss this vast increase and he assured every farmer member that they would bitterly oppose its implementation to the <Col N="1043" /> degree recommended by the Department of Finance.  Poor old Ritchie, poor old Minister for Finance; what a buffer he is for everybody.  He takes the blame while other colleagues hide behind his back and let him take it but they are not too quick to defend him.  Perhaps there is truth in the rumour that the time is coming when he will be shifted sideways.</P>
      <P>According to the president of the IFA that organisation were not even accorded the courtesy of being asked for their views on this matter.  That organisation described this decision as a dictatorship type decision.  The Minister should tell us why those who represent the vast majority of farmers were not consulted.  He should tell us also if the factories were consulted. Can the Minister say if Clover Meats or IMP were asked for their views of these monstrous increases?  The least one can say about the Minister's action this morning is that his approach was a highhanded one.  The Minister is probably aware that the cost of this increase in one year to IMP will be in the region of £120,000 and I have no doubt that Members who consulted other groups involved in this industry will be in a position to tell the House how they will be affected.</P>
      <P>By doing what he has done in this manner the Minister is saying that the industry is strong enough to bear these increases at present.  Nothing could be further from the truth of the real situation. The Minister and his advisers should know that there has been a drop of about 40 per cent in fertiliser usage over the last couple of years. Surely the Minister is aware of the consequences of this disastrous decline in fertiliser usage in the industry as a whole.  He must be aware that the pig herds have dropped by 30 per cent in the last couple of years, mainly as a result of the confusion created by him when he advised these small pig producers to get out of pig breeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have proved in this House on more than one occasion <Col N="1044" /> how the Minister created this confusion by advising people in the pig industry to get out of that business. The Minister's denial of this monumental error on his behalf is not enough to exonerate him from the serious disaster he caused to the pig industry.  If the Minister wishes to imply that I am telling lies in this regard he may make that accusation but he will do so knowing that that is untrue and that if he consults the record of the House he will find that I am correct.  I am not lying.  If anybody is lying let the Minister look into his own heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the rules of the House as well as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  If what I am saying, which is the truth, is tinkling the Minister a little too much he has to remember that it was he who gave the advice to the farmers, not me, to get out of the pig industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should know at this stage that with the unfortunate reduction in the cattle, sheep and pig herds the throughput in factories will be seriously affected, resulting in more redundancies.  If the creation of <Col N="1045" /> further redundancies is the policy of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries they should say so and let the people know exactly where they stand.  The Minister should know that factories have closed down and that others are on short time.  This is not the right time to impose further strangleholds on the agricultural industry when those involved in that industry are reeling from the clobbering the Government are giving them in many other ways and which they propose to impose further on them if the Minister for Finance gets his way with regard to the tax on co-operatives.</P>
      <P>The Minister should know and appreciate the duties and functions of the National Prices Commission. As I stated earlier, there is no reference in the Minister's brief regarding the case made by him or by the Minister for Finance to the National Prices Commission to justify this 800 per cent increase.  There has been no report from the commission with regard to this matter in the way they normally report when applications are made for increases.  In an interjection the Minister said he was in touch with the National Prices Commission.  I accept what he has said but other than that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy will accept what I said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said.  Every other citizen has to await the report of the National Prices Commission.  The commission make a recommendation to the Government which is accepted or rejected and this is how it works for everyone in the country.  If the Government or those who support them are serious about price control there should be one rule for everyone with regard to the commission.  Seemingly there is no such rule for the Minister.  In his statement this morning he refused to say that he went to the National Prices Commission and we have no word from the commission of the case made by the Minister or of their recommendations to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it that short cuts with regard <Col N="1046" /> to the National Prices Commission have been taken by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries?  Why is it that the Minister is not prepared to go through the same channels as he and the Government have decided that all others must do?  Is there a sinister reason why the Minister did not adopt the normal procedures with regard to an application to the commission? Are we to expect comments on the Minister's case in the commission's report?</P>
    <P>There will be other speakers from this side of the House who will develop the point further, and possibly better than I have done, with regard to the operations and functions of the National Prices Commission in a matter like this.  I should have thought that if any ordinary citizen wanted even a 1 per cent or a 2 per cent increase he would have to go before the commission to justify his application. If the Chair would allow the Minister to interject, I should like him to tell us when he went to the commission and how long the case was with them.  Will the Minister let us have the report on his application, a report that should be publicised? The law that applies to the ordinary businessman or the person in the street with regard to increases in prices should apply equally to those who make the laws and those whose function it is to see that the laws are observed.</P>
    <P>There should not be short cuts for anyone in a matter like this.  The Minister cannot say that this 800 per cent minimum increase was something that developed overnight.  I hope such a matter was given due consideration by the Minister and his colleagues, that this was not just a hasty decision to bring in an extra £700,000 because the bottom of the barrel is being scraped at the moment.  I would have thought that a serious matter like this would have been discussed within the Department in the first place and discussed with the interested parties whether in the factories or in farming. I would have thought that this decision would have been discussed further by officials in the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Fisheries and finally by the two Ministers concerned. <Col N="1047" /> When the Minister was convinced that an 800 per cent increase was necessary he should have made his application to the commission at that time.  If I were a businessman and wanted an increase of 1, 2 or 3 per cent&mdash;never mind the 800 per cent increase sought by the Minister&mdash;I would have to make an application, have it processed in the normal way and substantiate my case.  From reading the monthly reports of the National Prices Commission it is evident that the increases sought are not always those that are given.  We might well ask what percentage increase did the Minister seek.  Did he look for an increase of 800 per cent or 1,800 per cent?  We do not know but we would like to know.</P>
    <P>This is the wrong time for the Minister to take such an action and it is the wrong time to do it in this manner. There is an indecent haste about the whole matter.  We have only one hour to debate it and then it will be sent to the Seanad which is being specially convened this afternoon.  I realise that the time is limited and that the Minister may not be able to reply to all these matters.  If this is the case, those Deputies speaking in support of the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary should make a public apology to the farming organisations for lack of consultation with them.  There should be a public apology to the factory people for a similar lack of consultation with them and a public apology to the general public for the Minister believing that he has the right to take short cuts to the National Prices Commission without letting anybody know that he has done so and without making any effort to tell us that he has done so until we pulled it from him.

      <P>In their present state of distress it is difficult to expect a realistic approach on the part of Fianna Fáil to a measure such as this.  It is, indeed, a far cry to 1935, when the fees were set down by this House chargeable under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930. <Col N="1048" /> At that time it would be fair to say that a 300 lbs bullock was selling at no more than £3, and similarly the price of pigs and sheep was proportionately lower.  Today we have a flourishing cattle, sheep and pig industry. We are very pleased that that is the position.</P>

      <P>In 1974 Deputy Crinion alleged that fraudulent methods were being adopted by the fresh meat factories, that it was time something was done to change that alleged situation.  As that is his opinion, he may not consider £500,000 to be out of place at this time.  We have a flourishing industry in relation to cattle, sheep and pigs.  The inspections in question here are mandatory and they cost the Exchequer £1,600,000. <Col N="1054" /> The intake from the existing fees&mdash; these were established 41 years ago&mdash;is £102,000.  The Minister's proposals will bring in an additional £600,000 and the balance of £700,000 in a full year will come from the fees chargeable while £900,000 will be extracted from the general body of taxpayers. Deputy Collins indulged in mathematics and spoke of an increase of 800 per cent but that is on a fee of 5p.  When we consider that Deputies in 1935 got an allowance of £360 compared with the £5,400 which is today's figure, we get an idea of the increases that have occurred since then.</P>

      <P>I honestly feel the Minister was deceiving the House when he said these charges will bring in only £700,000, seven times what the present figure is.  How can that be so with the fee on cattle going up nine times, on sheep, 13 times, and on pigs, six times?  The Minister gave a false picture.  The Parliamentary Secretary said we are wrong to oppose this, that the housewife would not like to be taxed to make up for the increases. Of course, measures like this are virtually weekly mini-budgets and the amount from these increases will be a greater imposition on the people than would Exchequer support.</P>

      <P>That remains to be seen. Deputy Collins asked if this could not be postponed and the Minister said it must be put into effect as from Monday. I do not see the urgency for this order which the Minister said has been cleared by the NPC.  I rushed up to see the NPC report, which is embargoed as far as the media are concerned until tomorrow morning.  In view of the Minister's reference, I feel I am entitled to impinge on the embargo and this, of course, allows the media to break the embargo.  I refer to the NPC's March report.  We have criticised these reports previously for their lateness and I hope the Minister now present will take this matter up with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The reports are two months late.  The Minister said he has the commission's permission in regard to these increases, and the report conveys this.  The Parliamentary Secretary criticised us for opposing this motion which imposes increases of <Col N="1056" /> 900 per cent in the fees in regard to cattle, 1,300 for sheep and 600 per cent for pigs.  The Department's application to the NPC has been allowed in full&mdash;I suppose the Minister for Finance said he wanted to spare the Exchequer.  There are other Deputies on this side who want to contribute and we have Deputies on the far side willing to contribute, but the Parliamentary Secretary took up one-third of the time allowed for the motion.  I agree that he is entitled to contribute but he has been assigned to Fisheries, a specific appointment, and his contribution here today amounted to an implication that the Minister is not competent to deal with this question.</P>

      <P>According to pig statistics issued very recently the number of bacon pigs that have gone for curing in the 12 months ended 31st March was 1,196,000.  Of course that was 300,000 fewer than the previous year and a further 150,000 less than the year before.  That is an indication of the failure of this Administration as far as pigs are concerned.  It appears, from the administration of the present Government, that a number of farmers are thinking it would be advisable to get out.  This imposition today can be dressed up as much as one likes but <Col N="1057" /> the situation is that it will be a great imposition.  Working on those figures, just for bacon pigs without any reference to pork&mdash;I did a sum under the terms of the new charges&mdash;the amount that would be taken in now in a 12-month period arising from the increased fees on the killing of bacon pigs&mdash;working on last year's figures for the 12-months' period ended March last&mdash;would be £143,000.  That is not taking into account cattle, sheep or pork killings.</P>
      <P>I am not accusing the Minister of deliberately misleading the House in this regard.  But no matter what way one does the sum, in view of the overall proposed increases in charges, if that figure of £700,000 is the Minister's projected income from fees under the new charges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is seven times the present figure.  Anybody doing the sum across the board in relation to the increases taking place must conclude that that figure is wrong unless&mdash;and this is very significant&mdash;the Minister and his advisers have already made up their minds that there is going to be roughly a 30 per cent fall back in killings over the next 12 months, that between cattle, sheep and pigs, there will be 30 per cent fewer to be killed this year.  As I see it, a more appropriate figure in this regard would be £1 million approximately.  From that point of view the Minister should be more elaborate in his outlining of the situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister says also that he has in mind the amendment of existing legislation so as to enable fees to be collected monthly instead of half-yearly and to increase the fee for horses to the same extent as that for cattle.  This has to do with slaughters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I listened with considerable interest to the case the Minister made in reply to the case we made yesterday.  I should like to take the Minister up on his declaration that the social and political upheaval in other countries was the result largely&mdash;if I am paraphrasing properly&mdash;of reform of a taxation system.  I should like to point out that the social and political upheavals have been due mainly to the failures of governments and the complications of bureaucratic legislation; the failures of governments to be Executives, creating impossible positions for their public service, the indecision of governments and their inability to lead.  All of these constitute a far greater element in that social and political upheaval.  I am afraid the Minister is contributing to that element in this whole attitude of his Government towards not only taxation but the whole of economics because the taxation proposals now before us have a very vital bearing indeed on economics.  If the Minister wishes to make declarations of that nature and hold out the bogey that democracy is breaking down in this country I would tell him he is not the only person who fears it but that he had better look to the real causes as to why this House is becoming a <Col N="1060" /> futility, as to why we are becoming what we are becoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxation of this sort has a large bearing on it.  I accept what the Chair says but perhaps I could digress on a generality here.  To take up the point specifically, Deputy Fitzpatrick and I pointed out yesterday that there was a very big element of this community apparently singled out as targets by this Government for discrimination, which is rather surprising having regard particularly to the constitution and history of the Minister's party.</P>
      <P>In this section we are dealing with Schedule D taxpayers.  When the Minister spoke of Schedule D taxpayers he gave the impression we were dealing mainly with people who had investment or luxury income.  Let me read what are Schedule D taxpayers. Perhaps I may refer to section 52 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 under the heading Schedule D which reads:</P>
      <P>1.  Tax under this Schedule shall be charged in respect of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the annual profits or gains arising or accruing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to any person residing in the State from any trade, profession or employment, whether carried on in the State or elsewhere; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, it covers the self-employed, professional people and the unincorporated trader.  We all know that in our society a very important element which has contributed to the social and economic life of the community has been the private trader, carrying on a small business, whether retail trading, manufacturing or anything of that nature.  We all know the contribution our professional people, be they doctors, lawyers, or any other profession coming within the scope of section 52, have made.  These are all chargeable under Schedule D and are therefore involved in this and, as we have submitted, they are being <Col N="1061" /> unfairly treated in comparison with other taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the point but, all in all, the attitude of the Government and of the Minister in regard to this seems to be one of discriminating against that element in our society.  Having said that, let us take the financial facts.  Traditionally, as I said yesterday, the position was that the Revenue got their tax in arrear in the sense that they did not collect the tax until the taxpayer had collected the money on which the tax accrued or in respect of which tax was payable.  That situation developed through historical evolution.  There was an effort to correct this, the most significant and main effort being that made in 1960 with the introduction of PAYE.  Nobody will dispute that. Nobody quarrels with the Minister for wanting to correct the situation.  I defined the principle as being one in which we should aim as far as possible at having the tax paid when the taxpayer receives the taxable sum.  That is a fair principle and that would mean neither side would have an unfair advantage.  It is no harm to put on record the fact that this involves a traditional advantage the taxpayer had and this is a further tightening up on the taxpayer's tax burden.  Be that as it may, we will admit the principle that the tax should be paid when the money comes into the hand of the taxpayer.  That has been achieved in the case of PAYE because the tax is deducted when the payment is due. I accuse the Minister of twisting when he said that that tax was taken in advance and I leave it to fairminded people to judge the justice or otherwise of my statement.</P>
    <P>What happens?  I am due a pay cheque on the last day of the month or a wage packet every Friday.  I do not pay any tax directly on that wage packet because the tax is deducted before I get the packet or the salary cheque.  There is no element of advance in that.  In fact there is an element of arrear because the employer, the agent of the Revenue Commissioners, does not transmit the money deducted to the Revenue Commissioners until possibly a month later.  To say the tax <Col N="1062" /> is paid in advance is typical of the irresponsibility of the approach that can be taken in this House to such matters.  It is an approach I deplore. It should not happen on either side. The Minister's statement that PAYE tax is taken in advance is, and I say this directly, a false statement because no tax is paid in advance as far as the taxpayer is concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us see now where we are going. I have disposed of statements made by the Minister.  I want to emphasise again that we are dealing with the self-employed, what I call the middle class and the professional people.  These were described adequately yesterday by Deputy Colley, Deputy Fitzpatrick and by myself.  What I say cannot be controverted.  I pointed out that on investment income, though this may not be quite as strong a case, the people involved were deserving of some sympathetic approach on the basis of justice.  Let me put the case as succinctly and in as clear-cut a form as I can for the record.  The new rules the Minister is providing in section 6 and elsewhere will mean that the taxpayer carrying on a trade or profession will pay his tax in two instalments, half in July in the year of assessment and half on 1st January in the year of assessment. That raises a difficulty.  First of all, it is probably impossible to complete accounts in that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is advancing the making of accounts up to 31st March and that is only three months. But anybody completing his accounts up to that date in each year will find that tax will be payable three months after the end of the accounting year and it will usually be impossible for him to complete his accounts.  There is another essential point to be borne in mind here.  The tax is assessed and levied not on the cash received, as in the case of PAYE, but on book-keeping results.  The Minister is taxing book profits and if the books are not ready in time there will obviously be considerable difficulty.  Furthermore, there is the difficulty and uncertainty and delay in collection.  Not only is there the problem in making the accounts up to date but there is also the problem that you are not collecting your <Col N="1063" /> actual cash and there is there an element of payment in advance in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I had better explain that remark because the Minister might say that provisions in accounts would provide for this, but it is only bad debts written off that the Revenue Commissioners will allow.  Provisions for debts that are not bad debts written off are not allowed in the tax computation.</P>
    <P>This section is really unworkable. It is unfair, especially when any mistake in assessment can mean, as I pointed out yesterday, either an overassessment on the part of the tax-payer&mdash;then he is at a disadvantage as against other taxpayers no matter what credit is subsequently given to him&mdash;or, on the other hand, he is underassessed in which case he is liable to a penalty of 18 per cent under section 29. Those people are really asked to pay from three to two-and-a-half years tax over a period of two years.  Is that fair?  Will the Minister differentiate between the mechanics and the alleviation of the impost of burden?  Will he reconsider the mechanics of this section in the light of the practicality and the unfairness of the submissions?  Will he also give some bridging relief, some transitional relief, as he did in the case of the Schedule E people?</P>
    <P>The taxpayer would be better able to discharge his liabilities for tax if the present date of the 1st of January were retained.  That is the conclusion one must read from this.  The second instalment might be accelerated so that after the end of the transitional period it would be payable in one instalment on the 1st of January each year.  I would like the Minister to consider approaching the problem on that line.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to mention again the question of investment income which comes under Schedule D.  I pointed out yesterday that that investment income may not be certain by the 1st of July.  People in receipt of dividends for investment income <Col N="1064" /> generally may not know what they will receive.  Even a person who has a bank deposit with fluctuating bank rates might not know what he will receive. I know it would not be a very significant sum but it certainly illustrates my point that with fluctuating interest rates the interest on a bank deposit, no matter how certain the deposit is to the end of the year, will not be certain.</P>
    <P>In the case of dividends you might only have an interim dividend declared, which is not an uncommon feature.  There is a great element of uncertainty in this.  There is also the great element of impracticality and uncertainty when you approach this type of Schedule D taxpayer.  The mechanics of all this needs to be looked at.  I accept that people in old age or suffering from disability, who have had provision made for their old age or disability by an investment income, are by no means in a category that can be dismissed as the well-off. Even if you consider only the well-off, the mechanics of this are impractical.</P>
    <P>It seems to have been completely forgotten that in most cases there is a levy of tax on this income.  It is fair enough if it is a question of certain State income, that is income from certain gilts, but it is not.  In the case of income from trading and dividends from a company there is normally a reduction of tax at something approximating to the standard rate.  At least these taxpayers, so far as that kind of investment is concerned, are on the same basis as PAYE because the tax is deducted straight away.  I know that under the new corporation tax there will be a change.  A tax credit will be given instead, but that only means that the Minister has got all his tax from the company and the taxpayer is being put in arrears.</P>
    <P>The cumulative effect of all the things the Minister is doing here will ultimately be the subject of an interesting investigation.  The net practical result of the Minister's policy will be in the end to bankrupt the State.  Goodness knows, with his borrowing and all the rest of it he is going near enough as it is directly to bankrupt the State <Col N="1065" /> without this indirect approach.  In many cases where investment income is concerned tax is already deducted.  Admittedly there may be a question of sur-tax but it is only the surplus, so that even in the case of Schedule D people, there is a very serious question.</P>
    <P>There is an element of impossibility in the case of traders, professional people and the self-employed because accounts will not be ready in time. There is at least an element of confusion because the taxation year will be on book profits and not on money received.  There is an essential difference there between direct payment through PAYE in any category.  This is aggravated because tax very frequently can be collected as much in advance as in arrears.  There is also the penalty and for investment income there is the impossibility of being certain on the 1st of July what the position is and already in many cases tax has been deducted.  If the investments are State investments, gilt edge, then surely by taking this attitude towards investment income the Minister is offering a positive disincentive to investment in the State from the public.  Let us see what should be done.</P>
    <P>We agree that cutting out delays in the accrual of tax to the Revenue is probably required and we have common case on the matter of evasion. Since that is so I suggest that the Minister approach the problem, first, by a revision of the rules from the viewpoint of practicality and fairness, having regard to the impossibilities arising from the date and also to the essential difference between assessment on book profits or assessment on income derived from investment and a tax on cash pay situation.  There is a difference here which requires different mechanics and the Minister should consider this.</P>
    <P>Also, some transitional adjustment is required because for the trader or professional man a cash problem can be precipitated in the transitional period and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, if that problem reaches certain proportions the Minister will not get his tax because he will liquidate the source of tax.  These considerations must be borne in mind. <Col N="1066" /> Therefore, I would ask in addition to some revision of mechanics that transitional relief be given on somewhat similar lines as was given to Schedule E taxpayers.  Why should we not give Schedule D taxpayers the same consideration as was given to Schedule E taxpayers recently and to those who went on PAYE originally?  In all these cases there was a sudden jump from paying tax in arrear to paying tax on the nail.  I fail to see why there should be discrimination against the self-employed, the private trader, the professional man, the middle-class element and the recipient of investment income, the class comprised in Schedule D under the 1967 Act, when transitional relief is afforded to the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>In 1960 in the transfer to Schedule E there was an adjustment of this nature; with the introduction of sur-tax payments in 1963-64 and with the recent transfer of other Schedule E taxpayers to PAYE the concession of a half-year's income being excluded from charge was allowed and I do not see why we cannot do something similar in this case.  I want to put to the Minister therefore a recommendation that has already been made to him by other bodies that have considered the matter objectively&mdash;it does not come from people who have a personal axe to grind&mdash;and the recommendation is that transitional relief should provide that a half-year's tax should not be charged provided the taxpayer continues his trade or profession for a period of five years or some such period, and in the case of a taxpayer receiving investment income the date should be 1st October in the year of assessment, so that such taxpayers are treated equitably with taxpayers coming under the rules of PAYE.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to see why the Minister will not accept these recommendations which are consistent with the arrangements for the changeover of Schedule E taxpayers to PAYE in 1960, with the introduction of updated sur-tax payments in 1963-64 and with the recent transfer of other Schedule E taxpayers to the PAYE <Col N="1067" /> system, all of whom were allowed the concession of a half year's income being excluded from charge.  We are asking that the Minister will do the same in this case and, if he does, he will not meet much resistance from this side of the House in regard to the principle of trying to adjust matters. We also would like to see the principle operating of tax being due when the money is received by the taxpayer and tax paid when the taxpayer sees the money.  That is a simple principle but it is not so easy to operate.</P>
    <P>It does not happen in the case of PAYE because it is a question of cash.  As far as the taxpayer is concerned, the tax is paid in cash.  The mechanics of collection are part of the Revenue's organisation after that. In the case of companies, because profits and taxable profits which are the equivalent of income are only ascertained over a period through elaborate book-keeping, another system has to be used and that has been provided for in the Corporation Tax Act.  In between you have the self-employed, the professional man and the individual trader.  He has the disadvantage that he cannot pay cash nor can the Revenue collect from him on the basis of cash as he receives it because, being a business, it has the complications of business and it must be on the result of book-keeping. You cannot do that instantaneously like collecting your pay packet.  This is essentially the gist of it.</P>
    <P>Then of course when you are bringing a group forward and imposing a cash problem, as you are doing here, why is a cushion not provided as is done in the case of Schedule E?  I am only asking for the same thing, nothing more or nothing less.  I am at a loss to know why the Minister cannot do this.  I know there is a good deal of scraping the barrel going on.  It would be very interesting to know&mdash; only the Revenue Commissioners can know and I am sure they will keep the Minister advised&mdash;what the efficiency of this process is.  How much in the long term is it going to mean to the Revenue?  How much cost is <Col N="1068" /> going to be involved in implementing impossible provisions like this?  There are a large number of questions which the public are asking.  The Minister may feel that Schedule D taxpayers are fair game, but justice has a peculiar way of working through a community.</P>
    <P>I will finish where I began by adverting to the Minister's remarks about social and political upheaval, where it originates and why.  I accept completely the Ceann Comhairle's reasoning that to expand on it would be out of order in this debate.  But, finishing on the Minister's remarks, I will simply content myself with this. I have outlined the objections to the section on the grounds of mechanical difficulty, fairness, and equity.  I have made suggestions based on the grounds of equity and precedent for a transitional period.  As we have not got the power to force it through this House I must leave it at that.  I would like to say, although I have, as is the custom, directed my critical remarks at the Minister and the Government, that every Deputy who votes on these matters must carry the responsibility for the consequences of what he is doing.  Every Deputy who goes behind the Minister into the lobby must share responsibility with the Minister and the Government for what is done.  We have not got the power to do more than protest.  On this section, on the grounds of equity and public policy, I protest most strongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are putting forward a case to give relief to people who are not being asked to pay a higher <Col N="1069" /> amount of taxation because people who are being obliged to pay a higher amount of taxation are going to get some relief.  The Deputy is asking for a massive concession to be given to people who will pay the same bill but who will not get the same lengthy period of credit.  He wants a six-month remission for people who, instead of enjoying 18 months credit as they did in the past, will in future enjoy only 15 months credit.</P>
      <P>There are 700,000 people in this country who pay their income tax on their current earnings at the time at which they receive their earnings.  There are 100,000 people who enjoy 18 months credit and who, during that 18 months, can use the profits that they earn to generate further profits for them because the money does not reach the Exchequer until 18 months after it is earned.  In fact, in a large number of cases it does not reach the Exchequer until after two years or more. There are few countries, if any, where such extended credit is given to income tax payers.</P>
      <P>I reject totally the unfair and inaccurate allegation that this Government are hostile to the group that the Deputy has classified as the middle classes, or that we are hostile to the self-employed, the professional person, or the trader. What about the concessions that have been enjoyed by those people, that have been given by this Government and that were not given by our predecessors? I want to list them, Sir.  I would suggest that fair-minded people will see that this Government have gone out of their way to assist the independent and self-employed people who are making a worthwhile contribution to our community.  We have given in each of three succeeding years, in a time of very serious budgetary difficulties, very substantial increases in income tax allowances, increases of about 55 per cent in income tax allowances which are costing the Exchequer £18 million. That would go a long way towards the reduction of the deficit.  That would go a long way towards reducing the borrowing if we had not given that concession, but we gave it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among those who benefited are the classes Deputy de Valera says we <Col N="1070" /> have no sympathy for.  We showed a great deal more sympathy for them in the last three years than the Fianna Fáil Government did for 11 years, during which they gave no improvement in personal allowances for income tax.  We have given life assurance relief to the same people.  This is a very significant benefit for people who pay the higher rates of tax.  We have increased the limits for payments by the self-employed to secure retirement benefits, a long overdue relief. But we gave it so that the self-employed may now allocate as much as £1,500, or 15 per cent, of their earnings towards their retirement pension.</P>
    <P>That is a very significant relief to the people in the Schedule D class. We have given free depreciation on plant and machinery for a further two years.  We have given stock relief. These are all very significant and material benefits for the people about whom Deputy de Valera has the audacity to allege we have shown certain hostility.  These material benefits show our real concern to assist them.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  The principal beneficiaries of the abolition of death duties happen to be people in the same category.  I consider it appropriate to point out that many of these people are no longer burdened with the difficulties of having to assess, charge and remit value-added tax from food, clothing and footwear, items in which the majority of traders are involved.  These are real reliefs, real benefits.  Of course, eaten bread is quickly forgotten and Oppositions are not prone to remember this. Eaten bread has helped people.  The bread is still there and is still being eaten.  The material benefits are still there and are much more significant than the restriction of the credit period from 18 to 15 months as proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The essential difference between Schedule E and Schedule D taxpayers is this.  The Schedule E taxpayer's liability is being increased because he is being transferred to a current year basis.  The self-employed will still be on a preceding year basis.  I am satisfied <Col N="1071" /> that the public sector employees, over 225,000 of them, would very happily elect to get the treatment that will still be enjoyed by the Schedule D taxpayers, and to enjoy that without getting a six months remission. They would be much better off if they were to have that right conferred on them.  If it was proper&mdash;and we believe it was&mdash;to bring as many people as possible within the PAYE system to achieve some equity in tax treatment, it is also proper that the period of credit extended to others who pay their tax in arrear should be abridged somewhat.  We have done this in a mild way.  We are not proposing to do as so many other countries do, to require Schedule D taxpayers to pay instalments of tax on current income pending final assessment.  As I said yesterday, if that is ever proposed here, then that would be the appropriate time to give what the Opposition are now looking for: a remission of tax to compensate for the change. That is not proposed and therefore it is not relevant to the treatment of Schedule D taxpayers to demand that they get six months remission of tax when their overall tax burden is not being increased.</P>

They may be required to pay it in an accelerated manner, but they are not paying more tax.  Therefore, the case for the extension of remission to them does not stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude as I began with an appeal to the Opposition to stop what they have been doing for the past three years, that is, trying to stimulate envy and discontent on the part of any group who are having applied to them the same tax regime as applies to the <Col N="1072" /> majority of the population.  If we want to be a just society we cannot have a small group given exceptional treatment in circumstances that do not justify that exceptional treatment and which do not confer any benefit on the community.  It is proper that all should be treated alike.  When benefits are extended and reliefs are given they should be given across the board unless there are special reasons why they should apply to a particular group or class of taxpayers.  Likewise the burden must be fairly carried.  That has always been our policy and we believe it is the only justifiable policy.  We will never in Government be party to a policy of unfair treatment of taxpayers in any group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure most people would find it almost incredible to hear the Minister for Finance accuse the Opposition of fomenting discontent and envy for the past three years, of all people to say that, the Minister for Finance, who has based the whole justification for what he has been doing over the past three years on envy and allegations of unfair treatment for one section over another.  The whole basis of justification for what he has been saying over the years has been the politics of envy.  He and his colleagues have battened on that and the country is faced with the results of that kind of politics.  To listen to the Minister one would think he believed in the proposition that people should be treated equally under the tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a few months ago he introduced in this House the Corporation Tax Bill.  How did he provide for the payment of income tax by companies who are trading under that Bill?  He provided that as a general rule 50 per cent of the tax is to be paid nine months after the end of the accounting period.  For existing companies their present two dates for payment have been preserved.  Some companies will do better than the general rule and some will be worse off.  A company preparing accounts to 31st March would be the worst off because their full tax liability is payable nine months after the end of the accounting period. An individual who is trading, as distinct <Col N="1073" /> from a company, and preparing his accounts to the 31st March, would have to pay 50 per cent of his tax on 1st July following the end of the accounting period and 50 per cent on the following 1st January.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister care to explain how he reconciles that kind of approach to a company which is trading with that to an individual who is trading, and how he reconciles that with the loud talk about equity of treatment under the taxation system?  What is the big distinction between a company, on the one hand, and an individual, on the other hand, each of whom is trading, that they should get this quite different treatment under the tax code?  Why should the individual who comes within the general description of the middle class that have been referred to earlier in the debate on this section be singled out for this unfavourable treatment?</P>
    <P>The Minister has denied that that class is being discriminated against by himself and his colleagues, but it is very difficult to convince people in that category that they are not being discriminated against when they see the different treatment being accorded to them from that being accorded to their competitors who are organised companies, when they see that the public service and office holders who are being brought into the PAYE system and who heretofore have been paying on a previous-year basis, are getting a half year's remission of tax, when they see that the self-employed and the sole trader are being asked to pay an extra half year's tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister can juggle around with words any way he likes as to whether there is an increase in the tax burden, but the people affected by this section will have to pay an extra half year's tax in a period, depending on how you look at it, of one year or in a period of two years from 1st January, 1976, to 1st January, 1978.  However you put it, you come up with an extra half year's tax.  For the Minister to say that it is not increasing your tax burden is simply playing with words.  What is <Col N="1074" /> really happening is that their payment of tax is being accelerated.  Now they are going to pay on this year's salary; under the previous system they would not have paid until next year.</P>
    <P>The really important question for all taxpayers is, how are they going to pay the money and out of what are they going to pay the money?  The people affected by this section will be asked to pay an extra half year's tax out of, in many cases, what will be available to them in the form of a smaller income because of the downturn and recession in trade.  That is what will drive a number of these people out of business, those who are on the verge of bankruptcy at the moment.  The Minister has talked as if all the people affected by this are on the top rate of tax.  Of course, they are not.  Many of them have incomes which certainly do not put them into that category.  It does not help for the Minister to engage in sophistry, to pretend that they are not being adversely affected by this section. They are being adversely affected at the worst possible time for them.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the impracticality of this, to which Deputy de Valera referred and to which the Minister did not advert at all, the difficulty in many cases of producing accounts in the three-month period to which people are being limited under this Bill.  The Minister talked about the benefits conferred in the form of income tax allowances to taxpayers under this Government.  The fact of the matter is that because of the enormous inflation under this Government, there would have been a revolution in the country if there had not been increased allowances.  But it is also a fact that in real terms taxpayers were better off under the provisions of the 1972 Finance Act, the last one introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government, than they have been at any stage under this Government.  I defy the Minister to contest that.  He need not be claiming any great credit for increasing the allowances when he was forced to do so in order to meet the enormous inflation which <Col N="1075" /> has taken over and, of course, he did not go anywhere near meeting that inflation; he merely gave a sop to the taxpayers.  However, that is largely an irrelevant matter on this section.  The reality of this section is that the taxpayers affected will be required to pay an extra half year's tax, that the Minister proposes to ignore that fact and to make no provision which would give them any relief and enable them to meet that increased liability, as distinct from his approach when he is doing the same thing effectively in the case of the public service and the office holders affected by a later section.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the Minister does not appear to have grasped the implications of what he is doing in this section.  As I said yesterday, the economic and social consequences could be extremely serious.  We have done our best on this side of the House to point out to the Minister what those consequences could well be.  Some suggestions have been made as to how the problem might be approached, but there has been no recognition by the Minister of the fact that there is a problem or, if <Col N="1076" /> there is, that some effort should be made to tackle that problem and give some form of relief in the transitional period.  The Minister has failed either to respond to the suggestions from this side of the House or to come up with any other suggestions of his own, presumably on the basis that he does not acknowledge that there is a problem at all.</P>
    <P>If that is so, I do not think there is anything more we can do on this side of the House to bring it home to him that there is a problem.  However, if he does not recognise it now he will recognise it before he is very much older.  When this comes to operate and the taxpayers concerned find themselves in dire economic difficulties as a result, then the Minister will recognise that there was a problem under section 6 and that we told him that he should do something about it, as we have had to do on many other occasions but he did not recognise the truth and the reality of what we were telling him.  So be it, but let it be clear that the responsibility for what is being done under this section lies on the Deputies on the other side of the House and not on this side.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section corrects a drafting flaw in section 497 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which deals with the repayments of tax.  The section was amended in 1974 following the introduction of the unified system of personal income tax.  Section 497, as it stood prior to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1975, provided that tax repayments in respect of personal allowances or reliefs were to be made, save as otherwise provided, at the standard rate of tax or at the higher rates, as the case might be. The references to these rates were adopted in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1975, to take account of the 10 per cent surcharge.  As the section now stands, it is thought that it might be open to a taxpayer in certain circumstances to claim repayment of an amount greater than the amount of tax paid by him.  Although this has not occurred, the present section, by adding an appropriate proviso, clarifies the position as respects any claim for repayment of tax made on or after 30th March, 1976, which is the date on which the Finance Bill was released for publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum, and the Minister just now, uses the following sentence:</P>
      <P>...it is thought that in certain circumstances a taxpayer might claim repayment of an amount greater than the amount of tax paid by him.</P>
      <P>But the proviso being added in by this section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...the amount of tax to be repaid under this section to any person for any year shall not exceed a sum equal to the difference between the amount of tax paid by him...and the amount of tax which would be payable by him for that year if <Col N="1079" /> his total income had been charged to tax in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>I am slightly confused as to whether the two things mean the same thing or not.  Would the Minister clarify the position?  It seems that the amount of tax paid by him is not the same as the difference between the amount of tax paid by him and another sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Deputy correctly his query relates to the wording of the section which states that repayments shall not exceed a sum equal to the difference between the amount of tax paid by him in respect of his income for that year and the amount of tax which would be payable by him for that year if his total income had been charged to tax in accordance with the provisions of this Act.  The Deputy's question relates to the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum, and the Minister's explanation of the section, suggested that the object was to ensure that a taxpayer could not claim a refund of an amount greater than the amount of tax paid by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The section seems to refer not to the amount of tax paid by him but to the difference between the amount of tax paid by him and another sum.  They do not seem to be the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  The amount of tax could be a combination of that to which he had been directly assessed and deductions made from payments which were due to him.  They might not be at the rate which would be appropriate to the taxpayer in question when his total income had been assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an essential difference between the two documents and one would want to analyse the basis of the section to dispose of the point.  A taxpayer might claim repayment of an amount greater than the amount of tax paid by him according to the explanatory memorandum but <Col N="1080" /> according to this document if he had only paid a certain amount of tax he could not get a bigger refund than the amount paid by him.  In the Bill it is stated:</P>
      <P>the amount of tax to be repaid... shall not exceed a sum equal to the difference between the amount of tax paid by him,...and the amount of tax which would be payable by him for that year if his total income had been charged to tax in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that there would be no repayment unless the difference is in favour of the taxpayer.  The Minister is confining the repayment to the difference between the two as set out in the Bill and if that is the intention it is fair enough.  Section 7 states:</P>
      <P>Provided also that, in relation to repayments of tax made on or after the 30th day of March, 1976,...</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that if there is a cumulative refund or credit it will not be confined to a difference that was not intended.  I do not want to go into details across the floor of the House.  What is intended here is that if a taxpayer has paid more tax than he should have and is entitled to a repayment or credit of that tax he is only entitled to what he has overpaid and nothing else.  That seems reasonable enough and there is no point in labouring the matter. However, I am somewhat nervous about the way dates operate under this legislation.  Will the Minister ensure that it will apply over a period as well as in any particular year?  I am at a loss to know why the Minister has put in a date and perhaps he would tell the House why a date is specified in this section.  If it is merely to ensure that only the net overpayment is paid back or credited the situation seems relatively simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty arises that as we are identifying a flaw here if we did not put in a date people could make claims based on that flaw which was never intended.  What has happened here is that the Revenue Commissioners were cleverer than other people and they got in first to <Col N="1081" /> correct the flaw.  If we were to allow people to use that flaw in respect of claims in the last ten years it could be very costly.</P>
      <P>I can give an explanation which may help to illustrate what we intend doing.  Let us take the case of a single man whose total income for 1974-75 consisted of a taxed dividend of £6,000 from which tax, at the standard rate of 35p, has been deducted. His tax position for 1974-75 would be as follows: income, £6,000; tax deducted at source, £2,100; single allowance, £500 and the taxable income would be £5,500.  That amount would be taxed in the following manner: the first £1,550 at 26p; the next £2,800 at 35p and the next £1,550 at 50p, giving a total liability of £1,958. The credit tax deducted at source would be £2,100 and the repayment due would be £142.  However, the taxpayer might claim that under section 497 the repayment should be computed as follows: repay £500&mdash;personal allowance&mdash;at 50p which would be £250; repay £1,550 at 9p, the difference between 35p and 26p, which would be £139.50, giving a repayment of £389.50 instead of the £142 which would be the sum due. The gain to the taxpayer would be £247.50 and it is to prevent such a situation that we are making the amendment.</P>

      <P>This section amends a drafting flaw in section 525 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section, which was an anti-avoidance provision, originally provided for the grossing-up for sur-tax purposes of sums received in respect of restrictive covenants.  The section was amended in 1974 when the unified system of personal taxation was introduced with the consequential abolition of surtax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1974 amendment provided that any sum received by a person in respect of a restrictive covenant was to <Col N="1082" /> be treated &ldquo;as received by him after deduction of tax&rdquo;.  The amendment clarifies the matter by substituting the phrase &ldquo;as if it were a sum received by him after deduction of tax at the standard rate&rdquo;.  Again, it might help the House if I gave an example.</P>
    <P>A managing director of a company on resigning is given a payment of £6,150 by the company in consideration for an undertaking by him under a restrictive covenant that he will not set up a business in competition with that company.  He has a pension of £3,000 from the company, he is married and has one child.  Under section 525 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, he is deemed to have suffered income tax at 38.5 per cent on the gross amount of £10,000 but this amount is not regarded as part of his taxed income for the purposes of any relief.  His tax liability for 1976-77 will be computed as follows; pension £3,000, &ldquo;grossed-up&rdquo; payment under restrictive covenant, that is £6,150 grossed up at 38.5 per cent, £10,000, total income £13,000, personal allowance £1,250, taxable income £11,750. The income would be charged as follows: the first £1,550 at 26 per cent, the next £2,800 at 38.5 per cent, the next £2,000 at 49.5 per cent, the next £2,000 at 60.5 per cent, the next £2,000 at 71.5 per cent and the balance £1,400 at 77 per cent.  That is tax of £6,189.  Credit for tax deemed to be deducted for gross payment under the covenant would be £3,850 and the total tax payable the difference between £3,850 and £6,189, or £2,339.</P>

      <P>The 10 per cent surcharge on the income tax standard rate is being renewed, we will not debate for what purposes.  We have a continuance here of complication, of legal complexity in our income tax code.  We have a statutory provision extended by amendment.  The Minister referred to the Income Tax Act, presumably of 1967, and subsequent codes. These codes were to be revised and brought into some kind of order.  Since this Minister took office the Finance Bills have become more complex.  This is a superb example of it; it is all amended by legislation.  That means that the only people who can possibly know what it is all about are the experts and those who had a hand in framing the legislation.  This is a <Col N="1084" /> thoroughly unsatisfactory way of presenting legislation.  In a Finance Bill of this nature, with a substantive provision of this nature I believe that the enactment should be re-enacted.  It will cost a little more in paper, printing and time but it will be cleaner.  Reading section 9 one would merely think that two dates were substituted one for the other.  That might be all right if you were dealing with administrative procedures, a schedule or something like that, or a section that lays down a whole lengthy procedure.  When it comes to a substantive provision, as we have here where we are in effect determining the standard rate per year, it is not good enough that it should be buried away and covered up by a section such as this.  The marginal note reads:</P>
      <P>Amendment of section 1 of Finance (No. 2) Act, 1975.  1975, No. 19.</P>
      <P>Then the section reads:</P>
      <P>9. &mdash;Subsection (1), (2) and (3) of section 1 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1975 are hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;1976-77&rdquo; for &ldquo;1975-76&rdquo; in each place where it occurs.</P>
      <P>That is the whole of the section.  If I hand this section to any person other than an accountant or lawyer how would he guess that that section was fixing the standard rate of income tax?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a parliamentary question on 22nd October last, the absence of census data for 1976 will leave a gap in our statistical base.  I am satisfied however that the effect on the development plans of planning authorities will not be as serious as the Deputy's question suggests.  The majority of development plans will be due for review in 1977.  Had a census been conducted in April, 1976, the bulk of the data from it would not have been available to many planning authorities in time for use in this review process.  Moreover, the 1975 Labour Force Survey, the results of which will be available towards the end of this year, will provide estimates of the total population and labour force for different planning regions.</P>
      <P>It also needs to be stressed that, in planning for future development, planning authorities are far from relying exclusively on data normally available from census returns.  Many authorities carry out local surveys themselves or engage consultants to do so.  Alternative sources of information&mdash;for example, house completions and particulars of industrial and commercial development&mdash;are available and these should enable planning authorities, with their detailed local knowledge, to assess trends and to formulate realistic projections on which to base the objectives of development plans coming up for review.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that planning authorities cannot prepare development plans in the absence of figures relating to population, marriage rate, movements and <Col N="1086" /> trend in population in their areas?  Is he further aware that the benefit which would accrue from positive planning would far outweigh the saving of £1 million odd in a period of all-time high unemployment and that the benefits which would accrue to the Government and to the community as a whole could not be counted in terms of the saving achieved from not carrying out the census?</P>

      <P>I do not think anything the Deputy has said alters the fact that it is possible on the information available from the Labour Force Survey and on the basis of figures in regard to housing and so on in each local authority to plan.  As the Deputy is probably aware, there are 87 planning authorities and up to date 83 of them have made plans, some of which are still to be completed and some of which are due for review during the next couple of years; but the statistical data which would become available in an ordinary census would not in any event be available for a census next year.</P>

      <P>Wait now.  I do not know which the Deputy is interested in.  If he is interested in employment, that is a broad issue.  If it is a question of planning, there is no significant deficiency in the data available to make proper planning assessments.  I have not the data here but the last time I answered a question on this subject I indicated that the number of school leavers who would get employment is extremely limited because it is a highly scientific operation in which, with limited exceptions, only persons already experienced can be employed.  That is one of the facts involved in it.  There is no prospect of employing large numbers on it.  The personnel who would be employed on it are persons already in the statistical service.</P>

For the Deputy's information I could say, reasonably I suppose, that the amount we will get in the year 1976 from the fund will continue the same upward increase observable for the past three years. For example, the figure for 1973 was £4.1 million; for 1974 it was £7 million; and for 1975 it was £9.4 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy again to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, into which are built various criteria which must apply before a person can qualify for equal pay.  Knowing that, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to get reliable figures of the number of people who would qualify under that Act.</P>
      <P>Regarding the number of workers whose employment might be in difficulty as a result of the rejection of our Anti-Discrimination Pay (Amendment) Act, 1975 the question is one of the firm's competitive position and so on. This, taken in conjunction with the qualifications that would apply under the Anti-Discrimination Pay Act, 1974 will indicate to the Deputy that his comments on the lack of firm figures being available would not apply.</P>

      <P>Full discussions have taken place between the Departments concerned so it would not be helpful at this stage to go into the details of the submission.  I have indicated to the Deputy already the difficulties that lie in the way of providing in the House figures of the kind required by him.  There is both the nature <Col N="1092" /> of the Act of 1974 and the question of the competitive position of many firms in relation to the obligations of that Act.</P>

Is this another example of the contempt with which he treats the House or is he merely endeavouring to cover up for the situation whereby the necessary information is not available to the Department with the result that we are going to Europe seeking assistance without knowing what is involved?</P>

    <P>While every reasonable effort is made to avoid the occurrence of such fires and to minimise the damage caused by those which enter State plantations, complete protection is not possible.  I am sure that Deputies will agree that the best protection is an informed public which avoids putting valuable plantations at risk.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am glad the Deputy appreciates that forest fires are inevitable because, unfortunately, that is the position.  All reasonable measures are taken to avoid fires, such as drawing the attention of the public by advertising in the Press, radio and television.  In addition, precautions are taken locally, including the provision of fire breaks around and within forests and, where feasible, the provision of water supplies.  Caretakers and fire patrols are employed in particularly vulnerable areas and at periods of high risk.  Liaison exists between local foresters and fire chiefs. In an effort to combat illegal moor burning to improve grazing, a frequent cause of fires.  I have given an undertaking that where landowners comply with the law by notifying the foresters and gardaí of their intention to burn, they will not be prosecuted should damage to State plantations occur.</P>

      <P>The Government are not in a position to support in full the far-reaching proposals which have been advanced by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD.  However, the Government support the call for effective action in the commodities area as a contribution to a more just order of economic relationships between States and favours a case-by-case approach to take account of the particular circumstances relevant to individual commodities.  In the case of individual commodities, the Government are prepared to consider, in addition to other measures, financial arrangements involving contributions from producers and consumers.  After a commodity-by-commodity examination has taken place, a study could usefully be made on the advisability of grouping under a single arrangement the financial provisions of any product agreements concluded.</P>

But, in certain cases, they might come under the heading I mentioned&mdash;&ldquo;Other applications in respect of which really exceptional and urgent need can be shown&rdquo;.

When the circumstances were brought to my notice, as a result of the Deputy's question, I wrote to the addressee of the telegram to express my personal regrets for what happened on that occasion.  But, in fairness to my Department and to the postal services, I should like to say that this is fortunately a very rare event and all those concerned are well aware that it should not occur again.  I am not extenuating what happened in this case but I would not like the House or the public generally to make an adverse generalisation about the services in question arising out of that case.

    <P>Five of the licences were issued subject to special conditions.  Special conditions are applied in cases where the operation of wireless telegraphy apparatus under experimenters' licences are considered to warrant precautions which do not need to be applied generally&mdash;for example, where the apparatus will or may be used by persons who are not licensed experimenters or otherwise to ensure as far as practicable that the apparatus will not be used irregularly.  However, the fact that special conditions are applied <Col N="1108" /> in a particular case does not necessarily of course reflect in any way on the person or group to whom the licence is issued.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Industrial Development Authority that 24 of this company's 70 employees are at present working a three-day week and that some more workers are expected to be put on short-time working in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the main reason for this short-time working is a downturn in the market for the company's exports in addition to a temporary fall off in demand which normally takes place at this time of year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, not all the workers are on a three-day week.  Twenty-four out of a total work force of 70 are the only people that are on a three-day week.  There are particular problems at this time of the year which I gather the company do not anticipate will continue for the whole year.  As <Col N="1114" /> the Deputy is aware, this company are engaged in producing bags which are used in the distribution of vegetables and because it is anticipated that more fresh vegetables will be sold loose, the demand is not as high at this time of the year for this type of bag.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order, 1976, Irish manufacturers of drugs and medicines are subject to the same price controls as manufacturers of other products.  However, by far the greater proportion of drugs and medicines sold in this country is imported and no control can be exercised on the manufacturers' prices for products manufactured outside the State.</P>
      <P>Importers and wholesalers of drugs and medicines are exempt from the scope of the order but changes in prices and cash margins are monitored by the National Prices Commission. Retailers' margins are subject to the Prices (Stabilisation of Profit Margins of Retailers) Order, 1973.  The Deputy will be aware that proposals for a new approach to control retail margins have been made by the National Prices Commission and I have already announced that I propose to introduce the necessary enabling legislation.</P>
      <P>I have also asked the commission to have a study carried out in relation to the prices being charged for these products and preparations for such a study are in train.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that it is <Col N="1116" /> desirable that proper price control be applied to drugs and medicines generally in view of the fact that the prices charged in this country are significantly higher than the prices for exactly the same products in Britain and Northern Ireland and on the Continent of Europe?

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely because of complaints made along the lines of the Deputy's supplementary question that I have asked the National Prices Commission to carry out a study.  One of the matters, perhaps the major one, they will be looking at will be the possibility, a strong one, that these products are being imported here at higher prices, ultimately paid by the Irish consumer, than they are being sold on the British and other markets. However, this is not something which our information suggests is occurring within Ireland.  The evidence we have in the NPC study of January, 1975, indicates that the profit margins of chemists, while variable, on average are not unreasonable.  The problem seems to be outside the State, but I agree something should be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay either the House or the Minister on this section.  Of course, the Minister has a point when he says this is mentioned in the budget.  However, he will appreciate that my protest on the form of the section is meant to be part of a recurring one on my part against legislation by reference where there is something substantive, even if it is only a continuation. In this case the Minister has a good point in saying that he did mention in the budget what the facts would be but, unfortunately, the Acts are the law and it is highly desirable that the content of a section wherever possible should be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 stands out in sharp contrast with section 10 where, of course, it is necessary to set out the table, but if section 9 were so worded that the rate would appear on the face of it, then section 10 has all the greater meaning.  Persons who have to advert to legislation of this nature, after all, even if the Minister did say it on the budget, do not all remember everything that the Minister is saying and <Col N="1120" /> whether it is management in business, trade union or other organisations which have an interest in the matter, or whether it is even these people who have to transmit the information either to specific groups or to the public at large, for the sake of all these people it would be highly desirable that legislation involving something substantive like this should show on the face of it what it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister that in the case of the age allowance there is a very good reason why it should be increased, having regard to the position of pensioners from the public service as an example&mdash;there are many other people affected.  They thought they had achieved parity, but in recent years because of the nature of the agreements made for increases in pay some of which have occurred on a number of occasions during a year, the pensioners are further away from parity than they were before.  The combination of this factor and the effect of the later section which would bring them into the PAYE system is going to be quite substantial for a number of them. The best way to deal with it without the Minister being committed to an across-the-board benefit would be by increasing the age allowance.  I, therefore, urge the Minister before this measure is enacted to give further thought to increasing the age allowance for that reason.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I reiterate what I had to say on an earlier section, that, despite the fact that there have been fairly frequent adjustments of the income tax allowances in the last few years, nevertheless taxpayers are in real terms worse off and have been worse off at all times under this Government than they were under the 1972 Finance Act. This, of course, is because the adjustments that have been made have not nearly kept pace with inflation.  In the light of information published today in a report of the OECD that we are at the head of the international league of all developed countries for inflation so far this year, 1976, with Turkey ranking only behind us and Portugal behind that, the increases proposed in these allowances can only be described as ludicrous and a gesture but making very little real difference to taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the difficulties and the enormous cost involved in making adjustments of this kind.  I do not wish to develop the theme as to why so much larger increases are necessary and the causes of the enormous inflation to which we are subjected, so much higher than any other country facing the same problems of international recession and <Col N="1122" /> energy crisis as we are.  I do not wish to go into that in detail, but in the light of the fact, undisputed, that we are at the head of the international inflation league, I suggest that these proposed increases in allowances are ludicrous.  We have now reached a stage where the level of taxation and in particular the level of personal taxation is acting as a very serious disincentive to work.  This is true not only at the top of the scale where we have the highest rate of taxation in Europe but it is also true in the middle of the scale and the bottom of the scale.  All of us have had an unpalatable amount of experience of people refusing to take on overtime because they feel it simply is not worthwhile.  I know this was true in the past but it has now become widespread wherever overtime is available and is optional.  This is a very serious situation for our whole economy.  I do not suggest that there is an easy solution to the problem, given the present state of our Exchequer, the present state of revenue and the present state of expenditure.  I will not go into the reasons that have led to that level of expenditure and level of income for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We are now in a vicious circle whereby our economy instead of growing is contracting or at the very best is giving zero growth and the demands are increasing all the time.  In response to these demands the Government are imposing more and more taxation and as a direct consequence of that the growth which we should be getting is not forthcoming, so we have a situation of a contracting pool of resources with an increasing level of demand on it.  This situation will get worse and worse at an accelerating rate as long as we continue on the road on which we are going.  It is pretty clear by now that this Minister and this Government have no intention, or even if they have the intention, have not got the know-how to bring about a reversal of the situation. It is unfortunate for everybody that that should be so.  Allowing for the various steps that have to be taken to get our economy moving, as far as this party are concerned, we have no doubt that the level of taxation is <Col N="1123" /> too high and is bringing about a serious disincentive.  Consequently when we return to office we will certainly be lowering the level of taxation, including personal taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Changes have been made in the British tax system in respect of the proposed pay deal in Britain.  Even after those changes the personal tax rates in this country up to salary scale of £5,000 are less than in Britain.  It might be worthwhile for people to think on that, because there is a natural tendency always to look for more and more.  It is interesting that our tax rates for the overwhelming majority of people are less than what applies just across the water.  Tax concessions this year work out at about £18 million on an annual basis, and that at a time of very severe budgetary constraints.  I can understand Deputy Colley making promises as to what he will do when Fianna Fáil get back to power.  It is so far away that it is not difficult to make promises.  For any person with any expectation of being in office in this country for the next ten years, making promises as glibly as Deputy Colley, only represents a certain amount of irresponsibility, or if not that, a total ignorance of the financial circumstances of this country.  I know Deputy Colley is not ignorant as to the financial circumstances of this country because he so frequently makes reference to them, but he simly cannot perform the miracle of slashing taxes and at the same time eliminate deficits and produce all the other goodies that some Fianna Fáil spokesmen from time to time suggest can be produced, without increasing Government expenditure.  If you increase expenditure you cannot cut taxes.  We have, at a time of unprecedented budgetary difficulties in Ireland, maintained reductions in income tax levels and I think we are entitled to say that it is not an inconsiderable achievement.</P>

      <P>What the Minister has just said is an example of how the Minister uses words from time to time. Deputy Colley in referring to the high level of tax said that when this party are elected to Government there will be a reduction in these taxes.  The Minister in attacking Deputy Colley on that referred to the slashing of taxes.  That discussion merely illustrates in part at least the difference between the attitude on this side of the House and the attitude on the Minister's side.  When we talk about the high level of taxation we are talking not alone of the interests of the taxpayer, which is, if you like, a voting interest, we are talking about the fact that the high level of taxation acts as a disincentive to the creation of wealth. We have spent time on that before but it is a fundamental difference between the approach of this side of the House and the Minister's approach.  It lay behind a good deal of argument that went on this monring and yesterday. The Minister suggested that Deputy de Valera was simply talking about professionals and nothing else, whereas Deputy de Valera was talking about the effect of the tax system on the individual trader as against the company who have a slight advantage over the individual.  This does not relate directly to section 10.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has illustrated something which is important at present. It has become obvious over the last two years that the greatest burden that can be placed on any small economy is the burden of increasing inflation.  If anything has made the name of the tax collector, Seán P. Belford appear in the <i>Gazette</i> more often in recent times it is probably the effect of inflation on the small <i>entre-preneur</i> in relation to the liquidity demand on the increasing costs of the stocks that are necessary to maintain any sort of industry or business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley has highlighted the difference in this table.  For a married woman it works out at a little under 10 per cent, for a single person at about 8 per cent, for a widowed person at about 8 per cent and for an additional child at under 5 per cent. If that were being done in a time of <Col N="1125" /> normal inflation it would be a considerable advance and I for one would be congratulating the Minister but it happens at a time when inflation during the period referred to is well over double the additional amounts allowed.  In a sense it is a reflection on the Government that each person in this category has lost way to the tune of more than 10 per cent over the 12-month period and the Minister has, in effect, made up pretty nearly half of that loss and that is as far as he has gone.  What the Minister is not coping with, and the table illustrates this, is the effect that inflation is having on the ordinary person and on the expansion of trade which is so badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister's increase of allowances here is only a partial compensation, as Deputy Brugha has said.  This means that everything Deputy Brugha has said is correct, that we are continuing, and the policy of this Bill continues, to increase the burden of taxation.  The Minister talked about Deputy Colley's irresponsible approach in connection with earlier remarks.  I wonder did the Minister see a repeat of a very interesting &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme last night and I wonder did he register the fact corroborated there that the fundamental defect of this Government or of any Government who behave as they do is that they are not taking positive action and are simply trying to find money?  As Deputy Brugha has just said, there is a complete disincentive.  Money is available in the banks for people to take and it is not being taken.  I do not think it would be right for me to proceed further in general terms here but this section will do very little to improve the situation.  It is&mdash;and one is glad to see it there&mdash;some amelioration for personal taxpayers but when one goes back to the root of the problem the difficulties remain very much the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are significant omissions here as Deputy Colley has pointed out. However, I suppose this is better than nothing.  The individual taxpayer, when it comes to his own tax computation, will wonder just what the <Col N="1126" /> benefit is.  The individual taxpayer, through inflation and because the Government have been unable to control the economy and things have run riot, finds himself going into higher income brackets and being all the worse off all the time.  He goes into higher income levels and attracts higher tax.  If a number of these people make a comparison between their position a couple of years ago&mdash; irrespective of the schedule or the provisions under which they are paying tax&mdash;and the reliefs granted, will they find themselves very much better off? Granted, there will be an area of maximum benefit from these reliefs, which will come in in respect of people who heretofore were virtually exempt from tax but the large number of people in the community who because of inflation and the devaluation of our currency that that is equivalent to are now in tax brackets and are moving into tax brackets in such a way that it will be a matter for each taxpayer to assess how much better off he is.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the furnishing of a separate return of income by a married woman in respect of her own income.  The provision has been made in response to a request by married women who wish to make returns of their own income rather than be required to have that income included in their husbands' returns, particularly in cases where the husband has no income.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is also being taken of correcting a drafting flaw in the relevant section.  There is a reference to &ldquo;period&rdquo; in two places in the section which in one place means the period within which the return is to be made and in the other means the period for which the profits or gains are to be returned.  Subsection (5) of the section clarifies this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 100,000 working wives in receipt of the working wife's allowance.  An estimated 20,000 other wives are in receipt of investment income which in the <Col N="1127" /> majority of cases is relatively small. Therefore, an estimated 120,000 wives have an independent source of income. Separate assessment is at present claimed in about 1,500 of these cases.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he would clarify the position arising in this regard?

      <P>There is, in fact, no connection at all.  Section 169 deals with completion of returns and section 192 lays down the general rules as to tax on husbands and wives.  We now have the ridiculous position in which a husband with no income is nevertheless required to make a return on his wife's income and that, technically speaking, cannot be avoided, even if the wife makes a return.  We are providing here that where the wife makes a return that will satisfy the requirement in relation to getting particulars of the income of husbands and wives which, of course, are connected.</P>

      <P>There is the possibility that I have missed some amendment in a later Act but as I read the law, separate assessment is empowered by section 197 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  In that section there is provision for separate assessment.  However, section 169 of that Act, the section to which this amendment refers, deals with the making of returns.  I do not know if this is an amendment in so far as it appears to be a continuing provision.  If I am right so far, apart from effecting what the Minister calls a drafting amendment, I am not clear whether the section affects the substantive provision.  Under section 197 of the 1967 Act a wife could have a separate assessment so long as due notice was given.</P>

      <P>I am not sure as to how the allowances are calculated but does separate assessment render the married woman a single woman for tax purposes?  If there is a linkage arising from the conjugal state, it would seem to be difficult for tax purposes for either party to be totally disentangled.  Is there anything in this section that affects that situation?  It would be simple if section 197 provided for a married woman having two choices: either she can be linked with her husband who will be assessable for all income and will receive all the allowances or she is assessed separately in which case it would appear that the simplicity disappears unless she is to be treated as a married woman in which case her income is assessed separately but without allowances in respect of the marriage being available. I understand that is not the case.  The Minister would be within his rights in telling me to do my homework but the problem is in getting the material to allow one to complete one's homework on this complicated legislation.  Consequently, I must put myself at the mercy of the Minister and ask him if he is effecting any change here other than that to which he has referred and, in particular, if there is any change in regard to the allowances available or in regard to the notional aggregation of <Col N="1129" /> income that must take place for the purposes of these allowances.</P>
      <P>Anyone with an individual problem would have to seek individual advice, whether from the relevant inspector or someone else but it would be helpful for the House to know whether any change is being effected by the section. Paradoxically, this section refers to a section in the 1967 Act which on cursory examination does not appear to mention a married woman at all or to refer to the married state.  This is because it deals with returns, whereas on the other hand the whole substance of the section deals with the case for a married woman as provided for in section 197 of the other Act but which is not mentioned here.  Therefore, I do not think I am being unreasonable or unduly stupid in displaying confusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>We are dealing here only with returns by married women. Allowances and so on remain aggregated and these can be apportioned if the parties are assessed separately. Under existing law, the husband has an obligation to make a return of the wife's income even if he has no income of his own because her income is deemed to be part of his income.  What will happen in future is that a husband will notify the inspector that his wife has an income and the inspector will then require the wife to complete a return.  The commissioners will accept the declarations from both parties and will make the necessary assessments but if the wife fails to make a return the inspector will be able to require the husband to make the return.  As Deputy de Valera anticipates, we must ensure that the information is collected, that there is no weakening of the system of collection but at the same time we can accede to the representations that have been made regarding the enabling of a wife to make a return of her own without having to submit all the details to her husband.</P>

      <P>We all appreciate the situation in which there are working wives.  Supposing the wife does not tell her husband, what will happen? That seems to me to be putting the husband in an impossible position.  I <Col N="1130" /> begin to think we would want Men's Lib. as well as Women's Lib.  Supposing she does not, and it is confidential, then the husband and the wife, or one of them, will be assessed in a mysterious manner and they can never understand or appeal against it. In some other measure in regard to appeals it is provided that the grounds must be stated.  If a husband gets an assessment which is in part based on information to which he has not got access, how can he give his grounds for appealing?  We are getting more and more in the mire in our taxation system and the more we kick and struggle the deeper we get caught.</P>

      <P>Now there is a change in the law, the Revenue Commissioners can pursue the wife for her failure to discharge the duty imposed on her, and a penalty can be applied to the wife.  The law gives the wife the right to make a return and if she fails to make it the Revenue Commissioners may apply the penalty provisions. A wife can hardly expect to be given a right unless in relation to her failure to discharge it a penalty attaches.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, after line 54, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) A person shall not be entitled to a deduction under this section in respect of an assessment unless he makes a claim before&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the date on which the assessment becomes final and conclusive, or</P>
      <P>(b) the expiry of the period of six months beginning with the date of the passing of this Act, whichever is the later.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide a time limit for claims under this section.  It provides that in a new subsection (4) a person shall not be entitled to a deduction in respect of an assessment unless he makes a claim before the date on which the assessment becomes final and conclusive, or the expiry of the period of six months beginning with the date of the passing of the Act.  Amendment No. 5 is a drafting amendment consequential on the new subsection (4), deleting the existing subsections (2) and (3) and substituting subsections (2), (3) and (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask whether the period of six months after the passing of the Act is sufficiently long.  One aspect is whether a corresponding period given in the previous Act was sufficiently long or whether there is any evidence that people were unaware of the time limit and lost out as a result.  Second, this amendment <Col N="1132" /> applies to a section which is giving certain reliefs to individuals as distinct from companies as heretofore. It is clear enough that in the case of individuals there is a greater danger that some people might be entitled to this relief but might be unaware of the time limit than is the case in regard to companies where in general one can expect that claims of this kind would be handled by accountants and there is therefore less likelihood of the same percentage of cases being unaware of the limit.  Of course the involvement of accountants does not guarantee the claim would be made in time, but they are more likely to be aware of the time limit than individual taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I am asking whether the six-months period provided in paragraph (d) in the amendment is sufficiently long to give a reasonable opportunity for the taxpayer concerned to benefit from reliefs given in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy would not chastise me for finality in relation to tax matters, particularly where claims arise.  The six-months period has been adequate to date.  No cases have come to notice where persons entitled to the relief have made late claims.  All that is necessary is to make the claim within the time set. Considering that this is a claim being made by persons who are in business, it is not an unduly onerous obligation to put on people to avail themselves of a right to give notice within six months of the passage of the Act.  No problems have yet been identified of the nature referred to by Deputy Colley.  If they do, we can certainly consider whether or not the period should be extended. But, as it has worked well and the relief has been enjoyed by the people for whom it was intended, I would not see any need to extend the time at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One can understand what the Minister is doing here. If I understand it correctly, what he is doing is giving six months after the passage of the Act as a period within which to submit the return and the date on which an assessment becomes final and conclusive.  That simply means he is giving six months' grace <Col N="1133" /> to catch up and thereafter it will depend on the assessment, so that there would be finality.</P>
      <P>What puzzles me about this section and section 26 is: what has motivated the Minister in the way this has been presented?  As it is extremely difficult to separate the two sections perhaps I might refer briefly to section 26 in relation to this section.  Under the Finance Act, 1975 the Minister gave a very important relief to trading companies, companies having trading stocks, in an inflationary situation.  If I and my colleagues have been severe on the Minister, as we believe we should be in regard to the burden of taxation and the impact of inflation, here we must be equally objective and allow him credit for having given that substantial relief under section 31 of the 1975 Finance Act.  It may well be that, in the circumstances in which that relief was given, there was a certain amount of understandable precipitateness, in the sense that the relief was first notified, made definite and, for a while, made absolute in circumstances of mounting inflation.  I am sure that amounted to circumstances of pressure of urgency on the Minister and his advisers.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, we are faced with the extension of that benefit, on the one hand, under section 12, to which this amendment relates, and in a later section in the extraordinary amendment to which we shall come&mdash;extra-ordinary in that it appears to be almost a Bill in itself.  In so amending section 31 of the Act of last year it imports everything of substance that is relevant into section 12 of this Bill.  I do not know if my view of the law is correct here but I think probably it is.  Part of the explanation may be that section 31 was defective and open to abuse.  If so, the Minister will have no difficulty in getting the support of this side of the House in the prevention of abuse.  What is more, we will be very easy on him because the reliefs were of substantial benefit.  As I said on Second Stage, even if there were abuses, the benefits conferred, from a social and economic point of view, outweighed any damage done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What disturbs me is that, having <Col N="1134" /> brought in a Finance Bill to correct that, we now have amendments of this magnitude.  Some explanation should be forthcoming from the Minister. I did mention that a possible contributory cause was urgency; that there was not sufficient time to tie up all the details.  If that is advanced as a reason, it is an acceptable one in the circumstances.  On top of that, the passage of the Corporation Profits Tax Bill may have been a contributory factor.  If the Minister tells me that this Bill had been prepared already, that it could not be delayed and that the uncertainty about the passage of the Corporation Profits Tax Bill was the reason for it, that also I can understand.  Nevertheless, it seems difficult to believe there would not be a policy direction of a &ldquo;take a chance&rdquo; to the parties concerned, as it was quite obvious that the Minister had, and would have&mdash;putting through the Corporation Profits Tax Bill&mdash;the command of so many pairs of boots.</P>

      <P>I do not want to put in the boot so let us keep to the section.  I can understand that those may have been the reasons.  I am asking the Minister, in a sense, are they the whole reasons?  When we come to section 26 I will have more specific questions that are relevant. Lest it would appear that I am becoming totally irrelevant I presume it <Col N="1135" /> is in order if I do not delay the House afterwards on section 12 itself to talk on the section in connection with the amendment.  A very large part of the amendment of section 26&mdash;in other words, section 31 as it will be amended &mdash;is imported into this.  I will take two bites of the cherry if the Chair wishes. I want to keep within the rules of order so far as this is concerned, but it is very difficult to extricate the two. What this amendment really is saying is that a claim under section 31 of the 1975 Finance Act&mdash;when amended by this Bill&mdash;will be subject to the limitations imposed by this amendment. This amendment places a limitation in time on the operation of section 31 of the 1975 Finance Act, as it will be amended by this Bill.  I am quite prepared to speak about the section as a whole.  If this is a limitation on the operation of section 31, it means that stocktaking, furnishing of accounts, all of these things, have to be completed within the period concerned and the claim must be made before an assessment becomes final and conclusive.</P>
      <P>On section 7 I raised the question of the date that appeared in that section. The Minister very properly told me, and I understood immediately he explained it, that if he did not put in that date, there could be retrospection.  I take it something similar is being applied here.  If assessments have been finalised, six months' grace is given.  If that were not given, where companies would have the benefits in the calendar year 1975, traders would be excluded. The matter can be opened six months after the Act.  I suppose that is not unreasonable.</P>

      <P>It is important to recognise that section 12 deals with unincorporated bodies and section 31 and section 26 deal with incorporated bodies.  They have been separately treated and that is the reason for the two separate sections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>In this chapter we are dealing with personal income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> In the chapter containing section 26 we are dealing with the income tax position and all the taxes associated with corporate bodies.  That is why they must be treated separately.  All we are doing here is providing a period for making the claim similar to that contained in section 31 and now section 26 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out the element of urgency which probably left the original draft of section 31 of last year's Act imperfect. I mentioned the impact of the corporation profits tax legislation and, I gather, from the Minister's remarks that I am right in my assumptions.</P>
      <P>Now we must consider an amended section 31.  Although the Minister made the point that this deals with persons, while sections 26 and 31 deal with corporations, the fact is that under the wording of the section these provisions are imported, where relevant and applicable, into this section. Subsection 12 (2) (a) says:</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 31 of the Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1975, other than the excepted provisions, shall with any necessary modifications apply in the case of a person as they apply in the case of a company.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the substance of what is in this Bill relating to the amendment of section 31 of the Finance Act also relates to this section and, in particular, will include provisions for claw-back.</P>
      <P>The section, as amended, now has subsection (4). Subsection (1) defines an &ldquo;accounting period&rdquo; and has a proviso that where accounts have not been made up, the Revenue Commissioners may determine; and it defines a &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  I have already read the operative part, subsection (2) (a). Subsection (2) (b) defines &ldquo;the excepted provisions&rdquo;.  Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> Any deduction allowed by virtue of this section in computing a person's trading profits for an accounting period shall not have effect for any purpose of the Income Tax Acts for any year of assessment prior to the year 1974-75 or later than the year 1976-77.</P>
    <P>In other words, it confines the relief to companies.  What the section does not say, and what I think is included in it, is that the private person, no less than the company, is subject to the claw-back, in section 26 (1) (8) of this Bill, which amends section 31 of the Finance Act, 1975.  Am I right in taking it that the claw-back applies equally in this section by virtue of the importation of section 31 into the section? I must be.  Surely the Minister does intend to give private persons, who are not incorporated, permanent relief&mdash;as companies thought they had until the Minister brought in this Bill &mdash;and, at the same time provide for an effective claw-back in respect of companies which are incorporated?  I would like the Minister to clarify this point.  Am I right in my reading of the section that, by the importation under subsection (2) (a) of the provision of section 31, as amended by section 26, in the case of the private person as well as in the case of the company, the claw-back will operate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the affirmative in so far as importing subsection (8) into section 12 is concerned.  Of course, the question of the claw-back does not apply to the first two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but it would for the year 1975.  An extraordinary problem arises here for any company whose accounts ended with the calendar year and who had published their accounts prior to the publication of this Bill.  Remember, the Minister did not give warning of this in his budget speech.  All he said in his budget speech, as I think I pointed out on Second Stage, was that he would continue the relief but he gave no indication whatever that the claw-back would be there, whereas the indication was altogether the other way a year ago and, in fact, the terms of section <Col N="1138" /> 31 as they stood law at the budget date and stand law at the moment do not so provide.</P>
      <P>The result of that was that any company which had audited accounts ending 31st December, 1975, and had completed their accounts before the Minister had brought in this Bill would have taken the difference between their opening and their closing stock, valued presumably on the same basis; they would have taken 20 per cent of the notional profit, that is, the profit, to put it colloquially, that the Revenue Commissioners would recognise by the adding back of various things to what the company would claim was their profit.  Twenty per cent of that would be subtracted from the stock difference and this was the stock relief that was taken into the tax computation.  Therefore, a company which had completed their operation before the Minister's Bill was circulated would have taken in the stock in that way.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, in respect of a company that has to account since the publication of the Bill and a <i>fortiori</i>&mdash; because I raised this matter on Second Stage&mdash;after the Minister had warned that companies would be well advised to take into account that this would not be a permanent feature&mdash;and I am not suggesting he ever said it would be a permanent feature&mdash;the question arises as to whether this is a deferred taxation from an accounting point of view and it has quite an influence on the tax computation for a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that under the section the Minister wants to extend the benefit of the stock relief such as it is at the moment to non-incorporated companies, to what I might call personal traders and he wants to go further and be perfectly fair and give the same benefit as the others had over the years concerned.  In other words, the Minister is aiming to put these people on the same basis as if they were incorporated. We are dealing here with a question of trade and not in technicalities as to whether one is an incorporated company or not.  That is a very reasonable and proper approach, but it does not import this element into the section.  That is why I am adverting so much to the content of the section, <Col N="1139" /> because it is important for these people to realise that the claw-back that applies to certain companies will apply in precisely the same way to other companies.  The 1974 relief will be absent.  The 1975 relief will be given. But there is a big question now for anyone making up accounts for 1975 as to the precise way of accounting for this claw-back, and it has to be taken into account that in 1976 there will be the adjustment of stock in accordance with the paragraph 8 I mentioned.  It is important to realise that this attaches to the benefits given under this section 12 as well as to the amendment of section 31.  I think the section does nothing more than that, as I am sure the Minister will confirm, and that the Minister's intention is simply to put these people on an equal footing with the incorporated bodies.</P>
    <P>The rest of the discussion will have to wait for section 26 of the Bill, and particularly as amended here, when I will have further questions to ask the Minister.  It might be helpful if the Minister could shorten the discussion by making some further remarks, because we have a lot of work to get through on section 26 and there are other matters arising from this amendment. It is very difficult to deal with this completely in isolation.  There are suggestions that there is more to this very voluminous amendment than the Corporation Tax Bill, and I would like to know if the Minister is forced in any way in this legislation by abuse, because whatever provisions he puts into section 26 to block abuse or unfair use of the provision will automatically be imported into section 12. Although the Minister need not necessarily accept my indication here, if he cleared the air as to what the general position was now, we might get ahead with the business on section 26 and the amendment which I find somewhat intimidating in prospect.</P>

      <P>A question arises on this section which I think has been put to the Minister in representations, but I am not aware of the answer, and it is seeking clarification as to whether it is the intention of this section to ensure that the beneficiary will be treated as receiving a gross distribution of all of the income received before the payment of the surcharge, or if he will be treated as receiving a gross sum equivalent to the net distribution grossed up at standard rate.  I think the Minister has received representations on this and an example which would illustrate it, but if it is not immediately available to him I can develop it.  The net question is whether the surcharge is to be available as a credit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide against the avoidance or deferment of liability to income tax at the higher rates by the creation of trusts, the income of which is to be accumulated pending the happening of some event or the exercise by the trustees of a discretion to distribute some or all of it.  The section imposes a surcharge of 20 per cent of the income of such trusts unless the income is distributed within the year of assessment in which it arises, or within 18 months from the end of that year, in such a way as to become the income of a beneficiary and so be liable to the higher rates of <Col N="1141" /> tax, if these are applicable, to the beneficiary.  If the beneficiary is not liable to tax at a greater rate than the standard rate no additional liability would be incurred.  If he is not liable to tax or is liable at the lower rate he will be entitled to repayment.</P>
      <P>The provision is especially necessary because of the imposition by sections 101 and 162 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, of a surcharge on certain incomes of close companies and service companies.  The surcharge could readily be avoided by such companies by the device of channelling distributable income into trusts, the income of which would, in the absence of a complementary surcharge thereon in the hands of a trustees enjoy the tax advantage which the surcharge on the undistributed company income was designed to obviate.</P>
      <P>In its commonest form, a discretionary trust is one set up by a wealthy individual to which he transfers substantial funds for the benefit of his children or grandchildren.  In the deed it is provided that the trustees, at their absolute discretion, may apply the income of the trust fund for the benefit of any one or more of the specified class of beneficiaries, to the exclusion of the others, as the trustees may determine. At some time in the future the capital on accumulated income would be vested in one or more beneficiaries. In the meantime the income arising year by year to trustees will have been liable only at the standard rate of income tax, even though the income might have been sufficiently large to attract liability at the higher rates if the beneficiaries were chargeable to tax on the incomes at it arose.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has referred to a submission made to me, and the example which was given in the submission was as follows: from an income trust of £100, income tax £35, surcharge £20, that would be £55, leaving £45 available for distribution. I was asked whether in the example given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 13 (3) makes the position clear.  It provides that no relief in payment in respect of a surcharge will be allowed to the beneficiary.

      <P>Is this not a case where the Minister is going further and further and this is legislation that is starting off?  Initially he wanted to stop accumulations by discretionary trusts so as to defer taxation.  He then finds there is a major loophole which was not closed in his Capital or other Acts because it did not provide for the possibility of using a public company. He captures that in the Corporation Tax Act and he creates the new entity of a close company.  Now, in order to see that the legislation in regard to a close company is effective he comes round in the circle again and he has to surcharge a trust, which would bypass the close company.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister where it is going to end and what is the next one after that? In one section in the end the Revenue Commissioners have to be given a certain discretion.  Even in the last section we use &ldquo;as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  We have to give the Revenue Commissioners discretion.  I cannot understand the method by which we do it.  At one stage we treat them like children who may get burned or escape into a dangerous compound, and on the other side we let them completely loose.  Here we are empowering the Revenue Commissioners, as one would empower a penalty.  To impose a surcharge up to a certain amount would be more satisfactory than what is in this section. This is a very clear example for consideration. There are revenue penalties like criminal penalties and in these cases there is power and these powers are exercised with judicial reasonableness by the Revenue Commissioners. When I use the words &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners&rdquo; I embrace all their officers, I do not want to put all the responsibility on the individual commission or commissioner.</P>
      <P>There is a function being exercised with due discrimination, quasijudicially and as fairly as any judicial process can do it.  What are we dealing with here?  Really with what amounts to a revenue crime.  Any accumulation of trust money to avoid payment of tax and devices of this nature, whatever about their technical legality, have certainly got an element of <i>mens rea</i> that makes crime.  I cannot for the life of me see why we cannot give a certain discretion to the authority as a court has to have a discretion. One tries to avoid the criminal law specifying a particular penalty and it is done only in certain difficult cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> The usual prescription is a sentence not exceeding so-and-so or liable to a sentence of, which the court can give, or a lesser one.</P>
    <P>We are really dealing with what could be called a revenue crime.  In such a case why not give the commissioners the general authority in relation to penalties of that kind, which they already have in certain respects, when it comes down to brass tacks.  I have yet to find a substantial case where anyone could show that there was any abuse of that process. Why should we not take our courage in our hands and give them authority to treat this kind of revenue crime and a discretion to impose the surcharge as a penalty?  On this side of the House we have strenuously argued against the 18 per cent rate of interest for instance, which is imposed automatically as a penalty&mdash; that is being imposed, right or wrong, mistake or no mistake.  In this type of case there is only one way of catching the culprit and that is to give the Revenue Commissioners power to impose a penalty of up to 20 per cent. It also gives them the ability to use their own judgment, which leaves them in a much stronger administrative position because the person dealing with them knows that if they behave fairly and squarely they will be treated accordingly even if they have made a mistake, but if not they must take the full penalty.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if it is tied to a technicality like this a person knows that he either gets out of it on a technicality or he gets the whole wallop anyway.  If he wants to get out of it, all his ingenuity must be devoted to some practical way of doing this and he knows that if he is caught the 20 per cent will be imposed.  The very natural deterrent that is there, that honesty is the best policy, is blotted out by the Minister's approach.  If he takes the approach which I am advocating, he will be surprised how many people will reflect and decide that honesty is the best policy.  If a person is trying to get away with something and is not prepared to be 100 per cent honest, he knows that it is a matter <Col N="1145" /> of irrelevancy whether honesty is the policy or not the deterrent is gone.  I strongly urge the Minister to look at this surcharge business and adopt a reasonable approach.  It would simplify our law and simplify the task of the Revenue Commissioners and their officers who have to bear the burden of implementing all this legislation.</P>

      <P>Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1968, accords a certain priority in cases of bankruptcy, and so <Col N="1146" /> on, to tax due on foot of PAYE estimates.  The priority relates to the employer's liability for a period of 12 months before the date of the order of adjudication, or of the filing of the arrangement petition, or of the death insolvent of the employer. The present section, which rewrites section 11, extends this priority to income tax deductible from payments made to sub-contractors.

      <P>&ldquo;(8)  Where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the application of the provisions of this section would give rise to hardship, they may grant such relief as in their opinion is just.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me that while this section spells out in considerable detail the steps to be taken in order to effect this transition from payment of tax on the previous year basis to the PAYE system and endeavours to cover all of the problems anticipated, nevertheless some problems could arise which have not been anticipated and that unless a provision on lines such as suggested in the amendment is included we could have a situation in which hardship will arise which was not envisaged and was not intended to arise and that by providing as is suggested in the amendment that the Revenue Commissioners would, in effect, have discretion to deal with cases of hardship we can obviate any danger of that kind without opening the door to all sorts of abuses.  I would hope that the Minister would accept the thinking behind the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective is a worthy one but I believe the amendment <Col N="1149" /> would give rise to not a little difficulty.  It would, for instance, impose upon the Revenue Commissioners the obligation of deciding where and when hardship was involved, what was hardship, which is a judgment which would vary a great deal from individual to individual and it might involve them in making decisions on the financial circumstances not only of themselves and their staffs but also of Members of the Oireachtas, the Judiciary, a whole multitude of people in public office.</P>
      <P>We had a great deal of heart-searching and detailed discussion about the transition from the old system to PAYE and the measures we have taken cover all foreseeable cases of difficulty.  I think it is better to await the operation of the system to see if any unexpected cases come to light involving hardship and if they do, of course, remedial action can easily be taken.  I would consider it wholly undesirable that the sweeping measures suggested should be introduced.  The danger is that where it is introduced in this particular case it could be taken as a precedent for conferring on the Revenue Commissioners powers which I believe they would find intolerable because of the obligation it would impose on them to make judgments of this kind.  Let us see how the thing works out and we can correct any difficulties if and when they emerge.</P>

      <P>I do appreciate the difficulty the Minister anticipates might arise here but I do not think that it is right that the fact that the discretion sought to be given to the Revenue Commissioners in this amendment would have to be exercised in <Col N="1150" /> the case of office holders, members of the Judiciary, or even in the case of the Revenue Commissioners themselves should be a problem.  After all, they do have to exercise at the moment discretion in respect of virtually all taxpayers.  I do not think they have been accused at any time in the past of dealing with the classes of taxpayers mentioned differently from other classes of taxpayers.  The Minister may say that they have to apply the law.</P>
      <P>However, I appreciate the problem that the Minister anticipates could arise here.  Of course, the Minister talked about the discussions which took place and he felt that provision had been made for any foreseeable difficulties but he did say &ldquo;foreseeable&rdquo; because he had to say that because those not provided for are those that are not foreseen.  My concern is that if such a problem arises, first, it may be most acute in a situation arising on the death of a taxpayer and in connection with a pension which may be payable, say, to the widow of the former taxpayer and, secondly, because of the extraordinary high rate of interest chargeable in relation to unpaid tax, before the hardship could be remedied the person concerned, especially a widow, could find herself in considerable difficulty.</P>
      <P>I had thought that the amendment might enable such problems to be obviated but if the Minister feels that such cases can be dealt with without hardship to the person concerned until the law is amended, I will not push the amendment further.  At least, it is important to have drawn attention to what may happen and to indicate the kind of approach which we think ought to be taken if such problems do arise.</P>
      <P>I trust that no such problems will arise but if they do I would hope that it would be possible to deal with them without hardship to the taxpayer concerned arising in any of the ways I have indicated in what I have said.</P>

      <P>This section provides for transitional provisions and, if only for the record, there is something that should be said here.  Arising from the way the matter was handled, there was considerable vehemence outside the House from two viewpoints. Therefore, it is well that we should see this situation in its perspective in so far as the public service is concerned. My information is that when similar provisions were made in 1960 for the transition in respect of those taxpayers outside the public service, there was a considerable body of opinion in the public service that would have wished to have been included with the rest of the community. Personally, I consider it a pity that any differentiation was made then.  I say that having regard to the interests of the public service and in the interests of understanding between the public and private sectors.  However, the private sector were put on the PAYE system while the public sector continued on the old basis.  The transition at either point was not painless and it is only fair to put it on record that the public service were in a sense taken by surprise&mdash;I do not mean immediate surprise as in relation to section 26&mdash;but there are problems posed for the individual.  Consequently, it is only right that a transitional provision be made.</P>
      <P>There seems to be the impression abroad that the public service are getting something out of this.  That is not so.  They are being treated merely on the same basis as were other taxpayers who were brought into the PAYE system in 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the public realise that no concession has been made in that regard. What is unfortunate, though, is that the means by which the Minister undertook this task, gave the impression that he wished to go ahead directly without giving the same fairness.  Far from the public service being put merely on the same basis as everyone else, if this concession had not been given, people in the public service would have been penalised. <Col N="1152" /> It is important that people outside the public service realise what was the true position.  At the beginning this change showed every sign of being made at the expense of Schedule E taxpayers but what is in this section constitutes no more nor no less than what was done in the case of other taxpayers.  Therefore, it is just but what is unfortunate is that the Minister allowed the impression to go abroad that the public service was getting something which other taxpayers did not get.  This situation is not good for the public service no more than for any other sector.  Consequently, it is to be deplored.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this is the impression outside that the Minister made the transitional provision under duress.  There was no need for any duress when he was only achieving justice and equality.  The whole matter was handled badly on the Minister's side.  It was bad, too, from a political point of view.  However, we must all do everything possible to ensure that there is no rift between the community generally and members of the public service arising out of matters like these.  I am not the first to say this: if I were, I might be open to the charge of trying to foment mischief.  The Minister has found it necessary to make such remarks already.</P>
      <P>I join with what Deputy Colley had to say on this provision but although I agree with his very proper suggestion that where the public service is concerned and where the law is being administered by the public service, it is one case where the Minister might take personally the discretion and the responsibility rather than throw it back on any public servant, be he a commissioner or otherwise. The Minister should not abdicate in such matters.  I would be going very near the bone if I were to begin to develop that line and the Chair would be likely to apply the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  But I think the Minister understands what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Chair will allow me to harp back a little.  In the light of these remarks the Minister may understand <Col N="1153" /> why we were so vehement in regard to section 6, why, apart from the element of fairness and all the other arguments we put forward, we were urging basically the case of the Schedule D taxpayers.  Already enough damage has been done in creating a contrast between the public service and the rest of the community without adding to it by the type of discrimination that is in this Bill by virtue of the contrast of section 16 with section 6.  It is section 6 I object to but I will not repeat all the arguments on Schedule D tax.  It is the contrast between sections 6 and 15 that from a public point of view is wrong and bad and has further germs of distrust which some people want to see developing between the various elements in the community. Here I have sympathy with the Minister and his advisers in the problem of dealing with a very special case.  In regard to it, all Deputies and the Minister should accept full and exclusive responsibility.  It is one section more than another in regard to which Deputies should knowingly accept responsibility and relieve others from such responsibility.  I say this by way of explaining to the House the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for the public to understand these things.  One of the reasons for the gradation of the tax year is the building up of the administrative machinery.  The public do not appreciate that the computerisation of these activities, resulting in a considerable amount of efficiency, I should imagine, and when fully developed resulting in considerable economy, has been a task of some magnitude. I suspect that this section in particular could not have been brought in if the equipment, the machinery, had not been ready to cope with it.  We have to face up to the fact that certain things will have to be ironed out.  I assume that Schedule E taxpayers will come on the computer like other PAYE taxpayers and that similar mechanisms will operate.  If people understand that, they will cease looking for skeletons in cupboards and so on.</P>
    <P>The difference in assessments for <Col N="1154" /> companies and for trading profits may be one of the reasons why the Minister was so adamant on section 6.  I think that was a mistake.  There is no sense in my adding further to this. One could go through all the provisions which are necessary transitory measures.  The whole thing can be compared with earlier legislation on PAYE.  In the case of PAYE for everybody else&mdash;this is something the taxpayer outside should know&mdash;there is an element of expense, an indirect tax, on every employer who is an unpaid tax collector for the Revenue Commissioners.  Every employer outside has on him the task and the responsibility and the expense of collecting tax due by his employees and paying it over to the Revenue Commissioners. In that sense there is a hidden tax on every employer outside.</P>
    <P>In the operation of sections 15 and 16 there is an advantage to the taxpayer in that the mechanism will be more automatic and should result in greater efficiency, and it does not carry the hidden liability that the extension of the system to the general public had.  In other words, there is an argument from the public point of view for doing it.  Therefore, from the point of view of the general public what has been done in this section is to the advantage of the public and, to a certain extent, to the detriment of Schedule E taxpayers.  It is only fair to emphasise that because of the things that are being said outside.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the spirit of Deputy Colley's amendment should be considered. I want the discretion there but I think the person to take the discretion fairly and squarely should be the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated very clearly that if discretion is required here it should be brought to and exercised by the House.  Cases of hardship may emerge.  I am glad Deputy de Valera spoke the way he did.  Of course, I would not agree with his criticism of my good self&mdash;natural modesty would not allow me to do that; it would be contrary to my well-known humility.  He said it was proper that the House should be identified <Col N="1155" /> with the changes and the giving of the concessions.  He spoke rightly.</P>
      <P>There has been an undesirable amount of nasty comment about the remission being granted to the public service in the changeover to the PAYE system, which is no more than the remission granted in 1960 when others were brought in.  It can be argued, indeed, that it is less because the remission is being spread over three years rather than being given in one year, as happened in 1960, and the amount of additional revenue which comes to the Exchequer by reason of this change to PAYE, and nothing else, after the remission, is £8 million. So instead of people having a bonus or a gift they will be paying some 20 per cent extra compared with their 1975-76 tax.  In that situation it was equitable and necessary that a remission be given because otherwise people could have found themselves having less net take-home pay than they had in the previous year.  I hope that having spoken in this way we will kill at least some of the nasty envy which has been voiced in recent months and that people will see that there is considerable additional cost to those who have been brought into the net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair for us to remark&mdash;not that we seek commendation for it&mdash;that Members of the House, in passing this &mdash;and I trust the Opposition will not oppose this section any more than they did the last one&mdash;are, in fact, deliberately taxing themselves as well as others and that they will be paying their share of that addition of £8 million which works out at an average of 20 per cent higher tax than they were paying last year.  Of course, this is a measure of the advantage which people in the public service, not on PAYE until now, were enjoying over other taxpayers.  When they no longer enjoy the benefits of the old system, it is costing them so much more in tax now.  But it is a justification for the change we are making.  I said last June that the Government considered that equity required the change be made.  The change is now being made but the additional tax which people will pay here is the justification for the remission&mdash;which does not wipe out <Col N="1156" /> all of the additional tax or anything like it.  They will still be paying more than the remission.  With respect, as I pointed out on section 6, the same situation does not arise in relation to Schedule D taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I want to endorse what Deputy de Valera said in regard to this section and the attitude of this party to it.  We think it is justified and correct that there should be transitional arrangements of this kind on the same basis as were operated in the past when PAYE was introduced.  But I must say also on this section that one cannot escape the impression that, in operating this section, of which we approve, there will be discrimination in favour of those affected by it and against those affected by section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted the net increase to the Exchequer this year arising out of sections 15 and 16 as £8 million and gave that as a measure of the increased imposition on the public service and on the office holders who are affected.  But the Minister knows better than I that his estimated increase under section 6 is £10 million.  That is the measure of the increase he is imposing on the self-employed in this year.  No amount of sophistry can get over the fact that this is an increase on some people and that a different approach is being adopted in this section.  I do not wish <Col N="1157" /> to labour that point further; we made our position clear on it.  We favoured this section.  We regret that a similar approach was not adopted in regard to those affected by section 6.</P>
      <P>There are, however, two matters of detail I want to raise on this section. Firstly, in subsection (2) there is a proviso which reads:</P>
      <P>Provided that the remission shall not exceed the aggregate of the tax appropriate to the emoluments for the relevant years.</P>
      <P>What we want to know is how could it do so and, perhaps, the Minister would give us an example of how it could do so.  The second point I want to raise is in relation to subsection (3) (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>A woman who is in receipt of emoluments for any period consisting of the whole or any part of the relevant years shall be entitled to the remission in respect of tax on emoluments arising to her in the year 1975-76, if any, as an unmarried or widowed woman:</P>
      <P>Could the Minister explain how that will work out in practice?  Perhaps I should explain that my slight concern is that this refers to &ldquo;a woman&rdquo; at the beginning and then it says she will be treated as an unmarried or widowed woman.  The implication in that is that whether she is married or single, she will be treated as single or widowed.  I think there is a little more to it than that and, perhaps, the Minister would clarify it for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that I have all of the Deputy's points but I shall explain the subsections and see how far that gets us.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2), paragraph (a) is the main relieving provision.  It provides for relief amounting to one-half the 1975-76 tax appropriate to the emoluments, provided that tax appropriate to the emoluments arising in the three years 1976-77, 1977-78 and 1978-79 is not less than that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One half of the 1975-76 tax.  In other words, if the emoluments received by a person in the next three years is less than one <Col N="1158" /> half of the tax paid in 1975-76, there will not be a question of getting a rebate in respect of that tax.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have a situation in which a person would have left the service.  I would say there would not be many of these cases.  Nevertheless, they could arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is theoretically possible all right.  It seems very unlikely.  The reason for this proviso is not to meet a specific kind of case.  It is just a covering provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a possibility but I would not think it very probable.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (a) deals with the situation in which in the year 1975-76 a woman is unmarried, subsequently marries and then is in the situation we were discussing earlier, where her income becomes, or is deemed to be, part of her husband's income.  It will be seen there that the situation, to say the least of it, is complicated.  The purpose of subsection (3), paragraph (a) is to deal with that situation.</P>

      <P>Might I stop the Minister there for a moment?  I had a suspicion that that might be what this was all about, though I was not certain. My concern was that it starts off by saying: &ldquo;A woman who is in receipt of emoluments...&rdquo;.  The Minister appears to have confirmed my suspicions that what it means is a single woman or a widow who is in receipt of emoluments.  Am I interpreting that correctly?</P>

      <P>Yes.  If she is not married, then she is automatically treated as an unmarried or widowed woman.  But, even if she is married, <Col N="1159" /> she is to be treated for this purpose, as an unmarried or widowed woman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an example which I hope will help clarify the position.  I am frightened by the length of the example.  However, I shall offer it to you.  Before I do so, I want to explain the purpose of the subsection. For the purpose of the remission, a married woman is to be treated as if she were an unmarried or widowed woman.  The remission will be payable to her.  There would be no question of the remission going to her husband because he is making the return of the income.</P>
      <P>Let us assume that a woman civil servant married another civil servant, which is not unusual, in October 1975, and remains in her employment.  In 1975-76 her emoluments as an unmarried woman might be £2,000, tax £400 and a remission of £200. The husband's emoluments for 1975-76 would be £5,000.  The wife's post-marriage emoluments would be £2,000, a total of £7,000, and the tax is, say, £2,800.  The tax appropriate to the wife's emoluments would be two-sevenths multiplied by 2,800, or £800.  Apportioned in accordance with subsection (1) (b) the remission would be £400.  The tax appropriate to the husband's net emoluments would be five-sevenths multiplied by 2,800, which would be £2,000, and the remission would be £1,000.  I do not know if Deputies want me to proceed but I can give the situation for 1976-77.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In pages 14 and 15 to delete subsections (2), (3) and (4) and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where remuneration (hereinafter referred to as `unpaid remuneration') which is deductible as an expense in computing the profits or income of a trade or profession for an accounting period or period of account for the purposes of Schedule D is unpaid at a relevant date&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the unpaid remuneration shall be deemed to be emoluments to which Chapter IV of Part V of the Income Tax Act, 1967, applies and shall be deemed to have been paid in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3), and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) all the provisions of the said Chapter IV and of the regulations made thereunder and of <Col N="1162" /> sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Finance Act, 1968, shall, with any necessary modifications, apply to the unpaid remuneration as if it had been so paid.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a) Unpaid remuneration shall be deemed to have accrued from day to day throughout the period of accrual and there shall be deemed to have been paid on each relevant date so much thereof as accrued up to that date or, if it is earlier, the date of cessation of the office or employment in respect of which the unpaid remuneration is payable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  where there was no preceding relevant date, from the beginning of the period of accrual or, if it is later, the date of commencement of the office or employment in respect of which the unpaid remuneration is payable, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  where there was a preceding relevant date, from the day following that date or, if it is later, the said date of commencement.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph (a), unpaid remuneration would be deemed to have been paid on a date earlier than the 5th day of April, 1976, that remuneration shall be deemed to have been paid on the 5th day of April, 1976.</P>
    <P>(4)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to:</P>
    <P>(a) emoluments to which section 125 (c) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, applies; or</P>
    <P>(b) unpaid remuneration which is paid before&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the date of expiry of 6 months after the date (hereinafter referred to as `the deemed date') on which that remuneration is, by virtue of subsection (3), deemed to have been paid, or</P>
    <P>(ii) in case the period of account is one of more than 12 months, the date of expiry of <Col N="1163" /> 18 months from the first day of that period of account if the date of expiry is later than the deemed date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment looks rather intimidating because of its length but it is not.  The purpose of this amendment which rewrites subsections (2), (3) and (4) is to remove any ambiguity as to the word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; to which reference is made in the section and which was defined as `remuneration to which this section applies&rdquo;.  The matter is being clarified by the substitution of the term &ldquo;unpaid remuneration&rdquo; which is specially defined.  The consequential amendments would be so numerous that it is more convenient to re-write subsections (2), (3) and (4) than to deal separately with the several deletions and substitutions.  The amended draft contains no more than drafting amendments and in no way affects the provisions of the subsections as introduced.</P>

This House is entitled to have final drafts put before it and, with respect, I do not think it is good enough that we have a Bill circulated, that we operate on the basis of the Second Stage of the Bill being passed and we then get ministerial amendments of this magnitude and scope.  If this kind of thing were to continue, before long we would pass one Bill on Second Stage and we would substitute a completely new one on Committee Stage, which would make a complete farce of our parliamentary procedure. That would be the logical end of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> The Minister says this was the tidiest way to do this.  I am not faulting him on that or faulting the improvement.  However, I would like to know why it was not done this way in the first instance.  I would like to know, for instance, what was wrong with the first draft.  When you have regard, say, to the wording of a section like section 9 or section 15, when major legislation is done in that form, nobody will listen to me, certainly the Minister will not, if I plead for explicitness.  Here the Minister is making the case for explicitness, but I rather suspect there is something wrong with the original draft.  There are loopholes or something else in it, or otherwise the Minister would not have brought in this extensive re-write of the subsections in question.  The Minister will pardon me if I do not accept it as sufficient to say that the new draft is more elegant than the original one.  I do not think that argument would weigh with him if it came from this side of the House, so, perhaps, he will not take it as discourteous if we will not accept it either.  There is some loophole or something wrong in the original draft that is now being corrected in the new one.  I accept without question that once the Minister had to look at this section the cleanest way to do it was this way. I am not objecting to that; in fact, I think the Minister is right here. But would he not tell us what was wrong and why it was necessary to do that?  What was the loophole, what was the defect or mistake? What was wrong with subsections (2), (3) and (4) of the original draft as passed on Second Reading?</P>

      <P>The unpaid remuneration is that which is deductible as an expense for the purpose of Schedule D and which is unpaid.  The liability to tax arises only when payment occurs.

      <P>The Minister referred to this broadly as remuneration which is unpaid and which is deductible as an expense in computing the profits or income of a trade or profession.  I notice that the explanatory memorandum refers to this as an expense&mdash; remuneration which, although charged in the accounts of the employer and allowed as an expense in the computation of his profits, has not been formally paid.  May we take it that what is intended is that it is remuneration which is shown in the books of the employer which he would be allowed as an expense if he claimed it but which he may not have claimed on the basis that he has not yet paid it?  Would that cover the kind of situation that the Minister has in mind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any procedural point.  Under existing PAYE legislation tax is deductible on payment of any remuneration, including directors' fees, but where an employer fails to pay over to the Revenue the tax deductible from remuneration, there is a liability to the interest charged.  These provisions are now being circumvented in the case of private companies.  Amounts which purport to be remuneration are shown as expenses in the accounts of the business and are allowed as a deduction in computing a company's tax liability.  It is only when the remuneration is eventually voted, which may of course be a considerable time afterwards, that tax is deductible and liable to be remitted under the PAYE legislation.  In the meantime the directors are able to enjoy the use of the money, which will have been withdrawn in one guise <Col N="1169" /> or another without attracting liability to tax or interest.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the section, as I hope it will be amended, are aimed at securing that amounts shown in accounts as remuneration will be deemed to have been paid at a relevant date so that the PAYE legislation will apply as if the remuneration had been paid at that time.  This is doing something which Deputy de Valera was arguing earlier ought to be done, that, where a device is being operated with the apparent objective of avoiding liability to tax, the Revenue Commissioners should have the discretion to treat it for what it is, an artifical device to avoid the tax liability. That is, in effect, what this section will be doing.</P>

      <P>Let us take the case of an individual employer and fix our minds on this employee, no matter what his status.  He gets certain remuneration from the company, taxable remuneration, and it does not matter from the tax point of view whether it is charged as salaries, wages or expenses that are not allowed as such by the Revenue Commissioners. It all boils down to the one thing.  It is remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> Supposing that in the accounts of the company this money is charged to him in the gross total of the salaries and wages of the company and that it is subtracted from the revenue and so on and there is profit taxable for corporation profits tax.

      <P>His PAYE return will show the actual tax he got.  His PAYE will only be assessable on the actual money deducted from the money he got.  What beats me here is that he has got no money and why should they get after him?  Surely the company is guilty of a fraud in putting in remuneration that it did not pay.  I do not understand the case here.  If any company puts in expenses which it has not paid, to say the least of it, it is sharp practice.  It is the company the commissioners should go after and there is no reason why they should not be caught with the machinery in another way because what they would find is that an expense that was not properly an expense had been charged against profit.  I am a little bit confused as to the necessity of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Where a bonus is promised to an employee, let it be a manager or whatever, the bonus is paid at the end of the year or at least there is an arrangement made between the employer and the manager that he will get a bonus of £X to be paid at the end of the year.  I have an argument as to why this section should be omitted.  For some given reason that manager of a company could say to the employer: &ldquo;Do not pay me the bonus this year, leave it there and I will collect it in two years' time because I am getting married and I want to buy a house.&rdquo;  In that type of situation the employer when writing up the accounts would automatically bill that expense in as credit that is due to one of his employees by virtue of the fact that they have an arrangement. There are other occasions <Col N="1172" /> where this situation can arise and it is justified.  There have been cases where there has been an agreement made between employers and employees where the bonus is given at the end of an accountable year and due to a very bad period of business the manager could very well say that due to the circumstances that obtain within the business he will defer payment of this bonus for two to three years until things improve.  That is the type of situation that will be caught in it.  The Minister is looking at this section from the point of view of a deferred payment to avoid PAYE.  Eventually when the bonus is paid PAYE will have to be paid on it by an employee.  Does that make any sense to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a decision by the special commissioners that if directors receive money or make drawings and have the money in their hands, that is not remuneration. Remuneration does not arise until the money is actually voted. Most practical people would regard that as nonsense.  That allows a person a most convenient device to avoid payment of tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does it not say directors?  The Minister's use of the word &ldquo;voted&rdquo; certainly applies to a director but it would not apply to a lot of other people involved in this.  How could unpaid remuneration occur in a properly run company, leaving out the case where something would be falsely included as an expense paid, because that would be fraud?  I can only think of three methods by which unpaid remuneration can be made available, without falling back on this technicality of &ldquo;voted by the board of directors&rdquo;.  The first one is the case which Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned, of undertaking to pay <Col N="1173" /> somebody some money in the future whether by way of bonus, pension or otherwise.  In that case what would happen in company accounts is that a provision would be included and that would either be allowed or not allowed by the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes.  In computing the profit after tax that provision would be added back if it was disallowed.  If it was allowed, it would be an expense and the problem would not occur.</P>
      <P>The next way it could be done as Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested, is by a creditor.  The person concerned could be included as a creditor in the accounts.  It would be shown specifically in a category that is identifiable and it would be shown in the same way that other identifiable categories are shown and there should be no problem at all.  The third way is that the money could be borrowed in which case it would appear in a bank or somewhere like that.  Again, it is traceable and identifiable.  I cannot see how it could escape the Revenue Commissioners and it is a question for the Revenue Commissioners to decide whether that borrowing is a remuneration or not. This is a line of country that I cannot go into, not being a tax expert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, if it is anything like that then this will appear normal.  If it is a case of putting into accounts a sum of money that has not actually been paid and salting it away, that is a fraud under the Companies Acts and any auditor who would connive at that will be guilty of a breach of professional conduct.  So, I am ruling out any such misconduct.  Short of that, it seems to me that the others would be perfectly identifiable.  I am therefore left with the case the Minister has now given us.  If it refers to directors then may I ask why bring in categories other than directors, why not specifically legislate for what you are doing.  You may be doing this <i>ex abundante cautelae</i> but there is a little bit too much caution involved in this.  It is going a little bit far.  Can the Minister say, is it really necessary to go this far if that <Col N="1174" /> is all he is after and if he is not after more could not the results of this kind of legislation cause more complications in tax administration and more difficulties in accounting without any corresponding benefit or improvement for the Revenue?  These are two points which should be cleared up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is confusion here.  It is really a question of company law.  You talk about trade or profession and Schedule D.  Schedule D deals with self-employed persons, professional people and so on. What the Minister is obviously after are private trading companies or even <Col N="1176" /> non-trading companies.  From what he has said now, it is companies he is talking about and it must have been a private company that he referred to because no public company would get away with that.  There is a mix-up here between two things.  It is only a company who has to vote.  If it is a Schedule D taxpayer or the employees of a Schedule D taxpayer it is not an incorporated body and there is no necessity to vote.  I cannot see how the position the Minister has quoted &mdash;we do not seek any specific information and do not want any identifying information&mdash;applies to Schedule D taxpayers because Schedule D taxpayers are immediately available on their accounts.  I thought I understood it but now the matter seems to have become somewhat woolly.  Can we sort it out in this way: is there any problem with a public company?  &ldquo;Public company&rdquo; is defined in the Companies Act and there is a set of rules there.  If there is a reputable firm of auditors, and there must be auditors in that case, what the Minister is afraid of cannot happen without being revealed and the Revenue Commissioners can demand the information they require and they will get it.  I think we can leave public companies out.  Then we come to private companies, either trading companies or non-trading companies.  Trading companies are probably the ones more liable to this form of temptation because it is rather difficult to see how it would operate for a non-trading company.  If it is the problem of a private trading company why not say so and focus your attention directly on the problem of the private trading company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, it can be Schedule D cases. If it is Schedule D cases I fail to see how it is necessary to vote.  What is necessary is to complete the accounts. There is the whole tax code, with all the accounting periods and what the Revenue Commissioners may require by way of information and so on and all the combat that has been going on with Schedule D taxpayers over the years and admittedly the abuses that Schedule D taxpayers have been responsible for because many Schedule <Col N="1177" /> D cases did resort to the device of private non-trading companies and even trading companies to avoid tax. Why is it necessary?  Are not all the necessary powers of inspection and all the rest of it already in existence and is it not possible to deal with them on a surcharge basis, as has been done?  At least be consistent.  The Minister has got after trustees and after public companies on a surcharge basis.  Here is something similar to a surcharge position and the Minister is adopting a totally different technique.</P>
    <P>This is what completely complicates the tax law.  I am not trying to be difficult but I would ask the Minister to answer the following questions: what is the impact, (a) on a public company, (b) on a private trading company, (c) on a private non-trading company and (d) on Schedule D taxpayers. I apologise to the Minister for the delay caused by my mistake but I was under the impression that when the Minister said &ldquo;voted&rdquo; he meant voted by a board of directors.  I am aware now that he means voted at an annual general meeting.  I can see the relevance so far as that is concerned either to a private or to a public company.  However, I should like the Minister to clarify the position under each of the four heads I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no merit in identifying wrongdoers in case there is a possibility that others in another sector could produce a similar device. To say that something is wrong does not affect the innocent and Deputy de Valera is right in saying that he cannot see how this would apply in a public company, assuming that the public company is run properly.  But there could possibly be public companies where, in anticipation of the legality being completed, remuneration would be drawn pending the passing of a resolution to authorise it.  The Deputy says that the annual accounts would have to be produced but there could be several months delay in payment of tax in such a situation.  It is not a device that the best of companies would use but it is possible and, therefore, it would be wrong to exclude <Col N="1178" /> any group merely because they are unlikely to engage in such practice or because we do not see how they could engage in it.  While to render something illegal does not affect the innocent it hinders those who might be tempted to engage in the practice concerned. What we are discussing here is clearly an avoidance practice but it is our aim to catch the receipt of funds which, obviously, are remuneration and are intended to be such.  In other words, the time of receipt will be deemed to be the time of remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in so far as he goes but I have certain practical difficulties here.  Let us take a simple but very prevalent case.  Suppose an employee&mdash;I am not talking of a director&mdash;is advanced a certain sum of money by way of expenses before he goes away on some company business.  He can only account for the money after he has ascertained his expenses.  More often than not he would be entitled to a further advance.  There might be the very unusual case where his expenses and his advance would balance but there would also be the possibility of his having a surplus to surrender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering whether it can be construed as remuneration within the terms of this section because precisely that device could be used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I can make all sorts of accounting arguments here but what is to be the position in such a case?  We do not seem to be clear on what we are doing although the Minister is clear on what he wishes to do.  Again, I invite him to take up the question under the headings I have mentioned.  There would not be any identification of wrongdoers.  All I am asking for is the situation in respect of four well-known legally defined <Col N="1179" /> categories.  There are many public companies which can have capitals of from a few thousand pounds to several million pounds.  Surely nobody could identify these.  There is the private trading company which is mainly what the Minister has in mind and there is the private non-trading company which is the one most known to the Revenue Commissioners as a tax avoidance device. It has its <i>bona fide</i> uses as a trust but is used too often for tax avoidance purposes and, consequently, has a bad name.  The fourth is the straightforward Schedule D taxpayer, the unincorporated trader, for instance.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister to take the situation in regard to these four broad categories and to say what is the anticipated problem, what are the effects of the section in respect of each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference here between a trading and a non-trading company.  We are concerned only with the question of remuneration which is a deductible expense for the purposes of the accounts of a company. Regarding the illustration given by the Deputy of an employee being given a sum of money towards expenses and the sum being greater than the actual expenses, such excess would be treated as benefit in kind and would be caught under the ordinary benefit-in-kind provision and, consequently, brought into the tax charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the answer.  I have said that it makes no difference whether a company is a trading or a non-trading one in so far as this provision is concerned.  I explained what I would assume to be the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> a public company that was run properly.  In that case this proviso would not arise.</P>

Indeed I am somewhat concerned that certain implications have arisen from the discussions here&mdash;people who want to can develop this&mdash;and all I would say is that in the purpose he is trying to achieve we are in agreement with him but we are concerned that he may in the course of what he is doing catch something that he should not be catching. Primarily I am concerned because I think he is going about it in the wrong way.  Nevertheless, we agree with what he is trying to do and consequently I do not think we should pursue the matter.  I would ask the Minister to have his advisers take a look at the report of the debate on this amendment and consider the implications.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I fully appreciate what the Minister is trying to do.  This is money held in limbo.  I would be concerned that payment would be forced out of a company&mdash;commitments made to people in regard to bonuses, and agreements made between employee and employer&mdash;that certain bonuses would be deferred in times of recession. These payments would have to be made or otherwise they would come under Schedule D or be subject to PAYE.</P>

      <P>Very briefly I should like to add to what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said.  At times there may be reasons, because of various problems to do with liquidity, for some method such as this to be employed. I do not see anything wrong in it provided the individual concerned had not at the same time borrowed money from the company.  That is where I could see wrong being done to the Exchequer and to the taxpayer. There could be circumstances where individuals working together might agree to forego salaries or some part <Col N="1181" /> of them for a limited period.  If that were done and this amendment were to catch them, I do not think that would be right.  I am not sure if it can happen.  We are speaking of unpaid remuneration which has been declared as remuneration and allowed for tax purposes by a company.  Provided that money was not laid out or lent to an individual I do not think there is anything wrong with it because it might be necessary to do it for two or three years until a company recovered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 17, to delete &ldquo;with effect as on and from the 6th day of April, 1975,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 (2) imposes a limit on the total amount of the deduction that may be claimed by a farmer whose farming profits are assessed to tax on a notional basis.  The purpose of this limitation, it will be recalled, was to ensure that loss relief would not be available as a result of a calculation which could in certain circumstances produce an artificial loss.  The section as it stands imposes the limit for 1975 and 1976. Following publication of the Bill, a number of tax agents advised inspectors of taxes that it was their intention to make claims for their clients in respect of the year 1974-75, their aim being to exploit the apparent defect in the law for the year in respect of which it has not been remedied.  The amendment now being moved deletes the reference to 6th April, 1975 and makes the provision <Col N="1182" /> effective in respect of the year 1976-77 and as respects any year for which a claim for loss relief is made after 30th March, 1976, the date on which the Bill was released for publication. Since the notional basis is to be continued for 1976-77 without reference to any preceding year of assessment, the present position likewise applies for that year without reference to any subsequent year of assessment.</P>
    <P>I think I should explain what the section is doing.  It imposes a limit on the total amount of deductions that may be claimed by a farmer whose profits are taxed on a notional basis. Total deductions are not to exceed 40 times the rateable valuation of the farm lands.  In other words, the notional basis may reduce farming profits to nil, but it was never intended, and nobody could argue it should be intended, that it should be used to create an artificial loss that might be set off against other income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to formulate losses on the basis that this weakness or loophole existed, and of course they were not aware of it until we identified it by bringing in the amendment to stop anybody making any such claim. Quite clearly, no case can be made to allow people to generate artificial losses to be used against other profits.  The approach was made after publication of the Bill obviously with the intention of exploiting the apparent defect in the law for the period during which the defect existed.</P>

      <P>Last evening I was speaking about the Minister's circular, No. H4/76, and its effect on Dublin Corporation.  At present they have rejected it but I understand they will be speaking to the Minister in this regard. The result of its adoption will be that 400 men must be dismissed from the corporation's housing maintenance branch.  In his circular the Minister stated that some local authorities, in previous years, failed to carry out a <Col N="1184" /> proper system of maintenance and were now indulging in extravagant schemes. In 1972 Dublin Corporation employed 941 men on housing maintenance.  In 1976 they employ 965 men, an increase of 24 men in four years.  Of course, one must remember that such dwellings would be four years old by now and that there were a lot more dwellings built in that period.  Dublin Corporation, with all their faults, did not neglect proper maintenance of their housing stock.  Nor did they indulge in any orgy of maintenance when the Government changed the system of housing finance.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that if his circular has any application to local authorities in general, certainly it has no application to the Dublin city centre.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider its withdrawal in so far as it affects Dublin and in that respect, I am sure he would have the support of all members of the corporation irrespective of their political affiliations.</P>
      <P>One item to be axed under the provisions of the Minister's circular is central heating.  We all know&mdash;even if it is in an amateurish sort of way&mdash; that any system-built dwelling must have central heating, and we have many of such buildings in this city at present.  To force Dublin Corporation to pay the total bill for central heating constitutes a great penalty on their tenants.  One must consider also that Government policy, in the last budget, imposed an extra 2p a gallon on fuel oil&mdash;I do not know how much that would entail in the corporation's services&mdash;but it yields the Exchequer £20 million a year in tax.  I do know also that industry is complaining in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year it will cost Dublin Corporation £870,000 to deal with squatting and the question of caretaking.  We may blame the squatting on whoever we like.  We may say the Government did not act sufficiently quickly to stop squatting when we appealed to them to do so.  That is the collective responsibility of the Government and not of the Minister's Department alone.  We find that squatting will cost, in the coming year, £200,000 and caretaking <Col N="1185" /> £678,000, in respect of which I know some subsidy will be paid.  But central heating will cost £603,000.  Those three figures taken together amount to £1,480,000 approximately.  Therefore, because of the Minister's directive, Dublin Corporation must try to save £1.2 million.</P>

      <P>I shall just finish.  That means Dublin Corporation must sack 400 men.  I would appeal to the Minister to have talks with Dublin Corporation on that whole point.  By foregoing the sums I mentioned the jobs of 400 men could be saved. Apart from the loss of those men, we must remember also that the dwellings which should be maintained will deteriorate further which in turn will entail a lot more money. Perhaps the Minister would talk with Dublin Corporation in a common effort to save the jobs of those 400 men.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking on this motion.  Gloom regarding the building industry has been emanating from the far side of the House since 1973. Despite that, we built in excess of the number of houses we said we would build.  That was despite the prophets of gloom inside and outside the House, and particularly the prominent Member who represents the building construction industry. He seems to have taken upon himself the role of chief Opposition spokesman on all matters now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke about the circular letter issued by the Minister and maintenance costs.  He was talking about all of the houses built since 1973 and their additional maintenance costs.  In 1972 there were 941 men employed and, in 1976, 965&mdash;very little difference.  Deputy Moore attends corporation meetings regularly and should know that, in that period, we built 4,230 dwellings and sold 8,872.  Therefore, we have now 4,642 fewer dwellings to service.  Yet there are more maintenance men employed. <Col N="1186" /> That explodes Deputy Moore's very weak argument in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore comes out with that kind of nonsense in what I would regard as a very serious debate.  Deputy Moore spoke also of the mismanagement of housing, the guaranteed order housing.  Who was responsible for that monster?  Who was responsible, not for the low cost but cheap houses, houses on which we are now having to spend large amounts of money in maintenance?  When we assumed office we decided it was time we gave the people of this city and country decent homes, not something substandard, as had been emanating from the far side of the House.  They cannot get away from that.</P>
      <P>To prove our <i>bona fides</i> on the type of house and standard we want in Dublin city, we organised an architectural competition and we had 85 entries, the standard being very high. This was a result of progressive thinking on this side of the House.  We are not interested in substandard or low-cost housing.  We are interested in giving our people the best.  That is why we have drawn on all sections of industry to ensure that we get the best.</P>
      <P>Take Dublin city&mdash;I am chairman of the Corporation Housing Committee&mdash;where, when we came into office, we found literally the inner core in utter shambles.  When was a house built in it?  It was a long time ago.  The people of The Liberties, who had been agitating for years for good housing development to accommodate their community, found that their pleas fell on deaf ears.  It was not long before we came to grips with the situation there.  Now one can walk through The Coombe and see the development taking place there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The City Quay community have been crying in the wilderness for years. When a CPO was formulated in 1965-66 <Col N="1187" /> it was turned down.  There were no problems; it just did not suit the vested interests of the day.  That CPO has now been approved and passed. We are about to develop the City Quay, cattle market and Smithfield areas and the houses in Clogher Road. These are basically centre city sites. We are not interested in substandard or low-cost housing.  We are building the best.  We are blending in with the areas to ensure that we are restoring our communities&mdash;we are not imposing anything on them&mdash;so that the people will feel a continuity with the past.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at Deputy Moore's attitude to the Dublin housing programme. He picked on a very weak argument.  He used a loss of jobs in a most despicable way.  There is no question of 400 jobs being at stake and he knows that as well as I do.  At the moment we must spend wisely on construction.  Last year we spent £11.5 million on housing construction in Dublin city.  Even in present hard times, this year we spent £23.7 million.  Yet Fianna Fáil have the gall to stand up and complain of housing mismanagement and housing cut-backs.  They are not codding anybody, not even themselves, when they complain of mismanagement.  We know of mismanagement. We know the problems we inherited.  We promised to build 25,000 houses and we kept that promise. We are not building just any kind of house.  We are not building monuments we will regret.  We do not have to look too far from this House to see the monument I am talking about which was built by Fianna Fáil. That monument was supposed to solve our housing problems.  It was to save us.  Let us face reality and talk about this problem.</P>
    <P>We have a housing problem in Dublin city and the Minister recognises this.  That is why this year he selected Dublin as an area that required special attention and provided a large sum of money.  Deputy Moore says the Minister was playing politics and that was why he gave the money. Now he says there are cut backs in Dublin housing.  This is ludicrous.  It is not balanced thinking.  It is treating <Col N="1188" /> this very serious matter as a joke. It is regrettable that the Deputy is playing petty politics.</P>
    <P>As I said before and say again, Fianna Fáil put down these motions unwisely.  When one hears the answers from this side one will realise that we are serious about this.  If we have to cut back we will do so prudently. We will not cut back on good type house building.  We do not want to have to go back to try to shore up low cost housing.  Fianna Fáil are welcome to low cost housing; the people of Dublin want good housing.  They did not get it from Fianna Fáil but they are getting it from us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">

      <P>The motion as it appears on today's Order Paper reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's mismanagement of all matters appertatining to housing.</P>
      <P>So far this debate has centred on problems of prospective house purchasers, the problems of the construction industry with its massive unemployment, and the problems being faced by building companies.  Before dealing with that side of the debate, I would like to refer to the problems of existing house owners who are also affected by the Government's mismanagement, in particular the plight of the unfortunate ratepayers who are being asked to pay ever spiralling rates in return for a deteriorating service, at a time when many of their families are being forced into the dole queues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all remember only too well that at the 1973 general election the country was assured by the Coalition that by transferring health and housing subsidies to a national charge this would result in a reduction in rates throughout the country.  What are the facts?  We have seen ever-increasing rates burdens being imposed on our people.  Dublin County Council, the council on which I have the honour to be a member, illustrates the point clearly.  In February, 1973, the rate was £5.80 in the pound.  In February, 1976, the rate is £9.95, nearly double.  This despite the fact that the people were assured at the time of the general election that the <Col N="1189" /> Coalition, by making health and housing subsidies a national charge, would reduce the rates.  This has been shown up for the sham it is.  The people can no longer face this annual ever-increasing massive rates burden. Fianna Fáil have committed themselves to removing rates from private houses and from that residential portion of commercial properties.  This is the only solution to the ever-spiralling rates burden.  The sooner the Minister and his Government realise this the better for the people.</P>
    <P>The question can also be asked: what has happened to the health and housing subsidies that were supposedly given?  There is a simple answer.  In health this year there is a cut back of approximately £30 million which sees our health services falling apart and services which had been there for a number of years are being withdrawn. In housing we have the spectacle&mdash;</P>

      <P>In housing we have the spectacle of the Minister sending a circular to local authorities. This referred to maintenance by local authorities and the supposed abuse by certain local authorities of the relief given.  If this circular is put into effect our housing stock will deteriorate and this will result in unemployment in most of our local authorities. You can see the result in Dublin Corporation where a report was presented to the members on 6th May, signed by the city manager.  In the section that referred to the employment <Col N="1190" /> of men involved in maintenance jobs it said: &ldquo;Since only seven months remain in the account for the current year the necessary reduction in the housing maintenance labour force would be in the region of 400 men&rdquo;. This is not mere Fianna Fáil propaganda as was suggested by Deputy O'Brien.  I do not think even the Deputy would accuse a city manager of being a Fianna Fáil Party hack.</P>

      <P>What has happened in the Dublin Corporation area applies equally to other areas throughout the country.  I wish to refer to the problems of existing householders and to the mismanagement by the Government of the ground rents situation. On 9th and 10th December, 1975, we had a debate in this House on a motion put down by Deputy Collins and others.  That motion read as follows: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's inaction in relation to ground rents&rdquo;.  The Government then put down an amendment on the following lines: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann approves the Government's decision to prevent the creation of further ground rents&rdquo;.  We might well ask, what decision?</P>
      <P>In the course of his contribution to that debate at column 1142 of the Official Report dated 9th December, 1975, Deputy Andrews quoted a letter dated 3rd February, 1975, that was written to Deputy Browne arising out of representations to him from the residents in Enniscorthy, New Ross and Wexford town where there was a serious ground rent problem.  The letter stated:</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Justice, Mr. P. Cooney, TD, to refer to your letter of 25th January concerning legislation on ground <Col N="1191" /> rents, particularly in relation to the position of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>At this stage the name of the individual on whose behalf Deputy Browne was making representations was mentioned.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;whose lease has eight years to run.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to introduce legislation which will prohibit the creation of future ground rents on dwelling houses and the Minister hopes to be in a position to arrange for the circulation of the necessary Bill shortly after Easter.</P>
    <P>The Easter in question was not Easter, 1976; it was Easter, 1975, but we have not yet seen the legislation that was to abolish the creation of the future ground rents.  While the Minister dithers, ground rents are being created every day.  Since that debate on 9th and 10th December last&mdash; working on the Minister's figure of 25,000 houses built each year and assuming that about three-quarters of the houses are privately built houses &mdash;about 7,000 new ground rents have been created.  The Government voted against the Fianna Fáil motion and approved their own decision which was supposed to abolish ground rents, but where is the promised Government action?  On the basis of the Minister's figures, at least 20,000 to 21,000 new ground rents must have been created since the letter I have quoted was sent to Deputy Browne.  All that was needed was a simple Bill in this House.  Fianna Fáil promised that we would give such a Bill a careful and speedy passage in order to ban the creation of the future ground rents.</P>

      <P>Because of the Government's inaction and mismanagement existing house owners have had imposed on them the burden of crippling rates.  The Government's lack of action, despite their many promises, with regard to ground rents has left house dwellers in an appalling situation.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer again to the circular letter sent by the Minister.  It included not only comments about repairs to local authority houses but it also referred to the forward purchase of land. The Minister was imposing strict regulations on local authorities with regard to the forward purchase of land for housing purposes.  Surely it is sensible for local authorities to buy land in advance when it is available and when it can be purchased at a low price in the expectation that they will be able to build houses in some years time.  However, according to the regulations set out in the Minister's circular letter it will be very difficult for local authorities to do this because they will have to carry many of the charges themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has imposed regulations with regard to central heating in local authority houses.  In the Ballymun flats complex which I have the honour to represent, according to the circular issued by the assistant city manager this will mean an increase of 31p to 86p per week for central heating charges.  The maintenance of lifts is an item that comes under the circular <Col N="1193" /> sent by the Minister.  Surely we all want to see lifts properly maintained.</P>
    <P>As well as planning for future housing by the forward purchase of land it is essential to provide proper sewerage, water and road systems.  In this connection I should like to quote from a circular presented by the assistant city and county manager on 8th March to Dublin County Council:</P>
    <P>In letters of 13th February, 1976, the council was informed that the capital allocation for 1976 for major water and sewerage schemes is £4 million and for small schemes is £25,000.  It was reported to the council at its meeting of 12th January, 1976, that its total estimated requirements of the council for 1976 was £9,809,828.</P>
    <P>The requirement to meet expenditure already incurred and to carry on existing schemes and contracts in 1976 is £7,457,128.  The allocation, therefore, falls short of the minimum requirement by approximately £3½ million.  No reference has been made by the Department in their letters notifying the allocations as to how this shortfall should be financed.  The matter has been taken up with the Department.</P>
    <P>One of the major construction areas is within the boundaries of County Dublin because so many of the people on the corporation housing list are being rehoused in major corporation schemes such as Darndale, Poppintree, Tallaght and into Blanchardstown but the county council are prevented this year from providing the extra infrastructure because of the massive reduction in the amount of money they requested from the Minister.  It was wrong for the Minister to provide only £4 million out of a projected £9 million. The Minister will say that he gave us £3 million last year and that he is giving us an extra £1 million but that is not the point.  The point at issue was clearly outlined in the report I quoted.  The requirements to meet expenditure already incurred, bills that are owed by the county council, to carry on existing schemes and contracts, such as the Grand Canal scheme, amount to £7½ million.  That <Col N="1194" /> money would not have enabled them to start any new schemes but merely to carry on with the schemes in hand and to pay the money owed to contractors.  The Minister gave the council £4 million and no indication as to where the other £3½ million is to come from.</P>
    <P>How can a housing programme be planned if there is no forward purchase of land and there is a cut back in sanitary services?  It is not possible to design a programme on that basis. Obviously, the Minister is aware that the day of reckoning is fast approaching and he is prepared to push everything available in his Department so that he can carry on with his artificial figure in relation to construction with no thought of future planning.  When we take over from the Minister in the near future we will find ourselves without any land for advance planning. Most of the houses he is building at present are being erected on land purchased by the Fianna Fáil Administration. There is no forward planning for sanitary services because the Minister is not providing the money for this.</P>
    <P>What I have said in relation to the sewerage and water programmes also applies to the road programme.  In County Dublin last year we got £2,173,000 while this year we are getting £1,970,000, and that does not take into account the massive inflation or the cost of cement and other materials.  To do the same amount of work this year as last year we would have needed an extra 25 to 30 per cent.  This is all part of the mismanagement of the Government.</P>
    <P>What is the situation with regard to the unfortunate young couples who are trying to buy houses at present? In the course of many motions discussed here we appealed to the Minister to increase the maximum amount of the SDA loan from £4,500 to £6,000 and to increase the maximum income limit from £2,350 to £3,000. It is three years since the Minister increased the maximum amount of loan available.  At present private houses sell for something in the region of £8,500, but the Department's maximum loan is £4,500.  To become eligible for such a loan the <Col N="1195" /> applicant must be earning less than £2,350.  How could anybody expect young couples earning less than that amount to save £4,000 so that they could buy their own house?  The Minister has put a further barrier in the way of those couples by deciding to pay the grant only to those who are eligible for the supplementary grants.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister described those who are debarred from obtaining these grants as &ldquo;very wealthy people&rdquo;. Would the Minister consider that a person who earns £1,950, plus £100 for each dependant up to a maximum of three and a wife very wealthy? A little more than £40 per week seems to qualify those who earn that figure for the description, &ldquo;very wealthy people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The average wage for a skilled worker in the building industry is £55.93 per week and such a worker is debarred from getting a grant. An unskilled worker earns £47.95 per week and he is also debarred from obtaining that grant.  They are included in the category of &ldquo;very wealthy people&rdquo; by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Bearing in mind the financial constraints the Minister has spoken of it should be possible for him to alter his decision with regard to grants and SDA loans.  He should leave the position as it was prior to January of this year.</P>
    <P>On the question of SDA loans I should like to refer to the ludicrous situation which exists whereby the interest rates charged by building societies on mortgages are lower than those charged for local authority house loans.  The local authority house loans are provided for those who are unable to get loans from building societies because they do not earn enough money.  They get these SDA loans because of their low income; they have to be earning less than £2,350.  The Minister then, through the Minister for Finance, charges a hefty 12½ per cent interest rate on local authority loans, far in excess of what the current rate is on the building society market.  My colleague, Deputy Faulkner, had a question <Col N="1196" /> down to the Minister for Finance on this topic, and I quote the reply from column 24, Volume 290, of the Official Report of Tuesday, 27th April, 1976:</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on this subject on 24th February, 1976.</P>
    <P>Unlike building societies and banks lending rates the Exchequer lending rate, on which the rate for the local authority house loans is based, is a long-term fixed interest rate and is not subject to variation during the life of the loan.  The market cost of such long-term funds is at present over 14½ per cent which means that the present rate of 12½ per cent charged on local authority house loans already involves a significant subsidy which has to be met from taxation.  It would not be appropriate to reduce the rate at the present time.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be appropriate to reduce it.  There is no matter of principle involved.  The only principle involved is the principle that those who can least afford to pay are being asked to pay the most.  I would ask the Minister to give some assistance to those unfortunate couples who are being charged this savage 12½ per cent by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The whole problem of the Government in regard to the question of housing is that one side of the Government benches have one view of where housing should be going and what areas should be getting the greatest help&mdash;that is on the side of the Minister and some of his colleagues&mdash;and the other side have the mentality displayed in that speech of Deputy Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, both completely contradictory.  The Minister will probably tell us that the Parliamentary Secretary was expressing his personal view and there was no such thing as collective responsibility. Where did the principle of collective responsibility go, because each individual in this Government appears to be able to make his own statements on any subject; whether they are completely contradictory to those of other individuals is immaterial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> The most scandalous aspect of the present predicament of the building industry is in relation to unemployment. Last week the Taoiseach was asked the total number of building, contracting and works of construction workers registered at employment offices at 16th January, 1976, and I quote the reply from column 481, Volume 290, of the Official Report of the 4th May, 1976:</P>
    <P>The total number of persons in the building, contracting and works of construction industry on the live register at 16th January, 1976, was 24,699.</P>
    <P>If everything is as good in the construction industry as the Minister and his party try to tell us, how could we have 25,000 men unemployed in the building industry?  The only way you can have such a number unemployed is that the situation is as bad as we have been saying it is for the last 18 months, and it is getting worse every day.  We are not seeing the rise in employment we should see at this time of the year.  The sin of it is that the construction industry generally is the one industry which is able to take rapid growth.  With proper management by this Government, with proper investment in the building industry, with proper incentives given to workers and employers alike, you could see a dramatic increase in employment, practically over-night, in the building industry, because it is the one great industry that can rapidly expand and take up this great number of unemployed. This has always been the barometer of the health of an economy and particularly the Irish economy.  In the previous two Coalitions it was the rock on which they foundered, and this time again it is the rock on which this regime will founder.  For any Government to have in one sector of the economy alone nearly 25,000 people unemployed is an appalling indictment of their record, and I have no hesitation in recommending the Fianna Fáil motion to the House.</P>

      <P>When I was a young lad there were a couple of football <Col N="1198" /> teams down in my part of the country and one of them, to put it mildly, was very bad.  Nevertheless, they insisted on playing matches and competing in the championship each year, and they challenged the champions who were also in the area about four times a year, and in every case they were slaughtered.  As a young boy, I asked the trainer of the beaten team: &ldquo;What is wrong with your team? Why should they persist in going out and being hammered every time?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;The only answer I can give you is that they are gluttons for punishment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion, after listening, for the third time within 12 months, to the Fianna Fáil Party attempting to put across an attack on the housing programme, that they, too, must be gluttons for punishment.  If we got a worse record than that displayed by Fianna Fáil from any Government in Europe, I would like to be shown it.  The weakness of their arguments was displayed, first of all, by Deputy Faulkner&mdash;he is a decent man and I do not want to say anything hurtful about him&mdash;who made not the slightest effort to mount the attack that Deputy Burke has just been talking about.  He spoke for 40 minutes but he did not say anything.  There is very little to reply to in what he said.</P>
      <P>He was followed by Deputy Moore who struck on something which I think it might have been as well if he kept away from, that is, the alleged 400 dismissals by Dublin Corporation. There is no question of 400 people being dismissed.  He has got a document from an official of Dublin Corporation which says certain things may happen.  He is also aware, as is Deputy Burke, that Dublin Corporation have asked to see me to discuss the matter.  If Dublin Corporation have deputed Deputy Moore and Deputy Burke to raise the matter here in the House and to end it there, that is all right with me, but I believe the proper thing would have been to leave it until we discussed it to see if, in fact, there is any validity in the arguments being put across.  My information does not tally with what Deputy Moore has been saying here.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Deputy and I have read the document and, perhaps, I know as much about the matter as Deputy Moore or maybe a little bit more.  I would suggest it would have been as well to leave the matter until we discussed it, or do Dublin Corporation not want to come in to discuss the matter?  If they do not, then, perhaps, they can have their scare headlines and shout off the rooftops. It should be remembered that Dublin Corporation are responsible to the elected representatives and in the final analysis they are responsible to the Department of Local Government, and we can have the matter thrashed out at another level.  They can have it either way, but I do not accept that 400 people are going to be dismissed, and scare headlines like this, which are the hallmark of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Oliver Flanagan, last night talked about gloom and doom.  On a previous occasion in this House I pointed out that when Fianna Fáil discovered they were not coming back to office in a matter of months, every time one of them got on his feet he always tried to do whatever harm he could to everybody in the country, even if it happened to damage the country or annoved unfortunate people.  I know as much about working men as any Deputy on the far side of the House. If, for political purposes, they can damage them in any way, OK, that is great while it lasts but it does not last very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before replying to the debate I will take up a couple of points.  Deputy Burke was talking about Dublin County Council.  In 1973-74 Dublin County Council had 604 houses built; in 1974 in a nine-month period, 878, and in 1975, 1,036 or a total of 2,518 for three years of National Coalition Government.  In 1972-73 they had 878; in 1971-72 425, in 1970-71 278&mdash;a total of 1,581 for three years of Fianna Fáil Government.  For a final figure the total housing allocation for 1972-73 for County Dublin was £4.96 million and for 1975 it is £20.60 million.  Deputy Faulkner will have to teach some <Col N="1200" /> people how to count and how to add two and two, because obviously they are finding it difficult to do it over there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to central heating.  Without taking a rigid stand on its cost or whether the cost should rank for subsidy, I should like to remind Deputy Moore that the schemes on which the problem arises were foisted on the Dublin Corporation by the Fianna Fáil Administration.  The biggest problem arises in Ballymun where a totally alien system of habitation was foisted on the corporation by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government.  As long as I am Minister such a scheme will not be built again.  I do not think any member of Dublin Corporation would ever again see a Ballymun built in this city.  The same type of system exists in Swan's Nest, Cromcastle and Keogh Square. Again under the low cost project hundreds of corporation houses were built without fireplaces or chimneys. It is typical of Fianna Fáil Deputies to expect the National Coalition Government to carry the financial can for the disastrous policies which they carried out.</P>
    <P>The notice of motion deals with housing.  Let me point out that there appears to be great difficulty on the part of Fianna Fáil to differentiate between the building industry and the house building industry, because the house building industry is about 43 per cent of the entire building industry. While I know there is unemployment in the building industry, the house building industry is now producing more houses than ever before, very many more than under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I will give the figures in case Fianna Fáil have forgotten them.  Deputy Faulkner referred to the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, that the State should not build houses for people but should assist people to build houses and change the new house plan scheme.  Does Deputy Faulkner believe it is wrong to say that people should be encouraged to build their houses?  The Parliamentary Secretary offered an opinion and there was a good deal of validity in <Col N="1201" /> that opinion.  I would like to see and hope to encourage people building their own houses, but I did not go as far as Deputy Jack Lynch here in this House.  He on more than one occasion, the last that I am aware of being the 28th January, 1976, as reported in the Official Report, Vol. 287, columns 617 and 618, said:</P>
    <P>There are too many local authority houses being built as against houses owned by the people.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not say that.  Deputy J. Lynch said it.  I am quoting from the debate if anybody wants to challenge it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am giving the full sentence, which is:</P>
      <P>There are too many local authority houses being built as against houses owned by the people.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Lynch said he subsequently did not deny.  He raised it here on budget day and I quoted it to him then again.  What he said was that in relation to the 25,982 houses which were built last year 8,730 odd local authority houses were too many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner talked about the money that local authorities may spend on the maintenance and management of their houses in 1976. He said it is less in real terms than the amount spent in 1973-74 or 1972-73. Deputy Faulkner should check the facts.  There is limit on this expenditure. Circular H4/76 of 20th February, 1976, will allow an expenditure of £15.945 million on management and maintenance in 1976 representing an increase of 83 per cent on the expenditure in 1973-74, which is very reasonable; allowing of the increase of 58 per cent in the consumer price index between May, 1973 and February, 1976 and an increase of 76 per cent in the building <Col N="1202" /> costs between April, 1973 and January, 1976.  Deputy Faulkner was mixed up in that last night.  He referred to the fact that 71 per cent was greater than 75 per cent.  I know it was a slip of the tongue, but if he looks at the record he will see that he did say that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>I did not say the Deputy thought that but he did say it.  He did not mean to say it.  The Deputy's charge becomes even less sustainable when the position is compared with that in 1972-73.  The limits imposed in 1976 represent an increase of 124 per cent on the expenditure of 1972-73 compared with an increase of 99 per cent in building costs between 1st April, 1972 and 1st January, 1976.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore spoke at length on the problems of housing construction in the case of Dublin Corporation and in particular about the danger that some of the corporation's maintenance staff might become unemployed. Dublin Corporation are coming in to see me, I understand, and we will discuss the matter then.  I do not believe 400 men are going to be unemployed. It is unfair and unjust that anybody, either an official or a member of Dublin Corporation, should make a statement which will cause fear among a number of people without first checking the facts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Dublin Deputies pressed the point made in the subsidy circular of 20th February last that some local authorities have been undertaking ambitious schemes of structural improvements in recent years.  Fortunately the number of cases in which local authorities have acted unreasonably is not large.  However, I mention one instance in which a local authority prepared a scheme <Col N="1203" /> of improvements to some of their older houses.  It was estimated at £2.5 million most of which would come from the Exchequer.  The average provision for maintenance and repair of the entire housing estate of the same local authority would average £190,000 in each of the three years ended 31st March, 1973.  I intend to issue a circular letter to local authorities about improvement work on dwellings when I receive information sought from local authorities last February.</P>
    <P>A reference was made here, whether in order or not I do not know, to rates. I make two points about rates. First, Fianna Fáil three days before the last election announced that they proposed to take rates off housing.  They did not say whether they were doing it off houses plus, they merely said housing.  They did not know themselves whether they meant farm houses or city houses, and therefore I would not know.  That was in February, 1973.  In November, 1972 they had issued a very elaborate document in which they referred to the fact that their comment on rates was that an inquiry should be made into alternative methods of paying rates. Nothing else.  In the following general election they made no reference whatever in their election manifesto to the matter of taking rates from houses. There is a Deputy in this House who had, it was alleged, 200,000 copies of a document ridiculing the suggestion of the Coalition that they would be able to take health and housing off rates, and he was very mad indeed, and rightly so, when the Fianna Fáil Party advised him to burn the whole lot.  I hope he had not to pay for them.</P>
    <P>It is a little bit much to hear Fianna Fáil talking now about what they propose to do.  I would like to add further that but for the fact that there was a change of Government and that health and housing were taken from rates, rates would have been on average £4 in the £ more in every area in this country.  Fianna Fáil could not have operated the system they were talking about.  The Government's decision to restrict new house <Col N="1204" /> grants to persons who were eligible for reconstruction grants from local authorities came in for ill-informed criticisms in the course of the debate, and that decision has been described as a severe blow to persons in the lower income brackets buying modest homes.  The criticism comes badly from the party which previously alleged that the grants were insignificant and were merely builder's pocket money.  Indeed, on 28th October last, Deputy Callanan asserted that the grant would not be sufficient even to buy the nails needed to build a new house.  Admittedly, after that when it was stopped the Fianna Fáil Party said they would do away with the building industry although according to one member of their party it would not buy the nails needed.  Incidentally, spokesmen of Fianna Fáil who are going around the country telling people that the reconstruction grants have been done away with should be advised that they are wasting their time.  Reconstruction grants for houses in this country have not been changed and there is no intention of changing them.  One third of all the certificates of value issued by the Department last month for grant type houses have approved prices in excess of £12,000 a house.  Prices between £15,000 and £19,000 for grant type houses in schemes in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Mayo and elsewhere throughout the country have been approved since March, 1976.  Can any Deputy honestly claim that the withholding of a £275 or even a £375 grant for such houses is going to inflict hardship on the purchasers?</P>
    <P>In so far as persons with limited incomes buying more reasonably priced houses are concerned, I want to emphasise that new house grants will continue to be allocated and paid to persons eligible on income or valuation basis for reconstruction grants from local authorities.  This is not an unreasonably restrictive condition as the number of reconstruction grants paid in 1975 represented more than 60 per cent of the number of State grants paid in that year.  I am satisfied that the substantial incentive of rates remission and exemption <Col N="1205" /> from stamp duty which will continue to apply to grant-type houses will be sufficient to maintain the level of output of such houses.  Unlike the fixed grant, the amount of exemption is constantly rising and now amounts to about £1,100 on an average house.  In addition, house purchasers benefit from the remission of income tax on the interest element on repayments of a mortgage loan and on insurance premiums on a house purchase policy.</P>
    <P>The maximum grant of £275 was introduced in 1948 and was intended to stimulate private housing at a time when, under Fianna Fáil, the annual output was less than 1,000 houses per year.  Last year the corresponding figure was nearly 16,000.  In these times of pressure on the public purse the continued payment of new house grants on a free for all basis irrespective of income could not in my opinion be justified.  Predictably also Deputy Faulkner repeated once again his criticism of the Government on the grounds that the loan and income limits for SDA loans have not been increased and the already highly subsidised interest payable by borrowers has not been cut to an even more uneconomic level.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady demand for loans on the present basis and local authorities will advance about £40 million under schemes this year compared with less than £11 million in 1972-1973. Equally important is the fact that if the loan limit was increased to £6,000 and the income limit to £3,000 local authorities would be called on to advance not £40 million but nearly £100 million in 1976.  Deputies who have been demanding revisions of the present limits should say whether they would welcome the necessary additional State borrowing or taxation to meet this extra cost or else they should specify the public services which they wish to cut back in order to divert this huge amount of capital to local authorities loans schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner talked about cutting back on schemes which were not more important.  Perhaps when Deputy Faulkner is replying, we could have a suggestion as to what schemes he thinks should be cut back.  Would he tell us who he wants sacked and <Col N="1206" /> where he thinks the money should not be paid?  Does he have an idea as to how these huge sums of money could be saved?  One mouth of Fianna Fáil will say: &ldquo;We must cut back on public expenditure&rdquo; and another mouth will say: &ldquo;Spend more&rdquo;.  They were not anxious to spend when the budget votes were being taken.  I notice that on each occasion they walked into the &ldquo;no&rdquo; lobby.  They made no effort to try to produce the money which they consider even now not to be enough to deal with the problem.  They should put the money where their mouth is for a change and let us know whether or not they are prepared to vote for increased taxation in order to produce this money or tell us where they think the money can be found.  Deputy Faulkner criticised the interest rate of 12½ per cent charged on local authority loans. I want to put on record that this rate, which will remain fixed for the 30 years duration of the loan, is being subsidised to the tune of 4 per cent by the Exchequer which has to pay more than 16 per cent of some of the capital raised for the local loans fund.  It compares with an effective rate of up to 20 per cent charged by, and readily paid to, hire purchase firms for consumer items which begin to depreciate in value from the date of purchase, unlike a house which continues to appreciate all the time.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite strive to give the impression that persons of modest means have to borrow house purchase loans from local authorities or else do without, and take their place on the local authorities waiting list.  In fact, this loan scheme is only one source of mortgage finance for the private housing market even for borrowers of limited incomes.  This scheme took on a special importance in 1973 and 1974 because of the temporary scarcity at the time of adequate mortgage finance from other sources.  To cope with that situation, the Government increased the capital provision for SDA loans from less than £10 million in 1972-73 to £21.74 million in 1973-74 and to £27.32 million in the nine months to the 31st December, 1974.  Last year £45 million was provided.  At the same time, to stimulate investment with and lending <Col N="1207" /> by building societies the Government introduced the special temporary interest subsidy for the societies and arranged special back-up loans for them to a total of £20 million from the commercial banks.  The position in regard to mortgage finance for private housing has now changed so radically that further special support for either the SDA schemes or for building societies is not needed.</P>
    <P>The inflow of cash into the building societies since early last year has been so high that they were able to advance £65 million in house purchase loans during 1975.  This is the highest amount that they have ever paid in any year and represents an increase of over 50 per cent on the £40 million lent in 1974.  Loans are now more freely available from the societies than at any time in the past three years even though the societies have been approving more than double the number of loans in recent months than in 1974.  It is gratifying that the demand for loans continues to be as strong as ever.  I confidently expect that the societies will advance substantially more than £80 million in the current year and we are told that there is a shortage of money for private housing.  The house purchase loans scheme arranged by the Government with the banks is also going extremely well.  Already the banks have approved loans totalling £13 million leaving £27 million available for further approvals. Building society finance is much more freely available and when the bank scheme is properly in operation I am hopeful that will diminish the tremendous financial burden the Government and the local authorities have had to shoulder in order to ensure that in so far as it was feasible the local authorities could cover the gaps created during the time when mortgage finance from other agencies was scarce.  In so far as the overall position regarding house purchase loan finance for the year is concerned, I estimate that more than £150 million will be available during 1976 as compared with £61 million in 1972-73.  I am glad to say that the indications are that all of it will be taken up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> Deputy Faulkner wanted to know since I was taking credit for the upsurge in building society credit in 1976, would I take responsibility for what happened in 1974.  That was the year in which there was a continuous cry of mortgage famine from the Opposition.  At every opportunity they said that the building societies had no money to lend.  In that year the societies paid out a total of £39.6 million. This was due in the main to the unprecedented measure taken by the Government in 1973 in making available to the societies a special subsidy. I have no hesitation in accepting responsibility for the fact that the societies were able at, perhaps, the most difficult time in their history to make a very substantial contribution to the housing programme in that year with the aid of that subsidy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner also said a rather peculiar thing for somebody who apparently believes so much in private enterprise.  He said that the Minister has not the right to throw over responsibility for the private sector to building societies and the banks.  In other words, on the one hand he is saying: &ldquo;There is too much money being made available&rdquo; and on the other: &ldquo;Why should the banks and the building societies be asked to provide some of this money?&rdquo; Deputy Faulkner has a very short memory because, quite obviously, he has forgotten that Fianna Fáil provided less than £11 million for SDA loans in 1972-73.  This year £42 million is being provided.  The initiative taken by the Government last year in getting the two major associated banks to make house purchase loans was welcomed by representatives of the building industry and the general public. Since Fianna Fáil left office the Government have demonstrated very clearly that they are prepared to make good any short-fall in funds from private lending institutions in order to ensure that our housing target is reached.</P>
    <P>A number of things seem to have been missed out completely by the Fianna Fáil Party in this motion.  I could not understand why they should have decided to introduce it.  They <Col N="1209" /> must have known that they were on a very sticky wicket, the Dublin Corporation representatives in particular. The people who three years ago were given only about £6 million for local authority housing last year got £12 million and this year got £23.7 million for the purpose of building houses.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Moore not told anything at corporation meetings?  Is he not aware that this is the situation so far as Dublin Corporation are concerned? He came in and said to me that he wanted to know would extra money be made available.  I should like to tell Deputy Moore that £11 million extra was made available this year.  Did no one tell him about it?  We have built more local authority houses than ever before&mdash;8,700 odd last year.  Despite that, the land bank is growing.  Dublin Corporation officials have told me that they are perfectly satisfied that they now have three years advance land for building.  I have also told local authorities that if they are not able to carry on, if they require land for a three year programme, they are entitled to make arrangements to purchase the land.</P>
    <P>In spite of that, we have this codology carried on by the Opposition in an attempt to give the impression that they are the people who built houses.  They built a very small number of very bad local authority houses.  The low cost schemes which they built in the last few years of their term of office are a disgrace to any Government.  They nearly ruined very many respectable builders, people who have come to me and said that it was not their fault that the houses were bad.  Deputy Moore talked about the pre-cast schemes, that these could not have anything but central heating.  He should go and see where we have provided chimneys and fireplaces in some of these schemes that were built under Fianna Fáil and which were a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to purchase schemes.  With the permission of the Government, I changed the renting scheme and the purchase scheme for local authority houses in 1973 and <Col N="1210" /> people are now purchasing their own houses.  As against about 600 houses being bought a few years ago over 30,000 houses were being bought in the last 12 months.  Deputy Moore does not seem to understand that. The Deputies on Dublin Corporation do not seem to know that this is the situation.</P>
    <P>The question of the claw-back is a big thing with some of them.  They say you have no right to have a claw-back. I want to say quite plainly that a deputation came to me from the Dublin City Commissioners.  I had reinstated the Dublin City Commissioners. Deputy Moore was one of those present.  He said nothing. As one of the items on its agenda that deputation asked me to include a claw-back for a five year period, as did the Tenants Association when negotiating with me for the new rental scheme.</P>
    <P>As far as the purchase scheme is concerned, people are buying houses they can afford.  People are trying to saddle me with what Fianna Fáil did with the purchase scheme.  I am not having that.  If I can make some arrangement I will do so to try to take some of the burden off people's backs but not now.  I am happy that those who are at present tenants of a corporation or a county council can buy their houses at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>To put down a motion such as this and waste the time of the House is a gimmick which Fianna Fáil must be as sick of as I am.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly interested in the football stories of the Minister.  I learned as a young boy of someone who went around puffing and blowing about what he was going to do and who never had the courage to do it.  While I do not feel in the least deflated by the Minister's speech I do feel frightened, not by the content of the speech but by the fact that the Minister has once again come out with the same old reply.  There is no recognition of the crisis in which the building industry is involved, no recognition of the unemployment situation in the industry, of the very large number of building <Col N="1211" /> workers who are now out of employment or of the fact that there is a continuing increase in the number on the live register related to the building industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown no recognition of the fact that the building industry is the one industry which could provide jobs quickly if properly directed and properly financed.  We are all interested in getting new industry into the country and are pleased to see it but a new industry starts with a relatively low number of employees and takes a considerable time to reach its full potential.  The building industry could provide jobs quickly.  Under this Government there is a continuous fall in the number employed in the industry.</P>
      <P>It frightens me that the Minister refuses to face up to the facts and that the Government refuse to face up to the facts.  These facts are not being publicised by this party alone. They are referred to in statements made by the Congress of Trade Unions, by the Federated Union of Employers and by many and varied responsible bodies and by quite a number of the Minister's colleagues on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to the accusation made by the Minister and by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan and by Deputy O'Brien that we are attempting to spread gloom and doom throughout the country.  We could not do that, for the very simple reason that there is gloom and doom throughout the country, basically because of mismanagement by this Coalition Government. There is gloom and doom among young people who will be leaving school very shortly and for whom there is no prospect of jobs. There is gloom and doom among the parents of these children, gloom and doom among those who have lost employment, particularly among those who have lost employment in the building industry.  That gloom will not be lightened for those building workers who were hopeful that at last the Minister would face up to the very serious situation and would endeavour <Col N="1212" /> to do something about it so that they could get their jobs back.  Instead, the Minister gave the same old litany we have heard on many occasions in this House and building workers are no closer to regaining their employment.</P>
    <P>There is gloom and doom amongst industrialists who are frightened while this Government are in office to invest money in industry and thus provide jobs.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House had hoped that the Minister would at this stage face up to the situation and endeavour to convince the Government that it is necessary to provide more finance for this vital industry. Having listened to the Minister, I am afraid we have undertaken an impossible task, at least while this Government are in office.  If only the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary would recognise that there is a problem which must be tackled at least some of our anxiety would be allayed. If we could be assured of the Minister's concern we would assume that he could endeavour to overcome the problem.  At present all we are getting is a litany from him and this is of no help to those in need of employment.</P>
    <P>I repeat that there is less money being made available for housing in real terms this year than there was last year.  Last evening the Parliamentary Secretary quoted from a brief but he must have had considerable difficulty in choosing the most suitable figures from that brief.  He told us that in 1975 £112 million was made available for housing while the figure for this year is £122 million.  He asked whether we agreed that this was a worthwhile increase.  If we were to take an inflation rate of 16 per cent and this is very much lower than what the figure is likely to be now, it would be necessary this year to make available £130 million if we were to equal the amount made available last year.  But if we were to take the more realistic figure of a 20 per cent inflation rate, it would be necessary, to achieve the same equality, to provide this year £134.5 million.  Therefore, it will be seen that the money provided this year falls far short of what is needed.  I have said both here and <Col N="1213" /> outside on a number of occasions that to refer to amounts of money in these inflationary times in terms of comparison with moneys spent previously is a useless exercise.  There is no way in which we can judge accurately what is the situation unless we have a guideline in relation to inflation.</P>

      <P>Equally, I could ask the Minister whether it is futile to refer to numbers of unemployed.  We find from the document issued by Dublin Corporation in relation to housing estate maintenance that in 1972-73 there were 941 men employed on this work which cost £2,456,044, that in 1973-74 the figures were 957 and £2,782,000 respectively, that in the nine-month period from the 1st April to 31st December, 1974, the figures were 901 and £2,484,000 respectively, that in 1975 the figures were 934 and £4,662,000 respectively while in 1976 the figures were 965 and £6,831,000 respectively.  The point I wish to make is that the numbers employed on these services and schemes remained practically constant but that the cost increased from £2,500,000 to almost £7 million.  If the Minister were to say to the people of Dublin that he is giving £7 million for this work compared with £2,500,000 in 1971-72, they would think they were doing well but we must remember that the employment aspect remains at the same level.  There is no point in referring to millions of pounds if one does not have regard to inflation rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was referring a few moments ago to a speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, the Minister said that the Parliamentary Secretary was concerned with the question of having people build their own houses.  The Minister said that he, too, was very anxious to encourage people to build their own houses but is there any such encouragement for those people when the Minister has removed the grant of £325 which was available to people whose level of income is more than <Col N="1214" /> the level applicable to supplementary grants and when is he increasing the interest rate on SDA loans to a fantastic 12½ per cent?  Also, he has refused to increase the maximum loan from £4,500, a figure set in May, 1973. He has refused, too, to increase the qualifying income limit for SDA loans from £2,350, a figure set also in May, 1973.  Indeed, he has done everything possible to ensure that those who wish to build their own houses will not be able to do so.  Consequently, either those people must go on the long list for local authority houses or approach the building societies which means that they will have to borrow more money than if they got the SDA loan since, as I said last night, houses built by means of SDA loans cost on average £8,000 while the comparative figure in so far as the building societies are concerned is £11,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people who apply for SDA loans because they can only afford that type of loan but who are not successful are being pushed on to the building societies.  This will mean that in the future they will go from crisis to crisis in an effort to keep up payments.  The State has a responsibility to look after those people but by his actions the Minister is ensuring that fewer people will either seek or qualify for SDA loans and in that way he is saving money to the Exchequer.  Unfortunately, this will be done at the expense of those who will have the greatest difficulty in repaying building society loans.  For those who cannot get a loan from either source, there is the prospect of waiting until Tibb's Eve for a council house.</P>
      <P>The Minister was sarcastic in his remarks about our policy in regard to the removal of rates from dwelling houses.  I assure the Minister that our policy in this regard remains and that when we are returned to office we will remove rates from dwelling houses.</P>

      <P>It will not be so long and that is why the Minister is so perturbed about this motion.  Had we been <Col N="1215" /> returned to office in 1973 we could have removed those rates and charged the loss to buoyancy but there is very little buoyancy left in the Exchequer today.  Rates are an intolerable burden on the people.  I reiterate on behalf of this party that they will be removed from private dwellings when we return to office.</P>

      <P>In referring to loans and grants the Minister stated that there was no point in increasing the SDA loans from the £4,500 level and said that there was a wonderful demand for them.  Yesterday I pointed out the facts in relation to Dublin County Council where last year there were applications from 1,262 people for SDA loans, whereas this year the number is only 539.  In Drogheda there were loan applications in the first three months last year, January to March, from 29 people.  This year seven such applications were received in the same period.  If that is the way in which <Col N="1216" /> the Minister thinks he will rehouse people who have the courage and initiative to look for loans to build houses, it is a poor look out for them.</P>
      <P>I will come back briefly to housing maintenance.  We pointed out in the course of questions in the Dáil and on other occasions, including this debate, that the money made available for maintenance is not sufficient.  We see the result of it in Dublin where the corporation have not got enough money for maintenance and there is a strong likelihood that 400 people will consequently lose employment. At a time when the unemployment lists are higher than ever, when the country is in such a serious state, particularly the building industry in which more and more workers are losing their jobs daily, it is a disgrace that 400 more people in Dublin will have to line up outside the labour exchanges.  I recommend the motion very strongly and I am sure I will get support from several Deputies in the Government benches.</P>
