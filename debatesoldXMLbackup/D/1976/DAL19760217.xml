    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total number of unemployed persons registered in the Dublin area; and the approximate number of last year's schoolleavers in that area who failed to obtain employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons on the live register at the four Dublin employment exchanges on 6th February, 1976, was 33,702.  The figure includes 1,914 systematic short-time workers.  The information requested in respect of schoolleavers is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand that.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary not tell the House the number of boys who claimed unemployment benefit? I am aware this benefit is not paid to girls but my estimation is that about 50,000 boys are involved.  I should <Col N="2" /> like to be told that this figure is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the unemployment benefit recipients have to be working for half a year and have 26 stamps before they draw benefit. The assistance recipients can get assistance from the age of 18 but they do not normally register if they are looking for work for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They can draw assistance without stamps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They can but the information I have is that they do not normally register when looking for work for the first time.  Although I accept that there are schoolleavers not at work the question the Deputy asked does not allow me to answer without the resources of the Central Statistics Office in the way they produce their unemployment figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the most <Col N="3" /> unsatisfactory nature of the reply I wish to give notice of my intention to raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will state the following details of his recent visit to the United States: (a) the purpose of his visit, (b) the meetings held by him while there and the purpose of such meetings and (c) whether the cost of the trip was met by the Irish Exchequer or by the ILO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of my visit was to indicate to the US Government our point of view that US withdrawal from the ILO would severely weaken the effectiveness of that organisation. Previous to the visit the Director General of the ILO had asked member states to make representations to Washington in an effort to convince the US of the difficulties that would be caused by their withdrawal.  To give an idea of the extent of the difficulties, I might mention that the US contributes 25 per cent of the ILO budget.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to the consistent policy of support for the ILO pursued by all Irish Governments over the years if we failed to make an effort to prevent the breaking up of the ILO that would follow implementation of the US threat.</P>
      <P>While in the US I met the US Secretary for Labour and senior officials of his Department.  I also met Mr. George Meany, President of the AFL/CIO, a body which nominates the employees' representatives of the US delegation to the ILO Conference. I also had an informal meeting with the heads and senior officials of Irish semi-State bodies in the US.</P>
      <P>The cost of the visit was met by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what other Ministers of State visited the US on a similar mission? I should like to know the name of <Col N="4" /> the Secretary of State met by him on that occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a complete list of those who visited the US from the EEC countries to make such representations but I am aware that my colleague, the German Minister for Labour, Herr Walter Arendt, made similar representations in Washington.  The American Secretary of Labour was Mr. Dunlop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the German Minister visited the US or did he make his representations by correspondence?  Did any other country send a representative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the complete list but I can assure the Deputy that the German Minister for Labour visited the US on a mission similar to mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true to say that the Secretary of State for Labour our Minister met resigned the day after their meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Minister cannot be blamed for that resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister believes that his visit, because of the resignation of the Secretary of State for Labour, was worthwhile?  Would he agree that the ILO should have borne the cost of the visit rather than our Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not responsible for or able to say when resignations in the US Government will occur.  At the time the arrangements for my visit were completed there was no likelihood that this would occur.  I should like to assure the Deputy that the Secretary of State for Labour was accompanied by senior officials.  The representations made will be conveyed through that Department on a continuous basis.  In fact, President Ford made it clear subsequently that he is dispatching to each of the EEC countries the American Ambassador to Yugoslavia who will convey the present US approach to their membership of the ILO.  We will have continuing <Col N="5" /> discussions with that ambassador when he comes here.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself will meet him and impress upon him the anxiety of the Government that the US should continue membership of the ILO, to the effectiveness of which this Government pay a great deal of serious attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any indication of the result of his visit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a serious and very complicated problem.  Secretary of State Kissinger's note to the Director General of the ILO makes it clear that the US will give a period before they carry out the implementation of their intention mentioned in the letter of withdrawal from the ILO.  The Irish Government are anxious, like other countries in Europe, to ensure that the United States are not forced to carry out that threat.  We are awaiting the visit of their Yugoslavian Ambassador who was charged by President Ford with this mission of speaking to their friends in Europe in an effort to ensure that the International Labour Organisation in their general policy did not depart too much from what the Americans would like to see included in the policy of that organisation.  The Kissinger note, the threat of withdrawal, was related to the seating of the PLO at the last ILO conference. It is a very complicated question.  If the Deputy wants any further information on this whole question I will be happy to provide him with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to say what the outcome has been or does he think it will be a fruitful mission?  What means have the United States used to convey their representations? Have the Americans paid their subscription to the ILO?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Americans have paid their subscription.  The effect of their withdrawal would be that this would cease.  In effect it would change overnight the whole composition of the ILO.  It is possible that, at the coming meeting of the Economic Ministers of the OECD in March in Paris, this will again be discussed by member states of the Community.  It is not alone in <Col N="6" /> our interests but in the interests of members of the Community states in general that the United States should not withdraw from the ILO.  The purpose of my visit was to add Ireland's voice to the general European request that they should remain within the organisation.</P>

      <P>The Chair has allowed a series of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of our economic situation, would the Minister not consider that it would have been advisable to have made a written submission and allowed our Ambassador in America to make a verbal contribution on this question?  His junket to America would therefore have been unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it was possible for the Minister to make a written submission and for our Ambassador to make a verbal submission. It is a tourist we have, not a Minister for Labour.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Employment Premium Scheme.</Title>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will now amend the employment premium scheme to include persons who were not previously employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The premium employment programme was introduced to encourage the re-employment in agriculture and in manufacturing industry of workers who have lost their jobs as a result of the current recession.  The conditions as to eligibility are formulated to achieve this objective.  The programme is not designed to help persons who were not previously employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of persons seeking employment for the first time is a separate one and is being tackled independently of the programme.  A <Col N="7" /> scheme to meet the unemployment problems of those seeking their first job is already in operation.  The community youth training programme provides employment and training on socially desirable projects for schoolleavers and other unemployed young persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there are many instances where firms who have reduced their work force to the minimum in order to keep afloat could do with some technical expertise from young persons leaving second level education?  They are not given any assistance in taking on these people.  I am talking about persons who possess certain technical qualifications which would be useful to firms who have reduced their work force to the minimum. They are not permitted to take on these people because they cannot afford to meet the cost in the circumstances. Would he not consider extending the employment premium scheme to cases of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The premium employment scheme includes any categories the employer wishes to take on in addition to the figure at the start of the programme.  It is not confined to any particular grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to persons who have just left colleges of technology and are seeking their first appointment.  They are very much required by firms who cannot afford to carry their present work force owing to the load of overheads heaped on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The premium employment programme is already in operation.  In addition there is the community youth training programme. In that we seek to bring into socially desirable employment young people who have not previously been employed.  In this programme we are assisted from the European Social Fund together with our own finances. Our immediate target is to get 1,000 young people into employment under the scheme.  Following its success or otherwise, we intend to make a <Col N="8" /> decision on whether it should be extended to other parts of the country. It is in operation in the eastern region already.  The necessity is to get suitable projects identified for implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to be aware of the point I am trying to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the existing schemes.  There may be validity in what the Deputy says but it does not come under the heading of any of the operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in touch with the Minister's Department on the question of firms who wish to acquire some technological expertise in order to make up for the laying off of unskilled personnel they could not afford to carry.  They could not get the premium unless they took back some of the people they had laid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we are having repetition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Deputy wishes to make is for such firms to take on those who have not been employed before but who have a certain technical excellence.  We have no such scheme in operation at present.  I will certainly have a look at the possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How many people have been re-employed under the premium employment programme in the field of agriculture?  How many people are employed in the community youth project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These are separate questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have four schemes in operation under the community youth training programme. We have one in Bray, one in Dún Laoghaire and two in Dundalk.  I have not got the exact figure of those employed under that scheme with me. Of course, it is readily available.  Our target is for 1,000 young people to come under that scheme.  In the premium employment programme the numbers employed in the field of agriculture are very few.  Again I have <Col N="9" /> not got the exact figure.  The figures are available.  I would say less than 100 out of agriculture.  That is certainly true.  The total numbers employed under the premium employment programme are approaching 5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that an immediate broadening of this programme is called for?  We have not achieved even half the target originally set by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware from the details of the scheme that it relies on the co-operation of the employers.  Those employers who are ready to take on extra workers over and above those they had at the commencement of the scheme last summer, those who are ready to co-operate with the Government in taking on such workers, will get from us a subsidy of £12 per worker re-employed.  The main objective of that programme is to get those who have been declared redundant as a result of the present recession back into employment.  We must do everything we can to bring home to employers the advantage there is in the scheme, always realising that it calls for the co-operation of such employers before we can reach our target.  With a pick-up in economic activity this spring, it should be possible even at this late stage to realise our target of 10,000 people back to work under the premium employment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Broaden the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That would defeat the purpose of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the lack of success in this scheme is due to the fact that its terms are so narrow?  Would he not agree that a factory in Newbridge which employs 250 men and which is about to close down could only get a premium for every man employed in excess of 250?  That is no use in the present economic climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>After great consideration the scheme was directed to <Col N="10" /> getting people who are unemployed back to work.  It is not a question of widening the scheme.  It is a question of continuous representations to the employers to avail of the scheme.  We must continue to do that.  It is too early yet to say we will not succeed in reaching the target of 10,000.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not accept that there is any undue delay on the part of the Land Commission in making payments under the farmers' retirement scheme.  Where lands are sold to the Land Commission under the scheme the purchase money together with the premium is paid over on the closing of the sale.  In the case of lands being sold or leased direct to farmers whose development plans provide for additional land the premium is paid on receipt of satisfactory evidence that the transaction has been completed in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.  As to the annuity the scheme provides that this is payable monthly in arrear commencing on the first day of the second month following completion of the sale or lease proceedings.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any particular case in mind where he considers that there has been undue delay by the Land Commission in processing an application&mdash;as distinct from making a payment&mdash;under the scheme I shall have it investigated if he supplies me with details.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy asked about the delay in making payments.  As distinct from processing, eight cases have been completed in Donegal.  They are as follows: in the first possession was handed over on 11th March, 1975, and the first payment of pension was made on 30th April, 1975; in the second case possession was handed over on 11th April, 1975, and the first payment was made on 10th June, 1975; in the third case possession was handed over on 18th April, 1975, and the first payment was made on 1st July, 1975; in the next case possession was handed over on 30th May, 1975, and the first payment was made on 1st July, 1975; in the next case possession was handed over on 30th June, 1975, and the first payment was made on 7th August, 1975; in the next case possession was handed over on 7th July, 1975, and the first payment was made on 29th August, 1975; in the seventh case possession was handed over on 5th November, 1975, and the first payment was made on 31st December, 1975; in the eighth case, possession was handed over on 21st November, 1975, and the first payment was made on 31st December, 1975.  I think the Deputy will agree there was no undue delay in any of those cases.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I can tell the Deputy the date of application in the eight cases and I will elaborate.  I shall give the eight dates one after the other.  They are: 23rd May, 1974; 15th July, 1974; 27th May, 1974; 15th May, 1974; 13th May, 1974; 8th August, 1974; 23rd September, 1974; 14th August, 1974. I agree with the Deputy that there are three stages in the completion of each case.  There is the application and there is the necessary investigation to establish whether the applicant is eligible to participate in this scheme.  When this is established, there are negotiations as to price and they can be prolonged.  When the price is fixed the lawyers come in to it and they are not always the fastest people in the world.  Apart from that, in many cases the title may not have been looked at for a very long time; it may have changed hands a few times without it being investigated. When the title is cleared the sale is completed, the purchase money is paid and the annuity is paid.  If any Deputy puts down a specific question about a specific case I am prepared to go into it with him and, if there is delay, I will tell him where the delay lies and who is responsible.</P>

I am satisfied there is no undue delay on the part of the Land Commission. Some 110 cases have been completed, involving 4,463 acres of land and £1,000,263.  A price has been agreed on in 223 cases, involving almost 10,000 acres.  I am satisfied that wherever the delay is it is not in the Land Commission.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Law of the Sea Conference which will be resumed next month the Commission of the European Communities has initiated a review of the common fisheries policy. This covers, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of reserving parts of the 200-mile economic zone which the conference is expected to approve for local fishermen. On 6th January the Commission submitted to the Council a working document on the changes required in the common fisheries policy as a result of the introduction of 200-mile zones. This document was intended as a basis for discussion by the member states of the problems posed by a new régime and to enable the Commission to ascertain their attitudes with a view to preparing definitive proposals.</P>
      <P>The document has been considered in the Committee of Permanent Representatives and in the Council of Ministers on 9th February.  The Commission, in the light of views expressed by member states, will shortly be putting forward formal proposals for consideration by the Council.  In the discussions, we made a case for the establishment of a substantial exclusive band reserved for Irish boats within the 200-mile zone together with a preferential quota in the remainder of the zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary state when this review is likely to take place?  Does he think the case being made is sufficiently strong to enable us to extend our fishing limits?  He must be aware that the fishing industry is in dire straits at present; he must know that only 3½ per cent of all the fish caught off the south-east coast is taken by Irish boats and that the figure for the entire coastline is 9 per cent.  If we are not able to extend our fishing limits, I am afraid the Irish fishing fleet will not be able to survive against the competition from the bigger and <Col N="18" /> better equipped boats of the other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The review has already begun.  I want to make it clear to the House that the reason the review is being brought forward so far is because the Law of the Sea Conference, which is virtually a universal conference, is expected to agree on a 200-mile economic zone for all countries and to draw up a convention that will be signed by all of those who have attended the Law of the Sea Conference.  That will mean a reduction in the fishing waters available to the Community as a community.  It is only right to warn the Deputy and the House that although we have made the strongest case possible, and will continue to do so, for the maximum extent of fishing waters we are doing it in a situation in which all the countries of the Community are having their traditional fishing waters reduced.  This is because the fleets which formally travelled a good distance from their own shores&mdash;the Dutch, German, French and British &mdash;will now be squeezed and, as a consequence of the conference, they will find themselves confined to a smaller strip of water.  We will be looking for an extension of our rights at the very time when they will be looking for special treatment.  The Deputy and the House can be assured that we are making the strongest case we can but it is not the most favourable moment to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The richest herring grounds in Europe are off Dunmore East.  This year the catches were down by 17 per cent and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to bring to the Minister's attention the need for special consideration for this matter in any negotiations that take place. Will the fishermen's organisations be represented at the Law of the Sea Conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the second part of the question first, the fishermen's organisations will not be presented specifically&mdash;there is no provision, as I told the House two weeks ago, in the rules of the conference for the attendance of fishermen's <Col N="19" /> organisations and observers, but of course they will be very fully consulted before and during the conference. The Government are very well aware of the features of the fish resources to which the Deputy referred, and to the share taken by Irish fishermen, and one of the main planks on which we are resting our case for special treatment is that there are large areas particularly in the west in which the sea is the main natural resource, which is not the case in regard to other nationalities with whom we will be competing.</P>

Tá sé i gceist freisin, i gcás na limistéar Gaeltachta atá i bhfad amach ó na stiúideonna i gCorca Dhuibhne agus i dTír Chonaill, freastal níos iomláine a dhéanamh ar na ceantair imeallacha mar An Rinn, Múscraí agus Cléire ó dheas agus deisceart Thír Chonaill, mar shampla Cill Chárthaigh agus Gleann Colmcille ó thuaidh.  Tá freastal níos iomláine ar na hoileáin i gceist chomh maith.</P>
      <P>San tréimhse leath-bhliana atá imithe tharainn, tá méid áirithe déanta sna limistéir éagsúla ar bhonn trialach. Ar ndóigh, ní miste a mheabhrú go bhfuil costas nach beag ag baint leis an bhfreastal seo.  Murab ionann agus cláracha RTE, a ndéantar riar mhór díobh i stiúideonna, tá cuid mhaith taistil ag baint le cláracha Radio na Gaeltachta.  Cosnóidh sé go leor airgid bhreise an freastal níos iomláine atá i gceist ag Radio na Gaeltachta a chur i gcrích.  Tá RTE ag féachaint conas is fearr chur chun na hoibre sin, ag cur san áireamh an ghéarchéim airgeadais atá ar an eagraíocht faoi láthair.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether departmental inspectors were ordered to vacate the vacant lot at Parnell Road, Dublin, under the threat of suspension shortly before the suspended members of the POEWU were ordered to park on the same site; and the <Col N="21" /> length of time that passed from the time his Department agreed to provide toilet and canteen facilities at the Walkinstown Avenue site and the time of the first suspensions two days before Christmas.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The toilet and canteen facilities required for the staff to be headquartered at the Walkinstown Avenue depot were settled between the Department's local management and the union branches concerned in May, 1974.  Apart from some minor alterations and the supply of some furniture, both of which could be quickly arranged, the facilities were already available and the early transfer of the staff was proposed accordingly.  The branch representatives, however, informed local management that they would not be prepared to recommend the transfer to the staff until overall development plans for the site were produced.  The architect's plans for the development became available in December, 1974, and were given to the branch representatives.  However, the latter informed local management that they were not prepared to consider these plans, apparently because members of another staff organisation had been allowed to occupy, temporarily, part of the vacant accommodation. That temporary occupation ceased in December, 1975, following protracted negotiations.</P>
      <P>I may add that this information was given by me in the House when this matter was raised on the Adjournment during the course of the recent unofficial strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In the present financial position of the Department the suggestion in the question could be favourably considered only on the basis of increasing the charges for busy hour telephone calls, the bulk of which are made for business purposes.  No. action is, therefore, proposed at present but the question of adjustment of charges as between busy and non-busy periods is under consideration by my Department with a view to possible future changes in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in other countries where the differential has been increased downwards, particularly in the UK, it has worked very successfully to give a better service to business people during business hours?  Surely the Minister is not serious that after all he has taken out of the postal service by way of recent increased charges, he can only adjust this thing upwards in order to create a differential?

      <P>My Department's advice is, and I think the Deputy as a former Minister will agree that the Department's advice in these matters requires serious consideration, that the Deputy's suggestion if adopted would help to divert traffic from peak to non-peak periods.  As a 33? per cent reduction has been given already, any further reduction would need to be fairly substantial to be effective.  It is considered that the considerable loss in revenue which would result would not be made good by extra traffic in the off-peak periods and that it would be necessary in order to offset the loss to increase the charges during peak hours, and we could not consider this course favourably at this stage.  As I informed the Deputy, the matter is being kept under careful consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The completed report &ldquo;A Study of Suitable Coastal Locations for Oil Refineries in Ireland&rdquo; was formally submitted to me by An Foras Forbartha on 17th November, 1975.  The report was commissioned by me and was intended as a guide for me and the Government.  It was not envisaged <Col N="28" /> as a document to be published.  However, when it became known to me that some parties to the Dublin Bay oil refinery appeal by Aquarius Securities Ltd. considered it of relevance to the appeal I indicated that I had no objection to the making available of the report to that appeal.</P>
    <P>I have since arranged, as I indicated on 10th February in the Dáil, to make copies of the report&mdash;excluding certain confidential material&mdash;available to Members of the Oireachtas and to lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this report was leaked to the Press and relevant extracts from it appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i> on the night before the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on the Dublin Bay oil refinery what was the Minister's purpose in withholding it for over two months and then releasing it on the 11th day of the hearing of the appeal to which it is alleged at any rate to have some relevance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for the leaks which occurred.  I think they are very deplorable.  The report was commissioned long before there was a question of appeal in regard to the Dublin Bay oil refinery.  It was not commissioned in relation to Dublin Bay but to the whole of our coast line. The report contained confidential information and was not intended for publication because I believe it would precipitate speculation to have it published in full.  We have extracted some material from it but even so it may precipitate speculation.  It also is important to recall that although there were very serious leaks nothing like the full amount was leaked.  Immediately it was conveyed to me that it ought to be made available to the inquiry I indicated that I had no objection to making it available, but it was not my role as Minister for Industry and Commerce to make it available.  I simply released it to be given to the inquiry if they so wished.</P>

      <P>First it has been stated that this report was leaked to the Press and, secondly, the Minister is not going to publish the full report. He is going to publish a report which has been censored by himself.  This casts considerable doubt on the whole matter.  Would the Minister, by any means at his disposal, make a public statement on this matter apart from his answers here this evening to try to dispel the doubts and suspicions around this matter?  Also as Deputies O'Malley and Barrett said, regarding the delay in issuing this report, had it been circulated earlier it might well have saved days of hearing at the inquiry and also a lot of money.  Will this report influence the Minister for Local Government in turning down the appeal?</P>

      <P>It must be obvious to the Deputy that his last two supplementaries are not appropriate to me and that I cannot answer and it would not be correct for me to do so.  In regard to any disquiet that has arisen I have said that copies of the report, excluding certain confidential material, have been made available to Deputies and to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I want to take this opportunity to assure people that that was in no sense a censoring of the report by me.  I have neither wish nor reason for so doing.  Remember the report was not carried out for publication, although once the issue arose I thought it proper to have the report published.  It would ruin the possibility of having serious investigation of this sort in public in future if material which was obtained confidentially was then published.  The only restriction is in one specific area where the material was confidentially obtained and where I am advised on <Col N="31" /> technical grounds it would be contrary to public interest to publish it.  There was no intention to censor it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is so long ago I have forgotten what happened.  Sometime before Christmas we spent about three quarters of an hour discussing these amendments.  The purpose of these amendments which the Minister had submitted is, in effect, to delete section 6 of the Bill which we have debated often throughout the country over the past 12 months.  The section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, direct the <Col N="72" /> Authority to rebroadcast in its entirety a service of programmes specified in the direction and broadcast from any source other than the Authority and so specified.</P>
    <P>This section which occupied a considerable amount of debate in the Seanad was opposed by Opposition Members in the Seanad.  We pointed out in the debate which was held throughout the country we believed that if the second television channel was to be established it should be under Irish control.  The Minister's view was that it should be used to rebroadcast BBC in its entirety.  The Minister was adamant about this in the Seanad.  It was pointed out to him at that time that it was very doubtful if this would be successful from various points of view.  Objections to this section were outlined in the Seanad.  The Minister was told then that the employees at RTE, the journalists and broadcasters, objected to his proposals.  He was told that redundancies would occur&mdash;the figure mentioned was 600.</P>
    <P>When the Minister circulated the Bill we put forward our proposals.  We told the people that we would not allow this to be used by any outside broadcasting company, that we wanted it under the control of the RTE Authority. That Authority stood by our proposal.  During the debate which the Minister initiated we told the people that we would establish a programme council which would be representative of the rural areas and be in a position to pick the best programmes available for the second channel.  I always held the view that all viewers had the right to the same selection of channels as those living on the east coast and we told the people that the Minister's proposal would not give those in rural areas that selection.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposed rebroadcasting BBC 1 in its entirety while we favoured the selection of the best UTV, BBC 2 and BBC 1 (Northern Ireland) for showing by RTE 2.  There is no reason why we should not use some of the European programmes on the second channel.  If we took the Minister's line we would be depriving those who live in the single channel area of <Col N="73" /> the selection I have mentioned.  Nobody would allow a valuable asset such as our airwaves to be handed over for use as the BBC saw fit.  The Minister did not feel we were handing over control but if we accepted his proposal we would have no option but to accept the programmes transmitted by BBC 1. Some people put forward the argument that if we had RTE 2 we would have censorship in Dublin but I should like to state that if we accepted the Ministers proposal we would have censorship operating from London.</P>
    <P>From the outset we opposed this section because we felt it would be harmful and would undermine the status of RTE.  Was it the Minister's opinion that RTE 2 were not capable of handling a second channel?  I believe RTE have the script-writers and broadcasters capable of handling a second channel.  The establishment of that channel would give confidence to the employees.  Many talented people have emigrated and now occupy senior posts with other television authorities and I have no doubt that when RTE 2 is established they will return and take up employment with our service.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister made a mistake and he is aware of that.  He was given ample advice to the contrary. The Broadcasting Review Committee, established by Deputy G. Collins when he was Minister, deliberated on this topic for a considerable length of time. That committee, in their comprehensive report, were in favour of RTE 2.  The committee were representative of every <Col N="74" /> walk of life and nobody can say they were politically orientated.  The report of that committee was a solid basis on which the Minister could have made his decision.  Journalists and trade unions were in favour of RTE 2. They wanted a second channel to be under Irish control but, in spite of all the arguments against him, the Minister introduced this section.</P>
      <P>Even had the survey come out in favour of the Minister's proposals, I doubt if he would be in a position to adhere to them because of opposition from trade unions and difficulties over copyright.  The survey saved the Minister a lot of embarrassment.  We participated in the debate prior to the survey, although we were not invited to do so, and we had hesitation in putting forward our views.  Our party represents 47 per cent of the voters and it was only right that our views should be listened to.  Our campaign played an important part because we were able to explain to the people the choices offered to them.  We were able to show the people that, not only was this valuable asset being retained under Irish control, but we could give them a broader choice of programme.</P>
      <P>We heard many criticisms of BBC 1, BBC 2 and UTV.  Excellent programmes are available on those channels.  I hope that, when our second channel is established, the best will be picked from those programmes. I should like to see an extension of RTE programmes into Northern Ireland.  At the moment only about 14 or 16 per cent of viewers receive RTE in Northern Ireland.  If the beam into Northern Ireland could be strengthened, it would be worth while.  I should like to see it done on an organised basis between UTV and RTE. Closer co-operation would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why we should not see some of the UTV programmes showing the cultural aspects of life there, showing both the nationalist culture and the unionist culture.  I see no reason why people in Northern Ireland should not be given an opportunity of seeing some of our homemade programmes.  This would give us a better understanding of one another <Col N="75" /> and would be a useful exercise.  As time goes on, I hope we will get that close co-operation.  We must make every effort to cross the divides which exist in a small island such as this.</P>
    <P>I hope we will keep control of our broadcasts.  I should not like to see RTE put into a straitjacket.  They are entitled to a certain amount of liberalism.  We cannot streamline the Authority too closely.  That would destroy the function of the Authority.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister would have no control over the programmes on that station.  They would be directed by the BBC in London.  It was a misjudgment on the Minister's part to include this section in the Bill.  When the debate started, people were astounded to think that the Minister <Col N="76" /> would spend £4 million or £4½ million of the taxpayers' money, or money raised on their behalf, to establish this second TV channel, and then hand it over to the BBC to broadcast their programmes on it.  This was a gross mistake.  It is not the first mistake Government Ministers have made over the past 12 months.  There is nothing unusual about mistakes. Now we have to delete this section. The Minister had no consultation with other people before writing the section into the Bill.  We welcome the deletion of section 6.  I am glad the Minister has listened to the advice of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The deletion of section 6 gives me the opportunity to comment to the RTE Authority and to those responsible for television in Ireland that, because they now&mdash;as we on this side of the House maintain rightly&mdash;have control of the second channel, they should take into account very scrupulously the feelings of the people and the type of programmes the people want and demand from RTE 2.  We had the spectacle just before Christmas of people in the one channel areas being used as a pawn in the game at the time of the threatened strike by the people in RTE 1.  We do not want a situation like that to occur again.  We do not want to be held up to ransom by any television group, be it RTE 1 or RTE 2.</P>
      <P>We expect from RTE 2 better local coverage than we are getting from RTE 1.  I am afraid my criticisms of several years ago have gone unnoticed.  We still have a very distinct metropolitan bias on RTE. Some small effort was made to readjust the balance.  Very few people in Dublin watch RTE television. People in the one channel areas have no choice other than RTE.  It is surprising that we should have such Dublin-orientated programmes coming out from that station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not very long ago the vocational school in Bandon won the Aer Lingus award for a group project.  This was hardly mentioned by RTE.  They were interviewed and, as they thought, filmed for television but, so far, there <Col N="77" /> has been no programme dealing with this great achievement by the Bandon vocational school.  That is why people feel such frustration in relation to the administration of RTE.</P>
    <P>We hope that when RTE 2 comes into operation it will take into account the feelings of the people down the country and the kind of programmes they want.  We have had an absolute surfeit of programmes dealing with all sorts of issues of no interest whatsoever to people generally in the country.  If someone wants to talk about abortion, contraception or other subjects that some leftist researchers think we should be plied with from time to time they seem to find a ready platform on the current affairs programme or some other programme.  It is no harm to have it go out now from this House that, if RTE 2 does not give the programmes we want, then we will take whatever action is necessary to ensure we get the kind of programmes we want.</P>
    <P>Just by way of an aside, I wonder who was responsible for the decision to cut down &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; on radio.  Initially an effort was made to cut it out but subsequently it was decided to reduce the amount of time devoted to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and that is why I am concerned about the type of programme that will be rebroadcast. We want to ensure we do not get the kind of filth coming out at the moment. <Col N="78" /> We want to ensure there is someone with a sense of responsibility to the people who appreciates what the people want.  In regard to the programmes rebroadcast presently, such as &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo;, they are very welcome and have a huge viewing public.  The complaint mainly is we do not get enough sport on RTE 1.  Certainly we get nothing like what comes out from BBC or ITV.  I would urge those responsible for the programmes rebroadcast to remember that the people like sport and are interested in it.  I hope the maximum number of programmes will be rebroadcast so that people in the country will enjoy the same viewing facilities those in the multichannel areas have at the moment.</P>
      <P>I referred to the whizz kid responsible for trying to cut out &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; and, having failed to do that, reducing it from 15 minutes to ten minutes.  This is an example of someone wholly out of touch with the feeling in the country because that is one programme that is listened to by people who want to find out what is happening here.  Apparently there are pseudo-TDs in RTE who are taking the decisions for us here.  I say this to ensure we do not have a repetition of that kind of performance and that we have a rebroadcasting of all that is best on the other channels, not alone, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, in Britain but elsewhere as well.  We will have to take very seriously the strengthening of the signal to ensure we get across to the people in the Six Counties.  As he said also, a very small percentage are receiving RTE 1.  There are skilled people in my constituency in south-west Cork who do not even get one channel and talking about a second channel is a bit ridiculous as far as they are concerned.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now aware of the collective wisdom of the people.  They were not in favour of his proposition.  Up to this the Minister believed himself to be infallible in his pronouncements in regard to policy. He now knows he is no longer infallible. As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out there was no consultation with the major political party.  A carefully selected group came to a certain decision but a survey indicated that the collective wisdom of the people was in line with our thinking despite the efforts made by the Minister and some of his colleagues.  Mark you, not all of his colleagues were in favour of his proposition.  Apparently the Minister thought he might be able to overcome some opposition within his own party and some opposition within the Government by getting a group outside this House to make a decision. The position is now clear-cut.  I was reading a book last night&mdash;<i>To Katanga and Back</i>&mdash;and I found it very interesting. It indicated that the first thing to do in times of crisis and trouble is <Col N="80" /> to gain control of radio or television. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs apparently subscribes to this grabbing of this kind of installation in order to ensure that the news projected will be controlled in a very real way.  Radio Telefís Éireann could well have programmes superior to those produced by the BBC.  We could have &ldquo;Upstairs Downstairs&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Members of RTE have produced current affairs programmes that are comparable with or superior to those made by the BBC and other broadcasting corporations.</P>
      <P>I give the Minister full support with regard to the deletion suggested in this and in other sections.  I am very glad that at last I have found some area of agreement with the Minister who has been forced to put forward the amendments.  The document is a great one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 6 is of vital importance.  The responsible people of Ireland have given their decision and the Minister is now forced to fall into line with that decision.  No longer will the people slavishly follow the Minister.  He hawked his suggestions around the country and I am sure that people who took issue with him will speak in this debate.  Our views were accepted by the people and they will again be accepted by them on a broader base than what we are discussing now.  We hope the opportunity will come at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the reason for the original suggestion was that the time that could be allocated to the Minister on RTE was so limited that he felt he could get additional time on BBC 1 in order to project himself on a wider basis.  He has now been told the views of the people in no uncertain terms and the speakers before me have indicated their views.  I hope the Minister will take into consideration the points I made about the excellent programme RTE 2 can make. <Col N="82" /> I would mention the row in the Fine Gael and the Labour Party rooms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because there is consensus in the House in favour of the amendments. Deputy Fitzpatrick, as was his right, referred to the past history of this matter and I think it right that I should put my views on the record.  He stated I was adamant on rebroadcasting BBC but that is not quite right.  What I was adamant on, and the record shows this, was the right of the people, particularly those in the single-channel area, to receive a service they would regard as satisfactory&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We agreed on that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There was then a controversy about what exactly they wanted and thereupon I gave two assurances in the Seanad.  The first was that RTE would be free to explain to the people what exactly they had in mind by way of second channel because there was considerable confusion about what it would be.  The second undertaking I gave was that there would be an opinion survey taken on a scientific basis after the matter was fully discussed and that I would abide <Col N="83" /> by the results of that survey.  I fulfilled those undertakings.</P>
      <P>I believe the discussion that took place was useful and I think this is also the view of RTE.  It put RTE in the position of getting out and explaining to the people in the single-channel area what they had in mind and how they would use the second channel.  They explained what had not been clear before then, that approximately four-fifths of the time on the second channel would be devoted to transmission of various programmes from BBC, UTV and so on.  It was on the basis of that presentation that the people in the survey opted for RTE 2.  I immediately recommended to the Government that RTE 2 be accepted and the Government agreed with that.  All of that was a useful exercise, both for the people in the single-channel area and for RTE. In the course of the discussion on the activities of RTE, they were in a position to learn a good deal about the nature of the demand in the single-channel area.  Most Deputies would probably agree it was quite useful to bring the national station into closer contact with popular demand.</P>
      <P>Some expressions have been used here which I would rather deprecate. Deputy Dowling referred to the decision of the responsible people of Ireland in favour of RTE 2.  I see no reason to question the degree of responsibility of that considerable section of the people who were of a different opinion, who in fact wished for rebroadcasting of BBC 1, including approximately half of the population in the cities of Limerick, Cork and Galway. I would hesitate to stigmatise half the population of these considerable cities as irresponsible.  They were in the minority, that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, perhaps, being too glib, too smart by half in trying to quibble, as it were, at this stage over the stand he took during the course of a number of months, which the deletion of section 6 now covers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister questions the contribution of Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The Minister said Deputy Fitzpatrick was not <Col N="84" /> quite right when he said the Minister went in serpentine fashion through the country trying to get people to accept BBC 1.  The facts are that in the earlier stages of the Minister's campaign to get the public, in particular the people in the single-channel area to accept BBC 1, the Minister personally and through his office, and through the Government propaganda machine which he controls, did his utmost to persuade and influence the viewers in the single-channel area what was best for them.  Copies of scripts by the Minister, speeches which he made in the earlier stages, are available and, indeed, on occasions I myself had publicly to correct the Minister and point out to him where he had publicly advocated that the second channel be used for the dissemination of BBC 1.  I think it is only right and proper that if the Minister now wants to backslide from the stand which he took then, the facts must be pointed out to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister's whole attitude has been, to say the least, schizophrenic. Undoubtedly, the Minister wasted valuable time going around the country to meetings hoping that he was meeting the popular demand.  The Minister said he would try to meet the wishes of the people.  That is in line with what was said by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach the other evening regarding trying to buy popularity by putting through the Social Welfare Bill.  If the Minister's effort in trying to give us BBC 1 was just another effort to try to buy votes for this crumbling Labour/ Fine Gael Government that can be understood.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know that the Government are expected to lead from the front not from behind and that what the Minister did and the way he did it were wrong.  As time went on and as this debate changed from one county to another and when he saw that public opinion was mounting against him, it is fair to say the Minister changed his mind.  The Minister was not as definite at that stage as he was in the initial stages.  I was present at a couple of those meetings and I could easily detect the change of attitude on the Minister's part.  It is <Col N="85" /> only natural then that when the Minister was in the Seanad he gave assurances that RTE would be free to explain their position.  With all due respect to the Minister, I am quite sure RTE were going to explain their position anyway.  The Minister did say that an opinion survey would be taken.  In fairness to the Minister, while the debate was raging it certainly was a good ploy but not good in the way the Minister thinks.  It was good in this respect, that those of us who use television in the single-channel area almost continuously saw a remarkable improvement in the output of RTE.  We saw RTE making an effort to impress the viewers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>They gave the viewers for the first time decent programmes which they wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It did have this effect and I am sorry to say that the output which was excellent during that crucial period is not anything as good as the present time.  Certainly if competition is to lead to better television, then RTE should not fall back on their soft seats so early on as they seem to be doing.</P>
      <P>At that stage, particularly in the west and south-west of Ireland, there was no question of the transmitter being at less than half strength in sending out signals as we have had since last October and right at the present time.  The situation is that there was more to this than the Minister trying to meet the public demand or buying votes for his political party grouping in the Coalition Government. It was deliberate ploy on the Minister's part to try to camouflage the economic situation as it was at that time.  I think the Minister will be man enough to admit that for the length of time he was on his BBC promotion tour of the country he was taking the local newspapers and television in the single-channel area away from the economic conditions at the time.  He succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is wrong in one important fundamental principle and that is, leading from the rear.  The Minister is in a responsible position <Col N="86" /> and as a member of the Government, which he was when he went around the country, the Minister should have given the lead and put forward his views rather than asking people who were confused as to what was involved in BBC 1 or RTE 2 or what was involved in the suggestions of the Minister against RTE 2 or against the suggestions put forward by our party at the time.  I believe the Minister did a disservice to the whole concept of broadcasting in helping to create this confusion, and in helping to keep it alive.  I feel that this could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>I feel that as in other areas in Government, the Minister responsible should say, &ldquo;This is what we believe as a Government, part of our job and responsibility.  We believe that this is the course that should be followed rather than having the sort of service we have&rdquo;.  Nobody denies that people must have the opportunity of saying what they want at all times.  Nobody was taking away the rights of the people in these areas but when this was being voted on and when the publicity was mounted as a result of this voting in the different centres the Minister went to it took on an entirely new picture altogether.  The decision that was eventually decided on, that the second broadcasting service in this country would be under the responsibility of RTE, is the proper one.  As I said many months ago in public debate with the Minister on this matter, I hope there will be a representative committee from the single-channel area who will have a say in the type of programmes put out so that those who live in the single-channel area will through the committee made up of people in the single-channel area, be able to have direct access to the RTE Authority and put their views to them so that better television will be available to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> If I said the Minister was adamant what I inferred was that when this Bill was drafted&mdash;not as the debate proceeded because it became quite obvious to me then that the Minister was changing his mind&mdash;the <Col N="87" /> Minister was quite convinced that this was the best solution for the second channel.  If I used the word &ldquo;adamant&rdquo; I used it in that context.  I assure the Minister that I was in no doubt at all after about a lapse of three weeks and having followed some of the debate in the Seanad that the Minister was changing his mind on the whole matter.  It became quite obvious the complications which would arise.  The complication with regard to copyright is a most complicated and insurmountable one.  I am sure the Minister knew well that he was getting himself into a very difficult area with regard to the copyright. He knew very well the decision the employees in RTE had taken with regard to this situation.  It would undermine the whole strategy of the organisation taking this channel away from the realms of RTE and handing it over to be used by BBC.</P>
      <P>The view was put forward at that time that there would be redundancies of up to 600 in RTE if the Minister's proposals were put forward. It was quite obvious that the Minister's mind was changing when these things came to light.  If he allowed the BBC to be broadcast in its entirety it would be a sad state of affairs in our present economic situation when we have 120,000 people unemployed.  If the survey had gone in the Minister's favour, we would be raising capital, building transmitters throughout the country and when the money was spent we would hand this valuable asset over to be used as the BBC felt like using it.  We have heard too much over the past month of contracts going outside the country.  The Minister would be doing this under section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was my colleague, Deputy Collins, who first started this campaign when the Minister passed out his survey. When we put forward our proposals we stated that we intended to keep this television station under Irish control. That was a definite decision, and we stood by it.  We also put forward our proposal that we would establish a programme council.  We intend to do this if we get an opportunity, which <Col N="88" /> might not be too long off.  The members of the programme council would be representative of the rural parts of the country.  People would be in a position to put forward their views as to the type of programme they wanted.</P>
    <P>We have too much violence in television programmes today.  I would like to see violence on television minimised. I have young children and I know what an impact violence can have on them. I am glad we have succeeded in having this section deleted.  Members of the Seanad tried to have this done but they failed.  All during the summer our party tried to convince the Minister of the consequences of allowing this section to remain in the Bill.  The Minister should have withdrawn the section at that time.  Valuable time was wasted in the Seanad debating this Bill.  There are several important pieces of legislation which the Seanad could have been employed discussing instead of debating this section.  We know that 90 per cent of debating in the Seanad was taken up debating section 6.  The Minister is not deleting this section by choice.  It was the decision of the people and their decision must be abided by.</P>
    <P>We respect the opinion of the people who voted for BBC 1.  I have not at any time said that those people have not the right to vote for BBC 1 but we must respect the views of the majority.  I am glad the Minister abides by the majority rule.  I hope the second channel will be properly utilised.  I hope the choice of programmes on the second channel, which will now be established under the control of RTE, between BBC 1, UTV and some European programmes as we become more integrated in the European Community will be a pleasant surprise for the people who voted for BBC 1.</P>
    <P>A lot is expected of RTE now.  They will have to give the choice of programmes necessary.  If I got the choice in the morning, I would not opt for BBC 1.  I have experience of looking at the programmes on all those channels for the past ten years.  Many of the programmes put out by RTE are also put out by BBC 1 and UTV.  We will be giving the people in the single-channel <Col N="89" /> areas the choice they would not have if they opted for the choice the Minister was offering them.  How soon will the new channel be in operation?  How much capital has already been spent?  Will our economy be strong enough to get the new channel introduced?  What is the opinion of the Minister in relation to these matters?  When will the new channel come into operation?</P>

      <P>As regards when RTE 2 will be on the air, the transmission networks are scheduled to become completed before the end of 1976 or early 1977.  While RTE have not yet indicated when they hope to inaugurate the new service, I am <Col N="91" /> sure they will wish to provide a choice of television programmes, particularly for viewers in the single-channel areas, at the earliest possible date after the completion of the transmission network.  That is as far as I can answer on that at the moment.</P>
      <P>As regards who will control RTE 2, like RTE 1 it will be under the general control of the RTE Authority who will, I am sure, appoint a controller of programmes in the usual manner for the new service.</P>

      <P>With regard to what the Minister has stated we understand fully that RTE 2 will be under the RTE Authority, but can the Minister at this stage say if any provision will be made so that people from the single-channel areas in the form of an advisory committee to the RTE Authority will have a say in advising as to what programmes will be transmitted in RTE 2?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the question of an advisory committee for RTE 2, in the course of my opening speech on the Second Stage of the Bill on the 28th October, in Volume 285, No. 3, columns 410 and 411 I said:</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the transfer of power to appoint advisory committees from the Minister to the Authority... Accordingly it is for the RTE Authority to act on this question and I would not wish to prejudice their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I can see some possible objections to such an arrangement. The second channel is a second national channel, not an extension to the single-channel area of a service already available in the multichannel area.  Furthermore it is to be run as a complement to the existing channel so that there is to be a single balanced national service on two channels.  Given that this concept has won popular acceptance, I feel it should be allowed to work itself out.  That being so, it may not be considered advisable&mdash;I do not know&mdash;to create a system of committees which would naturally tend to pull in different directions, in order to run a two-channel concept <Col N="92" /> which is intended to be a balanced whole.</P>
    <P>That is my answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a perfectly reasonable explanation.  The only slight misgiving I have about it is in the event of the type of programme being selected not being suitable or acceptable to the people in the one-channel areas, would it not be better to include some sort of advisory committee to whom they could go rather than try to contact the Authority, who we all know can be impersonal at times? Would the Minister consider the appointment of such a committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the House at that time this Bill itself provides for the transfer of the power of the appointed advisory committees from the Minister resident at the moment to the Authority, so it would be for the Authority to decide that.  In the event of it becoming clear that the service provided was not satisfactory, then that is a matter which will be discussed with the Authority.  I have no reason to doubt that if the Authority felt that such a situation was arising where it might be losing contact with the people in the second-channel areas, it would be willing to give favourable consideration to the setting up of such an advisory committee, but it will be for the Authority to decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Our amendment provides that a member of the Authority may be suspended or removed from office. We believe that the Minister is the appointed person in relation to the appointment of the Authority and that when appointing the Authority, he does not have to come into the House to get sanction for the appointment. He can appoint in his own right. I can envisage a situation arising in which much embarrassment would be created for the Minister, and I am dealing in particular now with suspension and removal.  I want to make it clear that I have full confidence in the Authority and personally have no axe to grind in relation to any member of the Authority, but we believe that the amendment will protect the Minister in addition to strengthening the whole RTE organisation.</P>
      <P>I know from my experience of business that there are occasions when it becomes necessary to suspend and we know that in the ordinary course of business where a serious fault has been committed, a normal procedure is laid down by trade union practice, which gives a right of suspension. This is very valid, but the position is that it takes a good while to get a conciliation committee or a labour relations committee together to decide a particular issue.  It can take a week or ten days and during that time the person concerned stands suspended. He does not stand sacked by any means and he is not removed but temporarily suspended for good and valid reason.  A person in charge of a business or a factory cannot be allowed to continue in full operation during the time when these labour relations consultations are going on. The Minister, or some other Minister at some future date, may find himself in this rather embarrassing situation. I repeat that I have the fullest respect for the present Authority but I am looking into the future and to the possibility of some such situation arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister under this section will have to convene Dáil Éireann, if it is <Col N="95" /> not then sitting, before he can remove or suspend any member of the Authority and we know that this can take a considerable time.  The matter could arise during the Christmas or Summer recesses and the Minister could be presented with a problem in convening the House in which there could be a protracted debate on such an issue.  The Minister, in my belief, would be weakening his position in this type of situation.  This function should be an executive responsibility as it has always been, and the Minister of the day has always acted responsibly in the past, but this is undoubtedly an executive responsibility and he must accept his responsibility in the matter of doing justice to the RTE Authority and RTE.  There is nothing which so undermines an organisation or business as a weak executive at the top.  Every organisation in business which is strong and progressive has expanded and progressed under good management, and if there is one thing which employees down the line can detect immediately, it is weakness at the top.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that the Minister is the executive in charge of RTE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> No.  He is the ultimate man where the Authority is concerned, the man at the top in this regard.  If the Minister at the top does not accept his responsibility, it will reflect down through RTE, and I am speaking in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a long and complicated amendment, but we feel that this is the Minister's duty.  I want to make it perfectly clear that we do not want to act in any dictatorial manner. When it is a matter of removal or suspension, a resolution will have to be brought into the House and passed. That is very proper, but during that time we are conferring a right on the Minister in relation to the proper running of the organisation which we believe he should have.  We believe he should have this right and by exercising it he will have to come to this House <Col N="96" /> and justify his actions under sections 1 and 2.  That is only fair and nobody can say we are being dictatorial in that.</P>
    <P>In the other sections the Minister would have a right to remove a member of the Authority.  We are doing this because of the provisions of section 17.  That section provides:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister is of the opinion that the broadcasting of a particular matter or a matter of a particular class would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or would tend to undermine the Authority of the State, he may by order direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting the matter or any matter of the particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the order.</P>
    <P>No Minister would give such a directive or interpret that section loosely.  It is a serious matter particularly when we hear so much today about law and order.  The Minister has expounded that principle and told us how important it is on many occasions.  If the Minister believed that section was being broken he would be justified in making such an order and insisting that it be obeyed.  In the event of it not being obeyed subsection 4 of our amendment is justified.</P>
    <P>We considered these amendments seriously and we believe they are for the common good.  The Minister, if he thinks deeply about our amendments, will find that there are no selfish motives attached.  He will find that we are not trying to restore the section in the old Bill as it stood.  We are endeavouring to help and strengthen the Authority.  We believe the Minister should carry the authority contained in parts of this amendment.  I am sure the Minister will find that the substance of the amendment will help the RTE Authority and himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to recall briefly our approach on Second Stage.  In his opening statement the Minister recognised two essential points which were difficult to reconcile.  The first was that the Authority should be in a position to carry its responsibility and have the necessary autonomy to do it.  The second point was that there would be certain areas in which the <Col N="97" /> Minister could not relinquish his control. The Minister aimed to give the maximum authority while retaining, in certain areas, as contemplated in section 17, specific control.  The whole spectrum was covered on this from complete abdication by the Minister&mdash; giving responsibility the whole way&mdash; to the other extreme where it was argued on Second Stage that the Minister should not delegate any responsibility.</P>
      <P>During the course of that debate I said that when people are given responsibility they must be given the security to discharge the responsibility. I also argued that if the Minister was retaining control in a certain area that control would have to be effective.  I did not see any essential difference in approach between that of the Minister and myself.  However, from the Bill it seems that not only was there the difficulty of reconciling these two <i>desiderata</i> there, but, in fact, they were put in opposition to one another and were practically contradictory.  If one has a situation where a member of the authority can only be removed by the cumbersome procedure of coming before the House, on the one hand, and the necessity claimed in section 17, on the other hand, for the Minister to be in a position to give an order, an impossible situation could develop.</P>
      <P>The Minister could be completely frustrated and, from a legal point of view, one could put the Authority in the position of virtually snubbing the Minister.  On Second Stage we pointed out that in cases where the Minister would feel he was justified in interfering they would demand urgency of action or else any action the Minister would take would have the net result of aggravating rather than coping with the problem confronting him when he intervenes.  With that basic outlook before us it seemed that section 2 was too protective; it excludes the Minister. The existing provisions in the original Act were too inclusive, too paralysing. Therefore, the structure of the amendment is an attempt to meet this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sympathising with the Minister in the desire that the Authority should have very real autonomy and the security <Col N="98" /> necessary to exercise that autonomy properly, it was desirable that summary dismissal or suspension by the Minister would not be indulged in quickly.  Subsection 1 of the amendment states that no member of the Authority can be removed in any way by anybody except as provided in the section.  That is a general protection, an outlining of the domain, a limitation that precludes arbitrary action.  On the wording of subsection 1 of the amendment, there is an absolute protection given to the members of the Authority, as absolute as that in section 2 of the Bill.  Subsections 2 and 3 of the amendment visualise the case of a suspension.  I am still dealing with the area where the Minister wished to delegate autonomy and responsibility and when I come to subsection 4 of the amendment I will be dealing with section 17 cases.  Subsections (2) and (3) of the amendment visualise the case where, for one reason or another, it may be desirable to suspend a member of the Authority.</P>
    <P>These may be very different reasons from those operating where the Minister would intervene.  I could visualise a number of cases where suspension might be desirable in the public interest, and even in the interest of the Authority.  A member of the Authority might go so completely out of line that the rest of the Authority might go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We have to do something about this&rdquo;.  I can visualise a number of cases where it would be desirable that the Minister would have power of suspension. When you say that simply, immediately and quite rightly you are informed that you are defeating the whole idea of autonomy if you give a power of suspension like that without qualification&mdash;but there is a qualification.</P>
    <P>That suspension cannot be exercised without coming before the House.  If it were exercised without coming before the House within 30 days, the Minister would have to carry the odium and the publicity for a performance which would be obnoxious and inept.  A suspension must be brought to the House.  That corresponds to the provision in section 2. The effects of subsections (1) (2) and <Col N="99" /> (3) of the amendment are nothing more than the spelling out of section 2 in the Bill with, however, interim power given to the Minister to suspend, pending the decision of the Oireachtas. I hope I am making my point clear to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The only difference in effect of subsections (1) (2) and (3) of the amendment and section 2 as it stands, is that, as the section stands, no action could be taken until the decision of the House was made.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, this would entail considerable delay and probably a great deal of embarrassment.  We are suggesting the provision of a power of interim suspension where the Minister thought it desirable to act.  It is perfectly possible to imagine a case where one or two members of the Authority might go off the rails and the majority of the Authority would come to the Minister and ask for immediate action.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is a different kettle of fish.  In our opinion, quite rightly the Minister has retained certain powers in section 1.  The wording of this amendment would possibly be improved from the draftsman's point of view in its ultimate form in the Bill. It had to be worded this way because it is an amendment to an amending Bill.  I am sure what it means is intelligible to the Minister.  If the Minister gives an order under section 17, there are provisions in paragraphs (1A) and (1B).  These are being accepted.  It is provided that the authority shall comply with the order.  The practical question is: suppose they do not?  I need not labour the point that such a situation could arise.  What does the Minister do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This may not be altogether feasible.  It may not be done in time, and he may have an urgent problem.  Subsection (4) is proposed to the Minister to give him the necessary power to enforce his authority in the area he reserves in section 17.  It is agreed that he should reserve that <Col N="100" /> authority.  We believe he should have the power to enforce that authority. Subsection (4) does nothing more than give him power to enforce his order and the necessary power to act swiftly.  Swift action might very easily be necessary&mdash;not only desirable but highly necessary.  It might be impossible to recall the Dáil.  The Dáil cannot be recalled for a number of days anyway.  This subsection is commended to the Minister on that basis.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of the amendment is purely administration and deals with who takes responsibility if the Authority are gone in the case of a suspension. In the case of a suspension which is not put through the House, in the end the Authority are in the same condition as they were in the beginning.  They are vindicated.  In the meantime someone has to carry on. Subsection (5) of the amendment is purely an attempt to provide that there is no hiatus.</P>
      <P>In summary the substance of the amendment is this.  No member of the Authority can be removed except in the circumstances of this section.  In all ordinary cases within the area where the Minister wishes to give autonomy, exclusive of the area he has specifically kept to himself, subsections (1), (2) and (3) really do no more than section 2 of the Bill, with the one practical provision of power of interim suspension at the end of which the Minister, on the recommendation of the House, decides that the suspension should be made permanent and there is a removal, or else the Authority or the members of the Authority are vindicated and reinstated and the Minister has to carry the odium of having made a mistake in the opinion of the House.  That puts everybody on a fairly fair basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) is in a totally different category.  It enforces the power which the Minister is rightly claiming under section 17.  The wording is intended to keep the procedures and the structures as close as possible to what the Minister visualises in the Bill.  As I say, subsection (5) is purely a provision to avoid a hiatus.  I hope the Minister will see that a logical attempt is being made to meet his <Col N="101" /> policy of giving autonomy and security over the greater part of the area while preserving special areas.  In that one is assuming, of course, that the Minister cannot and neither can this House completely abdicate their ultimate responsibility to the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister as a member of the Government and an executive of the State cannot abdicate all his powers and responsibilities.  Even though he is not an executive in the sense which prompted him to pose the question a moment ago he still has a function of authority and supervision.  This is an effort to give the Minister power and protection and to give the Authority power and protection.  That is the logical case to be made for this amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the power of suspension it is conceivable the Authority would want it just as much as the Minister.  Instead of there being a conflict between the Authority and the Minister this would facilitate efficient co-operation.  I will not labour the point.  I think the Minister appreciates the point.  Would he consider it a great discourtesy on my part if I go back now to a committee in which I am involved very closely at the moment, the Corporation Tax Committee?</P>

      <P>I would like to refer specifically to a difficulty I see, a difficulty I believe the Minister will encounter unless he accepts this amendment. What we are discussing here is a situation we all hope will never arise but we have to take precautions. We are dealing with what would be an emergency situation and I hope the Minister is receptive to something complementary to his proposition. I can foresee a certain inhibition unless the Minister accepts the amendment. Reference was made to the Dáil being in recess.  That would not present an insurmountable difficulty.  Suppose there is a general election.  The Dáil has been dissolved.  What will happen during the period of dissolution? Are subversive elements to be allowed to remain until the new Dáil comes into being?  The Minister nods his head.  A general election would mean that the Dáil would be dissolved for at least a month.</P>

Does he think that a desirable situation?  If the Minister had the powers Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment would give him, he could cope with the situation. The question is what happens when there is no Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the section as a whole is far too weak from the point of view of the proper exercise of authority by the elected Government. I can visualise all sorts of things happening.  There could be difficulties in the middle of a general election because of some national issue or crisis and the Government would not be in a position to deal with the Authority or the executive of the Authority.  Even though it may call for the exercise of a little imagination, it is as well to spell out that awkward situations may arise under section 2, and that it might be necessary to get resolutions through the House.  For that purpose the House must be sitting but the House is not always sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken on this in the past. I believe the general principle of accountability of a government to the Dáil for the actions and performance of a State body should be precise.  It is the duty of a Minister to whom the State body reports to take the decision in exercising authority.  I do not think the Dáil, to which the Government and the Minister are responsible, should come in the way of exercising that authority which is how I see section <Col N="103" /> 2.  Perhaps the Minister may be over-reacting to what he may have thought was the over-exercise of authority in the past.  I spoke on this on radio before and after the particular occasion. The fundamental thing is the responsibility of the Government to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing here is transferring executive authority from himself to the Dáil.  I do not think it is a wise thing to do.  I should prefer the risk of a government over-reacting than breaching the other principle. What the Bill is doing in section 2 is putting one particular State body out of the 52 or 53 State bodies that exist in a similar position as that of the Comptroller and Auditor General or even of judges.  I do not think that is a wise thing to do.</P>
    <P>The responsibility and the right of the Executive is to act on behalf of the Dáil and on behalf of the people. The Dáil set up a State body to run broadcasting on behalf of the Dáil, reporting to the Government and to the responsible Minister appointed by the Government.  The position regarding his accountability to the Dáil should be no different from the position of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any other Minister reporting and answering for a State body.  Having had experience of this for a number of years, I admit there are all kinds of burning issues involved in a broadcasting system but I am not at all convinced that section 2 is the right way to go about it.</P>
    <P>The amendment is a compromise between the old section 17 and section 2.  It is a little complicated but it makes a certain amount of sense.  I am not sure that I would have departed from section 17 to the extent to which the amendment does but I would prefer the amendment to section 2.</P>

With regard to section 2 which it is intended will replace section 6 of the 1960 Act, I dealt with this matter at some length on Second Stage.  I would refer to my statement at columns 285 and 286 of the Official Report dated 28th October, 1975, and to columns 1045-1046 and 1073-1081 of the Official Report dated 6th November, 1975.  I do not want to cover the same ground at any length. The section would replace section 6 of the 1960 Act which reads:</P>
      <P>The Government may at any time remove a member of the Authority from office.</P>
      <P>The amendment in general is aimed at buttressing the autonomy of the RTE Authority, at asserting the authority of Parliament in this area and minimising the dangers of arbitrary intervention or intervention in the interests of the Government of the day which might not necessarily be in accord with the purpose of the Act or the amending legislation.</P>
      <P>I entirely recognise that the amendment represents a carefully thought out effort at improving the Bill in the interests of broadcasting and I respect that.  Through this amendment I welcome that there is a consensus in the House that the old section 6 requires amendment.  Deputy Brugha deviated a little from that consensus but broadly speaking it is there and it is welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  The question concerns the distribution of authority and that is a question on which it is difficult to obtain any finality.  Every one agrees that Parliament should have overall authority in relation to this.  Everyone agrees that public service broadcasting requires a degree of autonomy but <Col N="105" /> the frontiers of that autonomy and of the authority of the State are notoriously difficult to draw.  My own draft represents an effort to draw this frontier in a sense more favourable to the autonomy of the Authority.</P>
      <P>I can well understand there could be a genuine feeling that this unduly weakens the authority of the State, and that has been avoided here.  The authority of the State is not necessarily best upheld by adopting or implying in legislation a suspicion of the authority set up by Parliament itself. I am only expressing a view here and Deputies may entirely legitimately differ.  It seems to me that where the Oireachtas set up an authority and where the Government of the day, with the support of the majority in the Oireachtas, appoint that authority, a degree of confidence is due to the authority and that the extension of that degree of confidence, of fortification, will tend on the whole to uphold not only the autonomy required but also the legitimate interests of Parliament and of the State, so that a relation of mutual confidence is seen to exist.</P>
      <P>In those countries where the autonomy of broadcasting is generally regarded as best upheld, the broadcasting Authority and broadcasters are in fact regardful of the legitimate needs of the State.  Therefore, I would tend to deprecate legislation which would thrust in the direction of providing for every possible hypothesis in which the Authority might go collectively or individually mad and become subversive, or whatever.</P>
      <P>I would think it likely that while our democratic State continues to exist, which we hope it will for many decades and generations to come, no Government are likely to commend to the Oireachtas an Authority which would be likely to behave in some extraordinary or subversive way, and if no such likelihood exists, I would think it unwise to proceed legislatively as if this were possible and as if every loophole needs to be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons, though I would like to be able to accept an amendment in this area, as I did accept, as Deputies may be aware, a number of amendments, including Opposition <Col N="106" /> amendments, in the Seanad, I feel this amendment goes against the purpose and the general thrust of what I was myself proposing, and what I was proposing definitely strengthens the autonomy of the Authority and is in the public interest at the present time.  I think Deputies opposite showed in their interventions that they themselves feel that the machinery which would be set up by this amendment is overelaborate. It seems to provide for two eventualities.  First, it deals with the need to suspend an individual member or members of the Authority at a moment's notice, and two, a need to remove the whole Authority from office as a matter of urgency for failure to comply with a direction under section 31 (1) of the 1960 Act, as amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, the amendments as drafted seem to cut across the whole spirit of section 2 which was designed to give greater security of tenure to the Authority by eliminating the possibility of arbitrary action by an individual Minister or by a Government, while at the same time establishing positive control by the Oireachtas. Under the proposed suspension procedure, even though the members of the Authority are appointed by the Government they could be suspended by a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at a moment's notice.</P>

      <P>Any sensible Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would do that.  I hope all Ministers will fall into that category.  I would deprecate the suggestion that my proposed section involves an abdication of power by the Minister.  The Minister would still be responsible for putting the proposal before the Oireachtas and anyone who imagines in the vigorous parliamentary climate we enjoy in this country that any Minister is abdicating responsibility by binding himself to putting a measure before Parliament for approval would be very much mistaken.  On the contrary, he would be actually increasing his responsibility in the strictest sense of that term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> Admittedly, the suspension would lapse if it were not approved by resolution of both Houses within 30 days, but I find it difficult to envisage a situation in which such a procedure would be desirable.  Perhaps Deputies opposite, in framing the amendment, have been a little too imaginative in envisaging a situation which is not at all likely.</P>

      <P>That is the Deputy's view with which I must agree to differ.  The need for urgent action to remove a member of the Authority or the whole Authority should be envisaged only if the security of the State were involved.  I think Deputies opposite, particularly Deputy de Valera, have recognised this.  In the very unlikely event of a refusal by the Authority in an emergency situation to comply with a direction under section 31 (1), as amended by section 17 of the Bill&mdash;paragraph (4) of the amendment is intended to cater for that but the solution offered seems to me to be unsatisfactory&mdash;while the members could be removed quickly by ministerial order, they could not be replaced for a long time because the order could be annulled by a resolution of either House within 21 sitting days.  This would be a most undesirable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to the Second Stage debate I referred to the misgivings expressed by Deputy de Valera about the adequacy of the present section 2 to cater for urgent action in emergency situations.  I said then that if the country were faced with an emergency the Oireachtas would almost certainly be in session and that if it were not it would certainly be recalled. Accordingly there should be no problem about having the resolution to remove the Authority from office discussed. If the Government wish to remove a member or the whole Authority, my view still is, though I have heard arguments to different effect here, that I should seek the approval <Col N="108" /> of the Oireachtas for such a course of action.  Because of the importance of an independent broadcasting service in a democratic system I regard this restraint on the part of the Government to remove an Authority as very desirable.  Past history of this question shows that.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the amendment which would present difficulties. My main objections to the amendment are those expressed earlier. A point was made by Deputy Tunney, and I apologise both for interrupting him and for not having understood what he was saying, on the difficulty of dismissing an Authority during an election.  This seems to me to be an example of being perhaps imaginatively over-fertile in thinking what might possibly happen however unlikely. The period of a general election would be a very odd time to dismiss an Authority.  Admittedly, theoretically, an Authority could run collectively mad during an election period, do very strange things, but I think it extremely unlikely and that it is undesirable to provide in legislation against the extremely unlikely. Our legislation, by providing a remedy for failure on the part of the Authority to carry out their responsibilities, should not reflect a view of that as being likely but rather should reflect confidence in an Authority set up by and constituted by the Oireachtas.  Of course, another hypothesis was envisaged by the Deputy.  If the question of the suitability of the Authority to remain in office precipitated an election it would be undesirable in those circumstances to dismiss the Authority until the new Dáil had the opportunity to consider the position.  Again, there is the theoretical possibility that the Authority which had not been dismissed would then run riot during the general election period and would permit all kinds of excesses.</P>
    <P>This draft section is intended for the purposes which I have stated, primarily for the protection of the autonomy under Parliament of the Authority and their protection from arbitrary intervention.  It, therefore, necessarily reflects confidence in the body because we do not set ourselves <Col N="109" /> to provide increased autonomy for a body in which we do not <i>a priori</i> feel confidence.  Those are the principles, which I explained in greater detail in earlier statements, which underlie the draft section.  I find the amendment incompatible in principle with the draft section and I am sorry that for that reason I am unable to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the legislation belongs to the Minister he will have to take credit or discredit if he so desires, for what he describes as the excess of imagination which it has brought from this side of the House.  I refer to section 17 and I also refer to section 2 of the Minister's legislation. If we take the Minister at his word there is no need for those sections. The Minister has made a very good case for not having section 2 or section 17 in the Bill.  The same case can be made for not having either of those sections in the Bill as that which the Minister has made against accepting Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.</P>
      <P>My case to the Minister was that looking at section 17 I see that he is providing for a situation:</P>
      <P>Where the Minister is of the opinion that the broadcasting of a particular matter or a matter of a particular class would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or would tend to undermine the authority of the State, he may by order direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting the matter or any matter of the particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the order.</P>
      <P>That is the Minister's provision, not mine.  That is the product of the Minister's imagination, not mine. With that as a basis I now move to the protection which I thought the Minister should give to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visualise the situation where an employee of the Authority is guilty of the offence to which the Minister refers in section 17 and where a member <Col N="110" /> of the Authority&mdash;not the Authority <i>in toto</i>&mdash;is unwilling to accept the Minister's direction or his power in respect of that section and where this occurs at a time which is immediately prior to a general election.  The general election is called and the Minister is there with his desire to have the member of the Authority removed.  He has no Dáil to give approval, as he is providing for the legislation, to that which he desires. That is a practical presentation which politicians know can happen.  I agree entirely with the Minister that what is envisaged here is of an emergency nature.  I visualise one of the occasions on which I could see it happen.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that we want to give to the Authority all the power they would desire and that nobody wants to inhibit the Authority in any way, that we would give them absolute autonomy, but on the other hand there is on the two sides of the House acceptance that this precaution must be there.  I believe the precaution provides for the hoped for eventuality but in so far as the provision is there at all I indicate to the Minister what I would describe as a soft area, the case where he will still be Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or his successor is there as Minister responsible for the Authority being thwarted by the legislation which he has introduced in respect of dismissing a member of the Authority.  That does not savour as much of the fertile imagination as the Minister seems to suggest.  It is a real weakness in the legislation I see before me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply briefly to one particular point which the Deputy raised.  I think I have replied as best I can to the second point he raised.  The Deputy made a very good debating point that whereas I fought the Opposition amendment with over-fertility of imagination about conjunctures, my own section 17 is very fertile about:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where the Minister is of the opinion that the broadcasting of a particular matter or a matter of a particular class would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or would tend to undermine the authority <Col N="111" /> of the State, he may by order direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting the matter or any matter of the particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the order.</P>
    <P>There are differences in degree of imagination here, because opinions may differ about whether a given matter might or might not incite to crime.  There might be very legitimate difference of opinion.  The Authority might look at something and say : &ldquo;Well, there are dangers here, but it is right that this should be broadcast.&rdquo; The Minister might reach a different conclusion, equally legitimate.  That is quite a probable conjuncture, not highly probable, but certainly within the order of possibility.  What the author of the amendment is concerned about or what is a possibility, to my mind a very remote one, is one in which the Authority deliberately disregards an order made by the Minister under statute by which the Authority function.  That is an unlikely possibility and one against which we should not be at too much pains to provide very specifically.  There should be a general power in reserve, there has to be, but in my mind that is provided for adequately in section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In section 2 the Minister is providing that the Authority shall be removed by the Government, by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In effect what we are doing in section 1 (2) and (3) is giving more precision, giving the right to the Minister to suspend a member of the Authority.  The Minister stated that very few would appoint an Authority unless they had confidence in them.  This is true.  No Minister of the day who is careful about the members which he will pick for his Authority is going to pick everyone sent to him.  He is going to see that they are competent persons. I am convinced that this is how any Minister would function in appointing an Authority, and I have no doubt that the Authority who are patently exercising their function today are composed of such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> However, when we are legislating here we should be precise and know exactly what we are doing.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions I have seen Finance Bills going through this House, and we have had to come back the year after and rectify them because there were loopholes in them. During the course of the year the weaknesses in the Bill and in other Bills that have come before the House, have become obvious.  If they have been found to contain loopholes they can be rectified the following year, making amendments to provide for that.</P>
    <P>However, in the present situation we are legislating as regards the removal of the Authority.  This is a function which I think any Minister would be very hesitant to put into operation and it is only in case of the emergencies which have been pointed out in the House that he would do so.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order suspend for stated reasons every and any member of the Authority named therein provided that upon the expiration of thirty days from the date thereof the said order shall lapse and have no further force or effect and the suspension thereby made shall be annulled and deemed never to have been made unless before the expiration of thirty days from the date of the order resolutions approving and confirming the same shall have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We believe the Authority would welcome this to function in its own right.  However, we envisage a situation where members of the Authority on their date of appointment, and in the Minister's opinion, could be some of the most perfect people one could select and would be perfectly suited to exercise their right within the Authority, but in the course of time, in two, three or four years, may oppose the views of the Minister or may impede the operation of the Authority in day-to-day functions. There are several reasons why they could create an imbalance in the whole operation of RTE and the <Col N="113" /> Authority generally.  It is to deal with such a situation that we have drawn this amendment.  We want a situation where, if we abide by the Minister's section 2 the Minister would be obliged to have both Houses of the Oireachtas pass a resolution.  If such a position did arise the Minister should there and then have the right of suspension.  For the full and efficient functioning of the Authority any member who is impeding the progress of the Authority and of Telefís Éireann on the whole structure should be removed, and let the Authority carry on with their business. We are not trying to bestow greater powers on the Minister than he has in section 2.  What we say is he will have to have a resolution approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  He will have to come to this House to justify his actions to the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Even under section 2 the Minister is inclined to be democratic in delegating authority, or at least so it appears. He appears to be giving the Authority more autonomy.  However, this is not so.  The Minister who makes this decision of removing any member of the Authority, or removing all the Authority, in effect is saying: &ldquo;We know perfectly well that the Minister of the day will have a majority in the House. There is no way he will operate otherwise and hold his position as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.&rdquo; He is bringing a resolution into the House to remove a member of the Authority or all the Authority.  He is shelving his responsibilities and nothing else.  He is asking the House to do his work for him.  He knows the day he takes that decision and moves the motion in the House, as sure as the sun rises in the morning, that that resolution is going to be carried within the House.  No Minister could hold his position unless he had that majority.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between the amendment we are proposing here and that of the Minister?  I believe there is none when we unvarnish it and can see it in its true light.  The Minister is only refusing to accept his responsibility.  There is no good in buying popularity at this price.  The Minister is appointed to legislate and <Col N="114" /> to do so effectively.  We do not want the situation to arise in maybe two or three years.  The examples which Deputy Tunney has given are valid and could arise.  This is what we should legislate for.  We do not want to legislate for what we know happened in the past.  We should look to the future possibilities.  The first, second and third parts of this amendment are doing nothing more than the Minister's section 2.  The right of suspension is a normal, accepted practice in every employer/trade union gathering.</P>
    <P>I have on numerous occasions in the past had experience of this, of being on conciliation boards in relation to a suspended person and that conciliation board deciding to restore the suspended person.  Everybody knows this takes place.  We are asking only for suspension.  This is a normally accepted concept in business and in the trade union movement, and we know well that people in commercial life and in trade unions, who are very much alive to the whole situation, can visualise circumstances arising in which it is desirable&mdash;and trade unions have conceded it&mdash;that employers should have the right to suspend.  When the whole case is brought before the labour relations machinery, it can be discussed in a pragmatic manner and the case put by both sides as to how it should work.  That is how you legislate properly and let us not be afraid to do our duty with regard to the fourth section under which the Minister gives a direction. In the world in which we live today, the authority which the Minister has is perfectly correct, but unfortunately he will not be able to exercise it effectively&mdash;although he will be able to exercise it eventually when a lot of damage has been done&mdash; due to the fact that he is bound by section 2.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney has mentioned examples of what could happen.  The Dáil could be in recess; it could be right in the middle of the Christmas holidays, and we know how difficult it would be to convene the Dáil in Christmas week.  The Minister would find a certain amount of difficulty in convening both Houses of the Oireachtas to put his function into operation. We could have the situation outlined <Col N="115" /> by Deputy Tunney of the Dáil having been dissolved.  These are the realities and we should legislate for them here. They are very valid examples.  At no time would we wish to take autonomy away from the Authority or do anything by this amendment which they would regard as undermining their authority.  I am in favour of delegating authority at all times in every walk of life, but at the same time there must be one man at the top to take the final decision.  We have this new concept working well in all types of industry, but even with that devolution of authority at the top must remain the one man.  Any man occupying that position will not take harsh decisions but he should be there to exercise his responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any Minister would deal lightly with the matter of the removal of the Authority.  It is a decision which he would consider very carefully and on which he would have consultations with his Cabinet.  Any Minister, finding himself in conflict with the Authority in relation to a serious matter such as is contained in section 17, would have long and serious deliberations within the Cabinet as to what steps should be taken and it is only after those deliberations that he would be in a position to exercise his powers under these provisions and would be justified in exercising his rights.  When operating section 2 he will carry out these deliberations within his Cabinet to see what opinions exist within the Cabinet and when a final decision is arrived at in relation to invoking section 2, he knows perfectly well that if the decision has been taken by the Cabinet to remove any member of or the entire Authority and to get the necessary resolution passed, that member of the Authority or the entire Authority will be removed from the time the Cabinet make the decision.  It is merely an exercise to bring it here and have it debated. It looks more democratic, but I do not believe that any member of the Authority is under the impression that there is anything additional given in the section as opposed to our amendment. I agree that it was different in the old <Col N="116" /> Bill which provided that the Government may at any time remove a member from office and there is a big distinction between that particular section and the amendment.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the amendment is reasonable and I am sure that every member of the Authority would welcome that situation because the members, as intelligent responsible men, know that they can be saddled some day with one member who is undesirable and who will impede their business. Any group of men would welcome such a provision, while at the same time tying down the Minister to a right of suspension.  When the case has been proven, he may often change his mind in putting his case to the House so that the person may be restored.  We are not giving too much power to the Minister.  We are giving sufficient power to suspend so as to let the Authority function smoothly as they would wish to do.  I know that if I were a member of the Authority, I would wish to have this type of section. It is practical and has nothing dictatorial about it.  It is a democratic but businesslike section which is required, if any organisation is to function properly.</P>
    <P>In regard to subsection (5) dealing with removal of certain members of the Authority, we could envisage a situation in which the Minister would suspend, but at the same time would be forced to bring a resolution before the House, and during that time, we believe, it is necessary that there should be some type of Authority functioning in relation to the day-to-day running of the broadcasting system.  Under the Minister's section 2, members of the Authority may be removed by the Government from office for stated reasons.  The members of the Authority know what the result of any motion moved in this House would be, irrespective of how long it would take for that motion to be passed.  They are aware that once the Minister decides to move such a motion they will be removed.  However, as the section stands they will have full authority and can exercise that authority during the debate on the Minister's motion.  The Minister cannot do anything about that.  Does he realise the significance <Col N="117" /> of the matter?  It is dangerous to leave the situation as it is.</P>
    <P>I am certain that no business concern would leave a man in complete control while protracted proceedings were being engaged in to remove him. While this House, and the Seanad, would be discussing a motion to remove the Authority the members of the Authority could take decisions that would be detrimental to the security of the State.  I do not say that will happen but we must legislate for that type of eventuality.  In drafting this Bill the Minister had no thought of what the consequences would be.  He must have realised that a debate on a motion to remove the Authority could last up to five weeks, and, therefore, he should have included a provision to restrict the members of the Authority while a motion to remove them was being discussed by this House.  If the Minister visualises a situation arising where it will be necessary to remove the Authority, he has left himself open to a lot of trouble and has left our national broadcasting service at serious risk.</P>
    <P>Our amendment includes a right of suspension while such a motion is being considered by the House.  I feel sure members of the Authority would agree to the terms of our amendment. Business people would view the Minister's provision as farcical and irresponsible. We are dealing with a responsible organisation, one of the most influential services in any country and we are all aware of the responsibility that rests on the members of the Authority.  If the Minister could tell me that the powers of the members of the Authority will be restricted in any way while a motion to remove them is being debated in this House, I would be satisfied to some degree but I can see nothing in the Bill to the effect that the Authority will not retain their functioning powers while that is taking place.</P>
    <P>The section is too weak and that is why we have tabled the amendment. I agree with the authority the Minister is holding under section 17 but the putting of it into operation is another matter.  If he was confronted some <Col N="118" /> morning with a blatant breach of that section he would have to take the matter before the Cabinet.  If the Cabinet decided to remove the Authority the Minister must move a motion to this effect in this House, but that does not interfere with the function of the Authority in the meantime. That is the great weakness of the section.  The Minister will find that our amendment strengthens the Bill and will help the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the cogent arguments put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I cannot see how the Minister finds anything objectionable in the amendment we have put forward. The Minister reserves the right to order, under section 17, that a matter should not be broadcast if he considers it a danger to the State but, at the same time, if that order is flouted and he fires the Authority, the Authority still have 30 days in which they can do what they like. It seems to me that it would be most logical that the Authority would be suspended and that suspension would come before the House to be confirmed. I can see no difference in the sentence, as it were, on the Authority if the Minister has to do what we had to do in our time.  We all recall vividly the Minister's reaction at that time. So do all the members of RTE.</P>
      <P>Basically there is no difference.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, it is left wide open for the Authority to do what they like for a period.  It is possible that the Dáil could be recalled the next day.  I will not say a lot of damage would be done because that would be under-estimating the intelligence of the Irish people.  The fact is that they could become mavericks overnight. Acceptance of Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment would not change the principle enshrined in section 2 of the Minister's Bill.  I do not see how it would in any way change the sentiments expressed there.  All it does is strengthen another institution of the State.  Whether we like it or not, the broadcasting system is an institution of the State, and a very vital one.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is an inconsistency between sections 2 and 17.  The Minister quite <Col N="119" /> properly is taking power similar to the power under the old Act.  It is very important that he should.  The Minister suggested that it had been said responsibility was being transferred to the Dáil.  He is correct in saying that is not what is happening.  Under section 2 the Minister is removing some measure of responsibility from himself to the Dáil.  I do not think this is wise.  He could find himself in a situation where matter he felt should not be put across was being broadcast.  So far as I can see, he has no power to ensure that it is not broadcast other than by making an order.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he could not visualise a situation in which the Authority could get into the type of difficulties which would require him to have this power.  I do not think any Authority have ever got into difficulties because of their own actions. Difficulties which arose for Authorities in the past arose from activities further down the line.  This is where the problem can arise.  Because executive authority is needed, and should be seen to be there, we are suggesting that the Minister should reconsider section 2 and strengthen it somewhat. I assure the Minister this is not put forward as a party political issue but because of a genuine concern that whoever is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should be in a reasonably secure position to defend the rights of this Parliament and of the people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not intend to delay the House.  We have put our views on this matter.  We considered it very seriously.  We looked at the Minister's section and we came to some of the conclusions I have outlined. We thought there was a weakness in it and that it needed to be strengthened.  We drafted this amendment. We believe it does not go too far.  It would modify the old Act. It would lead to a better working relationship with the Authority.  It possesses the ingredients the Minister wants.  The Minister requires a certain <Col N="120" /> authority.  This is important in all walks of life.  We did not put forward the amendment to try to reenact the 1960 Act.  As it is drafted, it is removed from section 6 of the 1960 Act.  It gives the necessary power to the Minister.  I do not know why we on this side of the House should be giving additional power to the Minister, but we believe he requires it to carry out his duties efficiently.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of the amendment gives the Director-General and the remaining members of the Authority power to carry out their functions until such time as the new Authority are appointed.  The Minister does not see fit to accept the amendment. Bringing section 2 before the House is only an exercise which is intended to make it look more democratic. The Minister has made up his mind that, before he will move any resolution in this House, he will remove a member or members of the Authority.  There is no doubt about that.  We are more unvarnished in our approach.  We are more pragmatic. Ours is a direct approach. We are not looking for the great powers which some people might accuse us of seeking.  Before doing so, I hope they will read the amendment. I hope the Minister is never caught in a situation during his term in office where he will have to invoke section 2 of this Bill.  If the day arrives when the Minister has made a decision to bring a resolution into the House to remove a member of the Authority, he will find himself in an embarrassing position putting his case in the House while the members he wants to remove will be exercising full authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as Deputies opposite are preoccupied I want to be very brief.  I should like to make some progress with this Bill. If Deputies are genuinely concerned about the concept that the Minister may lack power to act in an emergency situation, I would draw their attention to the powers already possessed by the Minister under section 16 of the 1960 Act.  Section 16 (3) (b) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During any emergency declared <Col N="121" /> under section 10 of the Act of 1926, the Minister may suspend any licence under this subsection...</P>
    <P>That is the licence to broadcast.</P>
    <P>...and, while any such suspension continues, the Minister may operate any service which was provided by the Authority under the suspended licence.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to provide any necessary emergency power a Minister could possibly require and, if Deputies are genuinely worried about this, and I accept they may be, I think that is the answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the particular section and I have not had an opportunity of studying it.  The Minister has only brought this out now and what was exercising my mind was the fact that the former RTE Authority were fired, not for their actions but for failure to control certain actions, as the Minister must be well aware, after many repeated warnings.</P>
      <P>The point is that once the Authority are put on notice they are going to be suspended, or fired, or whatever word one likes to use, they would completely lose all authority over the people who were responsible for putting them in a position they could not control.  While I would find it difficult to visualise anyone doing this, the possiblity is always there.  Now the amendment is basically no different from the Minister's section except that we say that, where the Minister finds it necessary to remove the Authority, he should be able to do that immediately by coming before the House and having this decision ratified, but until such time as the decision is ratified, or otherwise, the Authority are suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in codding ourselves that the Minister has suddenly become more democratic.  It is very easy in Opposition to be slightly, if I may use a euphemism, irresponsible, but we have always regarded the responsibility of Government as a very serious function. It is something the people expect from a Government.  They endorse a Government and they elect a Government to carry responsibility and, if a Government fail to be strong when <Col N="122" /> they should be strong, they lose the respect of the people and the whole fabric of society is under attack with danger of a possible takeover.</P>
    <P>What the Minister proposes and what we propose is practically identical. All we are asking the Minister to do is to be strong and have the courage of his convictions.  As Deputy Brugha said, the matter could well be not the fault of the Authority.  It could be something happening within the organisation and there would be a lack of power of control.  As far as section 10 is concerned, at that stage we would have something approximating to a military situation where the forces of the State are brought in to take over the station and guard it.  It could be described as a <i>coup d'état.</i> If it came to that situation we would have a real state of emergency which would not end with the dismissal of the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not wise in refusing to accept this amendment. We fully appreciate that in 1960 the Oireachtas in its wisdom saw at that time it was necessary for the Government to have power to remove the Authority.  Now we have a situation where the present Minister feels this can be improved upon.  This is where the Minister is making a very great mistake.  He is not facing up to his responsibility.  He is trying to pass on to the Dáil and Seanad powers conferred on the Government under the 1960 Act.  I know the argument can be advanced that if the Government instruct the Minister or agree with the Minister that the Authority should be removed the Minister can come here and start proceedings.  Now the Government parties have a majority though at times it is a very slender majority as we saw on two or three occasions in the past few weeks when dealing with the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill or the importation of furniture from abroad.  On three occasions the majority was as small as it could be.  If an emergency situation arises, the Minister must come to the House, and remembering what happened on the occasions I mention, and the kind of Government we have, a Coalition Government comprised of <Col N="123" /> two parties, where it is obvious agreement is not shared, or the majority do not rule with the consent of the minority on all occasions, the Minister could find himself in this Labour-Fine Gael Coalition in difficulty in getting Dáil Éireann to approve the removal of the Authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully, though I was engaged on other work, on the monitor to the arguments and when the Minister hears what I have to say I think he will readily agree with me.</P>
      <P>The removal of members of the Authority might unfortunately arise&mdash; I say &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; purposely and I hope it will be a very rare thing. However, if such an occasion did arise, I want the Minister to understand that he must be in a position to do his job properly.  The Minister may not have given due consideration to the practical problems that could arise when he comes to this House and if he were able to get the legislation through this House he might have further problems in the Seanad.  All of this would take time&mdash;it could be a prolonged period&mdash;and a Government might not be too happy about it, particularly if an emergency situation existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were a time lag or a delay in the Minister acting in a responsible fashion, can we imagine the situation that would develop if the Dáil or the Seanad were in recess?  Can we imagine an instance where a Government with a majority of one or two were forced to recall the Dáil during the summer recess to deal with the situation of the kind I spoke about? It is perfectly reasonable to assume that some Members might go abroad on holiday when they could not be contacted easily.  We might have a situation where the Government, because of their inability to locate their members who would give them a majority in the House, would not be able to get the House to reassemble in order to get the legislation through.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's <Col N="124" /> amendment is a good one.  It gives the Government the means to deal responsibly with an emergency situation.</P>
    <P>I understand there is no power of suspension.  I do not know where members of the Government go on holiday.  I wish them a pleasant holiday wherever they go; I mean that because I am sure all of them deserve it, as does every Member of the House.  This is particularly so in view of the long summer session we had last year.  We would not like to see too many such sessions because they were physically very severe even on the younger Members, not to mind some of the older Members.  It could easily arise that members of the Government party might not be easily contacted.  By their own actions, the Minister and the Government are tying their hands and they are not facing up to their responsibilities. They are putting themselves in a corner where they will not be able to act responsibly in an emergency situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have another look at this amendment.  I hope he does not have occasion to deal with an Authority under this section.  In fact, there is every likelihood that the Minister will not have to deal with an Authority under this section because of the proper guidelines that were laid down by the previous Authority and which have been implemented, almost line by line and word by word, by the Authority the present Minister has appointed.  I gather their term of office expires at the end of next May.  Any Government would not want to put themselves in a situation where they were hanging by the collars of their own coats, where they were helpless and not in a position to take any action during the summer months or the Christmas period.  It would be extremely difficult for the Ceann Comhairle or the Clerk of the Dáil to get this House assembled for a period of two or three weeks.  If the Government think it desirable that such a situation should be allowed to occur, their thinking is all wrong.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made by previous speakers that in this day <Col N="125" /> when there is unrest in so many countries that the principal target of people who want to cause unrest are broadcasting premises, both radio and television.  Many charges have been made in this House by Members of this and other parties in the last four or five years.  Many people are of the belief that the Provisional IRA would never have been as popular or would not have been given the footing they have but for the way they were glamorised in Telefís Éireann in the early days.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared.  We must not tie our hands, as this section seemingly does, when we are dealing with people whose sole aim in life is to cause unrest and chaos in countries such as ours.  At least the Minister should have the power of suspension. As in the 1960 Act, the Government should have the power to remove the Authority.  By going along with the section in the Bill the Government will be allowing a situation to develop where their hands will be tied for many days in certain cases, and for long periods particularly on account of the way this House operates.  If there was something controversial in the suspension or removal of the Authority and if the Government had to depend on a majority of one or two in their parties to get legislation through, and if they were not happy or satisfied that full membership was available to them, then the Minister and the Government Whip would be extremely slow to reconvene the House to get such a proposal agreed in this House before going to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Minister for Education to formulate a suitable policy for third level non-university education and calls on him to establish the NCEA as the certificate, diploma and degree awarding authority in that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to say is very simple. <Col N="126" /> The Minister and the Government made a grave mistake and the purpose of the motion is to try to have it remedied.  Speaking on a similar motion last year the Minister is quoted at column 90 of Volume 278 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>...we decided to initiate the establishment of the structures necessary to secure a comprehensive system of third level education in this country. We took this decision having considered all the advice available to us.</P>
    <P>He spoke about equality of opportunity in access to higher education and the recognition of courses and qualifications.  I move this motion because I am convinced that having any other authority than the NCEA assessing, validating, and awarding degrees at this level is divisive not merely in the third level area generally but in the institutions themselves. I want to know how the Minister and the Government can contend that they are moving towards a comprehensive position in third level education when they are actually introducing a system where the NCEA are bestowing, validating and awarding diplomas and certificates and where some university, if one can be found to do so, will award degrees in the same institutions. You have a university presence at the top and an NCEA presence at the lower reaches.  How can this be called an effort at comprehensivisation by any sane person?</P>
    <P>I was puzzled at the time and the results of the action have left me more puzzled that anybody could attempt to defend that as a movement towards comprehensivation.  Surely the Minister for Education, the willing or unwilling messenger boy of the Government in this matter must regard his role as absurd.  Last year he set off like a travelling salesman to try to sell to some university college the awarding of the degree for the graduates of the National College of Physical Education in Limerick.  The Minister is a good salesman but he failed to sell and when he failed to sell he came back to the NCEA and the NCEA conferred the degree at the end of last year on <Col N="127" /> those people.  They were expecting to do so.  The Minister is wedded to the idea of university conferring at the top &mdash;the wedding is supposed to have been forced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the Minister for Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, well aimed.  The university refused and he has to fall back then on the kept woman, the NCEA, to come to his aid when his advances are refused by the universities. This has already happened in the case of the National College of Physical Education in Limerick.  The university does not oblige, so back to the NCEA.  This is a degrading position for the NCEA to find themselves in and that council are very worthy of the respect which they have earned since set up as an active body some time ago.  Last year was not one of action in this regard, the Minister is away again, he has his wares in his bag and he is going around to the universities to ask them if they will confer degrees on the graduates of the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick in June of this year.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate students have been writing to me to try to find out what is happening&mdash;who is conferring the degree on them at the end of this year. I put down a question to the Minister and the Minister said everything is all right&mdash;things are under consideration, the NUI is considering, he is is considering, everyone is considering, but the students do not yet know who will confer degrees on them at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not good enough, it is a dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister even within the terms of his proposal/decisions of November, 1974, He has had lots of time to remove this worry from the minds of the students who are now starting to campaign to draw attention to this matter.  A decision on the matter is not good enough <Col N="128" /> in a final year in a third level institution.</P>
    <P>Why should the students have to worry about who will confer degrees on them?  Deputies, O'Malley, Collins, Noonan and Herbert have asked me to raise this matter by way of a private motion.  Some Deputies from the Government side were worried about it and expressed their worry to me, but the Minister obviously has silenced them.  They cannot open their mouths.  Whatever he is hatching seems to be a secret from everybody, from Deputies on his own side, but particularly from the students.  There are 80 people about to graduate next summer from the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  It was established as a national institute and it is a national disgrace that those students should be kept in this position&mdash;80 young men and women who do not know what their academic future is. It is a cavalier manner of saying: &ldquo;The NUI are considering the matter, I will have an answer within a short time&rdquo;.  This is not good enough in a serious matter of considering the future of those people.</P>
    <P>Is this rationalisation?  Is this what the Minister and the Government mean by rationalisation?  It is a very funny interpretation of the word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;.  The whole business is irrational.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming in here with a great flourish of trumpets, carrying the flag for the underprivileged in relation to third-level education.  One would have thought that out of this dedication some clarity of objective would emerge. There is no clarity.  Nothing has been done.  People still do not know where they stand.  I remember 16th December, 1974 when the Minister made his announcement and sent out a copy of the proposals.  In the week before the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he was arrogating to himself all responsibility for the technological end of things in the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Education was defending his portfolio he would have run the Minister for Industry and Commerce to blazes out of his office and said that he would look after technological education.  He would have a far better chance of getting a rational system going than he has in those circumstances.  I have deplored the failure of the Minister for Education to formulate a suitable policy.  The evidence that his policy is not suitable is there in the disquiet of the students.  Even a person as self-satisfied as the Minister for Industry and Commerce must know that the students are dissatisfied.  Every paper is full of their dissatisfaction.  I gather that the Limerick people intend to make some kind of formal protest when they should be in the lecture halls and trying to get jobs for themselves next year instead of having to come up to get a positive decision out of the Minister with regard to the awarding of their degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend that the whole idea of the reluctant university conferring a degree as the final award in what is now non-university third level education should be dropped.  It was a crazy idea from the beginning.  It had nothing to do with comprehensivisation.  It had a lot to do with confusion, with <Col N="130" /> making a <i>pot pourri</i> of what is now third level non-university education. It is unworkable obviously.  The National College of Physical Education failed to get a university to award a degree last year.  The problem of the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick must be a difficult one because no solution has been offered.  We do not know what has happened.  The Minister has no answer except that somebody, the NUI and the Department, are in consultation about it.  I do not know to what effect.</P>
    <P>The hotel management course in Galway, the two plus one plus one course has been accepted as a degree course by the NCEA if my information is correct.  Who will reward that degree?  Will the Minister have to get that into a salesman's bag, trot around to the universities with it and ask them also to validate it?  If he is refused will he be back again to the NCEA to confer a degree, which is what they did last year, despite the Minister's decision that the NCEA would have no degree-awarding powers?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to rescind this proposal because it is divisive.  If we are to accept the ideas of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was in here before, it is making fish out of one part of an institution and flesh out of another.  This is what it boils down to.  On the contrary, if the NCEA were rewarding certificates, diplomas and degrees, it would unify the whole system.  I do not go along with all this bourgeois talk about the university being somehow more respectable than the technological institute which seems to me to be the basis of this whole nonsense.  Why should the degree, which was rewarded last year by the NCEA to the National College of Physical Education in Limerick, not be as good as the one awarded by a medieval university? Of course it is.  It is only a notion in people's minds.  If the certificates are two years, the diplomas are three years and the degrees are four years and are assessed, validated and awarded by the NCEA I submit that that is a stronger tendency towards comprehensivisation than what the Minister proposes to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> The Minister has a kind of transplant or a graft on to what is now third level non-university and in the manner of heart transplant it looks as if at student level and at teacher level that this transplant will be rejected. If there are deficiencies&mdash;I am convinced there are&mdash;there are no deficiencies in that particular sphere. There are deficiencies in financing from the point of view of buildings, staff and so on.  I agree with both the Minister for Education and the Minister for Industry and Commerce when they say that it is necessary that the standard of buildings, amenities, salaries and so forth should be at the same level and should not be at a lower level than any other third level university institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same debate. It is Volume 278, No. 1.  I do not know what column it is.  It is February, 1975.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce in particular referred to the salaries, buildings, length of teaching week and so on at that time. I presume the Minister for Education is in total agreement with that.</P>
      <P>When I suggested that on a certain limited number of occasions the NCA should also award degrees in the regional technical colleges, I was accused of attempting to proliferate the degree thing and possibly weaken it, make it too common and less worthy.  This was not my intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, I am taking the case of a very good head of a Department, in Plastics in Athlone RTC where after diploma level there is a fourth year in operation at the moment and where professional examinations are taken at the end of the fourth year by the students who have already been awarded a diploma by the NCEA. When a course like that achieves internationally recognised standards, this is where it is important that the NCEA should have degree-awarding powers.  Again, I do not wish to expand on this.  In that instance, in <Col N="132" /> special advanced plastic technology, very high standards were reached and even awards in competition with similar technical institutes all over Great Britain were gained by students.  In such cases the NCEA should have degree-awarding powers and should award degrees.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with the Government that the RTCs were basically established by Deputy Faulkner for the training of technicians and the provision of the type of trained personnel that a modern society needs particularly in industry and business.  That is conceded.  Perhaps when I mentioned this I was not explicit enough and people thought I meant that the NCEA should be awarding degrees all over the place.  Indeed, the new terms of reference for the NCEA would demand that there would be co-ordination and that the overall picture should be taken into consideration. There have been dedicated individuals, individuals of ability who have made such great contributions in every sphere, including the technological sphere, that that encouragement should be there and the facility to reward such effort and dedication should be there by the NCEA having degree-awarding power in specific cases.</P>
    <P>What the Government are supposed to be doing&mdash;and they have not succeeded at all as far as I know and I hope they do not in the interests of education of the country&mdash;is to get the universities to award degrees in some of these institutions.  What they are doing is putting the university pitch-cap on the head of the present non-university system, and it is burning it and will burn it right through because if a degree has to be taken at the end of the course the bright student who wants to proceed through certificate, diploma to degree will be geared to final examination, to the final year, the final assessment and method of it.  If a university wants to maintain itself, it will have to have a strong say in the final examination or assessment of what happens.  Some of the university colleges have stated that they have no competence in many of the educational spheres that are catered for by, say, the National <Col N="133" /> Institute of Higher Education.  If I understand correctly, the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick, in a modular system, for four years now has been carrying out this continuous assessment of its pupils.  What happens if a university is asked then to award a degree? Does the Minister expect the university to say: &ldquo;Right, you follow your system, you assess them, you tell me if they have graduated and I will confer the degree&rdquo; or does he expect the university to play a stronger role in the final assessment, and, if so, what kind of role?</P>
    <P>The whole matter is confused because it is based on proposals which were misguided and which, if the grapevine is right, the Minister for Education himself was not too happy with.  I know the Minister is reluctant to meet the union of students in the National Institute of Higher Education. I think he said he would not meet them because they were socialists. Would you believe that?</P>

      <P>The union feels that the NCEA degree would have the following advantages:</P>
      <P>(a)  The degree is awarded by a national body who are set up to monitor national standards.</P>
      <P>(b)  The National Council for Educational Awards would be validating and awarding both the NIHE diploma and degree.</P>

    <P>(d)  The NCEA would act as an independent body to ensure that <Col N="134" /> the NIHE retains and fosters its technological ethos.</P>
    <P>I am sure that is a sound kind of thing to set in front of them.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>(e)  The NCEA has gained public acceptability.</P>
    <P>That is also true, but in the light of the way it has been brought forward to confer degrees by the Minister when it suits and brought back then and left in the background and produced again if he fails to get a university college to confer in Limerick, public acceptance is a miracle. It has gained public acceptance because of the quality of its work, the quality of its personnel and the work of its committees. What we want is a Bill now setting up the NCEA statutorily, with certificate, diploma and degree conferring powers.  I think it is essential to clear away the fog which is enveloping third level non-university education at present.  Give it the power&mdash;certificate, diploma and degree&mdash;and this will have a more unifying effect on third level education than I think the Minister or his colleagues would be prepared to admit. I would like the Minister to wake up to the need for clarity.  He knows quite well that it is the mark of the student to be independent, anti-authority and so on, but he wants at the same time to be sure of something, to have an anchor.  There is a yearning there for a basic anchor and he will have it if the Minister introduces a Bill setting up the NCEA as a certificate-, diploma- and degree-awarding body.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to the relationship between the NCEA domain and the university domain and I do not think it is a question of which is respectable&mdash;the Ballsbridge-Foxrock kind of talk does not mean very much when one goes outside the Castleknock Gate or heads out past Inchicore for Naas.  It has no <i>fundamentum in re</i> at all.  What is the important question is how this sector will relate to the university sector and I think that a great deal of study&mdash;far more study than was given to this matter by the Cabinet sub-committee which foisted <Col N="135" /> these proposals on the Minister and the Government&mdash;and time should be given to it.  The NIHE is only four years old.  I do not want to wander into the field of university colleges not going to be allowed to stay on their own after 130 years, but there have been some interesting studies of this whole business of the technology and how it should relate to the university sector.  Some of the studies in certain fields were undertaken at the behest of the NCEA and I quoted elsewhere from an article in summary in <i>Studies</i> where Dr. Hession of UCD talked about the mistakes made in the technological sector in Germany, where it was too technological and too little conceptual&mdash;the word he uses&mdash;claiming that in the university, the conceptual element would be paramount.</P>
    <P>I am sure that this in part was the concern of some of the Ministers who spoke on this matter and it is to their credit, but my contention is that this conceptual element in technological education can be given <i>in situ.</i> It is not necessary that it be given in the university.  When the Germans apparently made a mistake of being over-technological and giving too little attention to the conceptual end of this education, apparently there was a complete failure when rapid technological change meant re-educating. The foundation was weak on which they had to build and apparently they changed over.  My contention is that bringing in the university to award degrees at the top of the third level non-university education does not solve this problem at all.  It can be resolved in the third level non-technological college itself.</P>
    <P>I do not conceive of the results of what I am proposing here as being the development of too rigid structures, completely apart and not touching at all.  What I am saying is that it will take time to solve the interrelationship, the arrangement of horizontal and vertical mobility within the system.  At the very beginning, there could be mobility post-graduate.  In other words, the university colleges and the non-university third level colleges could have reciprocity at post-graduate <Col N="136" /> level, which would be one way to start, particularly in scientific research and so on.  What I am asking for is that the Minister and his colleagues, who seem to be more dedicated to the cause than the Minister himself, should give up this idea of the transplant, because the system will reject it, and sensibly bring in a Bill here in respect of which the Minister will get from this side of the House nothing but help, a Bill which will establish the NCEA in its rightful role as a unifying force in the third level non-university sector, awarding certificates, diplomas and degrees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment set down in the name of the Minister for Education:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the Government's decisions on third-level non-university education as expressed in the terms of reference framed for the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, and the re-constituted National Council for Educational Awards.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, first, that I speak as someone interested and involved in third level education all his life, not involved in the non-university sector but an onlooker at it and someone who, therefore, has not detailed expertise but at least that experience of spending all my adult life in third level education.  I want to say, too, that in regard to matters of detail, these are things which are not my job in regard to education and on which I do not propose to touch.  I propose to try to raise a fundamental debate on this subject.  I thought I would have the opportunity and hoped I would be able to reply to what Deputy Wilson has said and I kept thinking that he was about to come to the point but when he sat down, I found that he did not do so at any stage.  Essentially he said two things: what about the NCEA awards and the 80 students in the NIHE down in Limerick?  That, <Col N="137" /> with the various nuances, cadences and rhetoric was the sum of what he had to say.</P>
    <P>There is a real problem about the inter-relationship of the different bits of third level education.  It is not just in Ireland; it is world-wide and it is not just for this moment for a couple of institutions, NCEA and NIHE; it is for decades.  It is therefore a large and fundamental problem and one I want to discuss in general terms.</P>
    <P>To set out the problem, and, hopefully, to indicate that it is acknowledged to be international, I should like to give a quotation which seems to set the alternatives in regard to third level education in a concise way and in a way that is neutral in regard to Ireland. I wish to quote from a publication of the OECD of 1975, called, &ldquo;Recurrent Education: Trends and Issues.&rdquo; That report is about the recurrent education which is only a small part of the problem.  I am not suggesting that it deals specifically with what we are discussing.  Nonetheless the following quotation is relevant and tidy because it sets the matter out neatly:</P>
    <P>As far as the relationship between the non-traditional and the traditional sectors of education is concerned governments have so far responded in one of three ways:</P>
    <P>(1)  by creating what in the United Kingdom has been called, &ldquo;a binary system&rdquo;, treating the traditional and non-traditional sectors as separate entities;</P>
    <P>(2)  by regarding post-secondary education as a totality and creating an integrated but diversified system embodying all its institutional manifestations and coordinating them as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The report went on to give examples from Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The report continued:</P>
    <P>(3)  by treating the two sectors as interdependent, for example Norway.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to mention France, some states in the United States and the provinces of Canada.  I have quoted that to indicate that the problem is world-wide and real.  It is real <Col N="138" /> because of the nature of the way third level education evolved.  It evolved almost 1,000 years ago in one of its current components, in the university bit.  That was a narrow speciality to produce the literate and expert people needed to run society, to produce a ruling elite.</P>
    <P>Many of the things that have since become incorporated into what is done in third level university education originated right outside it in totally different circumstances.  One example is the origin of surgery, in barbers guilds which has been subsumed into what is now understood as third level university education.  There are many other examples.  In the last 200 years, and with increasing and, recently with explosive speed, we have had a revolution in industry and, simultaneously and separately from it, we have had a revolution in technology.  Much of that technology and technology-based industry arose from people who were not the product of a university.  If one considers the invention of the steam engine, the invention of the aeroplane, the Bairds, the Edisons or the Bells, none of them came from the university strand.  Yet, the things they started produced an ever-growing body of science which became incorporated into university third level education, whether it was from a steam engine, the branches of engineering, the bits of thermodynamics that became the engineering and science and physics faculties.  What has happened is that two separate things have grown up. One of the technological sides related to the industrial revolution but becoming, from simple beginnings more and more complex because there is now nothing more complex than the mathematics of computers.  There is nothing more complex than advanced aeronautics.</P>
    <P>Having started with a skilled man with good hands making a product to fill a need it evolved into something at the very pinnacle of complexity of human understanding, of human elaboration and of human science and was therefore taken into and absorbed into what is a university. Those sort of people are profoundly needed in society.  The two strands started separately and are, inevitably, <Col N="139" /> moving together.  The task, especially for a country like Ireland which has to catch up in the industrial and technological revolution and which has to use its resources to the best advantage because we are poor in relation to this sort of expenditure, in relation to the buying of computers and the big physics machines and the heavy research expenditures, is to put those components, which exist in every country going through the evolution that we are going through, together in the way which is most humane, most national, most efficient in the use of resources and, above all, that is most guaranteed to enlarge human liberty and to break down the compartments between different bits of human knowledge and culture.</P>
    <P>It is easy to formulate that task and I have indicated that the response to it has been different in different countries.  In regard to the binary system, I am depressed that Deputy Wilson did not seem to think that anything else was possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>He talked fine but it did not seem to affect what he said because he seemed to think that the task was one of putting the two strands of the binary system together, humanely and rationally.  The whole point of the Government policy is that the existence of those two strands is a bad thing and that it ought to be ended.  It cannot be ended violently and suddenly.  The whole thrust of policy should be to do nothing that will perpetuate the division and to do everything that will make the fusion of those two strands possible in a humane, democratic and reasonable way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we are finding some common ground on an objective.  I have spent enough time talking about the way in which these <Col N="140" /> different components of third level evolved.  There is, what one might call, a debating point in saying that not to have certificates, diplomas and degrees awarded by the same institution is divisive.  It seems to me &mdash;I say this sincerely&mdash;that it is no more that a debating point.  The leaving certificate is a certificate of a particular narrow sort of knowledge. Is the argument that the same institution should award a leaving certificate as awards the BA and not to have the certificate and degree awarded by the same institution is divisive?  That is a semantic argument. It is not an argument about the core&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the secondary educators have been complaining for years that the university requirements have had too severe an effect on the leaving certificate?  That is precisely my argument in regard to the degree at the top of the technological sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I diametrically misunderstood the Deputy because I thought that the thrust of his argument was that to have degrees, diplomas and certificates awarded in any other way than by the same institution was devisive and the only source of unity was to have them all given by the same institution.  I quoted an example from the secondary to university stream, one of the strands, to indicate that that is not a demand that is necessary, practical or advantageous. We have one stream going through from primary to secondary to university third level and, of course, we can have certificates awarded at one level and degrees awarded at the other level.  It is only a semantic argument in favour of unity to say that if we want unity we should give them all the different degrees.</P>
      <P>I am using the word &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; in two senses.  We can scrub it out.  All the different sorts of indications of a particular skill should be given by the same institution.  The core of it is really about a unified system or a binary system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What interests me in the reaction <Col N="141" /> of the Opposition&mdash;it interests me, but it does not surprise me because I say, with regret, that over the period I can remember their existence and, indeed, over the half century they are celebrating this year of their existance&mdash;is that they seem to have reversed their position from being genuinely radical, genuinely full of innovations to now being profoundly conservative and opportunist.</P>

There is the division of culture on the one hand and that which is characterised as non-culture on the other hand.  Culture is indivisible. Culture is a human unity and the institutions for conveying that culture ought to be as unified as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the reality not just in Ireland but all over the world.  The Deputy quoted something about German education.  If one can judge by the cultural, and economic, and technological and scientific successes of Germany, there is something damn good about their education. Lincoln said about a general who was drinking whiskey that if people would only find out what whiskey it was and send it to his other generals, they might improve. If we look at the performance of Germany in the world we ought to be impressed by their educational system. If we look at the performance of the Scandinavian countries, and particularly Sweden, we ought to be profoundly impressed by their educational system.  What the Opposition want to do is to nail us to the binary <Col N="143" /> system characterised by the OECD uniquely as the British system, and who wants the scientific, the cultural, the technological, the educational performance of the United Kingdom? I say that with no contempt for them, but merely observing that over a century and a half for them it has been downhill all the way, and recently rather rapidly.  If you want to make comparisons between different countries and their general performance, or particular performance, in particular sectors, stay away from the British example, and stay away from what the British do, because it has not been so good.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a party with radical traditions.  It is deeply depressing that Deputy Wilson who I have been told is a good teacher.  I agree with many of his ideas about culture and its role in society.  When he speaks my reaction is: &ldquo;That is fine.  I feel the same way&rdquo;.  But, please, can he not see that the effect of the binary system is to slow up the recognition of the new knowledge and its use in our society?  Can he not see what it is doing in a world that is becoming more and more fragmented, where Snow was writing about two cultures long before we raised the question, where the two cultures are a real problem?</P>

      <P>Why does the Deputy not accept the full thrust of policy? I am not talking about the detail. I am talking about the whole thrust of policy and everything the Minister for Education has done fits into the <Col N="147" /> pattern of moving up possible, reasonable and democratic steps, but consistant, coherent steps, towards a unified system.  With the history of the past we cannot impose a unified system.  We cannot kick people into it.  We have to do it by talking and persuading.  We cannot wield the big stick.  We cannot abolish jobs and destroy people's prospects of promotion. We have to do it by nudging them in the direction of a completely unified and humane and completely democratic single culture solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we have to do and, in my view, everything the Minister for Education has done and is doing is moving in that direction. All the bits fit into the pattern &mdash;not of wielding the big stick but of urging people and persuading people and coaxing people towards a solution so much better than the alternative that I continue to be filled with amazement that the Opposition can oppose it.  We are, I think, seeing an irony in Irish political life and I am glad the Minister for Education is sitting beside me to hear me say this because I would rather say it in his presence.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been given the reputation of being a conservative by certain sectors.</P>

      <P>The effect of that image has prevented people from realising that the policy for third level which he is espousing and bringing on in reasonable and patient steps to fruition is the most radical thing ever offered to third level education in the history of the State.  That is the <Col N="148" /> truth of it but the image, even to intelligent people, has obscured that truth.  It has obscured it from the students and I would appeal to the students, through the medium of this Parliament, to think deeply enough and look at the issue and not take sides superficially and light heartedly because they think x, y or z is liberal or x, y or z is conservative.  Let them look at it and if they look at it, then how can they possibly believe that the maintenance of a binary system is democratic and, leading to the second strain in our cuture, has a fair place and a fair role?  The students protest under the banners of progress and principle and they seem to me to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It may be they do not think it but, if they analyse the steps that are being taken, they will find that what I say is the truth.  If you want instant action you wield the big stick.  If you want democratic and humane action, you have to be patient.  All the steps are towards comprehensiveness and towards a libertarian solution and towards the end of class domination in third level education, and towards equality of opportunity in third level education, and towards the abolition of two cultures in third level education.  They are profoundly radical steps which I &mdash;in this particular context you can attach any labels you like and I will proudly accept them&mdash;am profoundly glad to be associated with, profoundly glad to be associated with this progressive policy, a policy which in retrospect will be looked upon as one of the most important innovations in the first term in office of a Coalition Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indicative of where control of this particular facet <Col N="149" /> of education lies that we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce concerning himself so deeply with educational matters on a Private Members' motion on higher education.  I have no doubt his purpose is to ensure that his colleague, the Minister for Education, takes a proper attitude towards the Cabinet sub-committee which the Minister for Education so obviously dislikes.  He knows that the sub-committee overturned and disregarded all the long, tedious work done over the years in an endeavour to give the best possible facilities available to third level education and substituted the results of a few discussions which, of necessity, had got to be very short because of the duties of the Ministers involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce appears to think he has only to throw charges across the floor of the House and, the doing of that makes them true, such as the statements he made about our attitude&mdash;as he states it&mdash;about the binary system.  In the last debate on higher education the Minister for Education wanted to know whether or not we favoured the binary system and I told him our record in relation to comprehensive education was second to none and proof of that is there for anyone who wishes to see it.  I myself endeavoured to the best of my ability as Minister to ensure comprehensive education was available to all our young people through, for example, the community school system and I can say now to this Government that I got very little support or help from them in my efforts to make comprehensive education available at second level.  There was no reason to believe that, having proceeded along these particular lines in secondary education, we would not continue them in third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about bringing the two systems together in a humane way. That is exactly what we wanted and, as Deputy Wilson has already stated, it cannot be done in a humane way if we are unconcerned about the consequences of our actions to one of the streams.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks that handing <Col N="150" /> out degrees by a particular university which is not associated with the institution attended by the students is a new system of comprehensive education he has quite a considerable amount to learn.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke here in an airyfairy way about the differences between the facilities available in relation to the two strands of education. Surely the building and the facilities at the higher institute in Limerick are better than those that are available in some of our universities.  If one were to follow in a logical way what the Minister said, does this mean that precedence is being given to the technical and technological side?  I do not think that is what he meant but he did not show very much logic in his argument.</P>
    <P>One of the most important factors which should exercise the mind of the Minister in coming to a decision on a matter of this kind is the fact that the students are demanding that the degrees be awarded by the National Council of Educational Awards.  One should remember that it is not as though the students were expressing dissatisfaction with an older system and demanding that procedures relating to the award of degrees by UCD or TCD should be changed in a radical way.  In circumstances such as that one could appreciate the need for slow, careful and thorough examination of such a request and its possible objection.</P>
    <P>Here we are faced with an entirely new set of circumstances.  The National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick admitted its first students in 1972 and they were enrolled in five major study areas.  The work of this new college was based primarily on a technological content with a significant element of the humanities.  The new institute is something new in Irish education.  In my view it has a significant contribution to make to third level education in Ireland in providing us with a new and increasingly important form of higher education.  Its primary purpose is the application of scientific knowledge and method and it is a type of education that had been lacking previously to a great extent.</P>
    <P>In the new institute in Limerick we have a third-level institute which <Col N="151" /> has an opportunity never before afforded to any body to develop completely in its own way without being restricted by the tradition and usage of a university.  It has an opportunity of achieving an eminence which would place the National Institute of Higher Education at Limerick in the forefront of non-university education in the world.  By endeavouring to place third-level technical and technological education under the aegis of the universities, by giving the universities the right to award degrees in the NIHE, the Government are taking from the institute the power to continue to develop on its own lines.  In my view it is placing a restriction on it which cannot but harm the future of the institute.</P>
    <P>The Government have suggested that the status of the institute in Limerick would be enhanced by having degrees awarded by the universities. As I said on a previous occasion when debating higher education here, such a line of thinking could emanate only from the minds of the academics in the Government who have little or no appreciation of technical or technological education.  To them an aura attaches to academic education which places it in a category far above technical and technological education and, in such circumstances, the attitude of the Government could be regarded as logical.  Of course it is not logical because it is based on a wrong premise.  University and non-university third-level education are equal partners so far as this party are concerned and neither can claim precedence over the other.  It can be said that far more young people can reach fulfilment and can have their attitudes and abilities developed to the fullest extent in the technical field than they can in the academic field.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that should the National Council of Educational Awards have the authority on a statutory basis to award degrees to students in the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick the institute will have a real opportunity to attain an eminent place in the world of education.  From the knowledge <Col N="152" /> I have of the director of the institute and of the staff, I have no doubt that within a relatively short time the degrees will achieve a distinction and a status of their own which will redound to the credit of the institute and of the country.  What the Minister is offering them is second-rate qualification.  He is asking the students in that institute to accept qualifications from a university which cannot possibly have the necessary deep insight into the objectives of the courses there.  In my view, the degrees would simply be labels which have very little meaning.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt about the competence and the capacity of the National Council of Educational Awards to award degrees.  Perhaps it might be worthwhile to have a look at the NCEA and its background.  When the regional technical colleges were being set up we were concerned that the awards gained as a result of attendance at regional technical colleges and colleges of technology should be seen to have a nationally recognisable status.  In this way it would enhance the attractiveness of the courses offered in these colleges and would encourage young people to attend them.  The then Government referred the matter of establishing a body that would award national qualifications to the Higher Education Authority.  At that time practically all the awards were external as to the syllabus, the contents, standards and examinations. Because of this the professional involvement of the teachers concerned was very restrictive and I thought this was unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Another important point was that in many instances the objectives, standards and conditions pertaining to these awards did not reflect to any great degree our particular needs or the educational structures within which we operated.  The number and variety of the awards led to difficulty in assessing their comparative standards and it caused considerable confusion in the minds of the public as to the educational merit and the intrinsic worth of the qualifications. Another drawback arose from the fact that where the Government, college or intitution indentified a particular <Col N="153" /> national, regional or local need which could not be suitably met by the courses and by the examinations set up by these outside organisations, there was no way in which the qualifications designed to serve that need could attain the esteem and respect which other established but in many instances less suitable qualifications enjoyed, no matter how high the standard of the individual college or institution.</P>
    <P>Obviously then, the existing system of awards could neither continue to meet the needs of existing colleges nor have any prospect of extension to fill the requirements of third level non-university education which had significantly expanded through the addition of the regional technical colleges and the College of Physical Education and the Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  In many cases the achievement of natural self-sufficiency in this field was desirable and could have been achieved by pooling the expertise of people from the universities, from the fields of technical and general education, from industry, from the professions, from research and so on.</P>
    <P>The HEA reported favourably on the proposals and the Government decided that because of the urgency that attached to such a body commencing their operations quickly they should be established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis pending the introduction of legislation to grant them statutory powers.  In 1971 the Government decided that legislation should be prepared to establish the NCEA on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The HEA had been prepared to meet the demands and the needs of industry and of potential technological students for more advanced technological and other specialised courses and for the formal recognition of such courses and qualifications which would be awarded on the conclusion of these courses, and they suggested that the NCEA should be established on the following basis: first, to grant certificates, diplomas and degrees to persons who had successfully completed courses of study in third level institutions other than universities; to determine the conditions governing the granting of such awards; and third, <Col N="154" /> to approve courses of study to be pursued by candidates in order to qualify for such awards, including appropriate arrangements for industrial and commercial experience in association with such courses.</P>
    <P>When it became apparent to me that it would not be possible to have the proposed legislation prepared and enacted in sufficient time to allow the statutory councils to be set up and to enable them to assess study programmes which the students in the regional technical colleges had been following since 1970, I felt I should immediately establish the council on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Apart from the fact that there was an urgent need pending the establishment of the NCEA, I felt it would also be useful as it had been in the case of HEA, to have the NCEA in operation before legislation was brought in so that we would have the experience which we had in relation to the HEA before legislation was brought in.  That was very useful in relation to the HEA because that body had been born under a cloud of suspicion. There had been considerable controversy surrounding the matter, many people expressing the feeling that the authority would be simply an instrument of the Department of Education. The HEA soon laid that bogey and confidence grew because of the freedom of action allowed to them, and when the Bill was brought in it was possible to discuss it on its merits rather than personalities.</P>
    <P>The NCEA were established in 1972 and consisted of a chairman and 21 members, together with a director. The other members were persons of eminence in the fields of education, both secondary and third level, from the university and non-university sectors, and persons of wide experience in industry, commerce, public administration and other fields.  The chairman was Mr. John Nagle, former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The council included seven members who were professors in Irish universities, six who held posts in institutions of higher education other than universities, seven were engaged in industry, agriculture and commerce and public <Col N="155" /> administration and three had experience in post-primary education.</P>
    <P>The function of the NCEA is to promote, to encourage, co-ordinate and develop technical, industrial, commercial, technological and scientific education and, in association with them, liberal education, and to award certificates, diplomas and degrees for courses pursued at recognised third level institutions other than universities.</P>
    <P>I have gone into detail on the early days of the NCEA, their composition and their purpose, to illustrate how competent that body were clearly to understand the problems involved. There is no question in my mind that such a body must of necessity have a clear perception of their objectives and the means by which these objectives can be achieved.  That must be the body best entitled to award qualifications at all levels including third level, and quite clearly students who followed those courses had the same belief.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government appear to think that by insisting that the universities award degrees to students at third level, the non-university third level institutions are achieving a unified third level structure. Listening to the Minister for Industry and Commerce today, one would believe this is all that is necessary. In my view it achieves nothing. Instead, it is much more likely to damage the system which it appears to be their objective to enhance.  Our educational system, secondary schools at second level and universities at third level, is long established and deep-rooted.  Our technological side is relatively young and unless carefully nurtured it will be swamped, particularly at third level.  The vocational school system has been in existence for only a few years.  Up to the 1960s, the highest certificate available in them was the group certificate in two-day <Col N="156" /> courses.  Later, the intermediate certificate was introduced and with the introduction of free education it was obvious we could no longer be satisfied.  To redress these problems and to increase the proportion of the numbers entering the technical schools, the leaving certificate was introduced in these schools.</P>
    <P>Then, the regional technical colleges and the Limerick Institute of Higher education were established and technical and technological education came into their own.  Nevertheless, while the system has grown in esteem it is still a relatively fragile growth which must be nurtured.  As I said on a number of occasions, I am convinced that with proper handling this branch of our third level education system will grow and mature and will move slowly and gradually towards the other system.  On the other hand, the university system is being forced by circumstances to change, and I am very pleased to see it.  In recent years it has had to take cognisance of the fact that graduates have to earn their livelihoods and that though education for education's sake is delightful in theory the practical aspect must be catered for.</P>
    <P>Because of this, it became clear to me that the universities would perforce move towards a more practical system so that we could ultimately have a unified system provided in a natural and evolving way rather than the enforced marriage which the Minister for Education, but particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, want to foist on us for the sake of what I might term socialist principles. I think the Minister for Education would be much more likely to agree with me than with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): Plans for division of this 36 acre property are at present being examined but a decision has not yet been reached.  The application for a two acre site, which has been received from Pullough Community Council, will be fully considered in connection with the disposal of the lands.  I understand, however, that there is intense competition for these lands among local small-holders and the community council's application will have to be looked at in that context.</P>

The proposed amendments to the officers scheme are to provide that temporary service with the board or with a local authority or unestablished service in the civil service will be reckoned in full for the purposes of the superannuation scheme provided that it is continuous with established service and that temporary service with the board will be treated as temporary service in a local authority for the purpose for the Superannuation Acts and the Local Government Superannuation Acts.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments to the employees grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; scheme are to change the basis of pension from one-sixtieth to one-eightieth plus lump sum, to increase the benefit for death in service and to make provision for widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>

      <P>After-care cannot be imposed on persons discharged from custody on termination of their sentences.  After-care is, however, available, on a <Col N="69" /> voluntary basis, to any prisoner who requests it and is provided by the welfare service of my Department. After-care aims at resettlement of the offender within the community; advice and help in seeking employment and accommodation form a part of this total concept.  Hostels established by community organisations which provide accommodation for released prisoners are assisted financially by my Department in a substantial way. In practice very few prisoners opt for after-care but the numbers seeking it are on the increase.</P>
      <P>I am not too clear as to the information the Deputy seeks in the second part of the question.  Some prisoners are self-employed, others are taken back by their former employers and jobs are obtained for some by the welfare service.  In 1975 a total of 218 prisoners were placed in employment by the welfare service.</P>
