    <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The relevant provisions of this Act shall be subject, where appropriate to the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Protocols thereto.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress yesterday I was dealing with submissions made by Deputy Blaney in relation to Deputy Collins's amendment which seeks to have the Convention on Human Rights incorporated in the Bill.  I was making the point that the amendment was unnecessary and that, in effect, it would be seeking to make a part of our law something which is already part of it. To say the least this would be an unusual position.  I made the point that the worries and dangers which the Opposition advanced as being the reasons behind their amendment were groundless because the liberties which they seek to protect and preserve by the amendment are already protected <Col N="502" /> in a larger and more thorough way by our Constitution.  Any person who feels that his liberties are being infringed has his remedy in our courts.  Our courts have always been jealous of the liberty and rights of the individual as the pattern of judicial decisions from the commencement of this State show clearly.</P>
      <P>I submit that it is a groundless fear to say that in some way there will be a lessening of citizens' liberties unless the amendment is passed or unless the European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated in the Bill.  In the unlikely event of the Constitution giving inadequate protection to any citizen and if that citizen wants to rely on the convention he can do so.  He can pursue his remedy, not in a domestic court but before an international tribunal.  As Deputy O'Kennedy said, it is something to be desired that there would be access to an international tribunal.  The fact that we have ratified this convention enables any citizen of this State to pursue his remedies on foot of the convention before the appropriate international tribunal.</P>
      <P>In the unlikely event of a citizen not getting justice in a domestic court he has the right to go before an international tribunal but I consider that the protections afforded by our Constitution are much wider.  Deputy O'Kennedy complained that the Constitution does not particularise the rights it guarantees.  No constitution does that.  It guarantees the fundamental rights and then the courts vindicate those rights in their judicial decisions and this has been the pattern. We had a more recent example when two women sought to vindicate their right to act as jurors and while that right was not specifically spelt out in the Constitution nevertheless the Supreme Court found that it was a constitutional right.  Similarly, while bail is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution nevertheless when the test case on the question of bail was heard some years ago the Supreme Court found that there was a constitutional right to bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have complete confidence in our Constitution, in our courts and in our <Col N="503" /> traditions to be satisfied that the rule of law will prevail.  To suggest that the Bill needs the protection of the European Convention on Human Rights is to unwittingly take from our Constitution and from the jealous tradition of our Supreme Court in guarding the rights afforded by that Constitution.  The point was made by Deputy O'Kennedy that we have our Constitution and our rights but that the Bill in some way infringes on them.  My answer is that if this is so&mdash;which I deny&mdash;the courts are there.  The position in relation to this Bill is exactly the same as the position in relation to any piece of legislation that may be passed by this Parliament.  The courts are there to test and scrutinise every piece of legislation and if legislation is found wanting in terms of its constitutionality it will fall, become void and if the Parliament of the day want the measure it must be amended and reintroduced so as to comply with the constitutional guidelines found by the court.</P>
    <P>The rights of the citizen are in no way more protected by accepting this amendment than they are without it because those rights are already adequately guaranteed by our Constitution and will be vindicated as the need may arise by our courts.  I am quite satisfied, and I submit that the House should be satisfied, that the amendment is unnecessary.  If in the unlikely event of our domestic tribunal not satisfying an aggrieved person, he has his opportunity to go before the international tribunal where he can seek redress if there is a breach of this convention.  However, the history of individual applications shows that it is unlikely that this country, because of the guarantees of the Constitution, will be in breach of the convention if the matter had been found to be constitutional. In my view the Lawless case is an example of this.  I am satisfied with the protection already afforded within our legal system and by our ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I was asked why had we ratified the convention if <Col N="504" /> we did not need it but I cannot see the force of that because we are part of a larger international community and not all jurisdictions have a legal structure in which the rule of law as we know it operates in the way we know it.  We have had examples of citizens of this country who have been in detention in other jurisdictions for what seemed to us to be inordinately long periods without trial.</P>
    <P>It is important when an international convention of this type is negotiated that all countries would subscribe to it so that the convention would have a high moral force on all the nations who might be subscribing to it.  Our subscribing to it, because the rule of law prevails here and is seen to prevail, gives us a certain moral authority in the European Community and makes our subscription to the convention desirable and helpful from the point of view of human rights.  I do not admit it is an argument to say that we did not need to subscribe to it.  I think we had an international obligation and of course the fact that we were able to subscribe to it was a vindication of our legal system, because we could not have subscribed to it unless our legal system was such as to comply with it and that we were able to subscribe to it without in any way amending our legal system or our basic law.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that one of the motives behind the amendment is that if it is accepted there will be a compulsion or a persuasive force on the UK Government to incorporate a similar provision in the reciprocal Act. I cannot answer for another government, but the guarantees and protection given by the convention are extant in the UK, and because the UK have ratified the convention, and should there be a breach of the convention on the part of that Government, any citizen within that jurisdiction has his rights.  Not only that but the other countries who are parties to the convention have rights under it as well.  We have shown that those rights exist by ourselves taking action for a breach of the convention.  The sanctions and the protection which the convention imposes are already existing <Col N="505" /> in both jurisdictions by reason of the fact that both have ratified the convention, and it does not add to any citizen's position or status or increase the measure of protection available to him to accept this amendment.  Our citizens are already adequately protected by virtue of our ratification, and as has been exemplified, any country can make a complaint against another country who is a signatory and the matter would then be investigated with all the consequences that come from it.  This has been demonstrated as being real protection.</P>
    <P>The two sections in the convention which have been brought before the House are Articles 5 (3) and 6 (3). Article 6 (3) deals with the right of a person charged with a criminal offence and provides that a person will have the right to be informed promptly of the offence charged against him, to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence, to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing, to have witnesses against him examined and to be able to obtain witnesses for himself, to have the assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand the language used in the court.  I submit that all those rights are present in the fullest degree under our system and will continue to be present in cases coming within the ambit of this Bill.</P>
    <P>To be informed promptly in a language which he understands of the nature and cause of the accusation against him is traditional, basic to our legal code because an indictment must set out fully the charge and must be precise in charging an offence known to the law.  To give adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence: again this is a basic part of the conduct of our criminal trials, that adequate time is afforded to the defence counsel to prepare their defence.  Quite commonly an adjournment is granted as a matter of course and there is no opposition from the prosecution provided, of course, the application is <i>bona fide.</i></P>
    <P>To defend himself in person or through legal assistance: this right is not interfered with in the Bill.  An <Col N="506" /> accused may go north for the taking of evidence on commission which, thought connected with it, is not part of the trial.  It is important to remember that technical distinction.  If the accused wishes to be present he may do so and he is given immunity while present.  It may be argued that the fact that he has had to surrender bail and go in custody is in some way a diminution of his rights to defend himself, some lessening of his position.  That situation is analogous with the person surrendering bail to stand trial before the court &mdash;it is not part of the trial but it is connected with it.  I cannot see any difference in quality between surrendering bail for the purpose of taking evidence on commission and doing so for the purpose of the trial.  It will be argued that one incident takes place within the jurisdiction and another outside it.  I do not see any difference provided the immunity is there.</P>
    <P>Another part of the convention lays down the right of an accused to defend himself or to be defended by legal assistance of his own choosing.  This right is not infringed in any way because the accused is entitled to have the assistance of a solicitor and counsel at the trial itself and at the taking of evidence on commission.  In that connection I might mention that at the taking of evidence on commission in the North the accused is entitled to have present the same solicitor and counsel as would be available for him in the Special Criminal Court in this jurisdiction.  A misunderstanding has arisen that because of the lack of reciprocal rights of audience that would not be so.  The taking of evidence on commission is not part of the trial though it is connected with it.  The lack of right of audience does not apply and accordingly the accused can be represented at the commission by the same solicitor and counsel who appear for him in the court here. Therefore, there is no lessening of his rights or interference with the right. The convention lays down the right to legal aid if the interests of justice require it.  Legal aid is available normally here.  When this unhappy dispute with the Bar Council ends, legal aid will be available as part of our legal system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> The convention lays down that an accused person is entitled to call witnesses in his defence and to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.  The point has been made that somehow witnesses will be apprehensive about giving evidence and that if the trial is in the South a witness who is prepared to come from the North to give evidence on behalf of a defendant will be in some way prejudiced or put in danger.  I do not see why that should follow.  I presume a witness would come down to exonerate somebody and I do not see why he should be in fear in coming South to exonerate a fellow citizen.  If he is fearful of what might happen to him in the South, he may opt to give his evidence on commission in the North.  He is in the same position as any witness anywhere&mdash;he is entitled to all the protection of the law.  If he does not want to reveal his name and address it is a matter for the court whether he should be compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not see that there is any distinction being made between defence and prosecution in regard to the adducing of evidence.  The rights which the parties have to produce witnesses and give evidence on their behalf are not taken away by this Bill.  The Bill is very specific in ensuring that the same rights obtain for the defence as for the prosecution and I submit, once that is the situation, there is no breach of the convention.  If any person affected by this Bill finds the rights given by the convention are breached he has his remedy.  He can take this Government before the international tribunal in Strasbourg and he also has his rights in the domestic courts because, if any rights are breached, it will be quite clear the Bill is unconstitutional. I am satisfied on the very strongest advice given me that this is not so.</P>
    <P>The other article mentioned as affected adversely by the Bill is Article 5, paragraph 3.  That article provides that everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of the article, referring to lawful arrest and detention, shall be brought promptly before a judge or <Col N="508" /> other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and, shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial and release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.  What that article gives is a right to speedy trial and a right to bail pending trial.  I submit there is nothing in this Bill which in any way infringes the rights given by that article.  The right to speedy trial is there and, if speedy trial does not take place, there is the same redress available as is available under the criminal code. The accused is entitled to go to court and protest and, if the trial is not proceeded with, the proceedings will be struck out.  This has happened in the past when there was undue delay. Again, there is the right to bail.  The case has been made that the right to bail is infringed because, if the accused has to go north to give evidence on commission, he has to surrender his bail.  I see nothing different in that situation from that of the accused having to stand trial in the custody of a prison officer in the domestic court.  I would be quite happy to argue that this does not in any way interfere with the right to bail as defined by the Supreme Court.  I am quite satisfied, too, that there is no breach of Article 5 in this Bill and, as I say, if there should be a breach, a citizen has his remedy both domestically and in the international tribunal.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Bill by requiring an accused to go in custody is in breach of the convention. This suggestion overlooks two important factors.  The first is, as I have already said, in factual terms the Bill does not breach the convention because the accused can be there in person with immunity and advise counsel and examine witnesses or have them examined on his behalf. He is in custody only for the purpose of taking evidence on commission. He has immunity.  I have indicated that the guarantee for that immunity is the power that remains to the Executive here to say: &ldquo;Stop.  No more action in this particular arrangement because it has not been honoured&rdquo;. Deputy O'Kennedy made the point that this is all very fine for the second person but what about the first when <Col N="509" /> there has been a dishonouring of the immunity?  All I can answer to that is&mdash;it is the same with any citizen's rights&mdash;give him the right.  I have a right to stand up here or outside and make a speech.  That is a right given to me by the State and the fact that it is given to me by statute guarantees that right and, should that right be breached, the State will intervene and the proper sanction will be applied.  That is the position with regard to any right.  The question of the enforcement of a right depends on its observance and its being honoured. All one can do is give the right and then provide the sanction to ensure its observance.  That is the way any law is enforced.  You provide for its observance.  That is the point.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have overlooked the fact that there is another convention in existence in Europe under the auspices of the Council of Europe, namely, the convention dealing with mutual assistance in criminal matters. The date is 1959.  This specifically provides for the taking of evidence on commission abroad for criminal trials.  It is, therefore, contradictory to say the Convention on Human Rights is breached because we provide for the taking of evidence abroad on commission when the same forum that provided the Convention on Human Rights has also been the author of another convention providing precisely for that which the Opposition say is breached by the first convention.</P>

      <P>I will check on that. She is a signatory to the Convention on Human Rights.  The Law Enforcement Commission has also pointed out that the taking of evidence on commission is used in other countries in criminal cases.  It is no novelty as far as we are concerned in civil cases. I am quite satisfied that the protection sought by this amendment is already present in our domestic code.  Acceptance of it would simply mean putting <Col N="511" /> into the Bill something that is already part of our law, a pointless sort of exercise and tantamount to saying that the Constitution shall be read as part of this Bill.  The amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One would find the Minister's arguments quite convincing if one were dealing with a like situation in both parts of the country.  Of course we are not.  We are here proposing to take certain actions in dealing with specified offences committed either here or in the Six Counties and we are doing that on the basis of reciprocal law in the jurisdiction of the Six Counties' courts.  That territory does not provide justice to all its people.  It never has and obviously it never will.  Therefore, all of the Minister's arguments do not apply in this case, good and sound as the argument may appear on face value.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken about witnesses for the prosecution and for the defence having the same kind of rights.  He said that witnesses coming South, particularly defence witnesses, will have nothing to be afraid of in coming down here to give evidence to exonerate an accused person here, and even if they have such fears they have the option of giving evidence on commission in the 6-county courts. So far as defence witnesses are concerned, there will be fear regarding retaliatory measures that may be taken against them in the Six Counties. Whether they give evidence in the South directly to the court, with or without their names being published in the newspapers, they will be known and will be marked down for treatment afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is where the Minister's case falls.  He is trying to make it appear to be a normal situation but it is a totally abnormal situation where the accused, guilty or alleged guilty of offences as scheduled, will be of one particular political or religious persuation.  Except in the most extraordinary, accidental situation, we will not find a loyalist accused of any of the scheduled offences being apprehended in the <Col N="512" /> South&mdash;he will not be here&mdash;and brought before our courts.  We are providing a measure that will apply only to those of the minority in the Six Counties who are accused of any of the scheduled offences and who come here or are found on this side of the Border. To say that it is a reciprocal measure, that there is any parallel here as against what will happen in the Six Counties or what will be provided for by British legislation, is hollow and empty.  There is no parallel and there is nothing reciprocal about it; we are providing for a situation where in all practical cases it will be a member of the minority in the Six Counties who will be before our courts.  We will be acting on an accusation of the powers-that-be in the Six Counties to bring that person before our courts.  The accusers will be afraid to come South to give their evidence but yet we go to all the trouble and paraphernalia of taking evidence on commission in order to secure these people who are afraid to come here to give evidence.</P>
    <P>We are told that the provision regarding the giving of evidence on commission is a fair and equal one as between prosecution and defence witnesses. It is all very well to say that the defence witnesses can come here or give evidence on commission in the Six Counties because they will have nothing to fear, but there is no provision in this measure that can secure their safety after they give evidence in a case where we prosecute someone at the behest of the authorities in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>We cannot do anything about this. Perhaps by pushing this amendment some little assurance can be given that would help to provide some protection outside and beyond the courts in the Six Counties that have shown themselves to be partial and rigged in most cases in matters of a political nature. If we can push or persuade the British authorities to do likewise, we will have gone some little way to even the balance, which is totally imbalanced at the moment, between the rights available to the accused whom we may prosecute at the behest of the six-county authorities and the prosecution who have nothing to fear in coming <Col N="513" /> here or in giving their evidence on commission in their own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Britain is a signatory to the Convention on Human Rights.  We understand that and Ireland is a signatory to that convention also.  However, since they have not a written constitution, is there any reason why they should not be persuaded&mdash;we should insist on it&mdash;to legislate as we are doing in order to give persons in their jurisdiction in the Six Counties the right to proceed under their laws rather than, as the Minister so glibly said, that they would have the right to take their action to the European Court of Human Rights? Five years ago Ireland took Britain to the European Court of Human Rights but we have not yet got a result of any of the proceedings, although it is suggested that the Government have got the results of the report.  The public have not been told but that is not the point.  Five years after the event we have not been told the conclusion of the complaint and to use that as an example of how it could work is an argument against the Minister's statement this morning.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking about the right to go to the European Court of Human Rights when it has taken five years so far for this country to get any decision regarding its complaint against Britain or to get a report of the proceedings and even when we get the report it does not mean that we have got a decision on anything.  All it will do is confirm what we know already, namely, that brutalities have taken place under the jurisdiction of the British in the Six Counties.  It will only highlight the reasons why we should not proceed with this measure.  We are proceeding with this legislation on the spurious basis that there will be parallel legislation from Westminster in relation to the Six Counties where law as we know it, and justice as we expect it, does not operate.  We should keep this clearly in mind.  If we did this we would not be wasting our time in providing this measure here.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the accused handing himself over into custody, surrendering his bail, and <Col N="514" /> said there is nothing wrong with going into the jurisdiction of the Six Counties and having his rights of listening to his own trial.  He will not opt to go if he has any brains at all because, whether guilty or innocent, once the figner has been pointed at him, whether proved or not, he is already a marked man so why put himself into the hands of those who have pointed the finger?  If we are to make our own deductions, those who make the accusations are suspected of being involved in the wiping out of people to whom they can get them.  That is finger if they can get them.  That is one of the reasons why we find a number of people coming across the Border from the Six Counties, getting out of that territory because they know they cannot expect a fair trial once the finger has been pointed at them.</P>
    <P>They also know that even if, having been tried in the Six Counties, they are exonerated there are those in the community there who will not necessarily accept the exoneration of an accused and will carry out their own sentences in their own way, as we have seen happen too often in the past.  We are dealing with a most unusual and extraordinary situation which is not to be confused in any way with the very nice acceptable type of situation the Minister has been talking about, dealing on a reciprocal basis in regard to these matters with another sovereign State. We are dealing with an appalling situation. We are dealing with a situation where we are likening ourselves to the set-up in the Six Counties.  If we are to operate our courts and our laws parallel to the manner in which the courts are operated in the Six Counties then all I can say is God help the courts on this side of the Border in the administration of justice in the future if we are to take our pattern from what has been passing for justice and administration of law in the Six Counties over the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the same rights for the defence witnesses and the prosecution witnesses.  Why should we provide this whole paraphernalia merely because it is evident that those <Col N="515" /> who make the accusations that will bring about prosecutions in our courts under this measure are afraid to come across the Border to give their evidence?  It is in order to accommodate these people that we are providing this paraphernalia which has in-built in it the gravest dangers and the certainty that there will not be fair trials. Trials are incapable of being carried out in a fair manner, not through any necessary lack on the part of our courts or our peacekeeping forces, but because we are dealing with an extraordinary set-up in the Six Counties, for which there is no parallel here, no parallel in the administration of justice and no parallel in the everyday situation obtaining here and there so how can we with any feeling of security or honesty offer this measure to be enacted into law and expect that it will be in any way accepted in a general manner by our public as a fair measure?</P>
    <P>Surely if the law we enact, before it ever goes into operation, can be seen plainly not to provide the normal safeguards for the administration of law, particularly to people that will be accused under that law, then it is bad before it starts.  I assert that this is a bad measure, that it is one that we should not be discussing at all and that in asking to have the amendment accepted we are only doing the least that can be done to improve what is a bad measure as it stands, to give some little assurances in it that are not otherwise available and can be seen not to be available.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests, as he has done time and again, if what has been said from this side of the House proves correct in one case then it is all over because we will stop operating and that is really the end of the matter. The Minister says, to a degree truthfully, that all he can do is provide the safeguards.  He says we cannot go beyond that in ensuring that the first case may not work out that way but it is because of our inability, outside our own jurisdiction, to ensure that the rights the Minister writes into the measure can be secured for the accused that there will be no accused opting to <Col N="516" /> take up those rights, the right of being present at his own trial, in this case be present in the Six Counties jurisdiction, while evidence is being given on commission.</P>
    <P>We come very quickly to the point where what we are providing here is theoretically acceptable in a normal situation as between two sovereign States but clearly is unacceptable in our circumstances when it relates to the Six Counties administration and unacceptable in this specific instance on the basis that the accused is not being given the right in practice, though in theory, to attend and be present at his own trial.  That is the practical situation. If this were being done for any really good solid reason it might be understandable and could conceivably be acceptable.  The accused's basic right of being present at his own trial to all practical purposes is being denied him in this case because his accusers are afraid to come here and give evidence in our courts.  Surely we are crawling on our bellies to these people and ignoring the rights of the citizens of this country, resident in the Six Counties, who had to bail out of there because of harassment by the forces of the Crown.  Others, because they were unable to vent their spleen on them, as they have left, will make their accusations and allegations. Under this measure we will act, bring them before our courts and say they will get a fair trial.  They can go to hear the evidence against them on commission in the Six Counties but, of course, they will not go.  They would be right fools if they did.  If the Minister is not aware of the reasons why they should not go, they are so aware, to the degree that they will not tempt Providence by handing themselves back into custody of those they know from experience are called peacekeepers but who are anything but, when it comes to dealing with the minority in their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The basis of the Minister's operation is to provide theoretical rights for the accused persons who will invariably be from the minority in the Six Counties. They will have been accused by the authorities in the Six Counties and have come across the Border.  They will be apprehended here <Col N="517" /> because of allegations made in the North.  Theoretically the Minister is providing the basic rights for such an accused to be present at his own trial. The damnable thing is that this is being done merely because the people who make these accusations are cowards and are afraid to come into our jurisdiction to give their evidence and nail the person they are accusing.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but he seems to be indulging in a lot of repetition. What we are hearing now is tantamount to a Second Reading speech rather than a speech on Committee Stage.  I would be grateful if the Deputy would relate his remarks more closely to the amendment before the House.</P>

      <P>I could not agree more.  If I have been repeating every line and ever sentence of my arguments, it is because even I am aware of the repetition and the Second Reading nature of all the speeches on this Committee Stage.  When I looked at this amendment and gave some thought to it, it appeared to be inevitable that speeches made would be of a Second Reading nature but I am not the sole offender.  I am not being an offender merely for the sake of it.  By the very nature of the arguments which have been going across the floor of this House and because of the nature of this measure, there is an unfortunate tendency for the Committee Stage to be turned into a rehash of the Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>I would prefer if there were much shorter contributions, as is normal on a Committee Stage.  After each counter-contribution by Members who do not agree with the Minister, the Minister could specifically and as briefly as possible answer each point rather than waiting until several lengthy contributions are made without intervening.  I will endeavour to conform with the well established rules of the House in this matter.  If the Minister followed my suggestion I would find them easier to follow.  He might cover each point more minutely and more clearly if he answered them individually rather than taking many points together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might indicate why it <Col N="518" /> is that those who make accusations in the Six Counties should have a special law and procedure built into our law to accommodate them, merely because they are cowards and are afraid to come into our jurisdiction to give evidence against those they accuse and whom we will pick up under this measure and bring before our courts. Why should that arrangement be made when there is no basis for their fears? Why only in theory should we hold out the prospect that an accused person coming before our courts, charged with an offence under this measure, will get his basic and just rights, namely, to listen to the evidence being given on commission, while, in practice, he dare not and will not do it?  How can the Minister glibly pass over the fact that there is no written constitution in Great Britain?  While we might go quite a way towards accepting, and could be persuaded, that there is not a need for the amendment because of the general principles enshrined in our Constitution, there is no parallel situation obtaining in Britain.  Therefore, the insertion of this amendment into this measure is absolutely necessary in order that Britain may be persuaded, indeed, should be compelled, to write in a similar provision in her legislation, if she wants this measure to go through. I would ask the Minister to give us a clear and succint answer to that.</P>
    <P>The parallel is not there.  They have no Constitution; we have.  Let us put this in.  Let us put it to them that they should include it and give the right under their law of proceeding against them under their own law rather than this nebulous offering that, because both are signatories to the Convention on Human Rights, the citizen or the individual in either jurisdiction has the right to proceed to the European Courts, a right which is of little use, of which we as a country have evidence as we proceeded to it five years ago but a report of the findings has not yet been published.</P>
    <P>As a country we may be able to stand around and wait for such a lengthy period, but that is of little value to some accused person whose rights are infringed and who, as a result of those rights being infringed, <Col N="519" /> may be languishing in jail while he goes through what is provided for him in broad terms under the Convention on Human Rights as a citizen of this or the British jurisdiction.  Five years later he could be still waiting for a result, just as we as a country are waiting for a result of our complaint against the British, proceeding, as we do, on much the same basis.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us a clear answer on that?  There is no parallel constitutional provision in Britain. Therefore, not even that argument can be made of their having legislation of a similar nature to ours since they have not got a Constitution similar to ours.  If we inserted this amendment and they did likewise we would have common ground in that we would both be making our courts and our administration of this law subject to the provisions of the Convention on Human Rights and, in that way, providing equally in both jurisdictions the right of the individual to proceed within the courts of his own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the taking of evidence on commission is provided for under the European Convention on Mutual Assistance.  He said that eight out of the nine Common Market countries have become signatories to this provision but that he is not yet aware&mdash;although he may now be aware&mdash;whether Britain is one of the eight who signed.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that, whether or not Britain has signed, is of little consequence. Regardless of the content of this convention which Deputy O'Kennedy has been having a look at since the Minister brought up this matter, the same arguments would apply as apply to the British being a signatory to the Convention on Human Rights which does not, in itself, give any practical protection for accused persons, or persons giving evidence, and so forth. It cannot be of the same value as would be the intention of the amendment <Col N="520" /> which we are discussing.  Perhaps the Minister can give us straightforward assistance point by point on these specific matters.  In that way we may be able to relieve our minds of our apprehensions in regard to others. Perhaps we could get a little more clarity on the debate and on the amendment as a whole.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney raised a number of questions.  I take his point that a brief reply and, indeed, brief contributions would be helpful. The first point he raised was: why do we provide a commission procedure for prosecution witnesses who would be apprehensive about coming South?  He suggested that if these people have evidence to give they should have no fears of coming South. I agree they should have no fears of coming South.  I have no doubt they will be fully protected should they decide to come South.  We do not know in practice yet whether or not they will come South.  They may decide not to come South because of their apprehensions about the South, mistaken though they may be but nonetheless very real because of some of the things which happened in the South in the past, and their ignorance of the attitude in the South concerning the IRA.  By the way I am surprised at Deputy Blaney who knows that part of the country persisting in the use of the term &ldquo;the Six Counties&rdquo; which he knows is offensive to the vast majority of the people in that area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not witnesses from Northern Ireland will come down here.  We will have to wait and see.  I apprehend that witnesses in Northern Ireland will be apprehensive of their safety down here, mistaken apprehensions but nevertheless real to them.  For that reason, and in order to ensure that justice is done and that fugitive terrorists will not escape the consequences of their activities, we are providing this procedure.  We are providing for evidence to be taken on commission.  The reason it is here is that there are fears, unfounded in my opinion, but real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is resonable to anticipate that there will be such fears, unfounded but real, among people who might be called on to give evidence in the South, not necessarily members of the security forces, possibly civilians who have no knowledge of the South and to whom Dublin is a strange city.  A civilian who is a member of the majority in the North might witness a terrorist incident.  One can readily understand why that person would be <Col N="522" /> apprehensive about coming South.  If we are to provide for the trial of fugitive offenders, we must ensure that such people who would be able to assist at the trial in ascertaining the full facts would be enabled to give evidence in their own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is the further practical point that, if the witness is unwilling to come South, the courts have no jurisdiction to compel his attendance.  Consequently, the trial could not take place because there would not be a full hearing.  Deputy Blaney criticised the provision for the accused going North to attend at the taking of evidence on commission.  He says it is an unreal right and that accused persons will not avail of it.  This is his opinion, but it is only his opinion. I do not agree with his opinion.  I think it is a real right.  All we can do in an Act of Parliament is give the right and give it with suitable protections. The right is given with suitable protections.  After that it is a matter of opinion, and Deputy Blaney's opinion differs from mine. If a person is given a right, one cannot say that because he chooses not to exercise that right, he is not given it.  That argument does not stand up.</P>
    <P>The third question Deputy Blaney raised was that there is no written constitution in the United Kingdom and that therefore the protection of this amendment should be incorporated in the UK Act, and that even this protection is not great because of the long delay in the making of the complaint before the international tribunal and the making known by the tribunal of its decision on the complaint. It is true there is no written constitution in the United Kingdom, but the constitution of the countries where there are written constitutions are based on constitutional conventions, practices and usages of the United Kingdom.  It does not mean that there is no regard for individual rights in the United Kingdom.  There is such regard.  The answer to Deputy Blaney's point about the delay between the making of the complaint at Strasbourg and the finding is that the reality behind that complaint found its expression in the courts in the UK <Col N="523" /> awarding damages to persons the subject matter of those complaints.</P>
    <P>This is something that has been overlooked, that the courts in the United Kingdom have vindicated the rights of those citizens who have complained that they were subjected to unlawful processes of detention or interrogation, and substantial damages have been awarded by the UK courts against the UK Government. That is a point in favour of the argument that the rule of law exists and that irrespective of whether there is a written constitution or not there is a remedy for citizens whose rights have been infringed and who have got satisfaction.  It is possible that the complaint by this country to the European Convention may have assisted them in having their rights vindicated.  That is a point in favour of the procedure that was available up to now under the convention and will be available notwithstanding this amendment and notwithstanding the fact that the European Convention is not explicitly made part of the domestic law.  Once it has been ratified, countries are bound by the consequences of it and one of the beneficial consequences experienced in the UK has been that citizens whose rights were infringed by unlawful detention or interrogation have had those rights vindicated and have had compensation awarded to them by the courts of the UK against the Government of the UK.</P>
    <P>This is an indication that the system is not as black as Deputy Blaney and other speakers would have us believe.  It is proof positive that basic rights and liberties do exist in that jurisdiction and are respected and vindicated by the courts.  The findings by the international tribunal at this stage do not affect the individual position of the persons on whose behalf the complaint was made.  Their position has already been dealt with by the domestic courts.  As in all situations, arguments are not completely one way or the other, and it is important for balance that I would make this point.  Deputy Blaney sees only perfidy on the other side.  It is wrong <Col N="524" /> that such a biased argument should be made.</P>
    <P>Again I am slightly cynical at this protestation particularly by Deputy Blaney in regard to human rights.  I am not going to argue the merits of introducing internment without trial; it is the negation of the basic rights that is the subject matter of this amendment.  However, the last time it was brought into this jurisdiction &mdash; and it may well have been necessary; I am not arguing about that &mdash; it was brought in by a government composed of the party opposite of which Deputy Blaney was a leading member.</P>
    <P>On the question of ratification, the Convention on Mutual Assistance has not been ratified by the UK, but that does not take from the argument I am making, that the principle of evidence on commission in criminal matters is a well-known principle on the mainland of Europe.</P>

      <P>I assume the Minister has a copy of the Convention on Mutual Assistance.  I have only just now had the opportunity of getting a copy from the Library. I would invite the Minister to show me anywhere in that convention any argument to support his case that what we are doing here in this Bill has been done before under the provisions of that convention, that we are covering precisely the same area, as he said here this morning already. I will make an open confession, that when I interrupted the Minister this morning and said what he was saying was inaccurate, I said it without having seen at the time the provisions of that convention, because I knew it would be totally inconsistent that any of these conventions could contain such a provision as we have in this Bill.  I now find, having checked the copy I have here, that I was right. The Minister should not say we are doing here what has been done before in a convention, because it is very different.  He has a duty as a Minister introducing legislation here at least to be accurate.  Indeed he has a duty to go further and not to mislead.  Coming to this other convention, I would ask the Minister where the precedent exists.  As far as I can see there are two articles in this convention.  It is significant that the United Kingdom has not adopted this convention.  The Minister is misleading this House in more ways than one.  Incidentally, we have not the copy of the British legislation that the Minister promised us so long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I come to Article 8. We are dealing with witnesses only in this case.  It says:</P>
      <P>A witness or expert who has failed to answer a summons to appear, service of which has been requested, shall not, even if the summons contains a notice of penalty, be subjected to any punishment or measure or restraint; unless subsequently he voluntarily enters the territory of the requesting Party and is there again duly summoned.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as far as witnesses are concerned, they cannot even be penalised, unless they voluntarily enter the territory of the requesting party and are there again duly summoned, and they are quite free to remain outside, quite free to come in, and if they voluntarily go in then they may be summoned and may be subject to penalty.  There is no provision whatsoever of that nature in this Bill and it relates in no way to what we have in this Bill.  That relates to a witness.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the person who is being charged or, as Article 11 says, for purposes of confrontation.</P>
      <P>A person in custody whose personal appearance as a witness or for purposes of confrontation is applied for by the requesting Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>This relates to a person who is already in custody, and does not apply in this case where a man has to give himself into custody.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;shall be temporarily transferred to the territory where the hearing is intended to take place, provided that he shall be sent back within the period stipulated by the requested Party and subject to the provisions of Article 12 in so far as these are applicable.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Transfer may be refused</P>
      <P>(a)  if the person in custody does not consent</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  if his presence is necessary at criminal proceedings pending in <Col N="527" /> the territory of the requested Party.</P>
    <P>This is the way it would be here&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c)  if the transfer is liable to prolong his detention, or</P>
    <P>(d)  if there are other overriding grounds for not transferring him to the territory of the requesting Party.</P>
    <P>The significant thing there is that all that relates to a person already in custody, not to a person who has to surrender himself into custody for the purpose of exercising what the Minister inaccurately calls the rights being provided under this Bill, There is no parallel, far from it. This convention in no way relates to a person who is charged, and who is on bail as the case might be here, surrendering himself into custody to go into another jurisdiction, and to remain in custody there while evidence is being given.  It does not correspond, and the Minister cannot suggest that what we are doing here is simply following a precedent which is already there.  Even to the extent that there are provisions which may or may not correspond, it is evident from the exceptions that are provided for under article 11 that the transfer may be refused if the person in custody does not consent and if there are other overriding grounds for not transferring him into the territory of the requesting party.</P>
    <P>Article 12 goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The witness or expert, whatever his nationality, appearing on a summons before the judicial authorities of the requesting Party shall not be prosecuted or detained or subjected to any other restriction of his personal liberty in the territory of that Party in respect of acts or conventions anterior to his departure from the territory of the requested Party.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister seems to think that by saying, &ldquo;We are talking of one convention but there is another convention, that of mutual assistance, and that deals with this kind of thing&rdquo; that that is consistent with what we are doing here.  He seems to <Col N="528" /> think by doing that he can throw us all off the trail.  In fact by trying to rely on an authority which does not exist he is showing just how weak his case is.</P>
    <P>I should like to have the Minister's comments on that.  The Minister will have to clear this up because he is the man who said there would be confusion.  The Minister said that constitutional guarantees and guarantees under the Convention of Human Rights by way of right of action in our courts could cause confusion. Last night I asked the Minister to indicate precisely what he meant by that.</P>
    <P>An action can be brought before our courts based on the deprival of rights which are in statute law.  In the same action you can bring a claim for infringement of your common law rights and, would you believe it&mdash;and the Minister knows this very well&mdash;in the same action you can bring a claim for infringement of your constitutional rights. That is the way it is at the moment. Many actions in our courts, particularly appeals before the Supreme Court, incorporate claims for breaches against all three.  No one ever suggests that that gives rise to confusion.  It is the business of the law to protect all rights, to vindicate each of them, whether they arise by statute, common law or constitution.</P>
    <P>If we saw fit to introduce the convention into our domestic law to that extent, it would of course be the business of the law to uphold the rights under that convention and it would not cause confusion. I cannot see how the Minister can say it would cause confusion.  I do not know whether he is suggesting that lawyers would be confused, that they would not know which right applied.  I doubt if he is saying that because he would have a low opinion of the professional capacity of a profession to which he and I belong.  Indeed, any profession must know the basic precepts on which their professional services are based. I do not see the confusion.  I invite the Minister to point out to me where the confusion arises.  That seems to have been one of the strong arguments relied on last night.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> The Minister has not as yet dealt with the question we relied on from the very start, almost from the first argument that was raised here. Nothing that we have said here is implying that there is any defect in our laws.  Nothing is implied that our Constitution is less than concerned and determined about individual rights.  I think the Minister will concede that I may well have more respect for at least the origins of the Constitution than the reality of it.  So I would be the last person to denigrate the provisions of that Constitution.</P>
    <P>I want to agree with the Minister to this extent&mdash;neither is there an implication in what we are saying here that there is no respect at all for the rule of law within the United Kingdom. Far from it.  No one has ever suggested that.  The Minister raises that as if that argument was presented from this side of the House and then proceeds to knock it.  Will the Minister please defeat the arguments that are presented to him?  No one here has said that there is no respect for law in the United Kingdom. Of course, there is.  No one has said that the citizen in the United Kingdom cannot vindicate his rights in the courts of the United Kingdom.  Of course, he can.  What we are saying is that, of course, he can.  Let us be clear on that.  Let no one have any doubts either but that we are as fiercely concerned as we must be&mdash;I think this was said from the very start, on the Second Stage&mdash;to ensure what this Bill would hope to do, namely, eliminate terrorist activities and ensure the proper application of the law to those charged with those activities so that we could work together in harmony and peace.  We are as determined as anyone is to achieve that and the Minister can have our full support in that.  We are not engaged in an obstructionist activity here for the sake of protecting people who should be amenable.</P>
    <P>Our amendment, unfortunately, was not accepted and we are prepared to try to make this work the best way it can.  I want to clear those misconceptions out of the way because there <Col N="530" /> are some implications, an implication even this morning in one of the newspapers&mdash;I am not saying it directly implied but it seemed to&mdash;that we here are trying to protect the men of violence in some way or another. Nothing is further from the truth but we are not going to see the rule of law in any way jeopardised by what we are going to do in this House.</P>
    <P>Having cleared away some of those misconceptions, I want to say that I have mentioned three points already: (1) this convention that the Minister says does not apply; (2) I asked him to tell me precisely what he means by the confusion that will arise if we incorporate this and (3)&mdash;I come back to this now&mdash;reciprocity.  The Minister has not dealt with that to my knowledge in any of his replies on this.  We have mentioned it.  Each time I have spoken on this I have said that this amendment by us is on the basis that there would be a similar amendment contained in the legislation within the United Kingdom.  The Minister says that, in fact, the whole kernel of the operation of this legislation is that there will be reciprocal arrangements.</P>

      <P>Good.  That is fine. I can leave it at that for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one thing clear.  The Minister talked in terms of rights. There is a little touch of irony about this, that he said what he did this morning in the presence of that great defender of rights, who has lain on the streets in New York to defend fundamental rights, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who has earned an international reputation for himself as being concerned and sympathetic about rights.  I thought there was a little touch of irony when he sat beside the Minister for Justice this <Col N="531" /> morning when that Minister talked about the rights we were conferring in this Bill.  A fundamental right of every accused man is the right to be present at his own trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not conferring that on him.  The Minister talked in terms of rights he was conferring in this Bill.  He is not conferring that right.  He has that anyway. Every constitution that has any provisions in relation to that anywhere in the world must have that there of necessity and the conventions of Europe incorporate that.  Nonetheless, the Minister comes in and implies that we are giving that right in this Bill and when you give rights it is only when those rights, as he says, are infringed that you can make a complaint.  That right is there always.  In this Bill we are very definitely limiting and qualifying that fundamental right because we are saying to him, &ldquo;Yes, you can exercise your fundamental right but in this case, as in no other case, to do it you must surrender yourself into custody.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How, in the name of any kind of reason, can the Minister suggest that that is conferring a right when I think he has now acknowledged that that absolute right is there in any event? I should like to have the Minister's comments on this when I am finished. The absolute right is there and the constitutional lawyer beside the Minister would agree with that 100 per cent.  If that absolute right is being qualified or limited in this Bill, which it is, how does the Minister say he is conferring a right?  I should like to know that.</P>
      <P>Terminology sometimes is very important and what we are concerned about is: in the limitation of that absolute right that is there, which is in every constitution that has written details or in any convention that is directed in that area, what strict legal or constitutional guarantees does our Minister rely on?  We cannot see them. We do not see them anywhere.  That is why we are trying to incorporate this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has come again and <Col N="532" /> simply said that if it breaks down, if there is a breach, we will not operate it.  That is not the way the law must operate.  The constitutional lawyer beside the Minister now must be sensitive to, almost offended by, that kind of argument.  If the law were to be introduced on the basis that if it does not work we will not go ahead with it, it would be a very strange basis for law indeed.  As I said last night, our Constitution absolutely obliges us to vindicate the personal rights of the citizens in any law that we pass.  We must defend them.  That means that we must reserve here in our legislation, in so far as we can, the obligation that is imposed on us in the Constitution.  We cannot simply stand back and say, if it works, fair enough and if it does not work, we stop operating it.  That is the basis on which we are introducing this.</P>
    <P>I have raised four points.  The Minister says he has replied to one of them already.  I should like him to deal with each of them.  When he does, we may perhaps be able to reach some consensus on the basis that we all want the same conclusion but we cannot allow that this could be done by our qualifying or limiting the fundamental rights of any individual, particularly by transferring him to a custody over which we would have no control, in respect of which we cannot give any direction or have any immediate supervision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this question of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters in the course of making the argument that evidence on commission in criminal matters is provided for in Europe and that it is not a strange thing within the civil law countries as it is in common law countries.  It was in that context that I raised the argument. Deputy O'Kennedy says that I am misleading the House and that I attempted to mislead the House.  What I said was and the point I raised was that this European Convention provides for the taking of evidence on commission in criminal matters.  That is not misleading the House.</P>

      <P>No question of it. I am afraid the matter went above Deputy O'Kennedy's head because, as he says honestly himself, he did not have the convention before him.  I raised it in that context, that this question of evidence on commission is a normal thing in civil law countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that absolutely. I was making the case, and I make it again, that the provisions for evidence on commission in criminal matters is not an unknown procedure in civil law countries of Europe and I referred to the existence of a convention for mutual assistance in criminal matters to sustain any argument that it is a common procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy did not understand my argument he should not criticise it and he should not accuse me of saying something I did not say.  I made the argument that there is ample precedent in European law for evidence on commission in criminal matters and I gather from what Deputy O'Kennedy has now said that he admits the validity of that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were only concerned with evidence on commission in this Bill we would not be arguing about it at all.  We are concerned about the accused being transferred in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Kennedy has no objection to evidence on commission in criminal trials, does he object to a provision ensuring that an accused be present, or would be rather that the evidence on commission be taken in the absence of the accused?  It is in ease of the accused that we are providing that he be present with immunity.  It is wrong of Deputy O'Kennedy to accuse me of misleading; but may be it is not wrong, because he did not understand what the argument was.  My argument was that there is ample precedent for evidence on commission in criminal trials and that apparently is now conceded by Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been found out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is conceded by Deputy O'Kennedy who is now going to say that there is no precedent for accused persons to go in custody to another jurisdiction for the hearing of evidence on commission in criminal trials.  I did not say that the convention was a precedent for that and I <Col N="535" /> have no doubt that the record will vindicate me in that regard.  It is in ease of an accused that there would be provision for him to go because if that provision is not made, and it is conceded by Deputy O'Kennedy that evidence on commission is a normal enough thing, we would then have a situation of evidence on commission being taken in the absence of the accused with no provision for his attendance.  I submit that the provision in this Bill which gives the accused the right to go North, with all the immunities that are guaranteed to him, is in ease of the accused's position and that that maintains his rights to a fair trial.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the point that I alleged that there would be confusion. I cannot bring the matter any further than to make a self-evident proposition, that every piece of legislation is subject to the Constitution. It does not have to recite that it is subject to the Constitution and that it gives all the rights given in the Constitution. Automatically every Bill is subject to the Constitution and, likewise, all our law is subject to the European Convention on Human Rights because we have ratified it.  It does not add to the position of any citizen with regard to his rights under either of those basic documents to note the existence of either or both of those documents in a particular Act of Parliament.  Every Act of Parliament has to be constitutional; otherwise it falls.  I submit that this Bill when it becomes an Act will stand a constitutional test and to engage in this business of writing into a Bill something which is already law must surely lead to confusion and is a self-evident proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my question.  I asked the Minister to show me how in practice it would give rise to confusion.  I mentioned that in practice at the moment one can have an action which incorporates a claim for infringement of criminal law rights, common law rights and statutory rights and I asked him to add a fourth for the rights guaranteed under the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statute that will enact something that is already law and that is what the amendment is asking me to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said one of the reasons the Opposition were pressing this amendment was in the hope that if it was accepted and the Bill incorporated the European Convention of Human Rights the British would be forced to introduce a reciprocal measure.  However, I should like to make the point that the availability of this convention does not depend on it being written into a particular Act of Parliament; it is already available within our jurisdiction for our citizens and within the United Kingdom jurisdiction for UK citizens.  Any UK citizen complaining of a breach of the convention has his remedy to go to Strasbourg, just as our citizens have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can he sue through the British courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>His position is not improved in any way by writing it into a particular Bill.  Even more important is the fact that, because it is already part of the UK law by virtue of the UK ratification of it and is part of our law, the UK can complain against us in Strasbourg and we can complain against the UK.  The position with regard to individual citizens or international relations is not improved or enhanced by this amendment.  The amendment is well intentioned but it it only window dressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not serious when he says our amendment is only window dressing. There is a little more than that to it. We will be dealing with this until such time as the Minister decides to pull down the blinds and then it will become law.  That law will be applied to numerous people for a number of years and for that reason we have an obligation to tease this Bill out and point out the inconsistencies and weaknesses.  That is what we are engaged in.  It would be more convenient for us to pack it up at this stage and <Col N="537" /> have a vote, but we would not be discharging our obligations if we did that. If the Minister's reference to the UK was his answer to my question about reciprocity, it was not an answer.  The Minister said it would make no difference because at present a UK citizen can still go to Strasbourg.  Under our proposals the rights of the convention would be capable of being sued on in the courts of the UK or of our own jurisdiction.  That is the difference. If the Minister is suggesting that that makes no difference to the present position he is flying in the face of reality.  It makes a great difference. We are not basing our case on saying that we are holier than the UK generally, that our laws are better or that we have a higher regard for the criminal law, although there are grounds for concern about the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  We are saying that these rights must be secured here and in the North.  There is nothing in this legislation to provide for that and the Minister is flying in the face of reality when he says it would make no difference.  Of course it would.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we based our reason for ratifying this convention as an international guarantee on a very clear principle, that if we transferred people out of our jurisdiction to another over which we would have no constitutional or legislative control, the only way each jurisdiction could guarantee a standard by which both of us would be bound would be through the European Convention to which we would both adhere, thereby introducing a standard and an authority which would be imposed on procedures under our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole exercise is so new that we cannot transfer people to this other jurisdiction and say: &ldquo;We hope everything will work out and if it does not we will discontinue the application of the legislation&rdquo;.  This is not the way to approach law. We are now about to mingle or to merge with authorities in a jurisdiction over which we have no control &mdash;the police forces and courts of Northern Ireland&mdash;and at least we must ensure that a standard will be adhered to, in this case a very <Col N="538" /> acceptable commendable standard, which will give us and the UK some guarantee of control rather than the very hazy and totally unconstitutional attitude which the Minister has presented to us: that if it is not worked fairly we will discontinue it. That is not the constitutional guarantee which states that we must write into legislation guarantees for the rights of our citizens.</P>
    <P>The third point is that we must have regard to history, past and present. The Minister has acknowledged that the UK have not ratified the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.  That emerged only a few minutes ago.  They have no reluctance at all to become involved in reciprocal legislation with us, which incidentally does not guarantee the same protection and rights as the convention to which the Minister referred.  There is a strange contradiction in this.  Although we are not adopting a holier than thou attitude to the British and their courts, a Fianna Fáil Government laid a complaint against them, which this Government inherited, for inhuman treatment and torture of people in custody in Northern Ireland.  We believe the Government have received a summary of the findings of that court and we believe they vindicate our complaints, that the court has found there was inhuman treatment and torture of a terrifying nature.</P>
    <P>That has happened in the recent past, part of the unfortunate contemporary history of these islands, and the Minister is asking us to close our eyes to all of this and he has more or less implied that that kind of thing cannot happen because the people to whom we will be entrusting the men who will be going North and to whom they will be surrendering themselves have a totally clean record.  That should be the position if we are to administer this law as the Minister said we should&mdash;the security forces there should be fiercely concerned with justice and should be seen to be so.  I do not think any police force there could measure up to those standards.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there are many policemen, <Col N="539" /> may be the vast majority of them, who are concerned with fair play and justice.  We want to see them operate to guarantee the protection of citizens in custody.  We have not seen it from the Devanney days right through the torture period.  We know there are elements within the RUC who will not guarantee such protection and the Minister cannot ask us to turn our backs on that.</P>
    <P>We have asked him if there is any guarantee that structures and disciplines have been changed, and of course he cannot guarantee that. That is why we want built into this legislation these fundamental guarantees in the convention.  It is not asking for anything more than we should demand.  It would be different if we were entering into reciprocal legislation of this nature with Holland or Germany because we have no reason to apprehend from recent history&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no cause for complaint.  We would be glad to co-operate with such jurisdictions but we know that much of the trouble and unrest in Northern Ireland in the past, indeed the breaking point for the minority, has been caused by the lack of the disciplines to which I have referred.  We want to see those days gone and the Minister is being less than realistic when he implies they have gone.  The Minister has not satisfied me that he is relying in any relevant way on any other convention of Europe because if this legislation only referred to evidence and conditions in criminal trials we would not be arguing this at all.  The whole crux of this argument is that a man must surrender himself in custody for the hearing of evidence against him.  I assume the Minister was referring to a precedent for this.  I think I was right in my assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister found out that we had discovered he was wrong he backtracked and said that it only referred to taking evidence on commission. If that is the Minister's argument, then it is totally irrelevant or next to it.  We are concerned with <Col N="540" /> more fundamental issues and the Minister's introducing that convention as an argument in his defence certainly misled me.  That is all I shall say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of reciprocity, Deputy O'Kennedy says the need for this is evidenced by the fact that we had to make a complaint in regard to certain actions committed on detained persons by the security forces in Northern Ireland. First of all, the acts complained of occurred over five years ago.  The people have been compensated in the ordinary courts and the convention is the reason why compensation has been paid and redress got.  The convention has been found adequate and sufficient to provide the protections now being advanced by the Opposition as the reason why this amendment should be incorporated in this legislation. Protection already exists in both jurisdictions and it has been proved to be adequate by virtue of what has actually happened.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but as far as the individuals whose rights were infringed are concerned they have all been compensated in the domestic court by awards of damages of substantial amounts against the Government concerned. That is what counts where the individual is concerned and not so much the theoretical findings of an international tribunal.  That may be an international sanction to force a positive remedy in the State concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost certainly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I say the existence of the convention and the procedures available have proved adequate to protect those who needed this protection.  It is a bit pointless to say <Col N="541" /> that because something happened five years ago we should now introduce this convention into our domestic law.  The fact is the convention already operates as part of the domestic law of both jurisdictions and that has proved an adequate protection.</P>
      <P>On the question of the commission, I did not argue, as Deputy O'Kennedy seemed to imply, that the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters provided for the transfer of an accused in custody.  I said it was a provision and precedent for taking evidence on commission in criminal matters.  Deputy Blaney argued that witnesses should not be too cowardly to come down here and give their evidence in the actual courts and it was in that context I made the argument that there were precedents for the taking of evidence on commission in criminal matters and I pointed to this convention as the precedent and I was accused of misleading the House.  I deny that accusation absolutely.  I did not make that argument.</P>

      <P>With all due respect we have tried very hard to get the Minister to see our point of view.  Unfortunately his attitude on this amendment has not been any different from his attitude on the first amendment, to which a time limit, as it were, applied. We have made the best case we can and with as much authority as possible to show there is need for this amendment.  The Minister was the only spokesman on the Government benches and he refused to accept this amendment.  I do not think his arguments for refusing stand up.  On a number of occasions he has deliberately dragged a red herring across the trail.  More than once he sought the ruling of the Chair whether or not a matter was <i>sub judice</i> and could not therefore be discussed.  That arose last <Col N="542" /> week on a question tabled by the leader of my party to find out when the report in the case Ireland versus the United Kingdom would be available to the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that on the highest authority and advice available to him he believes the Bill is constitutional. That is his opinion.  Its constitutionality can be decided in another place.  The Minister dismissed our amendment on the ground that, so long as the Bill is constitutional, there is no need for the European Convention on Human Rights.  It was pointed out that the Constitution lays down principles.  If the Constitution is everything, is there any need for a convention?  The Minister is now in an impossible situation because of having refused to accept our amendment.  The main case for our amendment is based, first of all, on reciprocity.  If it is in our Bill, then the British must also have it in their Bill.</P>
      <P>Secondly, this amendment would allow a citizen to bring an action in our courts for an infringement of the rights specified in the convention.  The Minister's argument is that there is an international tribunal for hearing grievances and getting compensation. This is a very thin argument.  We know the length of time it takes for a case to be processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The aggrieved parties to whom I referred had their compensation paid years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree the time involved can be very considerable.  There is another very solid argument for our amendment. This is the first time we in the Republic have accepted so-called guarantees from another jurisdiction.  These so-called guarantees are now the foundation of this legislation.  It is only natural that we set about looking for the minimum standards&mdash;I stress minimum standards&mdash;under the convention to protect our citizens.  I believe the amendment can be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking to the background to the European Convention on Human Rights and our own role on it, we were always to the forefront in adhering to the principles and standards of the Council of Europe and we were proud <Col N="543" /> to be initiators with regard to fundamental rights and freedoms.  We were the first country to permit a case to be taken.  We have a definite responsibility to extend where possible the application of the convention to countries that may not have adopted it to the same extent as we have.  As has been pointed out in this debate, we are one of nine countries who have adopted and ratified without reservation all the conventions and protocols of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Our amendment would ensure that we would extract on a reciprocal basis a similar arrangement or commitment from the British Government that they would incorporate it into their law. We should give the lead in connection with human rights, particularly when there are fundamental matters involved in our legislation.  Article 2, protocol 4 of the convention has been quoted and I will not repeat it.  In addition, articles 5 and 6 of the convention have been quoted and discussed.  Basically what we are trying to get across to the House, the Government and the Minister&mdash;it appears in vain&mdash;is that what we are seeking are minimum standards so far as the European Convention on Human rights is concerned.</P>
    <P>When we are taking responsibility for what is done elsewhere, over which we have no control, the very least we can do is to introduce for those who will be subjected to the procedures the guarantees of the convention so far as the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are concerned.  This should be basic to a proposal of this kind.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out repeatedly, everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.  It appears to us that section 11 of the Bill is not in conformity with article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In order to exercise the rights guaranteed to an individual he has to surrender himself into custody and this deprives a person of liberty.  To my mind it is in contravention of the convention.  Article 6 of the convention says that in the determination of civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against a person, he is entitled to a <Col N="544" /> fair public hearing.  We must ask the question: is it fair if the man is not present at the hearing when evidence is given against him?  In order to exercise the rights which the person is meant to be guaranteed he must surrender himself into custody and thus deprive himself of the liberty guaranteed under the convention.</P>
    <P>I believe the provisions of the convention have been thwarted both in the spirit and in the letter by the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister and his party realise this and they are prepared to live with it.  If the person involved has to deprive himself of one of the rights and exercises another right in a very limited way, it is obvious that this Bill takes no account of the provisions of the convention.  I honestly believe this to be the position but evidently the Minister does not accept the argument.</P>
    <P>We made the point that the convention recognises the need for emergency legislation.  I said that in my opening remarks on the amendment. However, the convention also states that minimum standards are required, and that is all we want. The Offences Against the State Act was found to be in accordance with the principles and minimum rights of the convention.  Now we have new and novel legislation, operating in a different area altogether, and there is more reason than ever before for minimum standards to be laid down.  This is the first time in the history of this State that we have involved ourselves in the administration of justice and the implementation of law in another jurisdiction over which we have no control&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may hold that view but in these circumstances we cannot depend on the very loose guarantees, the like of which the Minister gave during the course of this debate while trying in vain to please members of the Labour Party who, seemingly, are in revolt against this legislation.  These guarantees were unacceptable to members of his own political grouping <Col N="545" /> which form the Government and they are not acceptable to my party.</P>
      <P>The performance to date of the police force in the Six Counties can only lead to distrust and apprehension because of the way they have acted. The SDLP have refused to give acceptance to the RUC.  We consider proper our standards with regard to such matters as bail, arrest without warrant and conditions of custody.  Seemingly the standards employed in the Six Counties are different.  If both jurisdictions are to work together, why not have a uniform standard?  The European Convention on Human Rights is the proper basis on which to introduce this uniformity.  We differ in our standards and procedures from those in the Six Counties and, because of this, we need to have standards co-ordinated and related more directly to the most desirable international standards. I am referring to the convention, which we helped bring into being and of which we are proud to be founder members.</P>
      <P>Our proposals guarantee minimum rights and no more than that.  The attitude of the Minister and Government is regrettable.  They are refusing to accept this amendment.  To say the least, it makes a mockery of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been ignored and put aside.  I realise the practical political reality of the situation is that the Minister has the manpower to vote down the amendment.  We have tried in a fair, honest and sincere way to convince him that our amendment could only improve the situation because it would lead to the minimum standards which everyone would like to see.  The Minister has the opportunity now of accepting or voting down our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I should like to ask a question which he might deal with in his reply. It is a question of some significance. In the case of an accused person travelling to the North of Ireland under the provisions of the Bill for the purpose of being present at the taking of evidence on commission, in the event of his being maltreated or interfered with in any way which <Col N="546" /> would give rise to a claim for compensation, what would be the procedure whereby that claim could be instituted and against whom could it be instituted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The action would lie at the suit of the injured party against the authorities where the ill-treatment took place.  If it happened in Northern Ireland it would like against the Government of the United Kingdom and it would be on all-fours with the actions that have been successfully taken in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister contend that this State would have no responsibility in view of the fact that it was under their jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The State would have no direct responsibility because it could not intervene in what would be an internal matter in another jurisdiction. However, the State would have a great moral standing to ensure that the action would not be impeded and I would be very surprised if that action went to a hearing, because the actions which have already taken place have been settled consequent on the complaint to the European Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy says that this is the only action open to him.  The best action available to him is to be able to proceed in the courts of the jurisdiction where he has sustained his loss.  That is the proper venue for him to obtain redress.  He could not take an action in the courts here for something which happened in another jurisdiction. There would be no defendant; there would be nobody to sue.  He would have to sue in the courts having jurisdiction over the defendant so that if the courts gave him a decree it could be enforced against that defendant.  With respect, it is inconceivable that one could even contemplate that such a person would have an action in the courts here.  I would be satisfied that his action would be well founded in those courts depending on the strength of the complaint he could make and that would be behind that action.  This Government and this State would be the moral authority to ensure that his action would take place.  If it were well founded I am confident that it would be settled because it would be open <Col N="548" /> to this State to lay a complaint for breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>We have debated this amendment for up to five hours, one might say an entire Dáil sitting day, with the exception of Question Time and Private Members' time, the normal time available for public business.  We have gone round in circles.  The arguments have been put forward and answered.  I have not convinced the Opposition.  I would be surprised if I had.  They have not convinced me and I am sure they would be equally surprised if they had.  I am satisfied that the rights which worry the Opposition are fully protected in the legislation concerned.  They are provided by our Constitution.  They are provided by the fact that this country and the UK have ratified this convention. The proof is that, where there were infringements of those rights, compensation and redress have been paid in full.  I move that the question be put.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first major section in this Bill.  It is a very lengthy one with nine rather complicated subsections in it.  It deals in general with the commission of offences in Northern Ireland.  The first point I would like to make on the section as a whole is to refer once again to the judgment of Mr. Justice McMahon in the Foyle Fisheries case, which was delivered towards the end of November last and in which he makes a number of decisions about the power of the Oireachtas to enact law in respect of areas over which it does not at the moment hold jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I raised this in general terms on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I asked the Minister to consider the implications of that judgment.  As far as I can ascertain, in his reply he did not do so except in a very general way.  I do not think he dealt with the details of it, and I think it should be considered now again on this section, to which it is appropriate.</P>
      <P>It seems very doubtful on the strength of that judgment and on the basis of the generally accepted canons of international law whether or not this or any other State can enact extra-territorial legislation in respect of offences or crimes committed outside its own jurisdiction unless the people who are to be made subject to that extra-territorial legislation are, in fact, citizens of the country enacting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave the relevant quotations from Mr. Justice McMahon's judgment in relation to that, and it did seem from that that he was indicating that the power of the Oireachtas to enact extra-territorial legislation was confined so far as prosecuting people was concerned to those who were citizens of Ireland or who were resident within the jurisdiction here.  If this were not so you would have a situation that could become quite farcical, that the Oireachtas here could purport to enact <Col N="554" /> legislation in relation to offences committed, for example, by Japanese citizens in Japan.  The Oireachtas could go through the motions of stating that if somebody did in Japan a certain act he would commit an offence against our law.  There is absolutely no point in the Oireachtas stultifying itself in this way by making any such provision when it is perfectly evident that the Oireachtas is not going to be in a position to enforce a provision of that kind.</P>
    <P>One wonders if in the example I have taken to make the doing of a certain act in Japan by a Japanese citizen an offence, whether, if that Japanese citizen subsequently turned up in Ireland, it would be right and proper that he should be prosecuted for that offence.  It seems to me that it would be a matter that should be dealt with, in the example I have given, by the Japanese courts.  I have deliberately chosen as an example a distant country in order to demonstrate the futility of trying to legislate in respect of people who are not our citizens, who are not normally subject to our law, in regard to acts they may commit outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that Japan is a bit far-fetched and all the rest of it. The reason I give that example is to demonstrate that for any country or any part of a country which is not presently subject to the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas and the courts established under our jurisdiction, the argument is just the same.  The fact that Northern Ireland is part of our island and a part of our national territory over which, pending the reintegration of the national territory, we do not currently exercise jurisdiction, does not make the argument any different to the argument in respect of Japan or any other distant country.</P>
    <P>There was in the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1958, certain extra-territorial provisions and, as the House is aware, some of those provisions were declared invalid by the High Court in this case which was decided last November.</P>

      <P>The actual decision may be based on the points the Minister is referring to, but nonetheless there were various statements, which I quoted the last time, of Mr. Justice McMahon in that judgment in relation to the powers of the Oireachtas generally in regard to extra-territorial legislation.  This section 2, which is, as I say, very lengthy and complicated, gives or purports to give, at any rate, extraordinary wide coverage to offences committed in Northern Ireland or attempted to be committed in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister in some detail whether he is satisfied that the generally accepted limitations on extra-territorial legislative power, both of this State and of states generally, are not infringed by the very wide-ranging provisions of this section, which go far beyond the provisions of an Act like the Foyle Fisheries Act, or any other Act we have had in which there is extra-territorial effect given to legislative provisions of this Parliament. We have had a very limited number of cases where the State purported to confer extra-territorial jurisdiction on our ports, mainly confined to matters such as hijacking of aeroplanes, incidents which of their very nature are international in form.</P>
      <P>This section is not confined to specialised crimes of that kind.  It extends to 13 different categories of crime as set out in the Schedule.  Some of these are very wide provisions indeed, and this section should be considered carefully before we commit ourselves to it.  The Minister should spell out the precise circumstances of our power to make and enforce extra-territorial legislation.  It might be best if we went through each of these subsections separately, because they are all to some extent independent of one another.  Each is a substantive provision in itself; I do not want to go through them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear what the Minister has to say generally on the powers of extra-territorial legislation, but I think the Minister should bear in <Col N="556" /> mind the recital of cases by Mr. Justice McMahon in that judgment where it was held that until the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, Saorstat Éireann, established under the Constitution of 1922, had no power to make any extra-territorial legislation.  Under the 1937 Constitution in this country the power of the Oireachtas to enact extra-territorial legislation is confined to whatever powers Saorstat Éireann had in this respect at the time that that Constitution lapsed in 1936.  It is a technical matter, but it is likely to be challenged in the courts afterwards if and when this Bill is passed.  I think it is appropriate that it should be considered in some detail here.</P>

      <P>This question of the power of a sovereign jurisdiction to legislate extra-territorially was one which was debated at length on the Second Stage in both Houses, and it was made clear beyond doubt that every sovereign nation has the right to legislate extra-territorially.  There are many well-known principles which justify this, well-settled principles of international law.  The concept of extra-territoriality is so well settled that to cast doubt on it now nearly defies hearing.  It is well settled on a number of principles, the protective principle, the passive personality principle, the nationality principle and the universality principle. All these principles have been defined both judicially and by writers on the subject.  Numerous examples of them can be given all over the world where nations, for the protection of territory or for the protection of their citizens, take powers to legislate extra territorially.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat the speech I made in this House and in the Seanad on the Second Stage in which I dealt at considerable length and in great detail&mdash;so much so that I was criticised for making an unduly legal speech&mdash;on the concept of extra-territoriality. I dealt in great detail on the concept of extra-territoriality to show how well established and accepted it is as a principle in international law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numerous examples of extra-territoriality in relation to specific matters.  I grant you, that extra-territorial jurisdiction covering a wide range of offences is possibly unprecedented in common law countries. When one examines the Bill the offences in it are run-of-the-mill albeit serious criminal offences.  The fact that it is unprecedented with regard to creating a number of extra-territorial offences in one Bill does not in my submission invalidate the principle that extra-territoriality is well settled. It so happens that the circumstances in which it has arisen up to now have required legislation only in specific areas such as piracy, hijacking of aircrafts and various specific crimes.</P>
      <P>Here on this island we have a situation which has to be dealt with under the principles of international law and extra-territoriality.  That situation demands that the crimes to be dealt with are not just these isolated international crimes but ordinary domestic run-of-the-mill crimes.  The principles on which the taking of extra-territorial jurisdiction is founded are well known. The State is entitled to take this jurisdiction to protect itself or to protect its citizens.  I think it is right that it should be so.  It is also necessary to take it in order to preserve the comity of nations.  These matters are so fundamental to international law and are so well settled that I do not think they require a debate at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to Mr. Justice McMahon's judgment in the Devine case.  I dealt with it when I was replying to the Second Reading debate.  There is nothing in that judgment which supports the view that extra-territorial power can be taken only in respect of the acts of one's own citizens.  Mr. Justice McMahon was considering the Foyle Fisheries Act of 1952.  It provided that the provisions <Col N="558" /> of the Act relating to offences applied to acts and omissions in any part of the Foyle area by a person resident in the State.  That particular Act confined the extra-territorial offence to acts by a person residing in the State.  That is not to say that because that particular Act was confined to persons resident in the State that all Acts taking extra-territorial jurisdiction are under similar constraint. I do not know what the policy reason was at the time, possibly because there was a reciprocating Act of the other jurisdiction and it was to deal with this narrow question of the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>It was argued before Judge McMahon that the laws of Saorstát Éireann referred to in Article 3 of the Constitution meant the laws in force in Saorstát Éireann at the time of the enactment of the Constitution and since there was no legislation corresponding to the Act of 1952, that is, the Foyle Fisheries Act, that the Oireachtas had no power to give extra-territorial effect to the Act.  In other words, it was sought to be relied on in front of the courts that the reference in Article 3 to the laws of Saorstát Éireann meant that there was no power under the 1937 Constitution to give extra-territorial jurisdiction unless it was already there in some law of Saorstát Éireann.</P>
    <P>That argument was rejected and Judge McMahon at pages 5 to 6 said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>In my opinion Article 3 of the Constitution in providing that the laws enacted by Parliament shall have the like extra-territorial effect as the laws of Saorstát Éireann means the like extra-territorial effect as the laws of Saorstát Éireann were capable of having.</P>
    <P>Of course, under all principles of international law, the laws of Saorstát Éireann were capable of having whatever extra-territorial effect the Government or Parliament of the day chose to give them.  The judgment refers to the fact that under Article 3 of the Constitution laws expressed to operate extra-territorially can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern <Col N="559" /> Ireland.  That is what Judge McMahon held, that they could bind those who were subjects of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very nub of the point that I have been making.  Judge McMahon went out of his way to use the words &ldquo;those who are subjects of the State&rdquo;.  On Second Reading I went into some detail as to who is or is not technically, under the Citizenship Act, a subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to finish I will answer that point.  I take the Deputy's point that he is relying on the judgment to state that extra-territorial legislation can apply only to subjects of the State.  I am saying that this was not what the judgment said.  If you like, the question of persons subject to the State arose because of the narrow wording of the Act.  The specific Act which was at issue in that judgment, this Act which provided for an extra-territorial offence, provided also that its jurisdiction extra-territorially referred only to a person resident in the State.  So, it was the Act that confined the extra-territoriality to the resident of the State, not the general principles of international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I please finish what I am saying?  The judge, as I say, referred to the fact that laws expressed to operate extra-territorially can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern Ireland.  He said that and that is so; it can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern Ireland or, if we so wish, in regard to their conduct everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that the judge did not hold that there was no power to affect non-nationals because that was not an issue before him and it is well settled in international law that any legislature, any sovereign State, can pass extra-territorial laws binding not merely or affecting not merely its own citizens but non-nationals as well. That is well settled.  The Deputy gave <Col N="560" /> the extreme example of something happening in Japan but, if we wanted we could give an example of a terrorist in Japan bombing, say, Irish property or taking action against Irish citizens out there.  It would be contrary to all principles of international law if we were incapable or did not have the power to pass a law to deal with such acts by a non-national inimical to our national interest.  This is one of the principles of international law, which particular principle, whether it be the passive or the active personality principle I could not say, is well settled.</P>
    <P>It is well settled in international law that a nation does have power to legislate extra-territorially not merely for its own subjects but also for non-nationals and it is on the theoretical basis that every sovereign State is entitled to take whatever action it pleases by its laws to protect itself, its territory, its citizens at home or abroad or its interests generally.  The effectiveness of the extra-territorial legislation may be another matter.  The effectiveness of taking power to deal with the extreme example raised by the Deputy is a separate issue and that is a matter that would have to be decided on as a matter of policy from time to time but there is no doubt that the power under international law to legislate extra-territorially not merely for one's own citizens but also for non-nationals is well settled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, this is the key section in the legislation.  Section 2 is the section from which the Bill derives all its force.  It is a very complicated section and it is quite difficult to follow the implications of the different subsections in many respects but one thing does emerge very clearly from it, no matter to what extent one is able to comprehend its complexities, that is, that it is a pretty horrific piece of legislation and it is very, very far-reaching indeed in its effects and I want to raise one or two points of particular significance in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) deals with where a person in the State or in Northern Ireland aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence <Col N="561" /> under section 1 or section 3.  Section 3 is the section which, in effect, makes it an offence to escape from custody in Northern Ireland.  That is a section that most of us find particularly repulsive. One can listen to the Minister making strong arguments in regard to acts of violence, atrocities of one sort or another, but knowing what we do about the situation in the North of Ireland, the things that are done there by the authorities as well as by others, it is very difficult to accept that we here in this part of the country should make it an offence to escape from custody in the North of Ireland.  I imagine the Minister will be quick to point out to me that escaping from custody would not be an offence where the person is detained because of an offence which is not within the scope of the Bill and also, of course&mdash;this is not as relevant as it was&mdash;escaping from internment is not an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It never applied to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I mean. I accept that.  Now that internment is ended, it is not as relevant as it was. Even when there was internment, escaping from internment was not an offence.  I want to direct the attention of the House, and the Minister to one aspect of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in discussing subsection (2) (a) we are automatically discussing section 3 and I should like the House to include section 3 in the discussion at this stage. If we do not do so, there will certainly be repetition when we come to section 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that section 3 makes it an offence for a person to escape from custody in Northern Ireland.  I want to point out that in the terms of the Bill if a person aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence under section 3 he is guilty of an offence.  In other words, if a person in the state of Northern Ireland aids, abets, counsels or procures a person to escape from custody he is guilty of an offence.  Surely, that is stretching things a bit too far.</P>
      <P>If a person from Northern Ireland is in custody and a Northern Ireland friend or relative suggests to him that he should escape&mdash;both are convinced of the injustice of his incarceration&mdash; and the Northern Ireland friend or relative, father, mother, brother or sister, does no more than suggest to the person in custody: &ldquo;For Heaven's sake get out of this place if you possibly can&rdquo; that person is committing an offence.  In particular that would apply if the person in custody was being illtreated or subjected to any of the indignities about which we have heard so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were to happen, it is possible it would not be lawful custody and there would be no offence then of escaping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was being illtreated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that.  It is not difficult to visualise the sort of situation I am describing relating to a person in custody in Northern Ireland for a non-violent offence, an offence which need not necessarily be in any way associated with the sort of violence with which this Bill is primarily intended to deal.  The Schedule to the Bill is such that there are all sorts of offences for &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; crimes.  We could have a situation where a person in custody in Northern Ireland for one of these &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; crimes is being subjected to brutality or illtreatment and a relative or friend who would do no more than counsel him to escape from <Col N="563" /> custody if possible would be guilty of an offence under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I suggest that that is an impossible sort of provision for us to pass.  Section 2 is so comprehensive and omnibus in its provisions that one could literally take any person in the North or South and put him into jail on the basis of those provisions.  I feel I am in order in referring to the Schedule at this stage because section 2 is meaningless without the Schedule.  That Schedule includes in its list of offences many things which are &ldquo;normal&rdquo; crimes which would be committed from time to time by different individuals if there was never a situation in the North of Ireland.  In the normal way if a person commits one of these offences and comes into this jurisdiction in order to avoid prosecution for them the Northern Ireland authorities would be justified in instituting extradition proceedings.  On the face of a number of these offences there is no political content and, therefore, it would be quite normal for whoever happens to be in power in Northern Ireland to undertake extradition proceedings in regard to any of these offences.  The accused person, in order to defeat the extradition procedures would have to claim political motivation. In doing so he would have to disclose fully any defence he might have to the prosecution.  Then, the extradition procedures presumably having failed, the Northern Ireland authorities would institute proceedings under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would a person have to reveal his defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to defeat the extradition proceedings he would have to admit the offence but claim it was politically motivated because that is the only way he can defeat extradition proceedings.  He would have to admit commission of the offence and say he committed the offence, was politically motivated and wanted to resist the extradition proceedings.  The provisions of this Bill would then be brought into play and the Northern Ireland authorities would seek to have that person <Col N="564" /> prosecuted down here for the offence. However, that unfortunate person would find himself in the unhappy position of already having admitted to the offence.  In my view that person could be put in a double jeopardy. I should like the Minister to deal with that sort of situation.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister assure me that that sort of situation will not happen because it seems to me that if this Bill ever becomes operative that will be the normal routine; extradition proceedings first and after an admission by the accused that he committed the offence but was politically motivated there follows an automatic open and shut prosecution under this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect to section 2 which I should like to submit to the Minister and the House, and that is that we are handing over to some person or persons unknown a vitally important fundamental part of our legal and judicial process, the preparation of a <i>prima facie</i> case, the book of evidence.  It is a very important part of our criminal law in this part of the country that persons of integrity, persons we know and who are answerable to us as a community, are the persons who prepare the original documents in a criminal prosecution, assess the evidence, judge the nature of the crime and decide at a very early preliminary stage whether there is justification for the prosecution.</P>
      <P>That is an integral part of our criminal law process but it is that aspect that we are undoubtedly handing over and entrusting to people or agencies about whom we know nothing.  In so far as we know anything at all about them, we have not been given any great faith to believe in their integrity.  It seems to me that important process will be entrusted to people outside this jurisdiction, and more important, outside the moral ambience of this community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred at an early stage to persons cooking up books of evidence and the Minister got annoyed.  I suggest it is not <Col N="565" /> totally unreal on my part to suggest that at this vitally important preliminary stage of a prosecution there can be cooking, a fabrication of the case to be outlined in the book of evidence, the preliminary documents. That is something of very serious import in so far as our legal and judicial processes are concerned.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the Minister spoke at some length about our impeccable judicial traditions and standards, and everybody in the House agrees with that. Fortunately we have succeeded in this part of the country in building up a first class judicial system, fair, impartial, objective, incorruptible, and I am very much afraid the operation of section 2 will put all that in jeopardy because the whole judicial system of ours will have to come into play, will have to be motivated, triggered off, in the first instance by a basic document prepared outside this jurisdiction by persons about whom our judicial system has no knowledge.  That is a very serious matter and I hope the Minister will do something to reassure the House and the general public about that aspect.</P>
    <P>If we move on from there and take it that the book of evidence has been prepared without any guarantee on our part as to the way in which it was prepared or the basis or the motives which inspired its preparation, and then an accused person from the North of Ireland is in this State and is brought to trial on the basis of that book of evidence, is there not straight away a presumption of guilt against that person?  The very fact that he is here, that he has fled Northern Ireland&mdash; there may be perfectly legitimate reasons, fear, intimidation&mdash;immediately starts up a certain presumption of guilt against that unfortunate person. Then there is thrown against him a book of evidence which is prepared under the most dubious circumstances. Section 2 <i>ab initio</i> places that person in an unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, at the start the presumption of innocence until proved guilty is greatly weakened.  I can see that fundamental principle of our criminal law, that a person is totally and completely innocent until he has been <Col N="566" /> proved guilty, is attacked very strongly in the sort of situation that will be initiated under this section.</P>
    <P>I do not say this in any vindictive spirit or by way of any sort of challenge, but one gets an indication of that situation in the way the Minister has spoken about the Bill during the course of the debate.  I detected, and some others did, a presumption that all these people are terrorists.  He said the Bill is to deal with terrorists.  It is only when we remember that the Minister withdrew, very honourably, from that situation and said the Bill is intended to deal with people accused of being terrorists, that we see the point.  The Minister's whole approach has been getting terrorists and putting them in jail.  That is indicative of the sort of situation accused persons having fled from Northern Ireland will be placed in.</P>
    <P>Let us not for a moment fall into the trap of thinking that all of them are violent terrorists.  There may be people caught up in these machinations who will be perfectly innocent, persons who should be sympathised with because they had to flee from intimidation.  We must again remember that everybody who comes within the ambit of this Bill should be regarded as innocent until proved guilty, but the very circumstances will go against those fundamental basic rights of such people.  Then we come on the prosecution of the crime itself.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, we are straying far from this section, which creates the extra-territorial offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is this section which brings the trial into being.  If we had not got section 2 there would not be any trial.  I want to make the point that apart from the serious inhabitions which will be placed on an accused person&mdash;having to go to the North to confront his accusers, having to get evidence in his own defence &mdash;will be added the preliminary difficult situation in which the very circumstances placed him.  All in all, provisions of this section as it is open the way to a serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that <Col N="567" /> it is quite easy to visualise a totally innocent person going to jail or being punished in one way or another under the provisions of section 2.  It is so comprehensive, it is so interdependent, as Deputy O'Malley said, it is almost impossible to visualise a situation where a ruthless prosecuting counsel could not succeed in getting a conviction against a perfectly innocent person under some of the provisions of this section.  I dislike most of all the provisions in subsection (2) and other subsections about aiding, abetting or counselling the commission of an offence.</P>
    <P>To give an example of what I mean, subsection (4) provides:</P>
    <P>Where a person has committed an offence under subsection (1) or section 3 or attempted to commit any such offence, any other person who, in the State or in Northern Ireland, knowing or believing him to be guilty of the offence or attempt or of some other such offence or attempt, does without reasonable excuse any act with intent to impede his apprehension or prosecution in the State or in Northern Ireland shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>That is very wide and pretty comprehensive. Subsection (2) of section 1 provides:</P>
    <P>References in this Act to an act include references to an omission and references to the doing of an act include references to the making of an omission.</P>
    <P>That definition is then brought forward into the terms of subsection (4) and you have &ldquo;does without reasonable excuse any act&rdquo; and that can mean makes an omission without reasonable excuse &ldquo;with intent to impede his apprehension or prosecution in the State&rdquo;.  By doing nothing at all one can be guilty of an offence. That is putting justice beyond limits in the circumstances in which this Bill will be operating.  If an ordinary member of the public in Northern Ireland does not do something and that something would lead to apprehension or prosecution in this State, he will be guilty of an offence.  I <Col N="568" /> hope the Minister will be able to give me and the general public some reassurance on this.  I find the implications of subsection (2) unpalatable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4), to deal with the last point raised by Deputy Haughey, restates what is already the offence of being an accessory after the fact.  That is already part of our criminal law and always has been. The ingredients are contained in subsection (4) and the reason why they are repeated there is because the offence of being an accessory after the fact can only be applied to a felony whereas the extra-territorial offences are not being made felonies. The old-fashioned offence of accessory after the fact does not apply to extra-territorial offences committed under this Bill but it is nevertheless a serious offence and so it has to be restated here.  That is what subsection (4) does.  It merely restates what is already a long-standing part of our criminal law.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Haughey's allegation that a person doing nothing, without reasonable excuse, would be open to apprehension and prosecution here or in Northern Ireland, there will have to be an act of omission without reasonable excuse and with intent.  One could imagine a person, who has a duty to close a door, who does not carry out that duty and has no good reason for not carrying it out, with the intent of impending apprehension or prosecution and that is the sort of situation envisaged by subsection (4) and by the definition in subsection (2) of section 1.  It is not just a question of a person doing nothing willy-nilly finding himself guilty of committing a criminal offence.  There are more ingredients to it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey was worried about the scope being very wide and the possibility of a vindictive prosecutor prosecuting an innocent citizen in either jurisdiction and catching him for something.  I must reject that. Section 2 provides that the offences specified in the Schedule when done in Northern Ireland shall be offences against the State.  Then we go to the Schedule which covers quite a wide <Col N="569" /> range of serious criminal offences, but very specific criminal offences.  The remaining subsections of section 2 deal with ancilliary or consequential matters arising from the creation of extra-territorial offences.  They deal with the inchoate offences of attempting, conspiring, aiding, abetting, counselling and procurring.  Subsection (4) restates the old common law offence of accessory after the fact.  All through the subsections the matters are matters already part of our existing law in regard to domestic offences, but they have to be restated here in a rather complicated way to deal with all the consequences arising out of the creation of extra-territorial offences.  We have to make it an offence to conspire within the State to commit an offence outside the State and <i>vice versa</i> and to aid and abet inside the the commission of an offence outside the State and <i>vice versa.</i>  It becomes a bit complicated by reason of the introduction of the principle of extra-territorality and one has to be careful in the drafting not to lead to anomalous situations.  The drafting has been carefully done and does appear rather formidable but, when read carefully and in the light of what I am saying, it merely provides for the extra-territorial offences the legal consequences which already exist for domestic offences.  Therefore Deputy Haughey's apprehensions are not well founded.</P>
    <P>With regard to double jeopardy, Deputy Haughey used these words in a non-technical way.  Double jeopardy is covered in section 15.  All it does is ensure that a person will not be tried twice for the same offence and that acquittal or conviction in Northern Ireland will entitle a person to plead that acquittal or conviction should he be tried here.  Technically speaking that is what double jeopardy is and it is provided for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey raised the situation where a person would be sought here on an extradition warrant and in order to claim political exemption he would find himself admitting the offence.  The whole point of this Bill is to avoid having to seek extradition for the offences set out in the Schedule on the grounds that up to now <Col N="570" /> extradition for those offences has been unsuccessful because people have pleaded political motivation, thereby escaping the consequences of their alleged crimes.  What will happen in the future is that extradition will be put on one side with regard to offences of the kind set out in the Schedule. The accused will be charged before our courts with an extra-territorial offence subject to his right under section 14 to opt to go for trial in Northern Ireland.  There is a similar provision in the corresponding British measure.  Extradition applications as we know them leading to the political plea or statement that &ldquo;I did it, but I did it for such-and-such a reason&rdquo; will no longer be made.  Consequently no one will be put in the position of avoiding extradition because his extradition will not henceforth be sought. People will be prosecuted under this Bill for the extra-territorial offence. At the same time, if a person wants to go north he has the option under section 14 to do so.  There would be no question of double jeopardy in that non-technical sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey was worried about the preliminary hearing and the books of evidence, that somehow an element of bad faith would come in and that unscrupulous people might cook the case&mdash;I am using his words&mdash;against an accused person.  At the moment the preliminary hearing with regard to offences scheduled to go before the Special Criminal Court has been dispensed with and the ordinary preliminary investigation does not normally take place with regard to offences there.  It has not been suggested that there has been any lessening of the rights of an accused person. Indeed, since the introduction of documentation at that stage, the preliminary hearing now is merely a formality in which the justice indicates that on the documents he has read he has decided if there is a <i>prima facie</i> case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey was worried that there could be concocted books of evidence, particularly when they would be coming from another jurisdiction.  He asked what safeguards there were against that.  There are a number of safeguards.  First, the books of evidence, when presented to the police here who will be the arresting authority and the authority presenting the case, will have to be credible on their face.  That will be a basic requirement.  They will have to satisfy the police here that they disclose a substantial charge.  They will then have to go for examination by the law officers of the State, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General, as the case may be.  Those experienced professional men will examine the evidence on which the charge is to be sustained and they will decide if it shows a sustainable case. That evidence then has to come into court and it has to stand up to cross-examination and security by the court in the same way as any evidence.  That is the protection against concocted evidence, coming from abroad or even domestically, in either civil or criminal cases.  It has not been unknown for false evidence to be given to sustain civil actions here.  The protection against concocted evidence is the right to cross-examine and to scrutinise evidence carefully and closely and the ability of the court to assess the evidence. If a case is false or wrong it will not stand up.  I submit that this is an extreme type of argument to put forward.  I am satisfied that the ordinary protection against such a scenario is available in our system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey was worried about the situation of a person from Northern Ireland who finds himself on a charge here and who comes South, that there might in some way be a <Col N="572" /> presumption of guilt in advance of his trial.  I must reject this because whatever I might feel or a layman might feel about a person who had to come South and who was on a serious terrorist charge our feelings do not matter.  What matters are the feelings of the court and I have sufficient confidence in the independence of our judiciary to know they would not undertake the hearing of such a case with any preliminary or prior feelings about the guilt or innocence of a person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as any person coming before our courts is concerned, such a person would be coming with an absolute presumption of innocence.  There would be no question of any presumption or taint of guilt.  Many lay people here feel that if any citizen is arrested for a normal crime down here&mdash;I am now using a rather inadequate adjective&mdash;there must be something in it because otherwise the Garda would not have moved. That kind of sentiment may be expressed by lay people but it does not affect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He could be charged before a jury.  I am satisfied that a jury would be in exactly the same position with regard to such a defendant as they would be towards any other defendant.  A jury would have to be warned by the court to put out of their minds all matters other than the evidence before them. If the Deputy says that is a risk before a jury, it can equally be said that every jury trial has within it this inherent risk that there may be a layman's bias in advance.  This is where the trial judge in his charge intervenes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the person has come down here and that would not apply in an ordinary jury trial.  The fact that such a person came here might give rise to a presumption of guilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might or it might not.  If we were at the stage where these extra-territorial offences were being charged before an ordinary jury court we would have reached the situation where the Special Court was dis-established and all the evidence had been taken down here. At that stage it would be irrelevant where the defendent was or where the offence was committed from the point of view of making presumption. We must talk here of the reality, namely, of cases going before the Special Criminal Court.  I am satisfied that a defendant from Northern Ireland would not in any way be prejudiced by any preconceived notion as to his guilt.  Our courts would have a completely open mind on the matter.</P>
      <P>I note the argument of Deputy Haughey that I seem to be perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not unconsciously, but that I seem to display a prejudice towards the people who would be sought under this measure and that I would be guilty of a layman's bias.  I do not accept that. I am very conscious, because of my professional training, of the traditional law of the land that every accused person is innocent until proved guilty.  The reality of the situation here is that the most horrible terrorist offences are being committed.  People who flee, having committed such savage terrorists.  That offences, are savage terrorists.  That is the long and the short of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person who is arrested under this Bill cannot be called a savage terrorist but he is a person accused of a savage terrorist act.  Nevertheless, the person who committed the act is a savage terrorist and the person accused under this Bill is, of course, an alleged savage terrorist <Col N="574" /> or a person accused of a savage terrorist crime.  I make that distinction and I reject any suggestion that I am prejudiced against people who might be caught by this Bill.  They will be in exactly the same position as any other citizen against whom a breach of the law is alleged.  As far as I am concerned any person arrested under this Bill is innocent until proved guilty.</P>
    <P>Those are the points raised by Deputy Haughey with regard to section 2.  He raised the point with regard to section 3 that somehow it offends our sense of fair play that we should bring into this the offence of escaping from custody in Northern Ireland.  It would be unreal to have extra-territorial offences if we did not also include the act of escaping from lawful custody following conviction for one of those very acts because it would set the whole machinery back to square one&mdash;in other words, a person who was to be convicted here for an extra-territorial act and then went to Northern Ireland could not be arrested there and tried for escape from custody down here.  The haven would be up there and <i>vice versa.</i>  With regard to the person who is convicted in Northern Ireland and imprisoned for an act of terrorism, it would be no advance if we were to say that escape from custody was not to be an offence.  Of course, escaping from custody has to be made an offence, otherwise the whole criminal law becomes pointless.  Likewise, assisting, inciting or procuring an escape must be made an offence for the same reason.  I believe Deputy Haughey allowed his emotions to interfere with his reason when he made the argument that somehow it is not fair play.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite aware, or he would not be pushing this Bill through the House, of the extraordinary situation in Northern Ireland.  That situation gives rise to some of the doubts Deputy Haughey put forward.  The question of the presumption of guilt has nothing to do with the presumption of guilt on the part of the Minister or the law enforcement agency here.  It is on the possible assumption of guilt in the Northern area where the doubts seem to arise because the very nature of the division of society in the Northern area can lead to all sorts of situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that there have been many occurrences where people have been murdered simply because they married persons of a different religion.  I am trying to show what sort of possible situations can arise where evidence of a prejudicial nature can be presented against people which may not have any validity at all.  Would the Minister enlighten us further on how the book of evidence can be evaluated?  I take it that in the ordinary course of events when the Garda are putting together the book of evidence they are in touch with the people providing the evidence, whether they are gardaí or witnesses within the jurisdiction under our control.  Reasonable doubt could arise where evidence would have been collected in another jurisdiction and would be sent here to the Attorney General who would then have to evaluate it and possibly submit it to the Garda for their advice or assessment.  How far can that evidence be evaluated?  Would the Garda be in a position to put any queries <Col N="576" /> with regard to evidence provided in the book of evidence which originates from the other area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There might be a query to be put, there might be a gap or inconsistency in the evidence, and it would be quite normal for the law officer to say that that gap should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister understands the difficulty.  I believe there was a case where the Northern police, following a very horrible occurrence, said they wanted to interview an individual from the Six Counties' area whom they believed was here.  At that stage, because the authorities in the Northern area knew the person was not at home and had left the Northern jurisdiction, they seemed to imply that that person was involved in some particular incident across the Border.  As far as I remember the person offered to provide witnesses saying that he was in his home or wherever he was at that time.  There can be prejudice and the degree of prejudice can rise or fall with the level of the incident.  It creates doubt in the minds of many of us regarding the validity of evidence which may be presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing here the question of prejudice or suspicion. We are discussing the trial of people alleged to have committed one of the terrorist offences in Northern Ireland.  Two points have been raised by the Opposition with regard to that.  One of them is the fact that such a person living here and arrested here would be seen by people down here as having the finger of guilt pointing at him in advance in a way that would not happen to a person normally resident down here.  That may well be a layman's opinion, but that is not what is relevant.  What is relevant is the opinion of a judge.  I am satisfied our judiciary will approach every case coming before them with completely open minds, irrespective of the antecedents of the defendant coming before them, that is with regard to this presumption of guilt, as Deputy Haughey phrased it. <Col N="577" /> I am satisfied there will be no such thing where it counts&mdash;in the court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the Special Criminal Court is there, these cases will go before it.  I cannot conceive of a situation where they will go before the ordinary courts because in the ordinary courts there is no provision for evidence on commission.  In effect, the limiting of the evidence on commission to special court procedures means that these cases will have to go before the Special Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputy Brugha about the evaluation of the evidence coming from the North, let me say firstly, that I am prepared to accept as much <i>bona fides</i> as <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the Northern authorities in submitting books of evidence to the authorities here.  I am prepared to have a completely open mind on that.  The argument has been made that there is a great danger that false evidence will be concocted and insinuated into a case against the fugitive.  I do not think that is a good basis on which to start the argument. I accept there will be <i>bona fides</i> in the working of this mutual arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume there is a knave somewhere behind the scenes and he introduces false or concocted evidence. The evaluation of that evidence is not what is done by the Garda, although that would be a preliminary screening because they will read it with a policeman's eye and a policeman's nose for consistency and general veracity.  It then has to be scrutinised by the Attorney General and his staff who again have experience in reading books of evidence and witnesses' statements. <Col N="578" /> If either of these bodies see anything inconsistent, they will be entitled to have it clarified, a gap closed or an inconsistency explained, in the same way they would do with regard to a book of evidence which originated with the Garda.  It is their job to view this book of evidence in the light of the court proceedings and apply their experience to ensuring that the case being made can be sustained on the evidence to be presented.  There would be evaluation by the Garda and by the law officers of the State. These are preliminary evaluations.  But the real evaluation is that which will be carried out by the court at the trial. That is the real protection against concocted or false evidence being inserted into books of evidence.</P>
    <P>There is no other way of preventing such a thing if a person is of a mind to do it, except by providing screening and evaluating processes.  In a civil action between two citizens in this jurisdiction, if one is sufficiently evil to put forward false evidence, there is no way he can be stopped except by having the system of cross-examination and security to ensure that the false evidence will be exposed and his case thereby destroyed.  That is our system.  We cannot put it any further than that.</P>
    <P>I submit that it is wrong to start from the premise that this will be a real live danger to be guarded against. That is unfair.  The proper thing is to assume <i>bona fides</i> and we have our system to check it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to agree with the Minister when he says we should assume <i>bona fides</i> on the part of the security authorities at present in Northern Ireland.  Is the Minister not aware, as is everyone else, that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has, within the past 12 months, paid out well in excess of £400,000 in compensation to persons who were in the custody of the security forces of Northern Ireland and who were brutally, savagely, systematically and illegally beaten and tortured?</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked me if I was aware that compensation was paid.  I am and I made this point this morning.  I said that compensation was paid in respect of many acts of unlawful detention and illtreatment during detention.  Compensation was paid following actions taken by the citizens concerned in the courts of the United Kingdom against the Government of the United Kingdom.  In some cases, decrees were awarded and in some cases settlements were effected.  These were in respect of illegal acts carried out against persons in custody in 1971 when the complaint was made by this country to the European Court.  We are talking about what happened five years ago.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be aware that many, if not most, of the people who carried out this torture and brutality are still members of the security forces in Northern Ireland.  In my view it is a bit much for the purposes of these two sections&mdash;I am not talking about the amendments which were discussed this morning&mdash;to assume that there must <Col N="580" /> be <i>bona fides</i> on the part of the security forces of Northern Ireland which are not confined merely to a police force.

      <P>There is no point debating a section we have not yet reached.  This point was dealt with on Second Stage and will be dealt with subsequently on section 11.  It is ludicrous for the Minister to attempt to suggest that where evidence is being taken on commission in Northern Ireland under section 11 that all the safeguards of our system will operate. Our judges will be there simply as observers.</P>

      <P>They have no control over the proceedings or the taking of evidence in Northern Ireland. In particular they have no control, in the last resort, over the security forces who will be giving evidence.  The fact that these things have been said before, and will have to be said again, does not invalidate them.  They are perfectly true.  They make nonsense of the Minister's argument.  He blithely seems to accept that no wrong can come from the security forces in Northern Ireland.  We certainly do not agree with that, and I think very few people in this country would agree with it.</P>

      <P>It is no answer to say that the safeguards of our trial system will ensure that any such evidence will be flushed out.  Our courts are not in a position to flush it out, because it is a commissioner in Northern Ireland who will be taking the evidence, and not our judges.</P>
      <P>I want to go back to what the Minister said earlier.  He made two assertions of law which, to my mind, he takes for granted to a great extent. He says they are the law and cites nothing in support of them.  One is the statement by the Minister that extra-territorial legislation can apply to people who are not subjects of this State.  I referred him to Mr. Justice McMahon's decision and he quoted from it.  Mr. Justice McMahon used the phrase, &ldquo;those who are subjects of the State&rdquo;.  The Minister seeks to justify his attitude, in spite of that statement by Mr. Justice McMahon, by saying that the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, applied to those who were resident in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a narrow point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice McMahon did not refer to those who are resident in the State when he was talking about the general power of the Oireachtas to enact extra-terroritorial legislation.  He referred to those who are subjects of the State. Why should he do that if he meant something else, as the Minister suggests?  Why did he not say something else if the Minister's suggestion is correct?  Why should Mr. Justice McMahon say, &ldquo;those who are subjects of the State&rdquo; if he meant something else?  A man such as he is not given to saying one thing and meaning another.  He means what he says.  The Minister can come in here and make all the assertions he likes but he still cannot get over the fact that the most recent judgment on this point in this country by the High Court says something different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  The Deputy must have misinterpreted or misread the judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to the fact that, under article 3, law expressed to operate extra-territorially can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern Ireland.  What the judge said is that extra-territorial laws can bind those who are subjects of the State and that is a correct statement of the law.  So it can.  I also went on to say that extra-territorial laws can also bind people who are not subjects of the State.  Judge McMahon did not fall to consider that aspect of it because it did not arise under the issue he was deciding.  It was a narrow net point he was deciding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so because the Act under which he was deciding the case referred not to subjects but to residents.  If what the Minister suggests is correct, the judge would have referred to residents of the State and not taken it on himself to introduce the words &ldquo;subjects of the State&rdquo;.  I cannot put the matter any further than that.  The Minister simply refuses to accept that words have their normal meaning and he puts his own meaning on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only leave it at that.  When he spoke first on this section, the Minister sought to give the impression to non-lawyers in particular that extra-territorial legislation was a frequent occurrence and nothing unusual, that it was in no sense unique and that there were ample precedents for it.  At the time, Deputy Haughey quoted the Law Commission Report in which the question of widespread extra-territorial legislation was described as unprecedented in common law countries.  I believe that is a correct statement of the situation.  It <Col N="583" /> is unprecedented in common law countries.  Therefore, the proposal in this Bill and in particular in section 2 is unprecedented in this or any other common law country.  The Minister should stick to the facts and not seek to lead the public at large to believe there are precedents for what is proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numerous precedents for taking extra-territorial power.  The principle is well established. It becomes a matter of detail whether we should take it for one offence or 20 offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If my recollection serves me rightly, there are three such instances in our law, and three only. Three were referred to by the Minister. I have no doubt that, if there were more than three, he would be very happy to refer to more than three.  They are for single, specific, specialised crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make the point that, in trying to convey the <Col N="584" /> impression that this is nothing unusual or nothing new, the Minister is misleading the House and the public. Apart from what the Law Commission said, his own explanatory memorandum to the Bill makes the very point which the Law Commission made at the end of page 1 where it is stated:</P>
      <P>The subsection provides expressly that the person who does the act &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;. This is because of the general rule by which, with a very few exceptions, things done outside the State that would be criminal if done in the State are not merely outside the jurisdiction of its courts but are not offences at all against its law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few exceptions. Because there have not been many instances of it, that does not make it wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be clearly understood that this is not, as the Minister seeks to make people believe, just a further extension of a well-established principle.  This is something which, in the words of the Law Commission Report, is unprecedented in common law countries.  In the words of his own explanatory memorandum there are very few exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not using the words &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; in a critical way.  They were using it in a factual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the fact that the creation of offences in this section is unprecedented in common law countries, subsections (4) to (8) of this section create a new type of offence in our law which is of some significance.  On page 2 the explanatory memorandum points out that in this country at the moment there is no offence of being an accessory after the fact to a misdemeanour.  Now it is proposed to create the offence of accessory after the fact to a misdemeanour.</P>

The lowest any farm worker is paid now is £34 a week and there is no way in which the money for this relief could be increased to such a level that would encourage farmers to employ farm workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have informed Mayo County Council that the unit cost per house of the tender received by them for the Kiltimagh housing scheme is acceptable.  The allocation of money to finance the scheme will be considered when the council reply to my Department's circular letter of 9th January, 1976, requesting details of capital requirements for new housing work in 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me, first, when he notified the council of the decision; secondly, is he aware that existing commitments for houses under construction in Mayo will eat up an allocation somewhat similar to what was given to us last year and that unless an increased allocation is given it will not be possible for this housing scheme to go ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few things that I have to tell Deputy Calleary. First of all, within the last few days notification has been sent out. Secondly, Deputy Calleary, apparently, is not aware that the Leader of his party, Deputy Lynch, in the debate before the Christmas Recess, said <Col N="590" /> there were too many local authority houses being built.  Possibly he had the ones in Kiltimagh in mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not out of context. He said there were too many local authority houses being built.  In 1972-73 Mayo County Council got £180,570 for local authority houses; in 1973-74, £228,000; for the nine months of 1974, £280,750 and Deputy Calleary is complaining because in 1975 they got £493,000 for local authority houses, a council that had not been building local authority houses for a number of years.  I think he has got more than his share and if he gets as much this year he should be very happy.</P>

      <P>Could I have this clear? Does Deputy MacSharry object to money which is borrowed being used for housing in Sligo, because he made a statement in this House yesterday that people were not taking up SDA loans in Sligo.  In fact, they took up £400,000 last year and asked for £100,000 more.  They are looking for an extra £100,000 this year and Sligo is one county where they are more than spending what they are getting. So, Deputy MacSharry should get his facts before interrupting here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose taking questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply given by me in the House on 2nd December, 1975, to a question by Deputy John O'Leary regarding applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund in 1976, Official Report Vol. 286 cols. 522-528, in which I indicated that the regional fund was not being administered on a regional or county basis.  The entire national territory is treated as a single qualifying region for fund purposes.  Applications for fund assistance in respect of projects costing less than £4.17 million are, in accordance with Article 7 of the fund regulation, submitted on a grouped basis for the country as a unit and the Commission determines a single aggregate aid figure for the region.  In these circumstances, it is not possible to specify the amount of fund aid approved in respect of individual projects.</P>
      <P>The following are the projects from the counties in question, Dublin and Wexford, which were included in the decisions taken by the Commission on projects put forward by the Government during 1975:</P>
      <P>County Wexford:</P>
      <P>Bellefield drainage scheme, Enniscorthy, industrial infrastructure; IDA land acquisition in County Wexford, industrial infrastructure.</P>
      <P>County Dublin:</P>
      <P>Warner Lambert (Irl.) Ltd., Dún Laoghaire, industrial investment.</P>

Normally customs examination of properly completed entries is finished within 24 hours of their submission by the importers.  In addition, there are special arrangements which, if properly availed of by importers, would ensure speedier clearance. Details of these arrangements are set out in Notice No. 1369 which is available from any Collector of Customs and Excise or from the Revenue Commissioners, Dublin Castle.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>To facilitate the flow of traffic through customs posts at the Border the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="601" /> have introduced special clearance procedures whereby many classes of goods may be cleared before processing of the documents.  Further to facilitate the flow of traffic on the Dundalk-Newry road the clearance of most export consignments has been transferred from Dundalk road station to Carrickcarnan frontier post where extra office accommodation and extra staff have been provided.</P>
      <P>I am aware that proposals emanating from commercial and industrial interests were afoot in the recent past which could lead to the setting up of transit depots removed from the points of importation for the customs clearance of certain container traffic.  The late Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Kenny, replied to a question relating to this matter on 6th June, 1974&mdash; see Official Report, Volume 273, No. 5, columns 730/731.

      <P>Deputy Lemass is right.  There have been strong demands from carrying companies for improvements but certain obstacles were run into.  The Association of Shipping have been told they should contact the trade unions concerned in order to initiate discussions on the labour problems in connection with these depots.  Unhappily these problems have not been resolved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principle governing transactions of the type referred to by the Deputy is that, while they are recorded in the external <Col N="602" /> trade statistics at the time of transfer to storage abroad, they are not credited in the annual balance of payments statement until a sale has been effected.  Where goods are transferred to storage abroad in one year and not sold until a subsequent year, there is an offsetting debit entry in the balance of payments statement in the first year and a credit adjustment in the subsequent year.  In addition, of course, any payments abroad in respect of transport and storage would be debited in the balance of payments in the year in which they arise.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to Bord Bainne transferring a certain amount of dairy produce to England last October.  I have no information on this.

When the Central Statistics Office are preparing the 1975 balance of payments figures they will make such inquiries as they consider necessary to determine how the transactions should be dealt with.  A preliminary balance of payments statement for 1975 should be available in April next and the detailed statement should be published around the end of the year.</P>

The latest date for which full information is available is mid-April, 1974, when numbers in industrial employment were 21,000 higher than at mid-April, 1968.  Such provisional information as is available for mid-April, 1975, suggests that, while there was a decline from a year earlier, total industrial employment was still higher than at mid-April, 1968.  In transportable goods industries, which form the major part of total industry, the preliminary figure for employment in the third quarter of 1975, the most recent date for which information is available, was 199,800 compared with 196,100 in the corresponding period of 1968.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, he has advised all State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of his Department to support the campaign; and if he will indicate the amount of foreign purchases of manufactured goods, on contract or otherwise by his Department and by the State-sponsored bodies in the past 12 months, excluding goods which are not manufactured in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am generally satisfied that the State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department are observing a policy of buying Irish goods where possible and in these circumstances there is no need for any general instruction to State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department to support the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. The purchase of goods by State-sponsored bodies is, of course, part of the day-to-day administration of the bodies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the Department of Finance nor any of the offices for which I have responsibility have made any foreign purchases, in the past 12 months other than goods which are not manufactured in Ireland with the exception of the Stationery Office which purchased goods of a total value of £3,382,629 <Col N="606" /> of which £16,406 were from Northern Ireland and £14,074 were from abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 25, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The first occasion on which the matter of the supply of office furniture to Irish Life came to my notice was on 20th October, 1975, when representations were made by Deputy Pat Joe Reynolds to me on behalf of a County Leitrim firm of office and contract furniture manufacturers.</P>
      <P>On receipt of these representations extensive verbal inquiries were made by my Department of Irish Life, the IDA and Fóir Teo.  My Department were informed that consultants had been engaged, that there were technical problems but that the matter was by no means settled.  The company were made aware of my anxiety that everything possible should be done to place the contract in this country.  The company's spokesman intimated that they were anxious to buy Irish and said the consultants had discussed the matter at length with the Industrial Development Authority.  The company were asked to keep me informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 17th and 20th November representations were made by the Minister for Labour and the general secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union.  A letter was sent by my Department to the company on 21st November and further verbal representations were made.  The company's reply, received on 2nd December, said the matter was still under consideration and no order had been <Col N="609" /> placed.  In supplementary discussions my Department again stressed the importance of buying Irish and inquired if appropriate bodies, such as the IIRS, had been consulted with a view to enabling Irish firms to overcome technical or other difficulties.  The company's spokesman gave an assurance that such steps had been taken and said that the placing of the contract was receiving very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>On 11th December, in view of the gravity of the situation and notwithstanding the company's reply of 2nd December, another letter was sent on my instructions by the secretary of the Department of Finance to the managing director pointing out that there seemed to be widespread concern that the business might be placed abroad and asking that I be kept informed of developments.  On 18th December the Department received a letter, bearing the date 15th December, from the company.  Verbal inquiries by my Department on my instructions elicited the information that, although the letter contained the statement &ldquo;we are in favour of accepting the recommendation of our consultants...&rdquo;, the contract had been placed irrevocably on the same date, namely 18th December, as the Irish Life letter had been received in my Department.</P>
    <P>On 5th January the company were informed by my Department of the Government's intense disappointment that they had failed to make the necessary modifications in standards and arrangements with Irish manufacturers to ensure the manufacture of the furniture in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senior officers of my Department and I have on a number of occasions since had discussions with the chairman, managing director and property investment manager of the company. I have been furnished with copies of documentation relevant to the issue, which I have placed before the Government.  Government inquiries into the matter are still proceeding.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the company themselves, as the House will be aware, announced on 26th January that they were investigating urgently the feasibility of having the furniture in question manufactured in this <Col N="610" /> country under licence.  Discussions have taken place between the company and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and a meeting has also been held with the Confederation of Irish Industry.</P>
    <P>The contract does not concern carpets, which are referred to in two of the questions.  I understand that it is the company's intention that these items should be purchased from Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>As regards value-added tax, I wish to point out that imported furniture is liable at the same rate as furniture manufactured in the State.</P>
    <P>At all times the best interests of Irish workers and industry, the company and their policyholders have been and will remain my primary concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad, Sir, you gave me this opportunity to correct the misrepresentation made here today and yesterday by the Minister for Local Government of what I was alleged to have said in relation to housing in the course of the adjournment debate before the Christmas recess.  Yesterday I was told that the Minister for Local Government, in the course of replying to supplementary questions in connection with housing, said that I said in the course of that debate that there were too many local authority houses being built.  That was reported to me but I took no action in the belief that a misrepresentation was made in the course of exchanges in the cut and thrust across the House.  Today I was listening in my room on the monitor and I heard the Minister for Local Government, again in reply to supplementary questions, say that I had stated in the course of the adjournment debate before Christmas that there were too many local authority houses being built.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by Members from this side that the statement was taken by the Minister out of its context.  The Minister replied&mdash;I quote him exactly as I heard it&mdash;that &ldquo;Deputy Lynch said there were too many local authority houses being built, full stop.&rdquo; Those were his exact words.  I want, with your permission, to quote in its full context what I said on that occasion. I quote from the Official Report of the 17th December, 1975, column 1788.  I said as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We undertook in our housing programme, published in the late 'sixties and early 'seventies, that by <Col N="618" /> 1972-73 we would have reached 25,000 houses output, which was reached.  There was no necessity whatever for a crash programme as the Minister for Local Government announced.  What has gone wrong is that there are too many local authority houses being built as against houses owned by the people which is what most Irish people aspire to.  Local authorities are becoming, and have been for many years, the biggest landlords in the country.</P>
    <P>That is not a very desirable trend, especially when there is the ideal of self-sufficiency and independence so strong in the Irish character.  That ideal is being depressed by this Government having failed to provide adequate grants for young people seeking houses for the first time.  They&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>are inevitably driven back to the local authorities, even against their will in many cases, to give them reasonable shelter in their early married years.  It is a wrong trend, it should be discouraged and it is one that this Government are deliberately responsible for by their failure to increase to a realistic level grants for house building and loans available from local authorities for a similar purpose.</P>
    <P>That indicates that the Minister's statement misrepresented what I said. The Minister is the most sensitive Member of this House when his escutcheon is in any way assailed.  I hope now he will have the good grace to withdraw that misrepresentation and apologise for it.</P>

      <P>May I say that when I said &ldquo;full stop&rdquo; if Deputy Lynch considers that I meant that was the end of his sentence, then I am sorry. What Deputy Lynch said and what I read out of it was: &ldquo;What has gone wrong is that there are too many local authority houses being built as against houses owned by the people which is what most Irish people aspire to.&rdquo;  Local authority houses can now be owned by their tenants. I did not cast any aspersion on <Col N="619" /> Deputy Lynch.  I am saying Deputy Lynch said that.  It is on the record of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Facts, however unpalatable, must be faced.  We have passed through the second year of the worst economic depression the western world has witnessed for almost 50 years.  It is necessary for me to stress this at the outset, for several reasons.  First, Ireland has had to contend with a situation not of her own making: as a small, export-dependent economy, we were very badly hit by the effects of the world-wide slump in economic activity. Indeed, because of our small size and vulnerability, we have, perhaps, suffered in some ways more than many other countries.  Second, while the Government's economic policy has consistently been to try to safeguard employment and living standards at the expense, if necessary, of considerable budgetary deficits, there are limits to such a policy; in the last resort we are dependent on an increase in world trade of which there has as yet been only the first hopeful signs.  Third, when the long-awaited economic recovery does come, there can be no <Col N="620" /> assurance that it will restore the patterns of growth to which we have become accustomed since 1960.</P>
      <P>These severe limitations on the Government's freedom of action mean that the highest priority has to be given to tackling the one economic problem that is, to some extent at least, within our own power to control&mdash;namely, inflation.  The first steps in this direction were taken in my June, 1975, budget by a series of measures designed to halt price rises and break inflationary expectations.  At the time, these were pushing income demands to levels which were already threatening our international competitiveness and putting our economic future in jeopardy.  While the full fruits of these measures have yet to be seen in the pay pause for 1976 called for by An Taoiseach, the initial response required by the Government&mdash;a modification of the current national pay agreement&mdash;was forthcoming.  I am, however, bound to say that inflation remains the greatest single obstacle to our economic health and prosperity and that its main contributing factor of domestic origin is excessive income increases.  I will return to this point later, but it is essential to state it at the outset, since it permeates every aspect of our economic performance.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The economy in 1975</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget&mdash;more, perhaps, than any other in recent years&mdash;must be seen in its economic and financial context.  Its shape and aims, the particular means of implementation chosen and the limits of their effectiveness are all set by the economic climate and availability of resources, present and prospective.  It is normal, in budget speeches, to review the recent development of the economy and its prospect at some length.  On this occasion, I shall be much briefer; not because it is unimportant&mdash;on the contrary, as I have said, it is more important than ever&mdash;but because the ground has been covered in some detail in the new publication &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo;, which I issued earlier this week so that everybody would have an opportunity of studying and understanding <Col N="621" /> beforehand the background to the budget.</P>
    <P>Last year was a disappointing one for the Irish economy, but this must be judged by reference to the performance of other countries&mdash; especially of our partners in the European Community.  The fall in the volume of our output was about the same as for the Community as a whole.  Unemployment was regrettably high, though the increase during the year was not, in fact, as fast as that of the majority of our fellow members.  While our price rise was, unfortunately, one of the worst, it began to slacken in the second half of the year.  Largely because of the low level of economic activity, combined with exceptionally buoyant agricultural exports, the balance of payments deficit fell to £30 million compared with £300 million in 1974.  In the last few months of the year, there were signs, from indicators such as imports, output data, retail sales and bank lending, that the recession has flattened out.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic Prospects for 1976</i>
    </P>
    <P>The world economic situation is expected to improve in 1976, but recovery seems unlikely to be dramatic. The internationally-held view is that there will be only moderate improvement, strongest in the United States and Japan but significantly weaker in Europe.  In the United Kingdom, still our most important export market, demand is unlikely to recover until the second half of the year at the earliest.</P>
    <P>A revival of world trade may not, therefore, be immediately of great benefit to us and our export prospects for the coming year are no more than moderately encouraging.  This makes it crucial that we should improve our international competitiveness by getting our own inflation rapidly under control.  Even if we do, it is clear that the prospects for growth in Ireland's economy in 1976 are limited, particularly in the first half of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic Strategy, 1976</i>
    </P>
    <P>Against this external background and the constraints of our deep-rooted domestic problems, it would be unrealistic to pretend that we can <Col N="622" /> quickly return to the comparatively high rates of growth to which we have become accustomed.  Our aim for 1976 must be to give top priority to tackling the basic problems which beset our economy, so that we can derive maximum benefit from the more generalised upturn in world economic activity likely in the latter part of 1976 and especially in 1977.</P>
    <P>Economic policy for 1976, if it is to be soundly based, must meet three vital requirements.  First, it must reduce our excessive rate of price inflation. Second, it must, within the taxation and borrowing resources available and the limited opportunities for growth, give a high priority to safeguarding employment. It must, finally, limit the growth of public expenditure, the expansion of which has been such a feature of recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inflation</i>
    </P>
    <P>A Minister for Finance, in talking of inflation, shares with a cleric preaching against sin the risk of wearying his audience.  The boredom of an audience notwithstanding, fundamental truths remain.  It is essential constantly to remind ourselves of the basic facts of our economic situation: we are utterly dependent on exports for future growth and jobs, we cannot export if we price ourselves out of our markets, we will do so if we inflate faster than our trading partners, our inflation is still much above the EEC average and the main cause of our own inflationary trend is excessive income increases.  That is the position in a nutshell and it should not, by now, be necessary to explain further why a pay pause after the current national agreement is not merely desirable; it is essential to our economic future.</P>
    <P>Several consequences flow from this.  The first is that, while this budget forms a necessary part of the nation's economic policy for 1976, it is only a part and, perhaps, not even the immediately important part.  The first priority is to settle the behaviour of incomes for 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last month the Government laid the seriousness of the national position <Col N="623" /> before the country when An Taoiseach addressed the nation on television and radio and through the Press.  On the same day An Taoiseach and Government Ministers met the social partners and told them that to maintain employment, those who have jobs should not press for any further pay rise at least until the end of 1976, apart from the payment of standard increases remaining as commitments under the present pay agreement. A similar restraint would be required of those with incomes from other sources.  While the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been unable to recommend the Government's proposals to their affiliated trade unions, the Government expect that, nevertheless, congress's recognition of the national economic difficulties and the Government's request will ensure the measure of restraint sought.  My budget is based on this expectation, both in the view I have taken of economic developments this year and in the forecasts of public expenditure and revenue.  In our circumstances, there is no alternative to a pay pause.</P>
    <P>The Government have, moreover, accepted a report from the Labour Court indicating that the obligation to achieve equal pay by the end of 1975 could result in a significant loss of jobs.  The Government have, therefore, decided that the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, should be amended to allow industries to defer equal pay if it should lead to loss of jobs.  Sex discrimination in public service pay rates is being eliminated with effect from the 31st December, 1975, at a cost of £2.5 million in 1976.  This action completely fulfils our EEC obligations and fully conforms with the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.  The Government very much regret that, at a time of unparalleled stringency, it is clearly not possible to provide in addition for the final removal of marriage differentiation. Steady progress has been made in this direction in recent years and up to 60 per cent of the gap has already been closed.  I am ready to enter into discussions with staff interests about the ultimate elimination <Col N="624" /> of this gap on a phased basis.  I would stress that the Government remain firmly committed to the principle of equal pay and are determined to give effect to it in the public service at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The Government are also preparing legislation to restrain non-pay incomes. These include dividends, directors' fees and rents.  It is not intended to undermine in any way the capacity of business to invest and expand, or to squeeze its ability to earn&mdash;we depend too much on profitable business for that.  Non-pay incomes will be required merely to carry their share of the burden of income restraint.  The legislation will be of limited duration and is intended to ensure equity among all income receivers at this difficult time.  While the legislation will shortly be introduced, it will, if passed, remain inoperative on the Statute Book until developments on pay are clearer.</P>
    <P>The second consequence of what I may call the economic facts of life is that income restraint, in one form or another, will have to continue for a long time to come.  It has been fashionable to regard income increases as in some way &ldquo;distributing the fruits of growth&rdquo;.  On that view, it would be logical, when we have had an actual fall in GNP over the past two years of about 3 per cent, that incomes should have fallen in real terms by a corresponding amount.  Instead, over the last two years, nominal increases in employee incomes of over 40 per cent have been typical.  The consequence of that is equally clear: for the rest of this decade, there is no scope, without the risk of recreating inflation on a most damaging scale, for income increases on the scale we have suddenly experienced over the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>We have, so far, escaped the full and dangerous consequences for our competitive position of our rocketing money incomes only because the rise in costs here has been paralleled in our main export market in Britain and because the accompanying slide in the value of sterling has cushioned our trade elsewhere.  The British Government are, however, making a <Col N="625" /> determined assault on the excessive growth of income and hope to cut the rate of inflation to single figures by the end of the year.  We must set ourselves a target no less ambitious if we are to secure our future prosperity.</P>
    <P>The Government have already charted the way forward.  The formula suggested&mdash;a moratorium on pay increases after the termination of the current national agreement until at least the end of 1976&mdash;would help to safeguard our competitiveness both on home and foreign markets; it should, at any rate, match the effort being made by our British competitors.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax-free price index</i>
    </P>
    <P>Too often in the past, wage settlements have been arrived at by reference to the consumer price index, as though the index were the distillation of all factors relevant to wage negotiation. It is, of course, nothing of the sort; it simply reflects movements in the prices of goods to consumers.  As such, it provides a general indicator of movements in the cost of living.  In so far, however, as prices are affected by changes in the level of indirect taxes, the index reflects these changes also.  I have repeatedly argued that inflationary wage settlements are inevitable as long as people insist on compensating themselves by wage increases for the effect of indirect taxes imposed to finance transfer payments or to meet the general needs of managing demand. I am, therefore, arranging to have a separate index published which would not reflect these tax changes&mdash;a taxfree price index.  This will allow people to distinguish between price rises to the consumer resulting from market forces and those arising from the necessity to raise taxes to meet the cost of services demanded by the community and for which the community must, accordingly, accept the necessity to pay without seeking compensation.  I should like to make it clear that, along with the new index, the consumer price index will continue to be published as before.</P>
    <P>PUBLIC EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>
      <i>General considerations</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length in my previous budget statements with the <Col N="626" /> disturbing rate of growth in public expenditure and it is hardly necessary to traverse this ground at length yet again. There are, however, several notable features of public expenditure which have become increasingly evident in recent years.</P>
    <P>The first, of course, is the accelerating rate of growth in the total, which in ten years has grown from 35 per cent of GNP to over 50 per cent.  Rather more disturbing is the fact that within this total, current expenditure has been rising faster than capital outlay&mdash;not the proper order of priorities, given our major needs for job-creation in the future.  The third feature is the sheer difficulty of curbing this rate of growth, let alone reducing it, without reducing either the scope or the standard of popularly demanded public services. But reduce it we must, for we must, after all, rely on the private sector as much as or possibly more than we do on the public sector for future growth and employment.  There is, moreover, a growing contrast between the demands of the public for services to be provided &ldquo;free&rdquo;, or at prices which do not cover their cost, and their obvious reluctance as taxpayers to pay for them.  Let it be bluntly said and honestly admitted: the Government cannot provide &ldquo;free&rdquo; services.  They have to be paid for by someone and that someone is the taxpayer, that noble patriot christened by the <i>Dublin Opinion</i> Seán Citizen.  His sister, Máire Citizen, also pays.  The taxpayer's reluctance shows itself in the demands for wage increases to compensate for the increased taxation necessary, in the tendency towards tax avoidance and evasion, and in the unwilingness of those at present outside the tax net to be brought within it, at least on the same terms as everyone else.  Indeed, in the difficulty of raising increased resources and in the ceiling of varying kinds that taxation seems to be approaching there are also compelling reasons for taking firm action on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effects of inflation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Inflation itself has, as I said in my budget speech of June last, been a major contributory factor to this problem: it has both inordinately raised <Col N="627" /> public outlays and at the same time constricted revenues, so that the gap between both has widened enormously over the past two years.  It has become fashionable with some economic commentators to point to the rapid growth in public expenditure as a primary cause of inflationary pressures in the economy.  But this is an over-simplified view of the situation and tends to blur the distinction between cause and effect.  The Government are fully conscious of the extent to which unrestrained spending policies can fan the flames of inflation, but it is unrealistic to ignore the extent to which the rapid rise in Government expenditure is a consequence, rather than a cause, of inflation.  The fact, however, that high spending policies were appropriate to the unique circumstances of the past two years is no justification for the continuation of such policies when circumstances change.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effects of recession</i>
    </P>
    <P>While a major effort has been made to moderate the growth of public expenditure, the impact of the recession has inhibited the Government from acting unduly harshly to curb otherwise undesirable trends.  The Government are satisfied that their past expenditure decisions were fully justified. It cannot be controverted that had restrictive policies been followed the recession would have been deeper and unemployment greater.  Public expenditure, resulting in unusually high current budget deficits which have to be met by borrowing, has had to make good, in part at least, the fall-off in private demand and investment. Public expenditure has, in present conditions, a major role to play in underpinning economic activity and the Government have made, and will continue to make, strenuous efforts to redirect expenditure into productive, employment-giving activities. When economic recovery returns, however, we will have to be extremely vigilant to ensure that Government expenditure does not preempt resources the private sector needs.  Recovery in the private sector will, in turn, permit firm control of public expenditure unhampered by <Col N="628" /> the present overriding need to maintain demand.  Indeed, it will be essential to do so: the present public sector deficit simply cannot be maintained indefinitely.  We have no option but to accept it at its present level because of the recession; but if such deficits are to have any rationale&mdash;or, indeed, any economic purpose&mdash;they must be reversible when the recession passes. Part of the present deficit is reversible since, as the economy recovers, revenue buoyancy will increase and certain items of expenditure directly related to the recession, particularly those arising from high unemployment, will be reduced.  In addition, a return to more normal rates of price and income increase will, relatively, lower the cost of public services.  Even allowing for these influences, however, it is obvious that there are other strong factors at work pushing up public expenditure which are not so easily reversed, whatever the state of the economy.  These forces, if not arrested, could lead very rapidly to the public finances running completely out of control.</P>
    <P>An illustration of the possibilities in this regard was given by An Taoiseach in his discussions with the social partners before Christmas.  He pointed out that, if all the demands made on the Government were to be met without additional taxation, it would be necessary to try to borrow almost £1,300 million.  As borrowing of this size is simply not possible or acceptable, and there are limits to the amount of additional taxation that can be levied, cuts in planned expenditure were necessary and have been made.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Main constituents</i>
    </P>
    <P>Capital and current expenditure combined almost doubled in the past three years&mdash;from £912 million in 1972-73 to £1,817 million in 1975. Current expenditure alone rose from £663 million in 1972-73 to £1,350 million last year.  Public services pay, expenditure on social welfare and service of the public debt account for nearly two-thirds of this figure.  The level of expenditure on these headings is largely determined in response to autonomous inflationary trends.</P>
    <P>The cost of debt service reflects not <Col N="629" /> only the additional borrowing undertaken by the State to finance a rapidly expanding public capital programme and the growing current deficit, but also the massive rise in interest rates over the past few years.</P>
    <P>Social welfare expenditure requires no apology.  For far too long, the less-well-to-do members of our community were forced to accept living standards which imposed real hardship because they were the least well-equipped among us to cope with the ravages of inflation.  The Government were determined to cure that situation.  We took effective action to ease the lot of those most in need and we will always be prepared to ensure that inflation does not erode the value of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>PAY</P>
    <P>
      <i>General considerations</i>
    </P>
    <P>The third major element in public expenditure is public service pay.  This term is used to cover the pay cost of the civil service, national and secondary teachers, the defence forces and Garda, together with the Exchequer contribution to the pay of nurses, doctors and other health board employees and vocational teachers.  It does not include the pay cost of the staffs of State-sponsored bodies, universities or voluntary hospitals, though a significant part of these pay costs are borne indirectly by the Exchequer through the grants paid to these bodies.  Public service pay is the largest single element in the total of current public expenditure. Nevertheless, I must emphasise that the growth in this figure from £200 million in 1972-73 to £449 million in 1975 chiefly arises because the Government as an employer and a party to national pay agreements are obliged to extend to their employees wage and salary increases negotiated or awarded under these agreements.  Those in the public sector cannot be expected to accept income increases smaller than those being granted generally in the private sector.  The fact is, however, that many of those in the private sector nominally entitled to increases under the current national agreement are not, in fact, at present receiving them&mdash; and of course, those in the public sector <Col N="630" /> are, by and large, in secure employment not subject to the redundancies being suffered elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The provision for public service pay in the 1976 Estimates volume is over £532 million.  To this figure must be added over £85 million representing the pay elements in university, voluntary hospital and certain semi-State body grants met by the Exchequer and nearly £50 million for public service pensions.  Intimidating as the total of £667 million is, this figure is based on the assumption that, apart from commitments under the existing national agreement, there will be no pay increases in the public sector in 1976. The increase in the public service pay bill is over 18 per cent.  Of this about 13 percentage points represent the carry-over effect into 1976 of standard increases under the national pay agreement, together with the payment during 1976 of standard increases yet to come under these agreements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Claims for special increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the claims for special increases for the public sector&mdash;that is, for increases additional to the standard increases under the 1975 national agreement.  If granted in full, they would cost some £60 million a year, most of which would fall on the Exchequer. The Government have, therefore, reluctantly come to the conclusion that they have no option but to defer consideration of all outstanding claims for special increases, subject to a few exceptions, until at least the end of 1976.  The Government feel sure that, in the critical situation now facing the country, the public sector staffs will accept this position.  Any increase in the total bill for pay and pensions other than those provided for in the present budget would necessitate the introduction of a supplementary budget during 1976. Any extra taxation involved could be injurious to the nation's economic wellbeing and would also be inequitable if it had to be paid, as it would be, by sections of the community who were themselves deprived by economic circumstances of corresponding income increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" />
      <i>Public service numbers</i>
    </P>
    <P>About 2 percentage points of the increase in the public service pay bill of £532 million are due to provision for extra numbers.  In the civil service itself, there has been a very rigid limitation on expansion over the past year and posts have been authorised only where they were inescapably required for essential work.  Considerable progress has been made in re-deploying existing personnel to the best advantage. Despite a significant expansion of work in several areas, the net increase in civil service posts during 1975 has been kept to less than 1 per cent, whereas the average annual increase in numbers in the preceding five years each year was nearly 6 per cent.  Most of the posts created in 1975 were required for work concerned with social welfare benefits, EEC agricultural schemes, the prison service and revenue collection.  It will be necessary to exercise a continuing restraint on numbers throughout 1976.  As Minister for the Public Service, I have directed my Department to continue their efforts to improve civil service efficiency. It must be recognised, however, that it is not possible in the longer term to curtail growth of the civil service if endless demands for expansion of State activities and improvement of public services are to be met.  As I said earlier, demands for services and unwillingness to pay for them are simply irreconcilable.</P>
    <P>Some of the expansion springs, of course, from necessity rather than new demands.  Defence Force numbers, for instance, have increased during the past year by 17 per cent and there has been a 3.6 per cent increase in Garda numbers.  Despite the high cost involved, we must keep our security services at the level necessary to guarantee the safety of our citizens against the evil, wantonly wasteful and criminal actions of enemies of the people who profess political motivation for their heinous barbarities. Another area of necessity arises because numbers of teachers have increased by over 5 per cent to match the increase in the numbers of pupils. The Government would like further to <Col N="632" /> reduce pupil-teacher ratios but it is not yet possible to do so.  There has been a small increase in the numbers of health board employees to cater for improvements in the health services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service arbitration machinery</i>
    </P>
    <P>An important factor in the cost of public service pay has been the existence of different arbitration boards in the public sector, which has contributed to &ldquo;leapfrogging&rdquo; pay claims and often to widespread dissatisfaction. Early last year, the Minister for Labour and I had discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the subject.  We proposed that steps be taken to ensure consistency in the operations of these boards and it was decided that a working party, on which the ICTU are represented, should urgently consider the question. Following a protracted series of meetings, it has been agreed that the various conciliation and arbitration schemes be amended to provide that Labour Court members should be appointed to arbitration boards where either party to a particular claim so requests.</P>
    <P>In our discussions with Congress we also proposed that the whole question of separate arbitration boards for public service groups be reviewed.  The working party is now continuing its work on a fundamental reassessment of public service conciliation and arbitration arrangements covering, in particular, the role of the Labour Court.  It is critically important that an early solution be found to the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Public service pensions, which follow pay increases, now account&mdash;as indicated earlier&mdash;for almost £50 million of the total non-capital expenditure, which is an increase of £10½ million in 1976 over 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public expenditure strategy for 1976</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are naturally disappointed that in present circumstances it is simply not possible to fulfil all the earlier expressed hopes and honestly made commitments for policy changes and new services.  Following <Col N="633" /> the nil growth of 1974 and a decline of 3 per cent in 1975, the level of GNP in 1976 will be about 12 per cent lower than the forecasts made in 1973 before the oil crisis precipitated the world-wide recession.  We openly and truthfully acknowledge that, because our resources are now less than they would have been in normal times, we have to modify or postpone many ambitions.  Better to do that than to aggravate our present difficulties by trying to do the impossible.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the reasons why there are limitations on the growth in public expenditure, the dangers and inherent contradictions in attempting to allow existing trends to proceed in the face of public unwillingness to pay the taxation necessary to meet the cost and the inbuilt resistance to change which make it difficult to achieve any flexibility in the system. Above all, as I have pointed out, there is an inescapable upper limit on the size of the increase in public expenditure which can be tolerated this year. Within this limit, however, other considerations have to be taken into account, in particular the needs of the economic situation.</P>
    <P>It is clear that because of the world economic position, and in particular the state of the British economy, little real stimulus to the economy can be expected from exports, at least until nearer the end of the year.  Similarly, the pause in incomes, while absolutely vital to improve the economic health of the country, will take some time to produce results.  If, therefore, economic activity is to be increased, particularly in the period before external demand begins to recover and the incomes pause improves competitiveness, the boost must come from public expenditure.  As the publication &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo; points out, economic growth would, if there were no stimulus from public expenditure, be less than 1 per cent.  Indeed, it would be in the region of ½ per cent.</P>
    <P>This is unacceptable to the Government. Instead, the budgetary aim this year is to use public expenditure, the real constraints on resources, to stimulate economic activity.  Total <Col N="634" /> Government expenditure in 1976 will amount to £2,105 million, of which £1,683 million is due to current expenditure and £422 million to capital expenditure&mdash;mainly on the public capital programme.  Total current resources available, at existing rates of taxation, and non-borrowed capital funds amount to £1,319 million, a shortfall of £786 million on planned expenditure.  The sources from which the gap must be financed are increased taxation or borrowing.  In deciding on the appropriate mix of these alternatives account must be taken of many, and sometimes conflicting, economic and financial considerations.  Having regard to the need for an economic stimulus without damaging competitiveness and the desirability of phasing out current deficits over a period of years and thus restraining borrowing requirements, the Government have decided to bridge part of the gap by £107 million net additional taxation. The Government's borrowing in 1976 will amount to £679 million&mdash;an increase of £78 million on 1975.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy is to prune current expenditure where it does not contribute significantly to increased economic activity in general and to employment in particular. Such a policy allows resources to be freed for an increase in capital expenditure, which should provide a stimulus to domestic demand and a boost to employment.  At the same time, we are moving towards a more desirable composition of Government expenditure: by the increased emphasis on capital investment, future prospects for growth and job creation will be enhanced.  We propose to continue the move in this direction and to subject all non-capital expenditure to critical examination by reference to the criteria I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>CURRENT EXPENDITURE, 1976</P>
    <P>
      <i>1975 outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>My January, 1975, budget envisaged a deficit of £125 million.  By the time of my June, 1975, budget the revised deficit had become £222 million, to which £20 million was added by the net cost of the package of economic measures I then announced. <Col N="635" /> The actual deficit for the year was £259 million.  The January expectation of revenue for the year was £1,126 million; by June, this had been revised downward in the light of trends prevailing to £1,110 million. The eventual revenue outturn was £1,091 million.  The shortfall in tax revenue was mainly attributable to the fall-off in income tax receipts&mdash; because of reduction in overtime earnings, increasing unemployment and short-time working&mdash;and in VAT receipts, due to depression of trade. Total current expenditure turned out at £1,350 million, or £2 million less than envisaged in the supplementary budget of last June.</P>
    <P>
      <i>1976 estimates</i>
    </P>
    <P>The opening total for current expenditure in 1976 is £1,682 million. Of this, the largest component is accounted for by non-capital supply services at £1,348 million, which show an increase of £216 million, or 19 per cent, over the 1975 estimates, including supplementaries, for those services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1976 estimates volume includes provision for a small number of new services.  About £6 million is being provided for the transfer of a further instalment of health and housing charges from local rates to the Exchequer.  This brings to £39 million the amount by which local rates have been relieved since 1973. If the Government had not accepted both this liability as it stood in 1973 and the full increases amounting to £21 million since then in the costs of these services, local rates would on average be about £4.50 in the pound greater and the Exchequer would have had an additional £60 million to spend on central Government services. The estimate for social welfare contains a significant new provision of £2 million for the supplementary welfare allowances scheme which is to be introduced in 1976 to replace the home assistance scheme.  The basic innovation is that country-wide statutory standards will be laid down <Col N="636" /> for the administration of the scheme, whereas the previous home assistance scheme was operated at the discretion of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The estimate for international cooperation contains a new provision of £1 million for international development aid arising mainly out of the Lomé Agreement.  In the estimate for Industry and Commerce £400,000 is provided to help with credit for Irish exporters of capital goods.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Subsidies introduced in June 1975 budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>The subsidies which were introduced in my June, 1975 budget, in order to combat the inflationary trend by achieving price reductions in respect of clothing and footwear and of certain items of transport, food and fuel, will be continued.  Over £46 million is provided in the 1976 estimates for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1976 estimate of expenditure on education is £241 million.  This represents more than one-sixth of total current expenditure and is £49 million more than in 1975 or three times the expenditure on this service five years ago.  As would be expected in such a labour-intensive area, the bulk of the increase is on pay and pensions, which account for about £180 million in 1976. There are also substantial increases under other headings, namely, secondary capitation and tuition grants for which £4 million extra is provided, operating costs of school transport&mdash; an additional £3 million&mdash;and grants to vocational education committees which are up by £7.3 million.  Few, if any, will dispute the importance, or begrudge the cost, of education for our young people.  This generous disposition towards our youth will have to be reflected in a willingness to pay the cost or else our children will be the sufferers.  The choice is stark but very simple.  If we want to advance our children's interest, we will have to pay the cost through higher taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>Expenditure on social welfare has trebled in the past five years.  The 1976 <Col N="637" /> provision, at £243 million, reflects the substantial improvements since 1973 in rates of benefit, which rose by almost 80 per cent on average, the alleviation of the means test and the reduction in the pension age from 70 to 67, which also allowed many additional people to qualify for free travel, free electricity and TV licences.  Unemployment insurance and assistance, which cost the Exchequer £48 million in 1975, is expected to cost £60 million in 1976, an increase of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health</i>
    </P>
    <P>Government expenditure on health in 1976 is estimated to cost £242.5 million of which £153 million represents pay.  Five years ago&mdash;in 1971-72&mdash;this expenditure was little more than one-fifth of the 1976 figure.  The transfer, now almost complete, of health charges from the rates to the Exchequer is at present costing the State about £50 million a year when account is taken of both the direct reduction in rates expenditure and the increased costs which would otherwise have fallen on the rates.  The immense increase in health costs must, of course, worry us all.  Have we experienced improvements in services commensurate with increased costs?  These are issues which are being urgently examined by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Justice and Defence</i>
    </P>
    <P>These services will cost £156 million in 1976 compared with £61 million in 1972-73, reflecting the Government's continuing appreciation of the community's preoccupation with security, to which I have referred.  Were evil men and women not now engaged in unforgivable campaigns of criminal violence in our midst in this island, nearly £100 million could have been released to provide jobs to create sustainable wealth.  We should resolve to make 1976 a year of total repudiation of all men of violence, irrespective of the political causes they evoke in self-justification. The bulk of the extra money on security will be spent on the Garda and the Defence Forces&mdash; both for pay and for improving communications, equipment and transport. The Prisons Vote, which shows a significant <Col N="638" /> increase, provides for continued modernisation of prisons and improvements in security.  These are areas of expenditure in which there will be no stinting.  It is high time that those unfriendly to the aspirations of our people appreciated that we will not compromise with the forces of evil and destruction.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1976 estimate for Agriculture provides for non-capital expenditure of £79 million compared with £65 million in 1975, an increase of 20 per cent.  In addition, £36.5 million is being provided for relief of rates on agricultural land&mdash;an increase of over £6 million on 1975.  The increased expenditure on agriculture is a reflection of the Government's anxiety that the growth potential of Irish farming should be used to the full.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Posts and Telegraphs</i>
    </P>
    <P>Non-capital expenditure here in 1976 will be £111 million, an increase of almost £20 million on the 1975 figure.  About half the increase is for pay, indicative of the fact that the Post Office is highly labour-intensive. The estimate also provides for an increase of £2.6 million in the grants to RTE.  This reflects the increase in TV licence fees recently announced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industry and Commerce</i>
    </P>
    <P>This estimate provides for an increase of £7.2 million or 32 per cent for non-capital expenditure.  Increased non-capital grants are being provided for the various promotional bodies such as the IDA, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Local Government</i>
    </P>
    <P>This estimate includes £29.4 million for housing subsidy&mdash;an increase of £4.9 million.  This increase mainly covers the cost of new houses coming on charge for the first time but it also provides for the cost of transferring a further instalment of housing charges from the rates to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Labour</i>
    </P>
    <P>This estimate provides for an increase of £3.5 million, or almost 70 <Col N="639" /> per cent, in the non-capital grant to AnCO, which should result in a very significant expansion in the industrial training programme during the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital expenditure, 1976</i>
    </P>
    <P>I come now to capital expenditure. Expenditure on the public capital programme in 1975 was £467 million.  The reduction of £22 million on the estimate was due mainly to the demand for agricultural and industrial loan finance being less than the amounts allocated for these purposes.  In view of the further deterioration in the employment situation and of the need to stimulate investment, the Government have decided on a substantial increase in expenditure on the public capital programme in 1976 despite the large borrowing involved and the high cost of servicing the debt.  The 1976 programme has been settled at £596 million which is £129 million or 27.6 per cent more than expenditure in 1975.  This represents the maximum possible within the limitations of overall borrowing and will provide a much-needed boost to economic activity in 1976.</P>
    <P>In determining the composition of the 1976 programme, the Government have given first priority to investments which will promote economic growth and sustainable employment.  Nearly half the overall increase of £129 million has been allocated to investment in industry, which shows an increase of £64 million or 71 per cent over expenditure in 1975.  Investment in agriculture on the capital side will rise by £18 million or over 25 per cent. When account is taken of the construction content of the whole public capital programme, the total provision affecting the building and construction industry is £325 million, an increase of £45 million over 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Estimation of revenue</i>
    </P>
    <P>My estimate of total revenue receipts for 1976 is £1,248 million, as shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.  This total represents tax revenue, including motor vehicle duties, at existing rates, and non-tax revenue.  The estimation of <Col N="640" /> tax revenue is always conditioned by the expectations of economic developments during the period in question.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful, having listened to many experts, both national and international, that the estimate I have now made for 1976 is well-judged and likely to be realised but I cannot rule out the possibility of having to revise my expectations at a later date, up or down.  Because of the volatile economic world in which we live, the position will, as in 1975, need to be kept under careful review.  Meanwhile, I am faced with an opening current budget deficit, being the gap between estimated expenditure and expected revenues, of £433 million.  This budget, as I have said, provides for raising £107 million by way of net additional taxation.  Allowing for a net increase of £1 million in expenditure the resulting gap of £327 million will form part of the Exchequer's borrowing requirement for 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchequer borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am circulating a table showing in summary form the Exchequer's financial requirements in 1975 and 1976, together with the sources of finance. The extent to which it has been possible to satisfy the Exchequer's requirements in 1975 from domestic sources has been particularly gratifying, though I am not unmindful that this is due in part to the fall-off in other investment.  Net receipts from sales to the non-bank public of Government securities, including the national loan, have in recent years averaged about £25 million annually and the original estimate for 1975 was put at £40 million.</P>
    <P>Last June, I increased the net figure to £90 million.  In the event, the actual outturn exceeded all expectations at £191 million, some of which came from non-domestic sources.  To satisfy demand, I created new tranches of existing stocks during the year and my Department and the Central Bank continued to support an active market in Government securities.  Receipts from domestic non-bank sources are particularly welcome because they reduce dependence on monetary methods of financing and do not create the potential <Col N="641" /> for undue credit expansion at a later date.</P>
    <P>A more rapid expansion of bank resources than expected led to a higher level of purchases of Government securities by the commercial banks. The Associated Banks also assisted the Exchequer by taking over most of the financing of intervention buying of agricultural produce, thereby enabling the Exchequer to recoup the bulk of its outlays in 1975 and earlier years.  The Central Bank increased their portfolio of Government securities by £50 million.</P>
    <P>Because of all these favourable developments it was possible to limit the intake from Exchequer foreign borrowing, which at one time seemed likely to exceed £200 million, to £164 million in 1975 and to leave over a substantial amount of the dollar credit facilities negotiated in 1975 for drawing down in 1976.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of all resources available to finance current and capital expenditure in 1976, including the revenue from the proposed tax increases in this budget, it will still be necessary for the Exchequer to raise £679 million by borrowing. The comparable borrowing figure for 1975 was £601 million.</P>
    <P>These are very large amounts, indeed, and have an immediate impact on expenditure in the form of debt service charges.  Such charges amounted to almost £200 million in 1975 and will require some £300 million in 1976. They are a massive burden on the Exchequer. Debt service charges are and must be a first charge on revenue.  It is well to remember, therefore, that borrowing is not the painless panacea which some people suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When £300 million of tax revenue has first to be put aside to meet debt obligations, it leaves £300 million less to spend on other, possibly more popular forms of public expenditure. Borrowing, therefore, considerably restricts the Government's freedom of action in resource allocation. Debt service charges represent the inescapable price to be paid for money borrowed to finance the public capital <Col N="642" /> programme, which has been the source of so much of our economic expansion, and to meet the deficits on current account.  Borrowing for capital purposes is justifiable in the context of our long-term economic aims.  Borrowing to meet current deficits is not, no matter how defensible it may be by reference to immediately pressing requirements. It is the Government's firm intention, therefore, to phase out the present current deficit over a three-year period.</P>
      <P>As regards the 1976 borrowing requirement, while the demand for Government stocks in the opening weeks of the year has been exceptionally buoyant, it is clear that loans from abroad will be required.  Criticism is sometimes made of Government foreign borrowing.  I must emphasise that this is undertaken only where considered strictly necessary having regard to Exchequer financial requirements.  While the servicing of domestic debt does not impose a burden on the national economy as distinct from the Exchequer, the cost of interest and principal repayments on foreign loans must in the end be met from our export earnings.  There is generally an exchange risk involved with loans raised abroad but part of this is cushioned by the lower rates of interest charged on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Small savings</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been keeping the terms of the small savings schemes under review and have had the benefit of the views of the National Savings Committee. During last year I introduced two index-linked saving schemes, one of which was in substitution for the earlier national instalment-savings scheme and gives an index-linked rather than a fixed bonus.  The degree of success in tackling the problem of inflation has meant that a rate of return linked to the consumer price index no longer appears as attractive as it might have some months ago when I introduced the schemes.  I propose, therefore, to provide for minimum guaranteed rates of return on these schemes where these would be <Col N="643" /> more favourable than index-linking and details will be announced shortly. This new arrangement will be backdated to the commencement of these new schemes last October.  I am satisfied that the terms of the other small savings schemes are sufficiently attractive and I do not propose to make any changes in them.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fiscal policy for 1976&mdash;Structure of tax system</i>
    </P>
    <P>From what I have said about the inevitability of an increase in public expenditure in the short-term despite the need to curb expenditure in the longer term and the absolute ceiling that financial prudence sets to our borrowing capacity, it will be clear that the financing of the necessary expenditure unavoidably requires considerable additional taxation.  Before I come to the details of this, however, it is desirable that there should be a clear understanding of the present structure of taxation and the severe limits it sets to the Government's freedom of manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>In the financial year 1960-61, only 28 per cent of total taxation came from direct taxation; the other 72 per cent came from indirect taxation&mdash; mainly the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;, beer, spirits, tobacco and petrol.  At that time and since, there was considerable comment on our heavy dependence on indirect taxation.  It was criticised as being generally regressive in its effect and bearing, therefore, more heavily on those least able to afford it. There was some merit in those criticisms, but the pendulum has swung a long way since then: by 1975, 45 per cent of our total tax yield came from direct taxation of incomes, mainly from people on PAYE, and 55 per cent from indirect taxes on consumption.</P>
    <P>A 45 per cent share from direct taxes is, of course, still relatively low when compared with most European countries, but, and this is important, the composition of that share is startling. Whereas in 1960-61 companies bore over 31 per cent of income taxes, last year their share had shrunk to about 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> This is partly a measure of the growth in the numbers of other taxpayers, but is also a measure of the extent to which companies are relieved of their nominal tax burden through export sales relief, accelerated depreciation, stock relief and other tax concessions. The extent of relief can be gauged from the fact that while the nominal rate of taxation on company profits is 50 per cent, it is estimated that the total yield of tax from companies could be raised, if all reliefs were abolished, by a straight tax rate of about 20 per cent.  It is evident that the scope for granting any further reliefs to companies is extremely limited and any further extension for any but the most limited purposes and periods would be hard to justify.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the other constituents of income taxation, we find that Schedule E, that is, employee, taxpayers, who accounted for 35 per cent of income taxation in 1960-61, contributed 82 per cent in 1975, while Schedule D payers, that is, self-employed, other than companies, who accounted for 27 per cent in 1960-61, represented only 12 per cent in 1975. Schedule E taxpayers&mdash;those in ordinary wage or salary-earning employment&mdash;account for 94 per cent of the increase in the number of taxpayers over that period and have borne 87 per cent of the total rise in income tax over that period.  It is also necessary to point out, in a time of high inflation, that the Schedule E tax has been paid, by and large, as it was earned, or very shortly thereafter, while companies and other Schedule D and self-employed payers have enjoyed the benefits of profits earned for up to two years and more before paying income tax on those profits.</P>
    <P>Moreover, inflation is increasing the progressiveness of income taxation: the average tax rate of a married man with two children, as I have informed the House previously, has increased in real terms over the same 15 years by anything up to 100 per cent, depending on earnings&mdash;that is, when allowance is made for inflation.  In addition, the effective rates of tax for all classes of taxpayers&mdash;single, married, or married with children&mdash;have increasingly tended <Col N="645" /> to converge; this has borne most heavily on married couples with children. We now have the second highest marginal rate of personal income tax in the EEC and it applies at a far lower point than in any other member State. What are the reasons?  It is in part due to our policy of exempting from income tax profits made from goods manufactured for export and the freedom from income taxation enjoyed by over 95 per cent of our farmers who, with their families, comprise almost 25 per cent of our work force.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, 50 per cent of total earnings is taken by taxation at an earnings level of just over £13,000.  The next lowest corresponding thresholds in the EEC are Britain at £16,000 and the Netherlands at £25,000.  In Italy the figure is £100,000, while in France the State never takes 50 per cent of earnings.</P>
    <P>I have gone into these matters in some detail in dealing with these matters because I do not think it is generally realised how heavily our income tax system bears firstly, on individuals rather than companies and secondly, on those in wage or salaried employment rather than the self-employed or unincorporated businesses. It also illustrates how much income tax has become an urban rather than a rural tax and how, despite the superficial appearance that direct taxation still represents a fairly small proportion of the total by reference to international comparisons, we are very close to the effective limits of personal income taxation under the present structure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Principles of tax policy for 1976</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have said all this because it has strongly coloured the Government's views on the form the additional taxation required should take.  We have taken the view that, because of the factors I have mentioned, it would be wrong to increase rates of income taxation as such, though I am sorry to say budgetary necessity requires the renewal of the income tax surcharge for another year.  This necessarily means that, if the sacrifice is to be evenly spread, the burden must fall on indirect taxation and we have deliberately <Col N="646" /> slanted the bulk of this towards non-essential spending.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Anti-evasion measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>Several other consequences follow from this approach to taxation.  The first is that evasion of tax cannot be tolerated.  In the interests of fair play, which demand that tax be paid by those best in a position to do so, each of my budgets has contained specific anti-avoidance and anti-evasion provisions. As from today, an even more rigorous anti-evasion campaign will be launched by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>A special staff unit is being set up in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to oversee the anti-evasion drive and to devise new procedures to pursue tax defaulters.  I might mention one particular aspect of their activities.  Cases which appear to warrant special attention will be subjected to intensive investigation and where evidence is found of tax evasion the offenders will be brought to court and prosecuted.</P>
    <P>There will in future be no question in serious evasion cases of allowing an option for a financial settlement out of court.  It is only fair to the general body of taxpayers who discharge their tax liabilities fully that major defaulters in the tax field should be named and landed in open court and face conviction where the evidence warrants.  The penalties for evasion include imprisonment for up to six months on summary conviction and I am having the question of a further strengthening of these provisions examined.  The Revenue Commissioners will also take special measures as regards those taxpayers who have an obligation to keep records.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for extra staff to be made available to the Revenue Commissioners to the extent necessary to give teeth to the anti-evasion drive and to ensure its continuing effectiveness.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Amnesty</i>
    </P>
    <P>In inaugurating a new regime of intensive combating of evasion I <Col N="647" /> think it is in the general interest that at the same time I should hold out to those who have defaulted in the past a last chance to put themselves right with the law so that they can start the future with a slate wiped clean.  I wish to announce, therefore, that an amnesty will be available to those tax defaulters who comply fully with its conditions within a strictly limited period of three months.  The conditions of amnesty are as follows:</P>
    <P>Defaulters must within three months from today's date&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  disclose to the Revenue Commissioners the fact that they had been understating their incomes;</P>
    <P>(b)  detail the manner and extent of all their evasions;</P>
    <P>(c)  produce details of their assets, deposits and other holdings; and</P>
    <P>(d)  make a substantial payment on account of the tax evaded.</P>
    <P>Full information about the amnesty will be published by the Revenue Commissioners.  I should like to make it clear at this stage that, unless all the conditions of the amnesty are strictly complied with, those concerned will not be entitled to the benefit of the amnesty and they will, therefore, be prosecuted with the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;Lumpers&rdquo;</i>
    </P>
    <P>More specifically, one abuse of the tax system has become notorious, namely, the use of the &ldquo;lump&rdquo; in the building industry to evade tax. The emergence of what the statisticians call &ldquo;net inward migration&rdquo; has resulted in the importation of unwelcome tax evasion skills and I am determined that they shall not take hold here.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1970 provisions sought to tackle this problem by requiring principal contractors to deduct tax at 35 per cent from payments to certain sub-contractors and then pay the tax to the Revenue.</P>
    <P>It was accepted that this scheme of deduction, which was an anti-evasion measure, ought not to apply to well-established sub-contractors who had <Col N="648" /> been making regular returns for tax purposes and who complied with their tax obligations.  Accordingly, provision was made for the issue to them of certificates which enabled them to obtain payment without deduction of tax.  I am sorry to say that this scheme of certificates is now being abused in many ways and on an extensive scale, even to the extent of using forged certificates.  If these abuses are not stopped quickly there will be a loss of revenue of several million pounds a year which other taxpayers would be called upon to make good.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, all certificates at present being used will be recalled immediately for authentication and, as from 1st March, 1976, principal contractors will be required to deduct tax at 35 per cent from any payment to a sub-contractor who does not produce a duly authenticated certificate.  A financial resolution is being moved today to provide the necessary statutory authority.  The Revenue Commissioners will announce later the arrangements to be followed for the return of certificates for authentication.  I feel sure that this measure will be welcomed by the general body of taxpayers and particularly by principal contractors, many of whom have been embarrassed by sub-contractors seeking to escape from their legal obligations. The yield in 1976 is expected to be £1 million.  This step, however, provides only a temporary solution and, as a longer term measure, it is proposed to tighten up considerably the existing scheme.  The details will be set out in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unpaid remuneration</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under existing PAYE legislation, tax is deductible on payment of any remuneration, including directors' fees. Where an employer fails to pay over to the Revenue the tax deductible, there is a liability to the interest charge. These provisions are now being circumvented in the case of directors of some private companies. In these cases, the directors draw money from the company by way of loan but there is no formal voting of remuneration until a long time afterwards.  Tax is only then <Col N="649" /> deductible and liable to be remitted and there is no interest charge in respect of the delayed payment of tax, although the directors have effectively drawn the remuneration much earlier. It is proposed to counter this device by including appropriate provisions in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Equalising the tax burden</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have repeatedly enunciated that those within the income tax net should be treated as equally as possible.  My ultimate aim is that people with the equivalent incomes should pay equivalent tax.  A major step in this direction was taken last June, when I announced that remuneration at present outside the scope of PAYE would be brought within the system, Those affected are public servants and some other groups. This change will now take effect from 6th April, 1976.  I had discussions with staff associations in the public service on means whereby the transition to the new system could be eased.  To allow for the cost of these transitional arrangements, the gain to the Exchequer for 1976 is put at £5 million. The gain in a full year will, of course, be higher.</P>
    <P>The corollary of this is that every effort should be made to bring all other taxpayers on to the same basis of contemporary assessment.  There are obvious obstacles to doing so as far as traders and the self-employed are concerned, but as a first step towards this aim the Government have decided to advance by three months each, the due dates for payment of tax by individuals under Schedule D in the next two assessment years&mdash;that is, from 1st January and 1st July, 1977, to 1st October, 1976 and 1st April, 1977, respectively, for the assessment year 1976-77 and to 1st July, 1977 and 1st January, 1978 for the assessment year 1977-78.  This change will bring forward to 1976 and extra £10 million from 1977.  I trust that there will be general acceptance of the equity of this move. Even after this advancement, individuals liable to Schedule D tax will still be paying their tax later than many companies and, of course, very much later than employees whose tax is <Col N="650" /> deducted from their pay as they earn it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmers' taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>A third consequence of the principle of equivalent taxation relates to profits in agriculture.  A major step was taken in 1974 by making some farming profits liable to income tax but because of the necessarily gradual method of its introduction only about 9,000 farmers out of a total of 160,000 are, in fact, liable.  At my request, in response to the representations of farmers' organisations, I referred the question of farmers' liability to tax to the National Economic and Social Council.  Yesterday I composed the following two sentences and I will comment on the matter in just a moment&mdash;I wrote them as late as 6 p.m. yesterday: I expect that the council will produce a report shortly on the general question of applying the taxation system equitably to farmers, just as it is applied throughout Europe.  Pending receipt of the report and an opportunity to consider it, no further action is contemplated in this general area.</P>
    <P>Since I composed those two sentences, indeed at 6.20 yesterday evening, I received a report of 130 pages on this very subject.  While I am naturally flattered at the estimate some people have of my capacity for quick reading and quick absorption of what I read, I have not got the same exaggerated view of my own abilities, and the House will readily understand that such short notice would not afford me an opportunity to present the report to the Cabinet for consideration, and still less an opportunity to bring our views before Dáil Éireann.  The position is, as I have stated, that no general action is contemplated in this area until we have had an opportunity to consider the report.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one matter which calls for immediate action.  As Deputies know, the tax charge on farming profits is, by and large, confined to farmers with farmland of valuation of £100 or more.  Devices are now being employed to avoid the tax charge by fragmentation of holdings through use of companies and family partnership arrangements and the letting of parcels <Col N="651" /> of the land at a nominal rent or on a rent-free basis.  There will be provision in the Finance Bill to counter these devices.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Benefits-in-kind and expenses</i>
    </P>
    <P>The fourth area in which the Government have decided there should be a step towards equivalent taxation concerns benefits-in-kind and expenses deductible for tax purposes.  An example is the &ldquo;company car&rdquo;. Although, in theory, 1958 legislation provided for taxation of the personal benefit enjoyed by the users of such cars, in practice the legislation is quite inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided that with effect from 6th April, where a car is provided by an employer the minimum amount of the benefit-in-kind to the employee for tax purposes will be taken as 15 per cent of the cost of the car or £300, whichever is the greater.  In the case of Schedule D taxpayers, allowable motor expenses will, with effect from tomorrow, be reduced annually by one-third of the amount by which the cost of the car exceeds £3,500 or, if the taxpayer so opts, in proportion to that excess.  As a concomitant step, and one which will bring a restriction of 1973 into step with current car prices, I am raising the existing restriction of £2,500 on capital allowances for business cars to £3,500 also.  The yield from these measures in 1976 is put at £2 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Liquefied petroleum gas</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have become concerned at the extent to which motorists have begun to convert their cars to run on liquefied petroleum gas in order to evade payment of petrol duty.  I could not obviously countenance the loss to the Exchequer which a widespread application of this practice would produce and I propose, therefore, to introduce a provision in the Finance Bill to render gas used in motor vehicles liable to duty, at a date to be determined and at a rate which, when differing efficiencies are taken into account, is comparable to the rate at which petrol is liable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" />
      <i>Agricultural and fishery co-operatives</i>
    </P>
    <P>Agricultural and fishery co-operatives have enjoyed for many years exemption from company tax.  This exemption was originally designed to stimulate greater efficiency and output in those sectors. In the last decade, however, the co-operatives' activities have expanded enormously.  They now include some of the largest businesses in the country and the scale of operations is now such that the continuance of the exemption is both difficult to justify and inequitable to the general body of taxpayers as well as to ordinary traders who are subject to the normal tax régime.  Industrial co-operatives have not been provided with a similar concession.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided to terminate the exemption enjoyed by agricultural and fishery co-operatives with effect from 6th April, 1976.  While the termination will not be reflected in tax receipts in 1976, the revenue gain could be up to about £3 million a year thereafter.  The co-operatives will, of course, be entitled to avail of the generous scheme of allowances and reliefs provided under the company tax code.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Personal income tax relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>Before I come to the tax charges necessary to bridge in part the gap between expenditure and revenues, I should like to turn to one area where taxation equity demands that I should give relief within the limited room available.  In keeping with the Government's commitment to a policy of reviewing the personal income tax allowances at regular intervals, and in view of the significant change in the real value of money since they were revised in last year's budget, all personal allowances are being increased again this year.  The single allowance will be increased from £575 to £620, the widowed allowance from £635 to £685, the married allowance from £920 to £1,010, and the child allowance from £230 to £240.  Thus, for a married couple with three children the combined allowances will rise from £1,610 to £1,730.  Details of the increased allowances, and resulting savings in tax of taxpayers with different levels of incomes, are <Col N="653" /> contained in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; which will be circulated separately to Deputies at the end of my speech.  The cost of the increases in personal income tax allowances is £10 million in 1976.  Deputies and the public will appreciate that this, in a difficult budget, represents a very considerable concession.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>I turn now to the other side of the account&mdash;the inescapable tax changes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT</i>
    </P>
    <P>It will be recalled that in previous budgets I removed VAT from foodstuffs, oral medicines, clothes and footwear&mdash;the &ldquo;necessities of life&rdquo;. Having regard to the exclusion of these necessities from the VAT net, it is proposed that the following changes in VAT rates be made with effect from 1st March, 1976&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 10 per cent rate will apply instead of the present rate of 6.75 per cent.  The new 10 per cent rate will also apply to short-term car hire, which is at present exempt from VAT, and to dances, which are at present subject to a special rate.  The effective rate on housing will, however, remain unchanged at 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 20 per cent rate will apply instead of the present rate of 19.5 per cent and will also apply to fur clothing, which is at present zero rated for VAT purposes.</P>
    <P>These changes are expected to yield additional revenue of £26.5 million in 1976.  The new 10 per cent rate of VAT will apply from 1st March, 1976 to the increased prices for spirits, beer, tobacco, wine, and petrol arising from the proposed excise changes which I shall come to presently and which will apply from midnight tonight.</P>
    <P>The effective burden of VAT on motorcars and motorcycles will not be increased.  In future, the two-tier VAT rate in their case will comprise 25 per cent a manufacturing-assembly level plus 10 per cent thereafter, compared with the present rates of 30 per cent and 6.75 per cent, respectively.  The two-tier VAT rate on other items will <Col N="654" /> in future be 30 per cent plus 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is proposed to abolish the 1 per cent VAT credit allowed to VAT-registered customers of unregistered farmers with effect also from 1st March, 1976.  The additional net revenue in 1976 is expected to be £3.5 million.  Having regard to the considerable income tax exemption enjoyed by the agricultural community as against persons in non-agricultural employment, equity requires that at least this amount of tax be recouped from agricultural activities.  It represents less than 0.7 per cent of agricultural incomes in 1975.  As heretofore, the VAT arrangements for fishermen will follow those applied to farmers.  In 1975, 0.2 per cent of farming incomes was paid in income taxation, compared with an average 14 per cent of non-agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Spirits</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of £4.282 is proposed in the excise duty on a proof gallon of spirits.  When VAT at the present rate is included, the retail price of a glass of spirits will increase by 5p.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £7 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Beer</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of £18.548 is proposed also in the excise duty on a standard barrel of beer.  When VAT at the present rate is included, the retail price of a pint of beer of average gravity will increase by 5p.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £19 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wine</i>
    </P>
    <P>Higher duties on wines are also proposed which will be equivalent to increases ranging between 10p and 20p a bottle, graded mainly according to alcoholic strength.  Further details of these increases, which are estimated to bring in extra revenue of £1 million in 1976, can be found in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tobacco</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of £0.618 is proposed in the excise duty on a 1b of tobacco. <Col N="655" /> When VAT at the present rate is included the retail price of the standard packet of 20 cigarettes will increase by 3p with <i>pro rata</i> increases in cigars and pipe tobacco.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £5 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Petrol</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of 9.36p a gallon is proposed in the excise duty on petrol. When VAT at the present rate is included, the retail price of a gallon of petrol will increase by 10p.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £17.5 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>All hydrocarbon oils except petrol and DERV</i>
    </P>
    <P>A new excise duty of 2p per gallon is proposed on all hydrocarbon oils other than dutiable petrol and diesel, together with liquefied petroleum gases.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £18 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>All these excise increases will operate from midnight tonight.  Consequential increases in the retail prices may not operate until the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made maximum prices orders giving effect to new retail prices.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Motor vehicle duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is proposed that the motor vehicle duties be revised with effect as from 1st March, as follows.  Road tax on private motor vehicles will be calculated at £4 per horse-power for those not exceeding 8 horse-power, at £5 per horse-power for those exceeding 8 horse-power but not exceeding 12 horse-power, and at £6 per horse-power for those exceeding 12 horse-power. Taxis and school buses will, however, be exempted from these increases. These changes are estimated to bring in £8.5 million additional revenue in 1976 for general Exchequer purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stock relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>An area in which, within the limited room available, I propose to give some relief concerns stocks. Companies engaged wholly or mainly in manufacturing, construction or <Col N="656" /> farming, or in the sale of plant, machinery or material to those sectors have, following the January, 1975 budget, been allowed special tax relief in respect of the additional cost of replacing trading stocks at inflated prices.  It is proposed to provide for the continuation of this relief for a further year to assist companies in the sectors indicated, who may still be experiencing severe liquidity problems because of the impact of inflation.  In my financial statement last January, I indicated that it was then intended to bring unincorporated traders in the sectors concerned within the concession this year, with retrospective effect, so that over a two-year period they will be placed in the same position as qualifying companies.  As I explained, this could not be done last year for practical reasons.  This year's Finance Bill will provide for the retrospective application of the relief to unincorporated traders as intended. The cost of this, together with the cost of a further year's extension in the case of both companies and unincorporated traders, is £7 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inflation accounting</i>
    </P>
    <P>At the time I introduced stock relief last year, there was some controversy as to whether present accounting practices result in the overstatement of a company's real profits during a period of inflation.  Since then, the debate about accounting practices in a period of inflation has intensified and particular attention has been given by the accountancy profession to the introduction of a form of accounting which would give more emphasis to current, rather than historic, costs.</P>
    <P>The debate over inflation accounting is, of course, a manifestation of the fundamental problem of inflation. Changes in accounting practices are not a remedy for inflation.  Nevertheless they could help in the evolution of a new concept of business profit and lead to a greater appreciation of how profits should be measured and taxed in a period of inflation.</P>
    <P>Accounting problems arising from inflation are not confined to any one country and it is doubtful if universal <Col N="657" /> agreement on this subject can be obtained.  I have made it clear to the Irish accountancy profession that I shall give careful consideration to their views in regard to possible changes in accounting practices and I am awaiting their response.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social welfare increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now come to an area affecting the welfare of thousands of our less well-off citizens.  The period 1973 to 1975 has been one of unprecedented expansion and development for the social welfare services.  The coverage of existing schemes has been expanded by the abolition of the income limit for social insurance, the easement of means tests and the reduction of the pension age. At the same time many new schemes have been introduced some of which are of general application, such as the pay-related benefit scheme, while others are specially tailored to meet the needs of particular deprived groups such as unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and single women approaching pension age.  As a result, the pre-budget Exchequer provision of £243.2 million for social welfare in 1976 is more than two-and-a-half times as much as was spent in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>Last year, because of the exceptionally high level of inflation, there were two increases in all weekly payments, the April increase averaging about 22 per cent and the October increase, which was designed to maintain the value of the rates set in April, amounting to an additional 5 per cent.  Because of the success of the measures taken in last June's budget to lower the rate of increase in prices, the most recent price figures in fact show that the October increase was more than sufficient to maintain the value of the April rates of benefit.</P>
    <P>For 1976, Government policy in relation to the social services will be one of consolidating the advances already made&mdash;an ambitious aim in view of the restraint required from the community in most other fields&mdash;and of ensuring that the vastly improved social welfare system we now have is not open to abuse at the expense of those who must pay for those services. There will, however, be one <Col N="658" /> important innovation: the introduction within the next few months of the new supplementary welfare allowances scheme which is to replace home assistance.  This will provide a clearly defined but flexible response both to the basic financial needs of those who have no other means of support and to the special needs of those whose existing social welfare payments may be insufficient to provide for exceptional circumstances in relation, for instance, to rent, heating or diet.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the rate of price increase in 1976 is expected to be lower than in 1975.  Because of this, and of the effectiveness of last October's increase in benefits in maintaining their real value, the Government have decided that, with the exception of certain small holders, all weekly rates of benefit will be increased by 10 per cent from April. This, for instance, will mean an increase of £1.95 a week in the maximum contributory old age pension for a married couple where both are over 67 but under 80.  Their new rate of pension will be £21.30 a week.  A non-contributory widow or deserted wife with two children will have her maximum rate of pension increased by £1.55 a week, from £15.50 to £17.05. The total cost of these increases in the current year will be £25.5 million, of which the Exchequer will bear £11.4 million.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the 30,000 smallholders who draw unemployment assistance have their means assessed on a notional basis which has remained unchanged since 1966 and which has had the effect that increases in farm income, which has in the interval risen by 250 per cent, did not result in any reduction in their entitlement to assistance. Over the years they have, therefore benefited on the double, from their farm income increases and from enhanced rates of unemployment assistance.  The Government consider that this situation can no longer be justified for smallholders with land valuations exceeding £15.  They have accordingly decided that, as from 1st April next, the means of smallholders with land valuations in the range £15-£20 will be calculated on the basis of <Col N="659" /> £30 per annum for each £1 valuation of the land, while for those with land valuations in excess of £20 the means will be calculated on the basis of £40 per annum for each £1 valuation.  This compares with the present multiplier of £20 per £1 valuation in every case which, as I have said, has remained unchanged for ten years.  Since farm incomes in 1976 are expected to be well over 10 per cent higher than in 1975, the Government have also decided that rates of unemployment assistance for smallholders with valuations in excess of £15 will be maintained at their existing level and will not be increased next April with the other weekly benefits.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of comment in recent months to the effect that the level of benefits and concessions available to unemployed persons leaves them with disposable incomes which are often as great as, and sometimes more than, they had while at work.  The Government have made a detailed examination of this matter on the basis that it would be anomalous and undesirable if an unemployed person, in effect, suffered financially by virtue of seeking and accepting a reasonable job offer.  Accordingly, arrangements will be introduced shortly to ensure that in no case will an unemployed person's income from benefits exceed 85 per cent of his after-tax income immediately prior to unemployment. While this will produce some economies in 1976, its main effect will not be felt until 1977.  Additionally, income from unemployment and disability benefits, pay-related benefit and redundancy weekly payments will henceforth be assessed in full for differential rent purposes.</P>
    <P>These measures will ensure that the benefits available to unemployed persons will continue to provide a reasonable level of income security without creating what has been described as a &ldquo;welfare trap&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The statutory penalties which may be imposed on employers who do not comply with their obligations in relation to payment of social welfare contributions, and on persons who abuse the benefits system, are also being increased <Col N="660" /> to reflect more accurately the large sums of money which can nowadays be involved in such malpractices, and those who abuse the system in this fashion will be prosecuted rigorously.</P>
    <P>Steps are also being taken to prevent abuse of the disability benefit scheme by strengthening the medical inspection staff of the Department of Social Welfare and intensifying the reassessment of dubious claims.  The economies which will be achieved in the current year as a result of those measures have been taken into account in the book of estimates.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that in my budget statement last January I announced that, because the proportion of social insurance costs being borne by the Exchequer is unduly high by European standards, the Government had decided in principle to reduce the Exchequer contribution to social insurance progressively, over a period of six years or so.  The first stage of this phased reduction will take effect this year when £8 million of charges will be transferred from the Exchequer to the social insurance stamp.  This will bring the Exchequer share of overall social insurance expenditure a little below 20 per cent, but in absolute terms the Exchequer will still be paying more into the social insurance fund in 1976 than it did in 1975. Deduction of this £8 million from the Exchequer cost of the 10 per cent increase in benefits leaves a net amount of £3.4 million extra to be provided by the Exchequer for social welfare and related health allowances.  In addition, I have to provide £2 million for the cost to the Exchequer of the stamp increase.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deficit</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am now in a position to summarise the budgetary position.</P>
    <P>The opening current budget deficit was £433.1 million, to which was added £10.9 million for increased social welfare benefits and pay.  The cost to the Exchequer of additional tax relief for individuals and companies is £17 million, thereby raising the deficit further to £461 million.</P>
    <P>To finance part of this deficit, taxation is being increased by a gross <Col N="661" /> £124 million.  This is a further offset in respect of unspent balances of Exchequer issues which are in the hands of Departments at the end of the preceding year.  A provision of £10 million is included in this year's budgetary arithmetic.  When this item and increased taxation are deducted, the deficit is reduced to £327 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medium-term planning</i>
    </P>
    <P>Some months ago I announced that the preparation of a new medium-term economic and social programme was under way in my Department. This work is going ahead.  Two essential elements of the plan are crystal clear.  The first is the necessity of greater exports and, therefore, of ensuring that Irish industrial production becomes much more competitive at home and in overseas markets.  If we are to plan with reasonable certainty, the way ahead on incomes must be reasonably clear.  The second is the major allocation of resources that must be made to investment if we are to create jobs, not alone to reduce present unemployment, but to provide also for the increase in the work force that is in prospect in the years ahead.  This allocation will have to be on a scale beyond anything that has been achieved hitherto.</P>
    <P>Since 1972 net immigration, rather than net emigration, has characterised population movements into and out of the Republic.  Given zero net emigration for the future, current trends in births, deaths and marriage point to a rise in population to about 3.3 million by 1980 and a work force of about 1.18 million.  This means there will be another 50,000 people in the work force within five years.  It implies that, on the basis of some further reduction in the number of persons engaged in agriculture, and of certain hypotheses relating to the rate of job loss and prospects for employment in non-manufacturing industry and services, 155,000 new jobs would have to be created in manufacturing industry during 1976-80 and an overall increase in employment of 50,000 achieved, if employment opportunities are to be available to those seeking them, even without allowing for a fall in the <Col N="662" /> present unacceptable high rate of unemployment.</P>
    <P>An average of 31,000 new jobs per year in manufacturing industry presents a massive challenge.  Job creation on anything like this scale has never proved possible in the past. Between 1960 and 1974 the annual growth of the economy averaged 4 per cent, exports rose by 6½ per cent a year in real terms, and the industrial sector expanded at just over 6 per cent a year.  Nevertheless, over the same period, the total number of persons at work was virtually unchanged at just over 1.05 million, the number of persons leaving agricultural employment being almost enough to offset the increase of 139,000 in non-agricultural employment, an annual average of almost 9,900.</P>
    <P>The employment outturn in recent years has of course been less heartening. The Third Programme period, 1969-72, saw a decrease of 17,000 in overall employment compared with a target increase of 16,000.  More recently, between 1972 and 1975 estimated total employment fell by 10,000 as a result of declines in industrial and agricultural employment of 7,000 and 19,000, respectively, which more than offset the increase of 16,000 in employment in services.  New job creation in manufacturing industry, which was about 17,000 in 1972, compared with 7,600 in 1971, rose to 17,800 in 1973, but has fallen back since because of the current world recession.</P>
    <P>We obviously owe it to the young generation and to the unemployed to provide them with jobs, but experience to date, as this short review has shown, does not provide grounds for expecting that, even with a recovery from the present cyclical downturn, the level of job creation will be sufficient to provide employment for all those looking for it in the years ahead unless all past trends can be radically improved upon.</P>
    <P>These are the unvarnished facts from which there can be no running away.  But they should not be a cause for despondency.  We should be glad to have an expanding population and be willing to adopt the measures necessary to provide our young people with <Col N="663" /> jobs.  It is inescapable, however, that if we are to improve on the past there must be substantial changes in public policies and attitudes.  To meet our investment needs in the face of the limited resources likely to be available, especially if, as some people argue, further increases in taxation would be unacceptable, a major reappraisal of national aims and policies has to be carried out to allow the maximum diversion of expenditure towards increased employment.  This is the central task in preparing the national plan.</P>
    <P>The assessment of possibilities, the collection of the relevant data from national and international agencies and their evaluation in the light of national requirements are taking more time than had been earlier envisaged. The time taken is a reflection of the difficulties in planning that even the most expert and experienced authorities have in volatile economic circumstances. As soon as the work is done, the Government will be publishing a Green Paper which will present frankly the options open to the country over the next five years.  Within the framework thus provided, we will work to achieve national commitment to a plan for economic revival.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is a misconception that because a budget contains increases in taxation it is therefore necessarily deflationary. While the individual components of a budgetary package can, in isolation, be labelled &ldquo;expansionary&rdquo; or &ldquo;deflationary&rdquo;, these labels are merely of academic interest or make good debating points.  Of course, if disputation were the answer to economic problems, we would have none. Leaving aside the niceties of academic debate, it is the overall impact of the budget that matters: in other words, the total effect of the increases in current and capital expenditure, after account is taken of the offsetting influence of increased taxation.  The overall effect of this budget will be to stimulate economic activity and to raise the growth rate to 2 per cent and more as compared with the pre-budget forecast of less than 1 per cent. <Col N="664" /> By the end of the year, assuming the incomes pause is successful and the revival in export demand is by then getting into full swing, the growth rate could be higher than 2 per cent.  The result should be seen in a reduction of unemployment as economic recovery gets under way.</P>
    <P>Fiscal policy this year has to be concerned principally with guiding the country through and out of our current economic difficulties.  As our people know only too well, this is an abnormal situation, which demands an extraordinary effort on our part.  Each of us and all of us must contribute.</P>
    <P>Every criticism of excessive expenditure, if it expects a hearing, should be accompanied by a request for specific cuts.  Every protest against increased taxes ought to be coupled with an honest demand for an identifiable reduction in expenditure.  Every insistence on increased expenditure must be associated with the readiness to pay and a courageous identification of the additional taxes required to produce the revenue.  Any critic, in this House or outside it, of the Government's budgetary strategy ought in all fairness to &ldquo;hold his whist&rdquo; unless he is willing to state publicly his alternative proposals. For too long this country has suffered from the huge gap between popular demand for more State expenditure on a wide variety of laudable schemes and a general unwillingness to pay taxes to meet the cost of services glibly demanded.  Those days are over.  We will have to set about paying our own way.  Nobody else is going to support us in a standard of living which it is beyond our capacity to sustain.</P>
    <P>This budget is realistic as to our present difficulties and is equally realistic in its optimism as to our future prospects.  Our overriding need is confidence, confidence in the ability of this country to weather the economic storms and resume our progress to prosperity.  We are concerned with how we go from here, how fast and by what means.</P>
    <P>The immediate aims must be the conquering of inflation, increases in production of both industrial goods and agricultural products at competitive <Col N="665" /> prices and accompanying the fulfilment of those aims by substantial reductions in unemployment.  But the solution to our urgent difficulties and our long-term economic problems does not lie exclusively in the field of State financial policy or private investment. It lies as much in the minds and attitudes of our people.  First amongst those attitudes must be a frank realisation that fresh commitments cannot be undertaken by the State until the resources are produced to pay for them. Without thrift, enterprise and hard work we will never have sufficient resources. &ldquo;No policy can get more out <Col N="666" /> of a nation than there is in a nation&rdquo;, said Walter Bagehot with much truth.</P>
    <P>We need a new sense of national purpose based upon a calm decision of the kind of future we are prepared to work for, to make sacrifices for, to pay for because we want it so much for ourselves and our children.</P>
    <P>Our present difficulties may yet prove to be of benefit provided we have the wisdom to learn from experience.  If we accept the necessary disciplines and face our problems with courage, unselfishness and determination, we can overcome our problems and face the future with confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The chickens are coming home to roost; the bluff is being called.  A few hours ago when I looked out of a window in this House I saw a bleak and raw day outside and it was, perhaps, appropriate because what we have heard here today presages a bleak and a raw time for our people, inflicted on them as a direct consequence of the irresponsibility of those guilty men sitting over there.  Despite the homily at the end of the Minister's speech the fact is that having inflicted grievous burdens on many sections of our community, with a clear consequence of loss of jobs because of the marginal state of many industries and the infliction of additional taxes causing loss of jobs, and despite the deliberate fuelling of inflation in this budget, and all the other hardships that will flow from it, nevertheless what is happening is that the Minister for Finance is again allowing expenditure to rip and is borrowing even more money this year.  He has done this in spite of all his homilies, platitudes and pious statements at the end.</P>
      <P>This must be the most incompetent Government this country has ever been saddled with.  This is not my view of the situation only.  That message can be read clearly in the neutrally worded report, Quarterly Bulletin of the Central Bank of Ireland, for winter 1975.  In that report one finds the following:</P>
      <P>In 1975, for the first time in many years, there was a fall in national output, employment declined, unemployment rose to nearly 10 per cent of the workforce.</P>
      <P>Profits fell again in real terms, thus reducing industry's capacity even to maintain existing productive capital.</P>
      <P>For some years, foreign borrowing, apart from its contribution to external reserves, has given greater support to consumption than investment.</P>
      <P>The rate of inflation&mdash;11 per cent on average in 1973, 17 per cent in 1974, and 21 per cent in 1975&mdash; has been at or near the top of the European scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial exports have contracted <Col N="686" /> in volume, while imports of finished consumer goods have been displacing home products on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>New public sector borrowing, for current and capital purposes, has soared from £199 million in 1972-73 to £385 million in 1974 (nine months) and £733 million in 1975.</P>
    <P>Of course, since then unemployment has got worse, it is still rising, and the borrowing situation has sharply deteriorated again.  Those words of the Central Bank soberly describe the condition of our economy since this Government took office.  Of course, the Government will have us believe that they are not responsible.  We all remember that at first they blamed the Arabs and then they blamed the recession in world trade.  They later blamed all the other Governments in the world who did not reflate their economies fast enough for our whiz kids over there.  Of course, all the Governments are out of step except our Coalition.</P>
    <P>The truth is that compared with the performance of other Governments in the EEC, for instance, our Government's performance has been a dismal failure.  Proportionately, we have borrowed far in excess of our fellow EEC members but we have little or nothing to show for it. Our unemployment rises faster than elsewhere and our inflation is worse than all the others, with the exception of Britain.  This Government gambled foolishly and recklessly with the nation's resources and lost the gamble. It is not only they who lost; every man, woman and child in this country lost.  It is not as though there was nobody to tell them. We told them consistently what they were doing wrong and we told them consistently what the result would be but they were the right economic experts and they persisted in their folly until now we have our economy on its knees and saddled with a dead weight of debt repayment.</P>
    <P>Already in the Estimates it is shown there is an increase of £102 million in the cost of service of public debt this year, and now with what we <Col N="687" /> hear from the Minister we can add about another £70 million to that, making £172 million extra cost of servicing the public debt. The total amount of the net revenue expected by the Minister as a result of all the taxes announced today is £107 million; in other words, even with all that taxation we are not going near paying just the increase in the cost of servicing the public debt.  The consequence of this is that the room for manoeuvre which should be available is not available and it is getting increasingly less.</P>
    <P>Over the next five years £780 million will have to be borrowed merely to pay off loans which are already outstanding.  That is not counting what the Minister announced today.  Foreign borrowing is becoming an increasingly large proportion of the total amount of the Government's borrowing and the repayment cost of foreign borrowing is increased by approximately 20 per cent over the face value of what we borrowed as a result of adjustments in exchange rates.  That is quite apart from the loss of revenue involved in the fact that we do not get tax back on interest payments on foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>We have had for too long from this Government the pretence that the borrowing they have engaged in has been dictated by economic assessments rather than political expediency. I hope we will now have an end to that pretence.  After all, if this Government were starting today, in the same way as they did start when they took over from us with a budget which was in balance, does anybody over there suggest that they would come out with the kind of deficit the Minister is coming out with today?  I do not think even the present Minister for Finance would have the neck to suggest that. Quite clearly, they have, for political expedient reasons, allowed the situation to get worse and worse until they have lost control of it.  For years to come all of our people are going to suffer because of the reckless incompetence of those men who sit over there.</P>

      <P>One of the dangers here is that, having borrowed as they have, having lost control of the situation, there is an additional temptation now, because, for purely fortuitous reasons over which this Government have no control, in recent months money has been available for borrowing by the Government in a way that they could not have expected, and while it will not continue indefinitely it will continue for some little time. This adds to the temptation to the Government to get over their political difficulties by further borrowing.  Surely the Minister for Finance and his colleagues now recognise what we told them a long time ago, that a start must be made now in cutting back the deficit on the current budget.  Of course it cannot be tackled immediately.  The thing has now got out of hand, and if it were to be tackled in this year alone the resulting deflation and misery would be quite intolerable.  However, the road to solvency, the road to paying our own way, and the road to investing our borrowings in productive purposes that will bring about growth in our economy and employment for our people, must be started on now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the simplistic view propagated from those benches that the more you spend the greater the growth in the economy and the greater the expansion you get.  I hope that view is now thoroughly discredited.  Anybody who believed that that was true, although we told them it was not, has only to look at what has happened to see how untrue that is.  I said frequently in this House, and so did quite a number of my colleagues, that borrowing has to be related to the capacity of the economy to grow, and that if it is not so related it can, and in our case did, directly fuel inflation.  But similarly the amount of spending in <Col N="689" /> which a Government engages is not the only factor that has to be considered. There are other factors, in particular, the purposes for which money is spent, that is whether they are productive or non-productive.</P>
    <P>Timing is also very important.  A good example of the importance of time arises in relation to the subsidies and the tax cuts introduced last June. If that had been done as we advocated in the autumn of 1974 when we were urging it, the price level we have today would be about 6 to 8 per cent lower than it is and there would be about 10,000 more people in employment. The output and the spending of those people and the saving in social welfare payments now being made to them would all be helping to reduce the deficit with which the Minister is faced today.  Timing on the part of the Government there was hopeless, for whatever reason, whether it was just political prejudice, that they did not want to do it because we advocated it, or ignorance on their part, that they did not realise the consequences and that it took them nine months to get the message and eventually to act on it in June.  Whatever the reason, their timing cost approximately 10,000 people their jobs and has our cost of living 6 to 8 per cent higher than it should be.</P>
    <P>That whole incident is also an example of the incredible ineptitude of this Government.  God knows we cannot be accused of having an exaggerated idea of the competence of the members of this Government but even I was startled at the ineptitude of their handling of that whole situation in relation to subsidies and the tax got from the national pay agreement.  Having failed to take action in the autumn of 1974, as we urged them, they introduced a budget in January, 1975, and again failed to take action.  Knowing the national pay agreement was about to be negotiated they allowed it to be negotiated on the basis of that budget, a budget which increased the cost of living by four percentage points.  It was negotiated on that level and within six weeks, the Government came back with another budget reducing the cost of living by <Col N="690" /> four percentage points, back to square one again, and calling for a renegotiation of the national agreement.  Was there ever an example of greater incompetence on the part of any Government than that whole performance?</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Central Bank report, the quarterly bulletin for the winter of 1975.  On the occasion of the last budget in June I read into the record various quotations from speeches made by us over the whole period of this Government's term in office in order to put clearly and concisely on the record the picture which emerged.  We were telling the Government correctly what was happening and what they should do.  We were correctly foretelling what the outcome of their failure to take the proper action would be.  That outcome is with us now.</P>
    <P>There are on page 7 of the Central Bank report the following two sentences:</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the oil crisis was not recognised from the outset as an economic emergency requiring adjustment measures on the income and budgetary fronts. Failure to adopt restraints in time has aggravated the problem and made remedial action more difficult.</P>
    <P>On the first occasion of a budget following the oil crisis, the budget introduced on 3rd April, 1974, I referred to this at columns 1492 and 1493 of the Official Report.  I said:</P>
    <P>But it is his job, his responsibility, as Minister for Finance, to take the hard decisions and to protect the economy of this country.  That Minister and his colleagues have run away from their responsibilities.  They have not tried to prune Government expenditure or to apply taxation where appropriate to reduce this deficit to manageable proportions.  They have just run away from their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This again is very reminiscent of their predecessors in Coalition Governments&mdash;running away from their responsibilities.  The best estimates of the cost in this coming year to the <Col N="691" /> economy of the increased price of oil is that it will amount to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of GNP. That means that if we achieve a growth of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent there will be no increase whatever in the domestic standard of living.  The whole increase in growth will have to go to pay for the extra on oil.</P>
    <P>What should the stance of a Government be in circumstances like this?  Should they not be clearly seen to do everything possible to stimulate exports, because we can only pay for this by increased exports or running down our external reserves?  I noticed nothing in this Financial Statement which was designed to take that course, a course clearly required by the facts of our economy and of the world economy.</P>
    <P>One more proof, if proof were needed, is that we have been consistently referring the Government in economic debates here to the realities of the situation and the Government have consistently ignored these realities.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to a very bland statement in the Capital Programme issued by the Minister for Finance this year.  At page 5 there is the following in regard to monetary policy:</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the current budget and monetary policy, it has a substantial influence on growth, the trend of demand and the maintenance of employment.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note what the Central Bank says in regard to the monetary policy of this Government. It says at page 8:</P>
    <P>Amongst the consequences of recent trends in money incomes and public finance has been an excessive increase in the money supplied. The budgetary deficits on current and capital account have led to the borrowing of very large amounts from the domestic banking system and from abroad.  These borrowings contribute directly to the money supplied and are of such proportions as to render monetary policy impotent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> According to the Central Bank, we have no monetary policy and are unable to have it because of the size of the deficits the Minister has indulged in.  Despite that the Minister blandly tells us in the Capital Programme that monetary policy in conjunction with the current budget has a substantial influence on growth, on the trend of demand and on the maintenance of employment.</P>
    <P>The major issue arising in connection with this budget and the Government's performance is the question of unemployment and what is being done about that unemployment. What are the Government doing to solve this problem?  We have heard from the Minister for Finance consistently in regard to every budget he has introduced and on any other occasion on which he got the chance to say so that the measures the Government were taking were aimed at protecting employment.  That is what he said.  But unemployment is going up and up.  It is now over 117,000 and still rising.  In the Capital Programme issued this year there are some very interesting things on page 6 in that regard:</P>
    <P>As part of the June supplementary budget the Government gave a further stimulus to employment and to demand generally by adding almost £28 million to the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>In the next paragraph we read:</P>
    <P>Actual expenditure on the Public Capital Programme in 1975 was £22.5 million less than the revised budget estimate...</P>
    <P>In other words, they put up £28 million as a further stimulus to employment and demand and they did not spend £22.5 million of it.  Even more interesting is the reference in paragraph 7 of the Capital Programme to the fact&mdash;they are talking about the Capital Programme for 1976&mdash;that:</P>
    <P>In determining both the size and composition of the Public Capital Programme for 1976 the Government have given first priority to investment which will increase the output of competitive goods and <Col N="693" /> services and thus provide for growth in permanent employment.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  Further on in the same paragraph and in more detail on page 23 we find a provision for transport.  It is an increase of over 82 per cent, one of the highest, if not the highest, provisions in this public capital programme.  Eighty per cent of that increase is going for £10.14 million in respect of instalment payments on two bulk carriers. Where is the permanent employment that is being achieved by the public capital programme being provided for £10.14 million?  The Minister knows that wherever it is it is not in Ireland.  The major test of the performance of a government is the success or failure of their policy in regard to employment and, on that test, this Government are failing more miserably year after year.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of controversy recently in regard to the Irish Life Assurance Company.  We have had some controversy also about shipping but there was not so much about it.  I understand the total amount being spent on ships in Japan is about £14 million, perhaps in excess of that.  It is being provided for by the Exchequer in the public capital programme and it is being supported by all those Deputies over there.</P>
    <P>Ministers and Deputies have become very vocal about the Irish Life Assurance Company.  It is an important issue and the money involved is £200,000 but I have not heard any of the Ministers and Deputies who were so concerned being vocal about the expenditure of more than £14 million from the Exchequer for the creation of employment in Japan.  There is some difference in standards for a reason that is not very clear.</P>
    <P>There have been other examples besides those I have mentioned of the failure to use the purchasing power of the State in supporting Irish industry and Irish workers.  I suggest there is an obligation to do so within the limits of our international obligations.  It is necessary in carrying out this duty to recognise that <Col N="694" /> the cheapest tender price is not the answer to the problem.  That is much too simplistic a view.  Leaving aside the social effects of unemployment and measuring it purely in monetary and economic terms, other factors should be taken into account, such as the cost of social welfare payments, redundancy payments, pay-related benefits, the loss of output and the loss of skills involved.  I suggest that any realistic assessment of the situation should take this into account.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that the example in this regard should come from the Government.  There has been too much of an effort by members of the Government to blame the boards of State companies when the fault lies with the Government, individually and collectively.  If the Government were giving the right example, these things would not happen.  In case anyone thinks I am exaggerating, let me point out that we have information that will be developed later in regard to activities by Government Departments, not merely by State boards, in this connection.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote briefly from a reply I received from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to a question I put to him in this House on 16th December, 1975.  It is reported in the Official Report of that date at column 1583.  The question I put to him related to the award of the contract for the printing of the telephone directory. There were two Irish firms concerned and, having referred to this fact the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Employment content was not, therefore, a factor in the award of the contract and I am not in a position to say what will be the effect on employment of the transfer of the work in question from one Irish firm to another.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the attitude of the Minister, that of employment content not being a factor in the award of a contract; he waxed quite indignant when I questioned him on it.  I suggest that employment content should be a factor in the award of every contract by this Government and by the bodies under their control, in particular at this time of crisis in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very strange because they have been doing it for some years, apparently to the satisfaction of the Minister.  They also happen to operate in my constituency, not abroad.  At any rate, I put it to the Minister that at a time when there are 117,000 unemployed with the numbers rising, there is a particular obligation on the Minister and on his colleagues to take the employment content into account when considering any tender.  If that is done by the Government, they will have no problems with the boards of State bodies.  They will get the message very quickly if the Government give the example. The Government will be in a better position to exercise any pressure they consider necessary and advisable if they are not guilty of the very thing of which they are accusing State boards.</P>
      <P>With unemployment as high as it is, with the necessity to stimulate employment and, at the same time, not to add to the enormous deficit we are facing, I am well aware of the difficulties that arise in that respect.  I have pointed out already, and I wish to reiterate it now, that much of the deficit which is causing the difficulty is being spent on unproductive purposes, which is not creating growth that will produce employment.  We have an emergency situation with regard to unemployment and I suggest it is time for some imaginative and even unorthodox methods to be adopted in tackling the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> In a newspaper article published today, I have given a few examples of what might be done.  One in particular relates to the construction industry where there are more than 20,000 unemployed. This is a labour-intensive industry, the products of which are almost entirely produced at home. There are other examples&mdash;I mentioned the inflation-linked mortgages in the article.  There is also another aspect.  In the 117,000 unemployed very few school-leavers and young people are included.  Most of them are not on the live register for various reasons but their numbers are very substantial.  If one considers the demoralisation that is involved for young people when they are unable to get employment and with no prospects of a job, one must agree that special urgent, perhaps unorthodox, measures are needed.  I want to put to the Minister for Finance that it would not at all have been out of place to have him announce today that he intended to devote a reasonable amount of money to the provision of employment for the young people.  I am aware that if one sets out, for instance, to create employment schemes for young people of the kind that are most easily got going fast one can easily find that a great deal of the cost of the scheme would be absorbed in its administration. It is not beyond the reaches of our imagination to create schemes for such matters as the provision of recreational and community amenities and such schemes could be admin-the various voluntary organisations throughout the country, especially those concerned with youth.  I believe many of these organisations would be only too glad to do this, even for nothing, and that the supervision that would be required on the part of the State would be minimal and the administrative costs would therefore, be very little.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, as strongly as I can, even at this stage to approach this problem in this kind of way, or any other way he can produce that will get results and get young people and school leavers to work, give them a chance to do something worthwhile and constructive for the community <Col N="697" /> and not leave them to rot and be demoralised, as is happening at present. I believe a relatively small amount of money would go a very long way if the problem were approached in this way.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the whole borrowing situation has got out of control so far as the Government are concerned but there is an even worse aspect of the matter.  This time last year the Minister for Finance calculated that there would be a deficit on the budget of £125 million.  The actual deficit on the current budget was £259 million.  On that basis, if we take the deficit the Minister envisaged today, there is every chance that this time next year that deficit will be £654 million.  What guarantee have we got that he will not be as wrong this year as he was last year? It is legitimate to ask how can one be as wrong as that in a deficit, over 100 per cent error in the calculation of a deficit?  It suggests either, as I said on a previous occasion the Government are cooking the books or they have not a clue about what is happening; they have lost control totally.  It is utterly incredible that any Government could be so wrong in their calculations for one year in respect of a deficit. I find it impossible to understand how such a thing could occur.</P>
    <P>We have heard today announcements from the Minister about changes in the scheme of what is commonly called the farmers' dole.  I must confess, as I listened to the Minister, I looked up to the benches over there where a new young Deputy, Deputy Enda Kenny, a nice decent young man, was sitting. I thought to myself that this young man is learning very fast about the cynicism of his colleagues.  He is the one who has to go back to west Mayo and explain to his constituents that Fianna Fáil were right in the by-election when they said that the Government are putting social welfare at risk. They are borrowing so fast that they will not be able to pay and they cannot go on borrowing to pay for social welfare.  Of course, we were pooh-poohed but now Deputy Kenny has to go back and explain it.  I would rather him than me.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a fleeting reference to equal pay.  All I want to say in that regard is that I am looking forward with eager anticipation to see the stance to be adopted by those warriors for equal rights, equal treatment between men and women, Deputy Barry Desmond, Deputy Eileen Desmond, Deputy John O'Connell, Deputy David Thornley and Uncle Tom Cobley and all.  They can wriggle any way they like but the test is do they support the amendment of the 1974 Act or do they not?  No smokescreen will change the issue for them.  That is their test and we will watch with interest how they approach it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made changes in regard to income tax.  He appears to be retaining the temporary 10 per cent surcharge he put on last year. It reminds me of the fact that it was only some time during my period as Minister for Finance that income tax became permanent.  It was introduced in the last century as a temporary measure.  It looks a bit ominous for that 10 per cent surcharge.  I notice also that the increases in the personal allowances, which the Minister proposes, at a quick calculation seem to range somewhere between 2 per cent and 10 per cent, a long way from the inflation rates we have been having and not having any regard to the fact that he is already behind in allowances for inflation.  There are changes in the VAT rates, on petrol and motor vehicle duties, some of which are savage impositions.  I do not believe many people will realise for some time just <Col N="699" /> how savage they are.  All of these are inflationary and all of them will cause more unemployment.  There should be no illusion on anybody's part in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister interrupted me a little while ago in regard to the contract for the printing of the telephone directory. I want to remind him of a fact that I overlooked, that is that the firm concerned employ 270 people, that they have been doing this telephone printing contract for, I understand, 40 years and that they are now in receivership almost certainly as a consequence of what happened to that contract.  It appears it will result in the loss of all the 270 jobs.  I would like the Minister to know that.</P>
    <P>The Minister used a sentence in his budget speech which he has used before in the House.  He said:</P>
    <P>My ultimate aim is that people with equivalent incomes should pay equivalent tax.</P>
    <P>That seems a reasonable proposition on its face but I pointed out to him before that if by the word &ldquo;people&rdquo; he is including companies what he is saying is that he is going to get rid of export tax relief.  When I said that before the Minister bridled and denied it.  He has repeated that sentence again and I want to put it to him that if he means to get rid of export tax relief he should say so.  If he does not mean it, he should not use high sounding phrases like this which mean that he is going to get rid of export tax relief.  This matter is much too serious to be left up in the air in that way.  Clearly, if you are going to treat people with equivalent incomes in an equivalent way and make them pay equivalent tax, a company which is not exporting and which has the same income as a company which is exporting should pay the same tax.  It is as simple as that.  If the Minister does not mean that he should not say this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I notice that the amendments the Minister announced in regard to social welfare benefits paid to the unemployed appear to be confining the <Col N="700" /> total benefits to 85 per cent of the pre-loss of job earnings and that that 85 per cent payment will be subject to full assessment for the purpose of differential rents.  This could be very severe in some cases.  One can easily visualise cases in which, say, the firm was going down and the person concerned had very low earnings before he finally lost his job.  If he is to be restricted to 85 per cent of those low earnings, some very serious problems will arise.  I urge the Minister to have that matter looked into very carefully before it is implemented.</P>

      <P>The increase in the cost of petrol would appear to be either 13.65p per gallon or 12.65p per gallon. There appears to be a contradiction in what the Minister said, but no doubt we will find out on the Financial Resolution precisely what is involved. This is a most savage imposition and will have the most serious consequences on many businesses. There is an aspect of this which we on this side pointed out before when the Minister was applying terrible increases on petrol&mdash;and he is doing it again now.  Do the Minister and his <Col N="701" /> colleagues not know that there are many parts of this country which are not served by public transport and that there are people who are obliged, unless they are to use a push-bike, to use petrol?  Would he bear in mind when he is gaily adding enormous sums of tax to the gallon of petrol that he is putting it on to the essential costs of many people living in different parts of this country?  If he realises that, it is not good enough for those people.  This will not be reflected in the consumer price index nor in the Minister's specially concocted consumer price index.  Neither will reflect the fact that for these people this is an essential cost.</P>
      <P>In a period of approximately 12 or 18 months the Minister must have nearly doubled the duty on petrol and he does not seem to care what the consequences are.  I want to reiterate the view from this side of the House that this Government are progressively mismanaging the affairs of this country to a most serious extent, which is getting close to the irretrievable, and that the consequences of what we have heard today will be extremely serious for many individuals and for our economy. I do not deny that quite heavy taxation was almost inevitable but that is because of what the Minister and his colleagues have been doing in the past and because of their refusal to recognise the truths of what we were telling them.</P>
      <P>As I said, they have let it go until it is almost too late and we get this kind of budget which is hurting so many people.  It will put many thousands of people out of work.  I hope the Minister is under no illusions in that regard.  If he is, he will soon find out.  That is a fact.  It will also increase the cost of living with all the consequences that follow from that.  As I pointed out earlier, it still leaves us borrowing enormous sums which are eating up the revenue which should be available to the Government to pay off the debt with virtually nothing to show for this borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest, even at this late stage, that what is needed is honesty with our people, a firm grip on our <Col N="702" /> economy and a willingness to take responsibility, not blaming other people for what is going wrong; not blaming the Arabs or foreign countries or boards of State bodies. The buck stops there.  You either accept it or get out, but do not try to get out from under.  The Ministers and the Taoiseach are responsible. Let them accept their responsibility like men and defend their position.  If they cannot do the job, they know what to do.  Do not go on making the situation worse and blaming everybody else in sight. Let the people know the real truth of our situation.  Rely on our people. If they are given a credible lead they will follow.</P>
    <P>We must create a climate here for enterprise, which this Government have been killing.  There is no hope for our economy unless the private sector can be got to expand, and expand fast.  That is not to say that the public sector has not got a very large role to play.  Of course it has. Nobody with any sense of reality can expect the public sector, certainly in the short-term, to provide any answer to the pressing problems of unemployment which we are facing. You can get a very fast response and make a very great impact on the problem of unemployment if you let the private sector go, if you do not try to hold it back or try to kill it with the kind of tax climate this Government are producing.  Let us reward enterprise.  Let those who make profits pay their fair share of tax but do not create the impression that to make a profit is something one should feel guilty about.  In this day and age particularly, anybody who can make a profit deserves to be encouraged and cossetted by any Government.</P>
    <P>This Government are not inspiring our people in any way.  Our people need determined leadership.  They need to have goals set in front of them which are attainable but which can be attained only by hard work by our people and by our Government.</P>
    <P>For too long we have been urging the Minister to produce an economic plan or programme.  It will not be <Col N="703" /> forgotten that the Minister was scornful of the whole idea for a long time. Then somebody twisted his arm and he made hesitant noises about it.  In due course he said: &ldquo;Yes, we must have one&rdquo; and, of course, with his usual form it will be the panacea for all our ills when he produces it, if he ever does.  He told us we would have it by the end of 1975.  We have not got it yet and, according to what he said today, it will be a long time yet before we get it.  It is another broken Coalition promise.</P>
    <P>This country needs that plan or that programme.  How can you expect to get the various sectors of our society to work together to see where we, as a community, are going and how we are to get there?  How can we expect them to do that in the confused situation we are in today, if they have no targets or no programme and are just operating from day to day as the Government have been doing up to now? That economic plan is long overdue. It is not a matter to be left until it goes through one sub-committee and another, the reports are co-ordinated and they finally reach the Minister, and then they are circulated to all Departments, and so on.</P>
    <P>The country cannot afford that kind of delay in relation to a medium term economic plan.  I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister to put their boot down on the accelerator in regard to that plan and get it out fast.  Even if it is defective, let us get something to work to.  At the moment the country is going around in circles and in a fog of confusion largely contributed to by the Government.  Let us try to get some kind of order into our economic efforts.  That is a most important step.</P>
    <P>Twice in the past the Fianna Fáil Party had to clear up the mess left by previous Coalition Governments, and those messes were pretty bad. They are as nothing to the mess already created by this Coalition Government. We in Fianna Fáil can clear up that mess.  If the Government persist in going on as they have been going up to now, and as they look like going from today's announcements, <Col N="704" /> it may be that the time will be reached when nobody will be able to clear up the mess.  I mean that quite seriously.  That being so, I urge the Government for Ireland's sake, before it is too late, to get out.</P>

      <P>(1)  That in this Resolution &ldquo;the Order of 1975&rdquo; means the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975).</P>
      <P>(2)  That the duty of excise on beer imposed by paragraph 7 (1) of the Order of 1975 shall be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 29th day of January, 1976, at the rate of £60.595 for, in the case of all beer brewed within the State, every thirty-six gallons of worts of a specific gravity of 1,055 degrees, and, in the case of all imported beer, every thirty-six gallons of beer of which the worts were before fermentation of a specific gravity of 1,055 degrees in lieu of the rate mentioned in the said paragraph 7 (1).</P>
      <P>(3)  That the drawback on beer provided for in paragraph 7 (3) of the Order of 1975 shall, as on and from the 29th day of January, 1976, be calculated according to the original specific gravity of the beer at the rate of £60.608 on every thirty-six gallons of beer of which the original specific gravity was 1,055 degrees in lieu of the rate mentioned in the said paragraph 7 (3).</P>
      <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance about this <Col N="705" /> resolution.  It seems to me that its effect is to increase the retail price of beer by 5p a pint.  I want the Minister to confirm that the corresponding increase in the price of a glass of whiskey is 5p.  A rough calculation seems to indicate that the increased rate of duty he is now imposing on beer is twice the increased rate on spirits.  I should like the Minister to indicate if that is so.</P>
      <P>Secondly, what is the philosophy, the thinking, behind that approach? Spirits are traditionally the drink of the better-off classes.  They are being let off lightly and the duty on beer is being increased by twice the amount of the increase on spirits.  Beer is the stable drink of the ordinary working man.  It seems to me that this is a complete reversal of budgetary tradition here.  Normally if it was necessary to increase the duty on drink of any sort, Ministers for Finance put a far heavier imposition on spirits, because of the capacity of people who drink spirits to pay, than on beer, the drink of the ordinary working-class person. On a quick calculation it seems to me that the increase which the Minister is putting on beer is twice the increase he is putting on spirits.  That does not seem to me to make sense.  Perhaps the Minister would explain if I am right and, if so, what is his approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In stating the amounts of money the Deputy is correct but he well knows the reason why.  He sees that a duty of 5p on beer produces revenue of £19 million whereas a duty of 5p on whiskey produces only £7 million.  He might say: &ldquo;Why not put 10p on whiskey?&rdquo; Even an increase of 10p on whiskey would not yield £14 million.  It is estimated to yield in or about £12 million or £13 million.  If you try to take money off beer and load it onto spirits, the amount you have to put on spirits becomes so prohibitive that you quickly reach the point of diminishing revenue rather than increasing revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These increases have been very carefully tailored to a point at which there is unlikely to be a reduction in <Col N="706" /> consumption and, therefore, the greatest possible revenue return.  It is not a simple matter to switch from the popular drink to the unpopular.  If the Deputy's argument is to be carried to its logical conclusion, then all the additions on alcohol should be put on wine.  The Deputy knows well that the net effect of that would probably be that you would kill the consumption of wine and end up with a negligible return in revenue.  The figures have been very carefully balanced to ensure that in relation to the drinking habits of the community, and the amount spent by the community, the greatest possible revenue will materialise with the least possible personal disadvantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I support what Deputy Haughey said.  This is the first time since I came into this House that I have ever seen any Minister for Finance take this course.  Up to eight or ten years ago the emphasis was always placed on additional taxation on spirits and lesser taxation on beer.  In latter years the taxation was about equal.  If 2p or 3p went on beer a proportionate amount would go on spirits.  Here we have a most unusual situation where the Minister has come down heavily on the section of the community who are least capable of paying.  I am speaking of old-age pensioners, the unemployed and people like that.  They partake more of beer than of spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is placing double the amount of taxation on the unit as it is bought, the pint or the half glass of whiskey.  He is placing twice as much increased taxation on beer as he is on spirits.  Before this year is out, the Minister will see a considerable decline in the consumption of beer. Just imagine the effect an increase of five new pennies will have at this time.  This is bound to create a downturn in consumption.  I cannot understand the Minister introducing this type of taxation.  There is no doubt that the people he is hitting are the old age pensioners, the unemployed, people in the lower income bracket. If they were compensated by the additional moneys the Minister is giving <Col N="707" /> to social welfare, I could understand it but with the meagre increase in social welfare and the restrictions he is introducing to deprive some people of social welfare benefit, I believe this taxation is most undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter to which Deputy Colley has adverted in his statement.  It is not clear from the Minister's budget statement what precisely is the position in regard to the new rate of VAT on beer.  I just mention beer because we are dealing with that in the resolution, but it applies to spirits, petrol and so on.  In one part of the Minister's statement he says:</P>
      <P>... The new 10 per cent rate of VAT will apply from 1st March, 1976, to the increased prices for spirits, beer, tobacco, wine and petrol arising from the proposed excise changes which I shall come to presently....</P>
      <P>In another part of it he says:</P>
      <P>... When VAT at the present rate is included, the retail price of a glass of spirits will increase by 5p....</P>
      <P>Then he says about beer:</P>
      <P>... When VAT at the present rate is included, the retail price of a pint of beer of average gravity will increase by 5p....</P>
      <P>In one case he is indicating that when VAT at the present rate is included there will be a 5p increase and in another case he says that the new 10 per cent will apply on the new prices after the excise changes have been made.</P>

      <P>The relevance of these remarks to Resolution No. 1 is not clear to me.  I shall now deal with the questions, and if the Deputies opposite want a civil answer, I suggest they put their questions in a civil way. The result of Financial Resolution No. 1 is that with effect from tonight the retail price of a pint of beer rises from 28p to 33p.  The excise content rises from 10.62p to 15.30p.  The consequent increase in VAT as a result of the increase in the price is .32p. Another Financial Resolution, in accordance with what was said in the budget, which increases the rate of VAT from 6.75 to 10 per cent with effect from March, means, subject to the appropriate order being made, the price of a pint of beer will be then 34p, the excise content 15.30p and the VAT content 3.09p.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the arrangements he made this year about restricting withdrawals from bond in the pre-Christmas period caused severe dislocation of normal trade and subjected a lot of people to considerable inconvenience and difficulty. We had the absurd situation <Col N="717" /> where the ordinary consumer often found grave difficulty in getting reasonable supplies for Christmas from his normal supplier.  Would the Minister take note of this fact and the next time he is going to impose these savage and devastating increases on beer and spirits would he try to make some more civilised arrangements where his purposes can be achieved without causing this serious dislocation, inconvenience and hardship on so many people?</P>

      <P>One of Deputy Haughey's more memorable phrases was that the old reliables came up smiling.  There were as many smiles around last Christmas as ever in relation to the consumption of the old reliables and, possibly, a certain amount of private stockpiling having <Col N="718" /> regard to possible increases that might follow in the budget.  In truth, the Revenue Commissioners, in the application of the order, had regard to what were the normal withdrawals by the trade in the Christmas season. It was not restricted in relation to any particular week, taking the annual consumption.  They had regard to the normal withdrawals for the Christmas trade</P>

The duty increases in this Financial Resolution will advance the duty element on hard-pressed and other pipe tobacco by amounts varying from 3.2 to 3.7 pence per ounce which, taking account of that, should result in retail price increases between 3½ pence and 4 pence per ounce.

    <P>(12)  That whenever the Minister for Finance so thinks proper, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, authorise any person to <Col N="734" /> import or take delivery from the premises of a manufacturer of gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form or from a bonded warehouse of any goods liable to the duty of excise imposed by paragraph (10) of this Resolution without payment of that duty.</P>

    <P>(14)  That the Revenue Commissioners may, if they so think fit, allow any goods which are liable to the duty of excise imposed by paragraph (10) of this Resolution to be warehoused without payment of the said duty, and may, if and so far as they so think proper, remit duty on any deficiency arising in goods so warehoused where they are satisfied that no part of such deficiency was caused by illegal or improper means.</P>

    <P>(16)  That paragraph 17 of the Order of 1975 shall, with any necessary modifications, apply as on and from the 29th day of January, 1976, in relation to the duty of excise imposed by paragraph (10) of this Resolution as it applies to the duties imposed by that Order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> (17)  That section 15 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972), be construed, as on and from the 29th day of January, 1976, as if the references to excise duty (inserted by the Order of 1975) included a reference to the excise duty imposed by paragraph (10) of this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(18)  (a)  That subject to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, the provisions of the Customs Acts and of any instrument relating to duties of customs made under statute, and not otherwise applied by this Resolution, shall, with any necessary modifications, as on and from the 29th day of January, 1976, apply in relation to the duty of excise imposed by paragraph (10) of this Resolution on goods imported into the State as they apply in relation to duties of customs.</P>

    <P>(b)  That where, in relation to the duty of excise imposed by paragraph (10) of this Resolution, there is a provision in this Resolution <Col N="736" /> corresponding to a provision of the Statutes which relate to the duties of excise or of any instrument relating to the duties of excise made under statute, the latter provision shall not apply in relation to that duty of excise.</P>
    <P>(20)  That this Resolution, so far as it relates to the duty of excise on imported goods imposed by paragraph (10) of this Resolution, shall be construed together with the Customs Acts and any instrument relating to the customs made under statute and, so far as it relates to the said duty of excise on goods made in the State, shall be construed together with the Statutes which relate to the duties of excise and the management of those duties and any instrument relating to the duties of excise and the management of those duties made under statute.</P>
    <P>(21)  That the provisions of Regulations 3 to 19 and 21 to 39 of the Hydrocarbon Oil Regulations, 1941 (S.R. &amp; O.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>From tomorrow morning petrol will increase by 10p <Col N="737" /> per gallon but from the 1st March, as I understand it because of the VAT increase from 6.75 per cent to 10 per cent petrol will increase by a further 3p.  Therefore, the total increase is 13p per gallon.  I would like to have this clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated it will be 12½p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase is 10p from tomorrow and 3.25 per cent from 1st March.  On a quick calculation that would be 2.7p or 2.8p on the new price from tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I have are that pre-budget it was a total of 75.7p, post-budget it is 85.7p and the increase in VAT on 1st March brings it up to 88.3p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is 13p to the nearest penny.  Does the Taoiseach realise that the people who will be hit by this are the working people throughout most parts of Ireland who are obliged to use their cars to go to and from work as public transport is not available to them.  Those are not the weekend car users.  They are working people and an increase of 13p per gallon with a possibility of the retailers looking for a further increase means that we are at the 90p per gallon and must be the dearest in Europe with the exception of France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate increases here.  There is an increase of 2p in the hydrocarbon oil. Does this apply to all oils used in industry, all oils used in heating factory floors?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that this is a very severe imposition on industry that is so badly hit already?  Does he not further agree that the imposition of the petrol increase will not only hit the workers very severely but will also affect distribution costs on essential commodities like milk, bread and other such commodities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach not further agree that because of this crushing taxation which has now been imposed on petrol in particular it will create a very severe hardship on the motor industry?  Does he not realise the problems it can create for companies <Col N="738" /> like Fords of Cork or is he and the Minister for Finance determined to kill the motor industry in the country and to ground down the motorists? This seems to be the pattern since November, 1973.  Did the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance not consider these very important things before bringing in this desperate imposition?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with everything that has been said in relation to the entire spectrum I would like to ask the Taoiseach a question. Is he aware that there are a large number of small commercial travellers who have been hit by VAT since the change in Government?  I refer to working people, not those driving company cars, who have built up a small income to rear their families.  They will be very severely hit by the imposition of this Financial Resolution and also by Financial Resolution No. 7?  Those resolutions will put many of them with their backs to the wall.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of those people, who have built up small businesses of their own, will now be unable to keep them going.  They will have to surrender their businesses to the large combines who can afford, because of their international status, to pay this large increase.  In their case the cost will be passed on to the distributor, something the small man cannot do.  Will the Taoiseach consider, maybe on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, giving some exemption to people engaged in this small way to which I have referred?  I must refer to this because, as a member of the Irish Commercial Travellers' Federation, I am aware of the problems of those people and their plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate points.  In relation to the point raised by Deputy Fitzgerald dutiable diesel is unaffected by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that there are two different types of diesel.  Is all diesel excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In relation to Deputy Lemass's point, a person so affected is entitled to offset expenses <Col N="739" /> of that sort against his income tax assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the increase in petrol to 90p does the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance realise that this is imposing a further £1.00 per week taxation on workers who are obliged to use their cars?  It is the equivalent in most cases of another £1 direct taxation on the people who are still working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>This will affect builders' labourers who are lucky enough to have jobs and have to travel to work.  They are not allowed offset this increase against any travelling costs in their income tax while commercial travellers can.  Does the Taoiseach feel this is right and proper?  Will he give us a breakdown on the gallon of petrol as it will be next March when the 13p extra is added?  How much will go to the Exchequer, as profit to the retailers and to the other elements which go to make up the price of a gallon of petrol?  We blamed the oil producing countries for most of our ills when they increased the price of petrol. When they look around and see the profit we make out of their work by the taxation we charge, does the Taoiseach not think that he will outdo the harm done to our economy by the oil producing companies with this budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty pre-budget was 34.05p, the trade 36.86p and VAT 4.79, making a total of 75.7p.  Post-budget duty will be 43.41p, trade 36.86p and VAT 5.42p, making a total of 85.7p.  As I mentioned, after March VAT will increase to 8.00p bringing it to 88.3p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, the Taoiseach said the type of person to whom I am referring can claim compensation in his income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The builder's labourer is not and he is typical of many workers throughout the country who have to travel more than ten miles a day to and from work.  Is the Minister aware that for such a man driving a ten horse power car and locking it up at the weekend&mdash;in other words he never uses it for any other purpose than going to and from work &mdash;the effect of this provision, plus the increase in the motor tax announced today will mean an increase of £2 a week for him?</P>

If diesel oil is not covered, would he indicate oils for what purposes are covered in the 2p per gallon increase?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say which of the two things underlies this heavy imposition on petrol and fuel added to other increases?  Is it that the Government are trying to reduce the consumption of fuel, or merely want to increase their outturn in revenue? I am asking that seriously and not in any facetious way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A combination of both.  Mainly to get revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In their various calculations, but specifically in regard to petrol and the increased taxation on vehicles, did the Government take fully into account that the great number of cars used for essential purposes are not under eight horse power.  They are the larger consumers of petrol and they will be taxed more heavily as a result of their greater horse power or c.c. capacity.  They may not have taken that into account and they may be working on the basis that the heavier car is entitled to pay more in all respects.  The 10, 12, 14 and 15 horse power range is more likely to be the car used by those who must have a car for their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The 14 or 16 horse power car is liable to be using twice as much fuel as an eight horse power. <Col N="744" /> I am asking the Taoiseach whether the Government gave due consideration to what I believe to be the likelihood that cars which are essential for business are more likely to be of a capacity greater than eight horse power, using more petrol and, therefore, carrying a greater impact.  Cars under eight horse power are more likely to be cars that could be done without or second cars in a household.</P>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate what effect the reduction of the 36.75 per cent to the 35 per cent rate in respect of motor cars and motor cycles will have?  This is a sop to the harrassed motorist who will suffer under Resolution No. 5 which has just been passed and the resolution to be next debated, No. 7.  Having regard to the savage increase in the cost of motoring, it seems to me that the reduction from 36.75 per cent to 35 per cent is noticeable because few, if any, new cars, or even secondhand cars, and motor cycles will be bought as a result of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are liable to tax at two levels.  The 36.75 rate applies to sales by manufacturers and to importations by non-manufacturers. Sales by non-manufacturers, such as retailers, are liable at only 6.75 per cent.  On the other hand the same traders are allowed deduct only 6.75 of the 36.75 charged them by manufacturers of paid for imports.  The result is that these goods suffer at the effective rate of 30 per cent on the manufacture or import price and 6.75 on retail price.  On motor cars and motor cycles the equivalent rate for March will be 35 per cent payable on sales from manufacturers and on importations by non-manufacturers, 10 per cent on sales by non-manufactturers with import tax deduction limited to 10 per cent.  The effective tax, therefore, will be 25 per cent on the manufacturer on import price, and 10 per cent on the retail price, which makes it 35 per cent.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that these increases apply to things like schoolbooks, on which, by the way, there was a very strong case being made in many quarters for the abolition of VAT, and all sorts of household necessities like furniture, furnishings, cleaning materials, haberdashery, electrical and kitchen equipment, the rated value of all these things is being considerably increased. Could the Taoiseach relate these increases to the reduction in VAT which was effected by the Minister <Col N="754" /> for Finance in his second budget last year?  Could he give us an estimate as to how the sum of money which these increases will bring in would relate to the sum of money which was foregone by the Minister for Finance in that budget?  Would I be right in suspecting that the increases now being made will more than counteract reductions which were made with such a flourish last June?  To that extent the Minister is, in effect, really cancelling out the reductions which he made last June in a frantic endeavour to reduce the cost of living. In this budget he is putting more VAT back on than was taken off at that time.  Is this not simply a ridiculous merry-go-round sort of exercise to take VAT off in June of one year in pursuance of a certain economic employment policy, and then to put it all back on again, and more, the following January?</P>

      <P>Two questions, please, if I may.  One refers to the increase from 19.5 per cent to 20 per cent on sports equipment.  I understand very strong representations were made to the Taoiseach in regard to juveniles' hurleys.  Has any consideration been given in relation to the increase of VAT on juveniles' hurleys?  Through the aegis of the Department of Education a grant is given for the promotion of juvenile hurling but that grant is only a small fraction of the amount of VAT collected on juveniles' hurleys. In order to promote a healthy interesting game for young people may I ask the Taoiseach if he would even now consider including hurleys, which are made from material produced in our own country and which are made in our own country, for exemption from VAT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question refers to a change in relation to VAT in the case of fur clothing, from a zero rating to 20 per cent.  I welcome that change. I am very sorry that Deputy Reynolds is not here to support me in this matter.  Last year in the debate on the financial resolutions I specifically asked the Minister for Finance a question in relation to blankets. Blankets will now be charged at 20 per cent VAT.  Certain items of clothing were excluded last year and the Minister for Finance went to great pains to explain to me how it was not possible to change the headings under <Col N="756" /> which blankets appear.  The Minister has changed the VAT rating on fur clothing in this budget.  I welcome that change.  Yet, he has not reduced the tax on blankets.  The elimination of the tax on blankets would be a great incentive to the Dripsey Woollen Mills in Cork and to the Foxford factory in Mayo and I am sure to other factories.</P>

      <P>There are two points I want to put to the Taoiseach.  The first is in relation to the imposition of 10 per cent on dances.  Down through the years cases have been made to successive Ministers for Finance, at least since the dance tax became operative, that genuine céili dances might be omitted.  There are a very few people around the country who organise purely céili dances, largely for cultural motives.  They find it impossible because of the imposition of this tax to maintain attendances at them.  There is a good case for excluding genuine céili dances from this tax.</P>
      <P>May I make one other point in support of what Deputy Gene Fitzgerald said in relation to the tax on hurleys? A tax on sports equipment is fair enough.  I take it that a horse saddle will last a lifetime, that football boots will last a couple of seasons but a hurley stick might last only five minutes, which makes it difficult for young people to continue adherence to this national game.  Some distinction might be made in these two cases.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d) other vehicles to which this paragraph applies&mdash;</P>

    <P>(3)  That paragraph (1) of this Resolution shall not have effect in relation to vehicles specified in Article 3 of the Imposition of Duties, (No. 170) (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Order, 1968 (S.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the proposed increase on road tax, I ask the Taoiseach, particularly since we have been hearing in recent months about national partnership and guarantees which workers had expected and had been given that the budget would not have the effect of increasing the cost of living, to visualise a rural worker travelling 20 miles to and from work.  The best he could do last year was to buy a second hand fairly big car, and on the figures before me, from 1st March next his car will be subject to an additional £40 to £50 duty, depending on h.p.  That is £1 per week. In respect of the increase in petrol tax, as and from 1st March he will have to pay £1.50 per week, an aggregate increase of £2.50 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair will agree it is very difficult to distinguish between the road tax and the increase in petrol tax.  I am trying to relate them to promises given to workers that any measure in the budget would not have the effect of increasing their cost of living.  In rural areas workers will be faced with an increase of £2.50 per week and that is not in accordance with the guarantees given to the Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

      <P>The resolution provides for the continuation in 1976-77 of the 10 per cent surcharge imposed in 1975-76.  The appropriate section will be included in the Finance Bill.

      <P>What I am about to say is not what the Taoiseach thinks. When the Government of which he is Taoiseach introduced increased allowances under income tax, they left the taxpayer worse off in real terms than he was when Fianna Fáil left office.  Since then the position of the taxpayer has steadily been eroded and the reliefs proposed in today's <Col N="776" /> budget, to which the Taoiseach has referred, seem to vary between an increase of 2 per cent and 10 per cent in the allowances.  They do not even remotely keep pace with inflation. The alleged reliefs, the nominal provisions, made in today's budget improved the taxpayer's position to the extent that there is an increased allowance but he is relatively worse off than he was the last year.  These are the facts of the situation.</P>

      <P>(1)  That, with effect as on and from the 6th day of April, 1976, Chapter IV of Part V of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (No. 6 of 1967), be applied to all emoluments assessable to income tax under Schedule E other than the emoluments specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 125 of the said Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is to provide for the extension of PAYE to all employees at present assessed departmentally.  The House will recall that when PAYE was introduced by the Finance No. 2 Act, 1959, with effect from October, 1960, all employees for whom a statutory scheme of taxation deduction was already in operation were excluded from the PAYE scheme.  These are now being brought into the scheme as and from 6th April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions I would like to ask on this.  First, is it proposed to apply the PAYE system to public service pensioners as well as those who are on salaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that by doing this there can be a very substantial imposition on such pensioners, particularly in the first year, unless&mdash;and this brings me to the second question&mdash;an undertaking given by the Minister for Finance, in response to a question from Deputy Haughey on a financial resolution in June and repeated by him in the House afterwards, is honoured?  That undertaking by the Minister was that nobody would be asked to pay in the one income tax year tax on more than one year.  If that undertaking is being honoured the problem will not be as serious as it would otherwise be, but if it is being honoured, perhaps the Taoiseach will explain the mechanics of that, how it is proposed to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment is only for one year but the actual arrangement for this would be spread over a three-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach and the Government not consider exempting pensioners from this arrangement altogether?  Pensioners are in a completely different situation from people who are still in the public service.  Whatever possibility a public servant who is still in the public service has of meeting this new and <Col N="780" /> unfair imposition, the unfortunate pensioners have no way of coping with it.  It would simply fall harshly and cruelly on the very hardpressed and unfortunate section of the community. I would seriously ask the Taoiseach to exempt public service pensioners completely from this arrangement.  I do not think there is all that much in it from the point of view of the Exchequer.  These people are coming to the end of their taxpaying life anyway and the State will catch up with them when they die, in any event.  Therefore I think there is a very strong case to be made for exempting pensioners entirely from this new arrangement and letting them continue under the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The State will not catch up with them now because death duties have been abolished.  The Deputy is thinking of the time before the advent of this Government when death duties were still in operation.  This tax is applicable for one year and the Minister has arranged a remission which I think is reasonable.  There are a total of 130,000 in all who would be charged for the year 1976/77 on their actual earnings instead of, as previously, on the year 1975/76.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach elaborate a little more on the arrangements he has in mind and in particular on the reference he made to the spreading of this over three years?  I do not quite follow that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to return to the plea made by Deputy Haughey. This would apply only to existing public service pensioners.  Those who retire in future on the PAYE system will not be affected in this way.  It is those who are on the other system and who are suddenly brought under the PAYE system who are going to have to pay a very heavy imposition.  I think it would be worth while to examine this. There cannot be all that much involved for the Exchequer.  I would ask the Taoiseach if he would undertake at least to have the matter sympathetically examined between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill.</P>

I am well aware that one can receive complaints in regard to this which are not well founded, but it does seem to me that there has recently been a slowing up in regard to the treatment of certificates which has operated to the detriment of genuine sub-contractors.  What is being authorised under this resolution could lead administratively to further delay and grave not just inconvenience but loss to sub-contractors.

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. It has been a long day and I am not going to delay very long.  I should like to ask the Minister if he would investigate the closure of this factory.  The firm are Messrs.  Janelle, they manufacture clothes and are part of an industrial estate in Blessington, County Wicklow, which was set up approximately ten or 11 years ago.  At one stage they employed approximately 150 workers and the number has now been reduced to 110.  These 110 workers are now under notice and I understand the factory is to close within the next two weeks or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will agree that an industrial estate in the Blessington area is a new venture and the closure of this factory will add to the unemployment <Col N="785" /> list.  I would ask the Minister to intervene if possible and have a stay put on the closure with a view to seeing what can be done to keep this factory going. My information is that this firm opened another factory some time ago and it is still in production.  One wonders why they have to close their factory in County Wicklow when they have opened another one recently.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the majority of their products are for export.  There is no alternative employment closer to Blessington. I understand that most of the employment in the area is provided from the Blessington, Kilbride and the Baltinglass areas.  Therefore it would be very difficult for the people involved to find alternative employment.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that, at present, having approximately 120,000 people unemployed and this being an industrial estate which was set up for the purpose of providing employment in the area, he should intervene from the point of view of putting a stay on the closure of the factory to see what can be done.</P>
    <P>This is the first time since I was elected to the House that I have raised a matter such as this on the Adjournment. From time to time I read in the papers that the Minister has become involved in the closure of other factories, and I am making a special appeal to him on behalf of the workers involved in this case.  I am sure we would all agree that today's increase in the cost of petrol will add very much to the cost of living of those travelling from Blessington to Dublin, which is quite a long distance.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I did say I was not going to avail of all the time afforded to me. Deputy Ciaran Murphy, who has been involved in the area, is anxious to say a few words.  Again I make a special appeal to the Minister to see what can be done.  Perhaps a deputation of the workers could be met by officials of the Department to see if they have anything to offer in relation to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to support Deputy Walsh in this matter. <Col N="786" /> It will be a big blow to the west Wicklow area in general and to part of Kildare if this factory is to close.  It is a pity that a factory of some ten years standing has to go to the wall.  At one stage there were 150 people employed there and now that number is down to approximately 110.  As Deputy Walsh said, there is really no alternative employment available in this area.  At the moment in Blessington there are something in the region of 142 persons on the live register and approximately £2,500 is paid out from the labour exchange each week.  These statistics indicate that there is certainly no alternative employment available.  I believe that one of the factors involved in the firm closing altogether and not going on to a three-day week was the transportation costs of bringing workers to the factory.  I would agree with Deputy Walsh when he said that the business which we went through in this House today in increasing levies on petrol will only aggravate a situation such as this.</P>
      <P>I would like to know why the county development officer for Wicklow, whose predecessors were involved in this industrial estate over the years, was not informed, until very recently, according to my information, of this closure.  Perhaps if he had known of it in advance he might have been able to do something to see that notices to the workers were not given for this factory to close on the 5th February.  I wonder if the Minister might see his way to having Fóir Teoranta intervene so that employment might be continued in this factory.  It will be a very big blow to the area in general if this unfortunate closure were to take place.</P>
      <P>Also, when we consider the cost to the Exchequer of more unemployed people it will be very costly to have 110 more people out of work. Apart from that, there is the impact it will have on people, many of whom have found it difficult to secure employment and now find themselves without it.  This is what we must try to avoid, and I feel that the Minister will want to do all in his power to see that each and every job that can be saved there will be saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times one uses as a statistic the figure of 117,000 unemployed without <Col N="787" /> relating the figure to real persons.  We would all agree that a person who wishes to work and who is out of work is a reflection on the country.  A further 110 persons unemployed in the Blessington area will be a small disaster. Social welfare payments may compensate to some extent financially but do not fully compensate persons wishing to live full and active lives.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Seán Walsh on bringing this matter before the House and for giving me an opportunity to speak here tonight.  I congratulate him also on the tone of his contribution and for striking a positive note in asking the Minister to intervene in order to save jobs for the people concerned.  The general facts have been put before the Minister, and I look forward to hearing the Minister suggesting a solution to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first say that I share the concern expressed by the Deputies on the other side of the House and I am grateful to them for the constructive tone of the contributions they have made?</P>
      <P>The factory in question, a factory that I know, the catchment area of which involves the constituencies of Deputy Walsh, Deputy Murphy and of myself, is in between a number of constituencies and it is a fairly large catchment area from which it takes workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put something about the company&mdash;its name has been given &mdash;on the record of the House.  The company is Janelle.  It is fair that I should say something about it.  It is a public company.  It is a completely Irish company, and it does seem to me that in fairness to them I should say that in my opinion they are an example of the very best sort of entrepreneurial flair that we have in Ireland, built up by Irish people, with really outstanding management and outstanding production engineering.  They are among our leading exporters of clothing, of men's and women's raincoats and trousers.  I should say also in fairness to them since we are discussing their affairs <Col N="788" /> here that they have an outstanding track record.  There is this one difficulty with one factory, but nonetheless it is fair to affirm that they have made a great contribution to the growth of employment, to the growth of exports in this sector.  Exports are more than 92 per cent of production.  Exports are going into the UK to mail order suppliers who, until fairly recently, until some new measures were introduced, were able to get products from all over the world including some of the low cost areas like Hong Kong and Korea. This Irish firm was able to compete against some of those suppliers on the basis of quality, on the basis of delivery terms, on the basis of price.</P>
    <P>They now have approximately 900 employees in eight factories, five of them in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Blessington, the one that was referred to, and the Enniscorthy one.  There are approximately 100 people in Blessington.  The core of the difficulty &mdash;and this is something I and my Department have been in touch with&mdash; relates to trousers.  The Blessington and Enniscorthy factories produce trousers.  Some of the other factories produce other things, notably raincoats.</P>
    <P>It is worth saying also that many of these factories are the result of takeovers and the bringing into health of firms that were established by others and that were never really healthy until Janelle, with very good management, came along and made them healthy. That was the situation in Blessington and also in Enniscorthy.  The quality of management is very high.  That is the key to the success.</P>
    <P>They mass produced with flow methods in a very efficient way, and they had almost £5 million worth of exports in very difficult circumstances to the year end of July.  The difficulty was&mdash;I am quoting from a company statement&mdash;that the planned progress in the trousers division was impeded due to the recession in the men's trade resulting in the main from low cost country imports into our export market&mdash;they are an example of these things&mdash;but since then&mdash;and I think this is important because I will be <Col N="789" /> looking a little into the future the measures taken by the EEC to restrain imports of sensitive clothing products into the member States of the Community will have begun to have the effect of an easing of competition because these restrictions apply to imports from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Macao and Singapore, which are the low cost areas.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the crux of the matter now.  One of these factories is closing down.  I have good reason to believe that a permanent closure is not envisaged and&mdash;here is the real problem which faces me in the sense of decision, and I know it faces Deputies on the other side who are looking for the best solution&mdash;we have a firm which is very efficient, which has a very good track record and in very difficult times.  We could twist their arm and say &ldquo;keep the production in both the Enniscorthy factory and the Blessington factory&rdquo;.  I know that what I am going to say now is hard on Blessington in the short run&mdash;one of these difficult decisions that have to be made&mdash;but I believe it is in the interests of all of the employees, 800 odd of them remaining, it is in the interests of our £5 million worth of exports, that we should allow them to operate in a very efficient way.</P>
    <P>There will be redundancy payments, I think, for the people out of work, and there is the perspective that it is a good plant and they manage it very well.  There is the perspective that the markets will turn up, as is expected now that firstly there are signs of an improvement and secondly now that the low cost competitors are excluded from the community to some extent, not totally excluded but supplies are cut down.</P>
    <P>I have taken the position that I wanted to see the health of the whole group and therefore I did not want to coerce them into what was basically an uneconomic position and a position of urging inefficiency on them because I thought that would endanger the whole group and that was something I did not want to do.  I would, however, say that I understand that the position has been fully explained to the workers and they understand it and I am informed <Col N="790" /> that the position has been accepted by them.  I understand that it is not possible in the short term to divert work from the rainwear side into the trousers side.  It is trousers that are manufactured in Blessington. In the long term, either there is the possibility of an upturn in demand for trousers&mdash;and when I speak of the long term I am not speaking about years but months&mdash;or else of the spreading of the raincoat work, but that takes retraining and takes a little time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the specific thing that is urged upon me, my officials are certainly available to talk to people from that factory if they so wish.  I know that in that industrial estate in Blessington substitute employment is difficult at this moment, but I would point out that while the distances are real there is Naas, there is Newbridge, there is Dublin, there is Clondalkin.  I know people will say there is high unemployment in this area, and that is true, but there are jobs and people have been brought in from quite large distances from some of these areas, from Clondalkin and other places.</P>
    <P>I believe that is a very good firm with a very good future, and it is my view that this will not be a permanent closure.  In regard to the point made about the county development officer I should like to say that I do not know why that was so.  There is no reason why those discussions should not take place; they would be useful.  If the company wants Fóir I would be happy to see them going that far.  In my view the company is so strong that they could go to commercial banks or to ICC; they are a very good risk and a good firm.  The question is whether it is prudent for them to do that at this time.</P>
    <P>I know the dilemma as to whether one puts those people on the labour exchange, which costs something, or whether one encourages, urges and pushes the firm a bit to keep those people in employment, is a real one. The latter would save the State a bit of money but it takes the real sharp competitive edge off the firm and may diminish their momentum.  It would possibly create difficulties at a time when competition is very intense.  On <Col N="791" /> the face of it, that is something I am not anxious to do because I believe the best guarantee of the future for the workers in Blessington who will be laid off is to have them re-employed.</P>
    <P>The prospects of re-employment are good, and the best prospect of the future of the jobs of the workers in the other areas, Dublin and Enniscorthy, is that the firm should remain efficient and healthy as it is now.  I was prepared, as the best guarantee of future employment, to countenance this in the short term for a period which I believe will be a finite period. I do not see that as the end of manufacturing by Janelle in Blessington; I see it as a temporary closure.</P>
    <P>The resources of my Department, of Fóir, the ICC, the IDA and AnCO are available to help this project.  I know I can commit AnCO because they are good in trying to take up the slack with training, and if there is a question of retraining, to go from trousers to raincoats, that is something I would be happy to see AnCO involved in.  All the resources of my Department are available to the company.  The basic cause of the difficulty was low cost import trousers from the cheap areas which has been much restricted of late with the result that the competitive position is improving.  That was the crucial thing, and that caused the trouble, but I believe it will pass.  I can assure the Deputies that all the State agencies in my Department and in the Departments of Finance and Labour are all available.  I will leave this one thought with the Deputies.  I believe that competitiveness <Col N="792" /> by what I would call a lean, hardy and fit firm is the best guarantee not just of the jobs at present in the firm but of future growth.  Therefore, I have taken the decision&mdash;the Deputies may think it is a hard decision &mdash;which I think was the correct one.</P>
    <P>I am prepared, if it is the firm's best commercial judgement to countenance some loss of employment to guarantee the general health of the firm firstly, to secure the jobs of the other workers in it and, secondly, to secure a dramatic leap forward when economic circumstances improve so that they have some resources, some spare cash and a strong and fit organisation.  I assure Deputies that the co-operation of my Department is available.  I believe that co-operation and help should be invoked by the firm in the light of their best commercial judgement.  If there is an approach by the firm, by the unions, together or separately, we will make available the entire battery of our mechanism of assistance.  I assure the Deputies that we have been in continous touch since this matter first arose.</P>

It has come to notice, however, that in many cases where the wife was entitled to a separate non-contributory pension the &ldquo;working wife's allowance&rdquo; of £230 was, in error, given in the computation of personal reliefs. This allowance is not legally due and will not be granted in these cases in the future.</P>
