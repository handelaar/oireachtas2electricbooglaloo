    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Since last night I have like other people read various comments in the newspapers by responsible bodies and decent men who expressed their concern about the measures at present before the House. In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> the executive of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, chaired by Bishop Michael Harty of Killaloe, expressed fears in connection with giving extra powers to the Garda and Army.  The Bishop said that the Garda and Army should have no more powers than are absolutely necessary and that the exercise of such powers should be established in detail.  That point has already been made in this House.  Not alone is it our point of view but it is the point of view of other responsible bodies throughout the country. That is just one of the comments in this morning's papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disturbing comment yesterday was made by the Taoiseach. He indicated to the House that no further measures were contemplated at present.  We would like to know what measures the Government have in mind for the future.  It would appear that at present we have to concern ourselves with the two Bills before the House but we would like <Col N="318" /> to know the dimensions of the package and whether any additional measures will be implemented.  Once there is an erosion of power of this type there is no doubt that when the Army and Garda act in relation to additional powers they must in turn be backed up by additional powers and there will be this continuity in the future. The freedom and liberty of the individual are most important and any further erosion of freedom and liberty will be opposed as vigorously as we have opposed these Bills and I am quite sure that other responsible bodies will do the same.</P>
    <P>Last night I dealt with the security factors that affect the country and the additional power that is being sought by the Government for the Garda.  I pointed out that since the Government took office there have been many instances of people being apprehended and then allowed to go free.  No further power was needed on the occasion of the <i>Claudia</i> affair.  People were apprehended at that time and then allowed to go free.  How selective is justice to be in this country?  This was an appalling matter.  A ship full of arms sailed into our waters.  The crew and others were apprehended but they were kicked out by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but it is clear that he is not referring to the measure before the House.  He must relate his remarks more closely to the Emergency Powers Bill and the subject matter contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the measures sought by the Government are not necessary, that we have an effective police force if they are allowed to operate.  They have shown in the past that they can do their job effectively.  The <i>Claudia</i> affair was one instance of the security forces doing their job effectively within our present legislation.  On that occasion there was no response from the Department of Justice or the Minister for Defence other than to let the foreigners go free.  We had serious problems such as the breakout from Portlaoise Prison.  Surely we do not <Col N="319" /> need additional legislation for better security within our prisons.  Again, this is a reflection on the Department of Justice and the Minister for Defence. The security around Portlaoise Prison is in question when a juggernaut can be driven into the area.  We know of the helicopter trip to Mountjoy.  As the Minister for Justice pointed out, some of these people have been apprehended by the security forces who utilised the services available within the law.  There was an escape from the Curragh through the fanlight of a toilet.  None of these matters requires extra legislation but they show that there is neglect in the security system. Prisoners were able to blow their way out of Green Street courthouse.</P>
      <P>This Bill is camouflage to try to create a different impression.  We had the mail train robbery.  The withdrawal of services was known to the people who were implicated.  These are not factors which require legislation but they are of concern to the public.  A man cannot leave his car in O'Connell Street.  The numbers of cars stolen in this city and throughout the country is appalling.  These matters could be dealt with effectively if the security forces had the necessary facilities and manpower.  These are disturbing factors in the minds of the people.  Declaring a state of emergency does nothing to rectify the situation.  We have the smash and grab merchants and the body snatchers of the British Army who endeavour to take people from this side of the Border.  One wonders why our forces are ineffective in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda and the Army can do an excellent job if they have the necessary men and materials.  In changing circumstances there is a need for strengthening further the Garda and to make available to them the necessary finances.  If lack of finance is a contributory factor to these crimes, the Government have a grave responsibility to provide finance to ensure that the forces of the State can act effectively.  The failure to pay overtime and to adjust pay problems appears to be affecting the efficiency <Col N="320" /> of the Garda.  It is time these basic problems were tackled rather than bringing in camouflage legislation such as the internment Bill of 1976&mdash; this is an internment Bill.</P>
    <P>The people are concerned about the recurring crimes which could be prevented within the existing structure of the security forces and within the law as it stands.  The Minister for Justice has failed in his duty, either in collusion with the Minister for Finance, or because of pressure from the Minister for Finance.  We have had a long litany of incidents which could have been prevented if adequate security precautions had been taken.  Because of the withdrawal of some of our security forces we have this build-up of incidents which are causing concern to the people. Now that an emergency has been declared, I do not feel any safer this morning, and I am sure our citizens do not feel any safer.  The remedy to the problems is to get more policemen on the beat.  We must ensure that whatever problems are rendering the service inefficient are rectified at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Our security forces have done a good job.  They apprehended the people who brought in the <i>Claudia.</i> They apprehended many of the people concerned in a variety of crimes.  I hope all these people will be brought to justice.  This Bill will not prevent a recurrence of these problems.  We were told by the Minister for Defence that, after several meetings of the Government, it was decided to introduce the provision relating to the additional five days' detention.  To my mind this means the police are taking seven days to do a two-day job.  This is as a result of the rundown in the service because of pay or other problems within the Garda.</P>
    <P>We know from the Press and from the documents circulated from time to time by the Garda that there is grave concern within the force about the problems which create the inefficiency within the service.  The Minister and the Government are directly responsible for that.  This type of incompetence <Col N="321" /> cannot be tolerated any longer. This is probably the only capital city in Europe where you cannot park your car in the main street and be sure to find it there when you come back.  The Minister should strengthen the Garda to the extent that they will become an efficient instrument once again in eliminating the problems which have been plaguing the security situation for so long.</P>
    <P>There was no emergency situation three years ago when the Government took office.  It has developed now because of their incompetence, because of their failure to carry out their responsibilities. Tampering with the basic freedoms of the individual is no solution to the problems.  The death of the British Ambassador has been mentioned. We have had fire bombs and other explosions within the State from time to time.  The Department of Justice and other Departments were alerted to the fact that certain actions were about to take place.  Last night I asked the Minister for Justice if there was any forewarning of the murder of the British Ambassador and if adequate precautions were taken.  I got no answer to that question.  The fact that the Minister remained silent must lead me to assume warning was given.</P>

      <P>Order.  I fail to see the relevance of what the Deputy is saying to the measure before the House.  I would be grateful if the Deputy would relate his remarks to the measure before the House and deal with the subject matter of the sections in that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The declaration of emergency was based on the death of the British Ambassador and the events at the Green Street courthouse.  The emphasis was placed on those two matters by the Taoiseach and the Ministers who have spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the general motion is closed.  It has been disposed of by the House. We are now dealing with a specific measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The general motion was the instrument which made this Bill possible.  Therefore, one is tied to <Col N="322" /> the other.  It is impossible to divorce one from the other and while that debate has been closed, nevertheless, there are some matters we must reflect upon.  In the general debate an effort was made to give the reasons why the Government regard it necessary to bring in this Emergency Powers Bill or internment Bill.  In effect, this is an internment Bill because the rights and liberties of individuals are being tampered with.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach told us that at present no further measures were contemplated but we must assume that other measures are contemplated for the future.  If we got the complete package today we would be able to digest it much better because we would then know the contents of the entire package.  However, there is a doubt among our citizens that there will be further legislation as a result of yesterday's declaration.  We heard the protests of responsible bodies and trade unionists.  Last night 500 people paraded to the square in Navan as a protest against this internment Bill. They did so because they feel that trade unionists are vulnerable under it.  Church leaders have also spoken out against the measures as have other responsible people.  The voices of our people are coming through loud and clear.  I see no necessity for this internment Bill introduced by the Cosgrave Administration unless the Garda require additional time because of the situation that has developed within the force.  We have been told that there has been an increase in the number of gardaí and I should like to know if we are maintaining the force at the height of efficiency necessary and desirable.  Is there the impediment I spoke of earlier?  Is there the need for some overhaul of the security system or a need to have a look at the general problem confronting the gardaí? Is the latter being placed in abeyance because the Government have gone bankrupt?  If the bankruptcy of the Government is a factor, we should be made aware of it so that we can make use of this House to ensure that the necessary money is available to meet this grave and developing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the <Col N="323" /> Deputy please return to the subject matter of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not law that is required but security within the State. Internment is no solution to that problem. We want more police to use the existing powers rather than fewer police with more power.  That is the big factor.  We need more police to eliminate the developing problem confronting the country.</P>
      <P>In common with other Members of my party, I am horrified at the atrocities carried out.  I should like to know if this measure will be selective.  Will it apply to forces unnamed?  Will it apply to the members of the British army who cross the Border in civilian attire?  Will they be detained for seven days in custody if they cross here on unlawful missions, on their body-snatching operations?  Will members of the SAS who cross here in civilian attire and armed with unconventional weapons on missions unknown to us be detained under the provisions of this Bill or will they be provided with a helicopter or other form of transport to get them out as quickly as possible?  Will we shun these problems?</P>
      <P>We do not know if some of the atrocities carried out in this city, and other parts of the country, were the work of the SAS or other sections of other armed services or whether they were the work of the IRA or some other extreme paramilitary groups from Northern Ireland.  We have evidence that members of the British army have operated here and have crossed the Border in civilian attire.  In a war time situation these people would be immediately executed but to date they have been returned to the North with all speed.  The only exception was the occasion when members of the SAS were charged before our courts but then they were ferried out in quick time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the tampering with the freedom and the rights of the individual.  In the not-too-distant past many Members who occupy Government benches today shed bitter tears in relation to the erosion of freedom and liberty but now a jackboot mentality has been stamped upon this legislation introduced by the Cosgrave Administration. The Labour Party have completely lost their identity on this measure.  In the past people asked what was the difference between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour but there is no need for me to explain that difference now.  We know there is no difference between Fine Gael and Labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my opinion.  I have placed my views on the record of the House.  For the peace and freedom of the individual a balanced system of power between security and defence is desirable.  We have stated continuously that the measures we deem necessary will be supported by the people on this side of the House.  We do not deem this internment Bill necessary.  We feel that if the Garda were allowed to operate as they wish, if the necessary finances were available, then we would not have the litany of problems that has disturbed the minds of the people for so long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is indulging in repetition.  He is saying the same thing over and over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Any tendency to <Col N="325" /> extend the powers of the police force has always been regarded as the start of a police State.  Where we have the powers of the police and Army being extended, together with the indication given yesterday that at the moment no further legislation is contemplated, then we are reaching a serious situation indeed.  We would ask that the Government come forward and honestly indicate what other measures they intend to bring before this House in the near future.</P>
      <P>I hope that the people who claim to have a conscience in the Government benches, if any of them have a conscience, would respond in the lobbies when this internment Bill comes to a vote.  Although I have my doubts, I feel that the cowardly action of people in failing to vote is one that we must be appalled at in a national Parliament such as this.  People must have the courage of their convictions to do what they believe is right and that can be done only in the lobbies whether in the Dáil or the Seanad. Those people who have not the courage of their convictions must be condemned. They have this opportunity now to make amends and to show clearly and positively whether or not they are against the measures before the House.  Their failure to vote against the measure is an indication of their acceptance of the measure which no amount of whitewash can camouflage. We listened last night to Deputy Barry Desmond who always tries to ride two horses, who has been found out on many occasions.  Last night again showed clearly the hypocrisy of this man.</P>
      <P>I appeal again to people if they really believe in freedom to show it in the division lobbies when they get the opportunity some time in the afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the criticisms of this Bill in the House and reading the criticisms of it outside the House, it it is clear to me that there has been a very substantial shift in the balance between society and the State, not just within living memory <Col N="326" /> but within the last ten or 15 years. My belief, which I must state clearly, is that the Irish State and Irish Governments have become over the last 15 or 20 years not more tyrannous, not more hard-line, not more repressive, but a good deal less so.  Although I do not want to be taken as welcoming repression for repression's sake, I think that the State and Government of this country, like those of many other countries in the western world, have become timid.  Government activities which passed almost without comment 15 or so years ago are now things that any western government, including this one, have to think twice about.  The Taoiseach yesterday when replying to the debate on the motion on which this Bill is founded devastatingly showed this point to the House by recalling the history of the former IRA campaign which was virtually confined to the North of Ireland, which resulted in very small loss of life compared with what we have seen over the last seven years and in which even the damage to property was negligible compared with what every year now brings with it.  Yet in 1957 it was possible for the incoming Fianna Fáil Government with absolutely minimal complaint from anybody, to introduce internment and to lock up for a couple of years 200 or 300 people apart altogether from those who had been sentenced to very heavy terms of imprisonment on conviction of ordinary charges before the Special Criminal Court, which in those days consisted of military officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all changed.  It is easy for Deputy Dowling to describe the measure in the Bill in front of us as internment, but he knows that is is not possible, if one is respecting language, so to describe it.  It is possible so to describe it if you have no respect for language, if you are a language-forger, of whom there are many loose in this country inside and outside the media today.  If you are a forger of words, a person who says &ldquo;violence&rdquo; when what he means is something which is not violent, a person who describes, for example, economic exploitation as violence and tries to lead people to suppose, <Col N="327" /> therefore, that there is no difference between economic exploitation and violence, which is a primary word and will produce a primary reaction; if you are a word-forger of that kind it is possible to describe this as an internment Bill.  However, if you respect language and the ideas that underlie it you cannot do so.  If you are the kind of person who talks about repression, when the activity you are describing is the maintenance of ordinary, decent conditions for ordinary, decent people, then, if you are that kind of forger and cheat, it is possible to say this is an internment Bill, but not otherwise.  To get away from politics altogether, if you are the kind of person to whom expressions like this trip easily off the tongue, who describes the placing of a petrol filling station on a scenically attractive route as the &ldquo;rape&rdquo; of the road, if you are the kind of person to whom these metaphors come easily, then, of course, this is an internment Bill. If you have some respect for ideas and for the impact which they should secure when they are properly used and if you do not try to break down people's instinctive hostile reaction to things like violence, then you may not describe this Bill as providing for internment, because it does nothing of the kind.  It does not contain such a thing, it does not remotely purport to attempt to contain such a thing.  I absolutely reject and condemn attempts by Members of the Opposition or by people outside the House so to represent it.</P>
    <P>My point remains valid that this measure is infinitely more timid, infinitely weaker, than what was taken for granted with minimal opposition and complaint from anybody in 1957, when what was going on here in the country was a pale shadow of what has been happening for the last seven years.  That is a striking proof that the State has become not more tyrannous, but a good deal more circumspect in the way it governs.  I do not complain about that.  I am glad to see the <Col N="328" /> State being more circumspect, but I condemn and reject the whinging and whining and bleating from inside and outside this House about how this is a bleak and black day for democracy.  That is more word-forgery and cheating and that, too, is aimed at muddying and mixing up people's minds in such a way that at the end of the day they will not know what kind of a State they have got, they will not know what there is in it to value and defend.</P>
    <P>Another example&mdash;a small one admittedly, I do not want to make too much of it&mdash;is the counterpart of the degree to which the State has become more timid.  It is the extraordinary growth of exquisite sensitiveness on the part of the State's critics, on the part of the self-appointed guardians, and very welcome they are, of civic rights, the exquitite sensitiveness and quick reaction of these people to any infringement whatever, not just of their rights but even of their convenience and of the exercise by them of something that may be, perhaps, slightly outside their full rights.  I would like to remind the House of a thing which the public is not often reminded of, an incident in 1962 when Deputy Haughey, whom I see over there, was presiding over the Department of Justice.  Dr. Noel Browne, who was a Deputy of this House at the time, found himself part of a procession on which police dogs were used.  Unmuzzled Alsatians were used on Deputy Noel Browne who, although I dislike and disagree with nearly everything he says, has never hurt a fly.  Why were police dogs used on that procession?  Because that procession proposed to demonstrate in a disorderly way outside the United States Embassy about nuclear disarmament. That could not be tolerated, and not only had it to be put down or kept in check by the ordinary force of the guards but, as Deputy Haughey explained to the House when he answered questions about it, police dogs were used as, he said, was usual in order to repress disorderly elements and preserve law and order.  Those phrases tripped easily off the tongue of all Ministers for Justice in those days.  I do not single out Deputy Haughey.  No <Col N="329" /> one thought anything about it.  His friends in the media do not remind the public about that now.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to consider honestly what would be the reaction here and outside if Deputy Cooney, now the Minister for Justice, were to turn police dogs loose on anybody at all, leave alone a harmless person like Dr. Browne.  Suppose we had a procession down here laid on by the Provisional Sinn Féin, and a police dog were allowed to lay his tooth on the sacred person of Mr. Brady or Mrs. Drumm, what would be said about Deputy Cooney?  Would not the papers be stuffed with cartoons showing Deputy Cooney in the guise of a dog with savage ravening jaws, with a brutalised policeman untying his leash? Is there any limit to what would be said about the brutality of a State which would tolerate such a thing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That happened in that time too.  The cartoons appeared just the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember that time, although I have no reason to remember it as clearly as Deputy Haughey.  I am absolutely certain that what there may have been in 1962 is absolutely nothing to what would happen if the present Minister were to stand over the use of police dogs, not against a poor, harmless, protester like Dr. Browne who never hurt a fly, but against people whose aim and work in life is to encourage murder and savagery and to drag this country down into the jungle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention these things as I believe&mdash; and any fair-minded person looking back over this country in the past 15 years must accept&mdash;that, for better or for worse, the State has become much more circumspect in enforcing the law for the people's protection than it was and that the critics of the State in the Dáil and outside have become infinitely more vocal and numerous.  There was once a time when almost the only complaints about what went on here came from people like Dr. Browne&mdash;in fairness to him&mdash;the late Owen Sheehy-Skeffington and the Irish Association for Civil Liberty which was set up <Col N="330" /> in 1947 to combat the absurd censorship law which prevailed at the time. These were a very small group of people and they were the people to whom the rest of the Irish people apparently were prepared to confide and leave all matters of protest in connection with infringements or threatened infringements of civil liberty.</P>
    <P>That situation has totally changed. It requires no courage nowadays to get up and criticise the State, the Government or any of the other establishments, ecclesiastical or otherwise, which were in such apparently impregnable positions 15 years ago.  What is needed now is the courage to stand up for those establishments which are under threat, because the only thing that can replace them is something which none of us wants to live under. These people who constitute a threat to these establishments have nothing to offer in their place except the kind of tyranny that nobody in this House would care to live under.  It seems to me that so far from it being a few lone people like Owen Sheehy-Skeffington and the Irish Association for Civil Liberty crying, half the country is permanently up on its hind legs giving out about something and they are encouraged to do so by the maximum coverage and publicity being always given to complaints.  Any person who can put two or three words together to say that something is wrong or &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; instantly gets encouragement.  I am sure this sounds very backward and reactionary but these people ought to be down on their knees thanking God that they live under the protection of a free State such as we have here.  I know there are 112,000 unemployed, that there are children who cannot get jobs and I know there are aspects of social injustice that I certainly joined my party in the hope of trying to improve. There are many things which should be improved in this country but I absolutely boil with indignation when I find the finger being pointed at the people who are out in front trying to maintain decent and free standards here, such as, I am very sorry to say, exist in very few countries of the world at this time.  Where is there <Col N="331" /> a freer country than this, with freer institutions, in which the ordinary person has more liberty than this, to leave the country, to come back into it, to travel round, to speak his mind, to publish what he likes, to go where he likes, to listen to other people speaking, to join what association he likes and to bring up his children the way he likes?  What country has greater freedom than we have?</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for his sardonic interjection, because it really makes the point for me.  I do not believe that there is a country with any greater freedom.  If there is a country which could list a greater number of liberties for people, I believe the difference would be absolutely marginal.  While naturally the Opposition must oppose, I think that this Government, and, in fairness, the Governments which went before it have very little to apologise for in regard to abridging civil rights and the freedom of the people or the freedom of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received from Senator Mrs. Robinson, who is a critic of the Bill which is now before the House a statement from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  This council did not exist a month ago, but it is there now, complete with an &ldquo;executive&rdquo;.  This document is signed &ldquo;On behalf of the executive of the ICCL&rdquo;&mdash;you would swear it was a declaration of independence, instead of being a very shaky piece of law, as I hope to show.  This document refers to criticisms made of the working of the Special Criminal Court by what it calls &ldquo;responsible jurists&rdquo;.  I am safe, therefore, in supposing that this document itself carries the <i>imprimatur</i> of equally &ldquo;responsible jurists&rdquo;, if not the same &ldquo;jurists&rdquo;. Paragraph 4 of this document says that the resolution passed here yesterday on which this Bill depends is said to have a &ldquo;precise consequence in law the effect of which is to suspend recourse to the Constitution in protection of fundamental human rights&rdquo;. This is all right for a school debating society, but for a &ldquo;responsible jurist&rdquo; to say such a thing is a disgrace, because <Col N="332" /> you need not only the resolution in order to suspend recourse to the courts in connection with any matter, but you also need a law enacted by this House and the other House specifically referring to and drawing its authority from the emergency resolution. I know that &ldquo;responsible jurists&rdquo; will say &ldquo;that is what we mean&rdquo;. That is not good enough for a lawyer, he must say what he means.  When this sort of thing is published and handed around with compliment slips as having the authority of a council with something serious to say, it should be exact and correct.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 of this document is entitled &ldquo;Duration of the Emergency Powers&rdquo;.  It says that &ldquo;although the powers including seven days' detention granted under the Emergency Powers Bill are to remain in force for only 12 months, the Act itself and the state of emergency are more than likely to continue&rdquo;.  Later on it says that this means that &ldquo;these emergency powers may be renewed and others may be introduced by Government Order without further reference to the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  That is absolutely false. I believe that it is a deliberate lie propagated by this council for the purpose of upsetting and disturbing people.  I believe also that that council is to blame for this pathetic statement coming this morning from a very worthy body in all other respects, the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace.</P>

      <P>I shall try not to <Col N="333" /> wander, but I want to make it clear that I absolutely defy this council or anybody else to show where in this Bill there is anything which permits or could possibly permit the Government to introduce further emergency powers without further reference to the Oireachtas.  The same powers can be extended, but where is the authority for the introduction of further powers?  It is not there. It is time these councils were sat on, time that somebody spoke out plainly to these mushroom councils with &ldquo;responsible jurists&rdquo;, if you please, on them who do not even take the trouble to make sure, before they hand out a document like this, that it conforms with the facts.</P>
      <P>On the very last page of it, before it is signed &ldquo;on behalf of the executive of the ICCL&rdquo;&mdash;and there are three names to conjure with underneath&mdash;in the very last paragraph there is: &ldquo;...as part of its campaign to alert public opinion to the full implications of the suspension of the Constitution....&rdquo; The Constitution is not suspended.  Anyone who says it is is engaged in word-forgery, word-cheating, word-fraud and in ideas-fraud.  Any Minister or police officer who got the impression that the Constitution was now suspended would be in for a queer shock.  Any Minister or police officer who tried to break up a meeting just because he did not like its political complexion would be in for a queer shock.  Anybody who arrested somebody and held him in a prison under any power except that provided by law would be in for a queer shock. Anybody who tried to dictate to parents how they should bring up their children would be in for a queer shock.  If the Constitution were suspended, this House would not be in session; the courts would not be working.  Anybody who tried to tell the courts what to do, who tried to dictate their decisions to them or who disobeyed their decisions in reliance on the statement of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that the Constitution was suspended would be in for a queer shock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind such a statement <Col N="334" /> on a hoarding, a paling or a wall, coming from some organisations whose only object is to pull down this State and destroy it, but I do mind it coming from a council which holds Press conferences, has itself photographed, and gets prestigious names on its notepaper and hands out a statement like this which is purporting to instruct and inform public opinion.  Deputy Lalor does not want me to continue on this line, but I believe that this is largely responsible for the production which we had this morning which I believe will not enhance the reputation of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace.</P>
    <P>In regard to the emergency provision the executive of this commission referred to the &ldquo;dangers inherent in allowing the easy or indefinite prolongation of a state of emergency&rdquo;.  We have had a state of emergency for the past 37 years. I have here a photostat of a parliamentary question answered in 1969 by Deputy Lynch, Leader of the Opposition when he was Taoiseach, saying so in so many words.  Where was the executive of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace then? How is it that it is only today we have this?  I have no inside information, but I will take a flying guess that there is somewhere an overlap in membership between the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, and that this overlapping person is behind this pathetic statement&mdash;I can only call it that.  This is the kind of thing that the Government or, as the Taoiseach fairly said, the Government that will replace us if the people put us out, will be increasingly up against.</P>
    <P>While, to some extent I may have that image, I do not believe at all in a hard line and I have no interest in or anxiety for repression for its own sake&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I think the State is becoming more timid and its critics are becoming more vocal; and their vocality is only matched in many cases by their ignorance and by the utter recklessness of what they say and their grotesque unfairness in the criticisms which are made of this <Col N="335" /> State.  Being a free country this criticism must be permitted but it should be made against the background of other states.  What other kind of state will they put in its place when this one has been pulled down?</P>
    <P>Along with the criticism on the Civil Liberties Council line there is also the kind of criticism that we heard yesterday and on the previous day from Deputies Blaney and Keavney.  I hope I do not do them any injustice&mdash;I did not listen very carefully&mdash;but their criticism was, I think, more or less on the lines that it was a disgrace for this national Parliament to be engaged in this kind of legislation when there were other things to do or other ways of solving its problems.  The same thing came from the Fianna Fáil benches and the Taoiseach nailed this particular poisoned butterfly, that the &ldquo;political initiatives&rdquo; that should be made were missing.  Side by side with the criticisms from the civil liberties lobby is this idea that all republican history should be homogenised, that republican deeds and words and so on can be homogenised in such a way as to make the whole thing hang together as a connected whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect your ruling and I shall have to leave what I was about to say about republican history for another time, but the Chair might allow me to say that a thread running through the debate on this measure inside and outside the House has been that this Government is a kind of lackey of outside forces and that we are engaged much of the time on what I notice some journalists call &ldquo;Provo-bashing.&rdquo; That is certainly a good one.  The people who do the real bashing in this country are the Provos and their imitators on the Unionist side. Anybody who does it by pen and ink or by the strength of his own voice is supposed to be &ldquo;bashing&rdquo; Provos. There is the question sometimes articulated, sometimes tacit as to why <Col N="336" /> we are engaged in bashing only one side of this awful confrontation that exists.  The reason is a very simple one; it is that the people we are engaged in &ldquo;bashing&rdquo;&mdash;by word of mouth or by pen and ink&mdash;are flying our flag and pretend to represent the traditions which have us here, pretend to represent the people who elected us or to know better than we do how the people should be represented.</P>
      <P>In the eyes of the world, whether we like it or not, we are to some extent identified with them by a common mythology, by a common flag, and in many cases by common blood and common ethnic origin.  We are responsible for them, and we are the ones primarily required to keep them in order.  The very same thing, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> holds true for the Unionist population in the North of Ireland.  If they have not been as vocal and as courageous in keeping down their savages, that is their shame; it is not our job to point out the beam in their eye; it is their job to see it and cast it away from them.  I hope I shall not offend any of the Unionist people that I know are doing their best in the North for reconciliation and to make it possible for people with different aspirations to live together if I ask them, with that tradition to look at their own leaders and ask where is the quantum of courage that has been shown by the political leaders in the Republic towards people usurping their own tradition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is their Cosgrave?  Where is their FitzGerald?  Where is their Cruise-O'Brien?  Where is their Cooney?  Where is their Donegan?  I will go further: where is their Jack Lynch?  They simply do not exist. Figures of that prominence, of that commitment and of that courage just do not exist.  I think it is a shameful thing that the most prominent, the most politically successful representatives on the Unionist side are&mdash;I will not say absolutely silent, certainly not that; when they are asked they give the right answer&mdash;so half-hearted, as it were.  They give the right answer when they are asked, but they do not go as far out in front in condemning and rejecting, and leading their people towards <Col N="337" /> condemnation and rejection of, savagery, brutality, and animality as the leaders of this community have gone, and I gladly associate Deputy Lynch and some of his colleagues with that.  That is their shame.</P>
    <P>It is not the job of the Parliament of this Republic to spend as much time keeping in order people who do not identify themselves with us and for whose deeds we will never be blamed.  We will never be blamed here in this House for what is done by the UVF or the UDA or other groups with other names and initials.  We will not be asked to carry responsibility for their murders and savageries by history or by God; but we will be asked what we did to keep our own people in order, the people of our own tradition, or who claim to belong to our own tradition.  That is the reason why this House leaves itself open and why the leaders of the Irish people in the Republic leave themselves open to that cheap, dishonest gibe about being the lackeys of this and the lackeys of that and of &ldquo;bashing&rdquo; the Provos.  That is the reason and that is the only reason.  At least it is the only reason I recognise.</P>
    <P>If I were a Northern Unionist I hope I would have the guts to speak openly and not wait to be asked, but to come out day in and day out and give my people a lead against the savages that have sprung up there&mdash;no one ever doubted they existed&mdash;in reaction to and retaliation against the ones we have spawned on our side. If that population wishes to make good its claim to be &ldquo;no petty people&rdquo; they will have to show more courage and more magnanimity in keeping some moral control, so far as it can be done&mdash;we know how difficult it is to keep actual control&mdash;over people of their own tradition, and they will have to match up in their political leadership&mdash;not in loud talking about not surrendering and not giving an inch&mdash;they will have to match up in courage and conviction with the leaders of this community in the politically, frequently not so easy, task of keeping down the insane brand of republicanism that has led this country to the verge of the abyss.</P>
    <P>History will not be too sophisticated <Col N="338" /> in sorting out people in the way they behave in this crisis and historians will not be too careful in reading politicians' histories, as to whether they had good reasons for this sentence or that sentence.  They will be looking for the large lines of history, to see who in this moment of crisis stood up to violence, who condemned violence unreservedly, who threw his moral weight, whether heavy or light, into the balance against it, who tried to bring his constituency organisation with him in facing up to it and condemning it and in never temporising with it or making excuses for it; and who did not.  That is what history will be interested in.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country, and some of them are in this House who, while they will, if asked, give the right answer and go through the motions of saying they are against violence, are nonetheless quick to make excuses on occasions for those guilty of it and who put a pretty face on those who are guilty of it and find fault&mdash;I do not say fault cannot be found sometimes; of course it can&mdash; with those who, whatever their defects or weaknesses, are trying to put it down.  These are the people who keep one foot in the deep pile of Leinster House but have the other foot in Crossmaglen.  Those people are the most contemptible of the lot, and I say that the constituents, the supporters and associates of such people should pass judgement on them, as history certainly will.  I say also to the perfectly decent, honourable Deputies who, for one reason or another, have held back in giving that lead in their own localities and organisations, that history will not be too careful to inquire for what local reason or personal reason or family reason they kept their mouth shut and did not give the lead they should have given.  History will record only that they did keep their mouth shut and did not give the lead which it was their duty and their job to give.  I want to close on this note.  The Taoiseach yesterday afternoon said that there were many decent, I think he said, and harmless men in Fianna Fáil.  I am glad he said that because that is exactly my own belief.</P>

      <P>The reason why, and I say this with no intention of wounding, there has been such unease on the Opposition benches in the last couple of days, and it is very evident unease, is not so much fear of a general election.  I think it is due to the fact that these Deputies&mdash;the decent ones, the harmless ones, in the Taoiseach's words, and the patriotic ones&mdash; know that intellectually and ideologically they have reached the end of the road, reached some kind of an impasse or T junction which will force them inexorably to one side or the other.  It is no good saying, as Deputy Andrews said yesterday: &ldquo;We are a republican party&rdquo;.  I know what he means, but the content of what he means is now so small one could not see it on the head of a pin.  What is the difference in Deputy Andrews's understanding of that phrase between what he is trying to do in the best way he can and what we are trying to do over here?  You can be a gun-republican or you can be a guff-republican.  Deputy Andrews is not the former, I know, and being an intelligent man he does not want to spend the rest of his life being the latter either.  He is being driven to make a choice, and to see that there is no escape from making up his mind whether to go with the people who have appropriated the republican position, dragged it in the mud, fouled it and filthied it, and going, whether formally or informally, along with the forces on this side of the House, without putting badges or names on them, that have learned the lesson over the <Col N="340" /> years about the intoxication of violence, about the intoxication of truculent, political slogans and are trying to make sure that the things that people are really interested in, like leading a decent life and not having it cut short arbitrarily because somebody wants to make a political point, will be provided and defended.</P>
      <P>I can see I am not encountering much sympathy when I make this point, and I am a little fearful of going further in case it may be thought patronising, or anything like that.  I do not mean to be patronising, but I think the Opposition party have had a chance in the last couple of days to look at themselves and to ask themselves what do they stand for.  Possibly they will put us out at the next election, or the election after that; I do not at all make prophecies about that or say they will never again be the Government. I do not say that at all. Perhaps they will, but at the moment they do not seem to stand for anything except a general critical approach to what this Government do which, of course, is quite right. But it is very far short of being a political philosophy and particularly far short of being a political philosophy strong enough to sustain the largest party in the country.  They should ask themselves what they stand for.  If they decide honestly and fairly that what they stand for is no different from what we stand for, if each man in his heart is willing to admit that, then let them come over here and sit with us.  I have no authority to say such a thing except my own feelings.  I have had no instructions about it one way or the other.  But I would never recriminate or triumphalise about that development.  I believe that perhaps most of us will actually live to see it.</P>

      <P>This morning he lectured many organisations who disagree with the Government's standpoint.  I can share some of his criticism of these organisations.  At the same time the Opposition must ensure that the organisations to which he referred have and will maintain the right to criticise the Government.  First of all, the Parliamentary Secretary should have tried to sort out the Government's attitude to the Bill before us.  He said that there was no country freer than ours with regard to freedom of thought and so on.  Then a Labour Deputy said &ldquo;Yes, one, Russia&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am endeavouring to make is this: The Parliamentary Secretary continued with his lecture and told us that we must all be good Fine Gael people, model ourselves on Fine Gael Deputies and, in that way, have political salvation. That, to some of us, is anathema. Certainly we do not want to model ourselves on Fine Gael.  The Parliamentary Secretary made a case here which, to my way of thinking, illustrated that Fianna Fáil's record with regard to the maintenance of law and <Col N="342" /> order had been good, that they provided adequate legislation.  Therefore, the Government need not introduce any further legislation to protect our citizens and ensure that people can go about their lawful business without interference from any subversive group or even from the lunatic fringe which accompanies them.</P>
      <P>Mention of Deputy Haughey brings to mind a remark he made in the House yesterday which indeed put matters into proper perspective, when he referred to the murder of the British Ambassador and Miss Judith Cooke.  He said that had those who murdered those two unfortunate people been apprehended they could have been sentenced to death.  How much further can one go than that?  The legislation existed.  We may regret that people have not been apprehended for those murders.  I do not blame the Garda for not having done so; they tried hard enough.  The fact is that had they been apprehended, or if they are apprehended and found guilty, they can be sentenced to death.  Fianna Fáil had to introduce legislation over the years to curb the activities of subversives and I shall not go over the old ground again of Fine Gael and Labour Deputies trying to prove that that was not necessary.</P>
      <P>Now they come along with much more repressive legislation.  Any legislation which curbs the freedom of any person in any way, I suppose, can be described as repressive.  Therefore, we are apprehensive that this Bill will mean a further curtailment of an individual's freedom.  The Parliamentary Secretary left me feeling more uneasy this morning because he appeared to believe what he was saying.  Therefore he went on to justify his belief by arguing for more legislation in order to curtail criticism and ensure that if a person is apprehended, even on suspicion, he can spend much more than 48 hours in custody; he can now be held for seven days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can foresee a great social upheaval in this country.  I said the same thing two years ago.  Perhaps the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government know more than I and are preparing for such an upheaval. <Col N="343" /> But they are doing nothing to remove the cause of such a potential upheaval. Rather they are deciding that we must have further legislation to curtail the activities of certain groups, and no doubt the para-militaries' activities are in need of curtailment. However, the Government are going much further in this Bill.  Should there be any kind of social upheaval or should one want to change the system through Parliamentary methods one will find oneself apprehended and held for seven days.  Perhaps the Government have evidence available to them to show that stricter laws are necessary.  But condemnation of the Government must arise from the fact that they are dealing continuously with symptoms and not endeavouring to find out the reasons why we might have a social upheaval. Here I am not talking about the traditional issues behind which some subversive groups have lined themselves.  But there could arise social issues in respect of which people would feel a change in the system was necessary through peaceful means.  The Government, however, will have armed themselves with legislation to prevent that.</P>
    <P>The trade unions and some of their leaders have acted already to oppose this legislation.  They, too, may have information available to them which dictates that they act in that way.  Therefore, I join with those men who voted in another House against this legislation.  We on this side of the House will ensure that when there is legitimate criticism of the Establishment&mdash;when the criticism is done in a peaceful and democratic way&mdash;it will have our full support. At no time did we support people who would not respect the democratic institutions of this State.  It may please Members on the Government benches to allege otherwise. Successive Fianna Fáil Governments introduced legislation which was not popular but which they felt was for the common good.  Indeed, let me say they lost power because of their actions.  That is the way it goes in a democracy.  If the people want to <Col N="344" /> change the Government they can do so.  We are going to ensure that that power remains with the people.</P>
    <P>I can imagine that the Government, drunk by the successful passage of these Bills, may be tempted to go even further.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach spelt it out this morning. He was going to prescribe what was good for the people and whether it was that good did not matter. He played with words and gave a convincing performance if one accepts his thesis for government.  However, thousands of people will not accept it and that is their right.  I can see the Parliamentary Secretary, perhaps when he has a more senior position in the Government, prescribing medicine through this Legislature for what he believes is good for the people.  We do not believe that this Bill is good and that is why we oppose it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government would be better employed in trying to cure the obvious ills in our society, the first being the very high unemployment rate.  There is hopelessness in the hearts of young people who have not been able to get jobs.  We are spending our time discussing this Bill when we should be considering ways and means to put the building workers back into employment, to build houses and to give hope to the parents of young people that there is some future for them in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling of hopelessness with regard to our economic situation and also with regard to our diminishing freedom.  I subscribe to the policy that tries to eradicate the militant groups no matter what banner they march under.  I believe in democracy. These people have no right to decide what is good for the people or what political form we should use.  The Government are acting in a crazy manner. They are not tackling the economic crisis and they are not trying to improve the quality of life.  By bringing in this legislation they may well unite many of the subversive, semi-subversive and the lunatic fringe groups in an effort against the State.  That will be a terrible tragedy.  The Government <Col N="345" /> have a crazy policy: they are telling the people they cannot give them jobs or proper accommodation but that they can give them accommodation in prisons.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the prison officers who have a dreadful job in trying to control and safeguard prisoners who have been sentenced by the courts.  These officers are not given the praise they deserve.  They are dedicated men and carry out an onerous task.  We must have men of integrity to ensure that the governing of our prisons is of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach said that law-abiding people need not fear the law but this has been said throughout the ages.  It is probable that the same thing happened in pre-war Germany but laws were made which men could not accept and they rebelled.  Afterwards they suffered the rigours of the law.  The Government by their action will unite the subversive groups and will make it more difficult for people to oppose the Government.  Fianna Fáil represent more than half of the people in the country and we consider it our duty to ensure that in this democratic national Assembly our voices are raised to expose what we see wrong in the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach this morning spoke eloquently on the various freedoms we enjoy and he was right.  The only fault was that perhaps he was speaking in the past tense.  The Government should ensure that they have given sufficient thought to the various Bills they have introduced.  I am not satisfied that the real reason was the curtailment of militant or subversive groups.  It may be a red herring to keep people's minds away from the real issues.  We have condemned the murder of the British Ambassador and the secretary and the maiming and killing of other people and we sympathise with those who have suffered but I submit the Government are doing nothing to make these militant groups less effective.  They are handling the matter in a ham-fisted way and they will bring more trouble on themselves and on the country.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach threw down the challenge of an election.  Personally <Col N="346" /> I consider he should let the people decide about these Bills.  If the people accept them, then democracy has spoken.  They should have a chance to make known their view.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I appeal to the Government to give the people some hope by having a social policy that will be of benefit to the country. Somebody said recently that peace is not the absence of war but the pressure of social justice.  The Government are sowing dragon's teeth with this legislation and we may have to pay a terrible price for it.  Let the Government deal with the problems that deserve attention.  If they do not do this they may have much worse problems to face in the near future.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  Many years ago in the context of a small clerical group of which both of us were members I had occasion to call the Parliamentary Secretary a fascist hyena. Perhaps this was a rather juvenile form of description but having listened to him this morning I am inclined to think that my prediction of 15 years ago was correct.  He says: &ldquo;Where in Ireland, for example, are people compelled to educate their children in a manner other than that which they choose to educate them?&rdquo; He should ask the parents of Dalkey something about that because they are being asked to educate their children in a manner different from the one they choose.  Also, we have a society which extends the hand of friendship and peace to our separated countrymen in the Six Counties.  At the same time it appears to be a society which is designed to have a Catholic legislation for a Catholic people.  We know that the Taoiseach voted against the Bill introduced by his own Minister on contraception. This is hardly designed to reassure our northern brethren that they will enjoy their privileged rights if they come into this country, this State or this Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General, Deputy Costello, has just summoned up his <Col N="347" /> youthful courage to produce a discussion paper on what he hastens to define as nullity, not divorce, fearing, no doubt, the whack of a crozier if the word divorce were mentioned. This is the free society which the Parliamentary Secretary defends and boasts about so laudably and which gives him the justification to deride what I found a very helpful document from the Council of Civil Liberties, which includes among its principal members, Senator Mary Robinson, one of the world's leading international and penal lawyers.  Perhaps it is a case of lawyers falling out.</P>
    <P>There are just a few more things I want to say about this Bill.  Under section 2 (3) a garda is entitled, if he is not below the rank of chief superintendent, to direct that a person be detained without charge for seven days.  I find this completely unacceptable to my principles.  It should be opposed.  Whether I shall oppose it or not is a question which shall remain locked in my bosom. It also empowers a garda to effect an arrest on production of identification, if so requested, when he is not in uniform.  That is a much more important point than many people in the House seem to realise.  I have nothing personal against the garda although I remember his name with clarity, which is understandable in the circumstances.  As Dr. Johnson said: &ldquo;There is nothing like the prospect of being hanged within a week to concentrate the mind&rdquo;.  The garda who gave me the summons to appear before the court for my appearance at the Provisional Sinn Féin meeting was dressed in a T-shirt and jeans.  He flashed a card in front of me with one hand and thrust the summons out with the other.  I have the utmost respect for the ordinary uniformed garda on the beat.  He does a very difficult job. He is easily identifiable and easily beaten up.  He is easily abused as fuzz, a blue bottle and this sort of thing.  The slowly creeping power of un-uniformed gardaí frightens me.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that this should coincide with the case which occurred <Col N="348" /> in the European Parliament of which I, as long as I retain the grace and favour of the Tánaiste, am a member. A Danish Member of Parliament, Mr. Nielsen, a most harmless and inoffensive man was enjoying a quiet bottle of beer in a pub in Strasbourg when a number of people dressed in sneakers, jeans and T-shirts came in and said: &ldquo;Identification&rdquo;.  He was with a clerical assistant and the wife of the clerical assistant.  He speaks perfect English and French. He said: &ldquo;Mind your own business; let us see your identification&rdquo;. He awoke up in the back of a squad car with his ribs kicked in and was brought to a police station where his ribs were further kicked in.  It turned out that the people who requested identification from him were police.  He was then released about 6 o'clock in the morning without explanation or apology.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this is the kind of system which is at the back of the mind of the Minister for Justice but it is rather deplorable that this state within a state should be growing up of un-uniformed gardaí who do not appear to me to satisfy the educational or physical requirements of ordinary gardaí and who have powers which are strengthened by the Bill before the House.  I do not relish the prospect of some diminutive gentlemen in sneakers and jeans coming up, tapping me on the shoulder and putting me away for seven days and then saying &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; without explanation at the end of it.  This is an extraordinary illiberal step and an extraordinarily unnecessary one.</P>
    <P>This was debated at length by Deputy Blaney in his speech yesterday, which I thought a little premature. However, Deputy Blaney ranged widely over the issues contained in the three measures before us and not simply this Bill.  I will confine myself to the very short Bill before the House now.</P>
    <P>It may be asked if I shall vote for or against this Bill but I do not think this is a question which can fairly be addressed to me.  It is one about which I shall keep the House in tense, taut, <Col N="349" /> suspense over the next few hours.  I will say that an appalling shadow is hanging over the discussion of the three measures before us.  What is that shadow?  Is it the shadow of the death of the British Ambassador?  Is it the shadow of the death of the girl secretary who was in the car at the same time?  Is it the shadow of the tragedy in the North of Ireland?  No, it is none of these shadows.  It is the shadow of an autumn election.  I regret that sounds cynical.  Every man claims one virtue, as Nicky Carraway said in <i>The Great Gatsby.</i> Mine is that I am a realist.  The Taoiseach possesses the ultimate ace of spades in his hand and he can cause us all to concentrate our attention, to paraphrase Dr. Johnson, on the writing of our election addresses.  There is nothing like that prospect to fill a politician with loyalty towards his leader and a determination that the set of circumstances in which he remains in his seat at least until pensionable age will not be upset.  As to how I should vote when the debate is concluded, especially in regard to the seven days' detention, I suppose I should follow the excellent precedent set by the Taoiseach on the occasion on which we were discussing a fundamental right which affects everybody who is not an addict of <i>Humanae Vitae</i>, that is, the right to practise contraception.  I think I should follow the precept of the Taoiseach on that occasion and walk quietly up these stairs, lean at the back of these benches and wait there, looking pathetically on the Chamber, to see whether some of these notorious liberals from the Cabinet, people such as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;a well known liberal himself&mdash;the Attorney General who with his toe is testing for their warmth the waters of divorce and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I shall wait to see whether any of them will join me in the event of their suddenly rediscovering their conscience which appears to be temporarily in abeyance. In this eventuality I shall march cheerfully through the lobbies against a measure which I regard as being despicable and abominable.  In the event of my not doing this I shall remain passive because I am tired of <Col N="350" /> a situation in which I appear to have assumed the role of universal chopping block and of being in a situation where all are out of step but our Johnnie.</P>
    <P>The Coalition seem to have attained a position in which when father turns we all turn.  Father turned against contraception.  Father is now turning towards repressive legislation and apparently is bringing with him people for whom I once had a high regard as liberals and defenders of human freedom.  I regard this Bill as unnecessary and unfortunate but I look forward to the illumination which no doubt I shall receive from the liberal Labour members of the Coalition as to the action they propose to take in respect both of this and the other Bill which is an extension of the Offences Against the State Act.  Of course, I shall be guided by their superior conscience.</P>

      <P>During the course of the debate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said that he noticed perturbed faces on the Fianna Fáil benches during the past few days.  I would merely make the point that that is directly opposite to the facts.  If there were perturbed faces in the House they were on the Government benches, particularly among the Labour Party.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had been here to listen to some of the vocal gyrations of the Coalition liberals referred to by Deputy Thornley in trying to excuse themselves for what they are doing now and for the line they took in 1972, he would have realised where the stress and strain were.  If we take into consideration the public reaction to these Bills there is no need for members of this party to be perturbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are opposed to the Bill.  We see no necessity for it.  Nevertheless, the debate this week has been worth while because it has torn asunder the smoke screen that existed in relation to the Fianna Fáil stance on security, a smoke screen which was cultivated assiduously by the Coalition during the past three years.  The people can see clearly that not only now but in the past Fianna Fáil's performance is and has been excellent in the field of security. When special legislation was <Col N="351" /> needed to deal with unlawful organisations, we introduced that legislation. The Leader of our Party has said that we are prepared to support the Government in any reasonable and necessary legislation for maintaining the security of the State.  But we are not prepared to accept a situation where the Constitution will be suspended, particularly in this instance where there is no necessity for so doing.</P>
    <P>The performance of Fianna Fáil in the whole field of law and order has been very much better than the record of the Coalition because we have been concerned with all types of crime and not merely with one type of crime as is the case with the Coalition.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing to hear regularly on the news, reports of crime of all kinds &mdash;robberies, attacks on old people, situations where even young people get into trouble during the day as well as at night.  Nobody can deny that some of these activities are political but a considerable proportion of them are not political and have remained undetected to a considerable extent, a matter of grave concern to the public generally.  The fault lies in there not being available sufficient gardaí to deal with the situation and particularly in the decision of the Coalition not to allow overtime pay which was something that had been available to the gardaí during Fianna Fáil's time in office.  When we were in Government there was much less crime than there is today.  The worsened situation is due to there not being Garda presence in every area.  From a financial point of view overtime was costly.  Possibly there were some abuses but it should have been possible to streamline matters so as to eliminate any such abuses By disallowing overtime pay in order to save money there is now the situation where in very many areas a garda is rarely seen with the result that wrongdoers can operate with impunity. The Leader of this party underlined this fact during his speech.  He pointed out that because of the situation which exists whereby a garda working on a case must leave it aside on the completion of his ordinary hours of duty for the day so that it must be taken over by another colleague who must then <Col N="352" /> endeavour to pick up the threads and continue from there.  This is a very unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that because of this debate which, as I have said, has resulted in eliminating the smokescreen cultivated by the Coalition in regard to Fianna Fáil's stand on law and order, the next general election, regardless of whether it occurs in a month's time, in a year's time or in February, 1978 will be fought on the issue on which an election should be fought, that is, on the performance or the lack of performance of the Government in the economic and social fields.  If the election is fought as it must be on that basis it will take very much more than the Coalition's gerrymandering of constituencies to keep the present Government in office.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reply last evening was pathetic.  It was far from the very high standard which was set in the debate by the Leader of this party. That high standard was followed by the various speakers from this side of the House.  Indeed, it was followed to quite an extent by Members from the other side also, but the Taoiseach came in last night to try to retrieve the political situation which he felt was slipping from him.  He was obviously convinced that he had failed to understand the mood of the people generally and he tried to retrieve that position by descending to personal abuse. In a matter of such importance as this, the standard of debate should have been kept at the level which was set by speakers on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I was very interested yesterday to note the speeches by Deputy Halligan, the new Deputy on the Labour benches, and by Deputy Barry Desmond.</P>

In any case, Deputy Desmond spoke on this Bill and I am entitled to refer to comments he made and also to comments made by Deputy Halligan.

      <P>If I might continue, Sir.  First of all, Deputy Halligan spoke on the motion and then at the end of his speech said he had reservations about the detention of people by the Garda for seven days.  Last night Deputy Barry Desmond spoke in somewhat the same strain, and I might describe their performance as window dressing within the general Government window dressing.  Surely these Deputies had got a copy of the Bill and the motion for a week prior to this House convening, and surely they understood that the only way they could ensure this Bill would not come before the House was through refraining from voting on the motion. Of course, they were anxious to have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the Labour Party is in serious difficulty in regard to this Bill. I am not referring to the Deputies, most of whom will walk through the lobbies in support of anything the Coalition put forward, but they have a serious problem in relation to their supporters.  Therefore, they have spent their time in speeches here trying, on the one hand, to support the Coalition in bringing in measures of this kind and, on the other hand, to make themselves right with their supporters.  As I say, they knew that once they voted for the motion yesterday, this Bill would immediately come before the <Col N="354" /> Dáil and would be steamrolled through by the majority at the disposal of the Coalition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond also referred to the fact that the Minister, when speaking here on this Bill, pointed out that the Garda felt the Bill was necessary to strengthen their hand in combating subversion, and he said he was perturbed by the fact that these proposals had come from the Garda.  While there might be concern at the aspect of it referred to by Deputy Desmond, I am perturbed for a different reason, and that is, that it is a matter for the Government in any democratic country to listen to expert advice and, having done so, to make their decision, and having made that decision to accept responsibility for that decision.  In his speech the Minister far from accepting responsibility for the decision, is endeavouring, as a sop again to the Labour Party, to imply that had it not been for the Garda the Bill would not have been brought in at all.  I have never seen a speech presented in that manner previously.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I think the debate on this Bill and on the motion underlines the importance of the value of Dáil debates on such matters.  I think it is true to say that immediately prior to and immediately after the publication of the Bill which is now under discussion, much of the public comment in the media tended to take the view that the Government know best, that the legislation should be accepted <i>in toto</i>, that the situation was extremely serious and that nobody should rock the boat.  Indeed, we were exhorted not to depict Ministers as enemies of civil liberties simply because they were introducing the proposed legislation.  After one day's discussion, the view of the Opposition, as propounded by the Leader and other members of the party, was seen by the public generally to be a sound approach to the problems which face us, and aspects of the Bill which were highlighted by the Opposition were seen by the public to have the inherent dangers which we pointed out. As a result of this, public opinion has changed very considerably in regard to the Bills themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> We now have an official state of emergency because the motion was passed here last night by five votes, but the public do not recognise or see that there is, in fact, a state of emergency.  In any democratic State when the Government wish to declare a state of emergency and when such a declaration is to be accepted by the people, then the people themselves must feel that there is an emergency; they themselves must recognise that such an emergency exists or, alternatively, during the course of the debate the Government must clearly indicate to the people, by producing the necessary evidence, that an emergency exists.  This information which we called for has not been produced by the Government.  The information which was available to the people prior to the introduction of the emergency was all the knowledge they were given.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the people do not agree that there was any cause for declaring an emergency or, therefore, for the introduction of this Bill. I represent a Border constituency and the people there go about their daily avocations without any feeling that there is an emergency.  The vast majority of them abhor, as I do, the activities of illegal organisations, whatever their source.  They are anxious that the Government should be given the necessary powers to safeguard the State but they are convinced that these powers are available or can be made available to the Government without interfering in any way with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley pointed out earlier, the situation is very different from that in 1939 when every individual in the country recognised the need for emergency powers at a time when the whole world was going up in flames.  It has been stated by Government speakers that the 1939 Emergency Powers Act, which was in operation up to yesterday, had existed and that they were simply removing that Act from the Statute Book and replacing it.  The fact is that although technically that is true, the powers under the Act had <Col N="356" /> not been utilised in the past 30 years. Now the Government propose to utilise the powers given under the motion which was passed yesterday.</P>
    <P>What worries me most is that if the Bill is passed and if it is accepted as being constitutionally sound, any Government at any future time can bring in similar emergency powers legislation, for whatever reason.  They can enact laws which could destroy civil liberties, and there would be no way in which they could be prevented from doing so under the Constitution so long as they had a majority in the Dáil.  One of the most serious aspects of this legislation is that any Government in the future have only to suggest that there is an emergency. They will not have to prove anything, as they did not prove anything here this week during the debate on the motion: they can simply state that an emergency exists and then they can bring in any laws they desire.  As we are aware there is no control over them in relation to such laws in so far as the Constitution is concerned.</P>
    <P>The murders of the British Ambassador and Miss Cooke were heinous crimes which were rightly condemned by all right thinking people.  As has been pointed out by a number of Deputies on this side of the House, the new emergency powers will do nothing to avert actions of this kind.  The law as it stands, which provides for the death sentence for the murder of a member of the Diplomatic Corps is the most severe penalty possible.  The impression has been given by the Government that all that is needed at any time to control any given situation is to bring in new legislation.  They have also been trying to give the impression that this legislation will advance the cause of peace.  Of course, legislation of itself will not advance the cause of peace.  This was pointed out by the Leader of this party and by our spokesman on Justice.  They pointed out that the law is quite adequate but the security arrangements are not.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have advocated full support for any proposals to increase the number of gardaí, and for a return <Col N="357" /> to the system of overtime payments to the gardaí in order to ensure that there will be a regular presence of gardaí in all areas, particularly in their own areas where they can be most effective.  Similarly we have advocated the reopening of rural Garda stations. There is no doubt there has been a very serious deterioration in law and order in general since this Government took office.  The wave of crime in all areas is frightening.  Citizens, particularly old people and many young people, are frightened to remain in their homes on their own by day or night.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, we accept that some of these crimes are politically motivated but it is equally clear that a number of them are not.  A very large number of them have gone undetected for the reasons I have mentioned. The law and order image which the Government try so hard to cultivate has been severely tarnished.</P>
    <P>The aim of legislation such as this must be the achievement of peace in our land, not just short-term peace which could possibly be maintained for a short period by repressive laws, but rather peace in the long term which can result only from long, tedious and painstaking efforts.  The obvious purpose of this legislation&mdash;this has been underlined by all speakers on this side &mdash;is simply to attempt to achieve a short term political advantage by endeavouring to distract the attention of the people from the exceptionally severe economic situation with its distressingly high unemployment content. This is nothing more than a callous misuse of the shocking death toll and destruction of the past seven years and, therefore, it must be condemned.  The Government also stand condemned because of their complete lack of policy on the situation in Northern Ireland, which is the basic cause of all our problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress again that Fianna Fáil while in office brought in strong measures to deal with subversion. Despite threats by illegal organisations the Fianna Fáil Government never wavered in their determination to secure the State from these subversive elements and to uphold the rule of law.  The statements on this matter made by the leaders of our Party from its foundation to the present day have shown a very clear consistency.  When legislation was needed to curb or control the activities of illegal organisations, such legislation was enacted by the Fianna Fáil Government.  We recognised, however, that such legislation dealt in the main with the effect rather than the cause.  While ensuring the safety of the State, we, unlike the Coalition, actively pursued a positive policy aimed at unity in a form which <Col N="359" /> would be acceptable to all our people, whatever their class, traditions or creed.</P>
    <P>In recent times we restated that policy in clear and unambiguous terms.  In our document we pointed the road towards peace.  The people know where we stand but they have no idea where the Coalition stand.  The fact that the Coalition have no policy is the root cause of our troubles and until they decide to put forward a worth-while policy, irrespective of what type of Bills are introduced we will still have these difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to quote from the speeches made by members of the present Government when they were speaking on a Bill introduced in 1972 by Deputy O'Malley, the then Minister for Justice.  These quotations have already been used by members of my party and they underline the shallowness of the liberal image that the present Ministers endeavoured to project at that time. When one remembers the speeches, marches and protests in which these gentlemen took part during their time in opposition and compares them with their activities in Government now, one almost despairs of integrity in public life.</P>
    <P>I admit that listening to some of these gentlemen in 1972 I was only too well aware of the fact that they regarded debates in this House as college debates and could have argued eloquently for one side or the other.</P>

      <P>I have already pointed out the serious effects this Bill <Col N="363" /> will have on our economy.  Dundalk, which is a town in my constituency, is a quiet and peaceful town.  The vast majority of the people in that town are law-abiding.  Nobody is afraid to walk the streets in Dundalk but hostile propaganda, particularly from British television programmes and British newspapers, gave the impression that Dundalk was a hot-bed of violence. No new industries have come to Dundalk in recent times.  The unemployment rate in Dundalk is one of the highest in the country.</P>

Now that this Bill is before the House, a Bill relating to emergency powers about which people will be informed all over the world, we will find that the State will be in the same situation in which Dundalk finds itself.  People will be led to believe that there is an emergency and that this is no place in which to invest.</P>

      <P>I just want to refer to the general principle of the Bill and to comment on a few of the observations that I have heard made here this morning.  Deputy Faulkner accused Deputies on this side of falling below what he regards as the high level set by speakers on his side of the House and of indulging in personalities. He then conducted a personal attack on several Deputies, including myself, as he has a right to do.  I am sure we all aspire to a high level of debate.  Perhaps we sometimes achieve it and perhaps we fall below it; perhaps we all fall below it from time to time.  The Taoiseach, as he showed yesterday, is well capable of answering for himself and I do not have to do it for him, but I would like to qualify as inaccurate the description of his remarks as consisting of personalities. It did not.  It was a hard-hitting political speech and I can understand that the Deputies opposite did not like it.  I think it even quite possible that they were not intended to like it, but it was not a string of personalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner was not in the House a little earlier this morning when an incident occurred which was illustrative of a certain level of debate. In the course of a remarkably fine impassioned speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach on this subject, Deputy John Kelly asked, &ldquo;Where could a freer country than Ireland be found?&rdquo; Deputy Haughey interjected sardonically, &ldquo;Russia&rdquo;.  I do not for a moment accuse Deputy Haughey of a belief in the institutions of the Soviet Union.  I do not think he <Col N="365" /> wants to live there.  I think he has intellectual, moral, political and economic objections to living under such a society, so it was a sardonic or facetious interjection.  But Deputy Moore, getting up after the Parliamentary Secretary, referred in a most casual and offhand way to the comment just made by a Labour Member to the effect that Russia was a freer society than Ireland.  Made by a Labour Member, that casually thrown-off sneer, quite repeatable around the country, may no doubt come to be believed by some supporters of the people opposite. I protest against that standard of debate.  I am sorry it should be Deputy Moore I have to take up on this.  It may have been an inadvertent slip.  If so, I hope he will apologise for it.  I will say for him that he is not a Deputy who habitually engages in this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner also said in relation to this Bill, as in relation to this whole group of legislation, that none of this would be necessary if the Government had a policy on Northern Ireland.  Of course, this situation came into being while Fianna Fáil were in Government and while their policy, whatever it was, on the subject was in operation.  This developed, and 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1972 were very fateful years, and years of somewhat changing policy.  What we should be concerned with in relation to the effect of legislation of this type in so far as it bears on the North&mdash;and it necessarily does bear on the North; Deputies opposite have shown at least their understanding of that&mdash;is not the bearing on a territorial claim, but the bearing on people.  It is people we want to bring together in peace.  It is misunderstanding between people we want to heal.</P>
    <P>What has been the reaction so far in Northern Ireland to this group of legislative measures?  We heard an interesting report on that this morning. As those of us who have any interest in Northern Ireland know, there are two morning papers there which may be broadly taken as representative of the two main sections of the community: the <i>Irish News</i> which <Col N="366" /> finds its readership among the Catholic or nationalist section, and the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> which finds its readership among the Protestant or unionist section.  How did those newspapers react representing those sections, that is to say, between them the people of Northern Ireland?  They welcomed this legislation.  They welcomed the state of emergency which has now been declared.  They regretted &mdash;the <i>Irish News</i> in particular&mdash;that the Opposition had taken the line they did, which gave the false impression, as the <i>Irish News</i> rightly said, that there was a serious division of opinion here in relation to the IRA.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the bearing of all this on Northern Ireland&mdash;and I think all of us believe that is part of the interaction between the situation here and there; this is one of the great causes of our troubles&mdash;if we are serious about that, surely to God we ought to pay attention to what these people are saying.  We lecture them <i>ad infinitum</i> but do we listen to them? I should like to leave Deputies opposite a chance of considering that.  Just think about it for a while.</P>
    <P>I should like also briefly to refer to the intervention here of Deputy Thornley.  Deputy Thornley has told us we will know in due course what way he proposes to vote, and that he will vote in accordance with his conscience. I have no doubt whatever that he will vote in accordance with his conscience.  I respect fully his right to do so.  However, in the course of his remarks he also referred to those of us who are going to support this legislation. He suggested, in the course of doing that, that we were necessarily voting against conscience.  People with short memories might think as they heard him that, for example, when we were in Opposition, Deputy Thornley and I were side by side upon the self-same barricades.  We were not.</P>
    <P>In Opposition I supported the Prisons Bill which enabled the transfer of certain categories of prisoners from a prison which they had broken up to military custody.  I also publicly supported the Government order setting up the Special Criminal Court sitting without a jury because of the <Col N="367" /> intimidation matter.  I also strongly, and as some people thought vehemently some over-vehemently, condemned the Provisional IRA and the other IRA from the beginning of their active campaign, consistently through all that period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley from, I believe, a sincere attachment to civil rights, as he saw them, and from to my mind a misguidedly compassionate nature, responded in various ways which could be taken, and were rather widely taken, as gestures of sympathy with the Provisional IRA.  I think he did not so intend them, but I thought they were wrong.  I said so and he responded very vigorously.  He described me&mdash; and we were then in Opposition&mdash;as a succubus, a colourful phrase which became popular for a while among some members of the party opposite.  I have no hard feelings about any of these things, but I would put this to Deputy Thornley.  When he is voting, and thinking, and speaking in accordance with his own conscience, he need not assume that people who differ from him are necessarily voting against their own consciences.  Deputy Thornley is the keeper of his own conscience, but he is not the keeper of mine or of other persons here.  I say that with respect and, if I may say so, affection towards him.</P>

      <P>This main point about the Bill is this: do we believe in the wake of recent events which have been adequately referred to here that the Garda need their hands strengthened by legislation or not?  If we believe that they do&mdash; I believe most people believe so&mdash; then the question is, how do they want their hands strengthened?  On that point, whom do we consult first?  Do we consult the Garda and what is their advice?</P>
      <P>This Bill reflects the matured decision of the Government as to what is necessary in the light of advice received from the Garda.  I believe that if Deputy O'Malley were in the place of my colleague the Minister for Justice today and he received that advice he would either proceed like this or he would do something more drastic such as introduce internment which, it will be recalled, he threatened to do in 1970 on the basis of the reports of which we know nothing further than that there might be kidnappings or murders.  As has been pointed out there have, subsequently, been kidnappings, murders and threats of the kind to which that reaction was sketched in 1970.  Murder and kidnapping, are almost daily occurrences as many Deputies on this side of the House and, probably on the other side of the House for all I know, have reason to be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can this then be described as over-reaction?  The Government's approach to this was to find what is the minimum degree of restriction on normal liberties that is required by this drastic and appalling situation. In my view the Bill before us as a whole represents such a reaction.  I did not understand some of Deputy Thornley's criticisms.  He recited a sad incident which occurred in some place of refreshment in Copenhagen where persons apprehended a citizen and carried him away, apparently, in a vigorous and brutal fashion which we <Col N="370" /> would all deplore.  This was because he asked them to produce identification and, apparently, they refused to do so.  A member of the Garda Síochána who refuses to produce identification would be acting contrary to this Bill and that is one of the safeguards in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>

      <P>We will not dwell unduly on the incident, My point was that these and other safeguards exist and also that we have now what we had not before, a totally independent Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is a matter very relevant to the application of the measures as are proposed here.  I am not going to enter into the sections of this Bill but I shall attend the discussion on Committee Stage.  I note that the Minister has promised to take amendments or suggestions seriously into consideration and if they appear reasonable to him, and the Government, to change or vary the wording of certain aspects.  The Minister has not committed himself to taking any particular action yet and it is natural that he should await further suggestions here and he does so.  Therefore, the debate on this Bill by no means closes on the matter of the principle of the Bill.  I want to express full support for the principle of the Bill, for its necessity and for the fact that it is a moderate response&mdash;we try to be as moderate as we can&mdash;to a very grave situation under which on even lesser provocation the gentlemen opposite who now criticise us for inconsistency would already have introduced internment without trial.</P>

      <P>Unlike the last <Col N="371" /> speaker, I should like to deal with some of the details of the Bill.  Members of my party and I have already given our views generally on the whole exercise that is now going on, the so-called emergency which was described recently by the Minister for Justice as being an emergency with a small &ldquo;e&rdquo;. He felt it was necessary to play down what is now being done and what is backfiring to a great extent.  Firstly, I should like to deal with some of the details in relation to the Bill.  In making suggestions for its improvement I am not to be taken as accepting its necessity which I do not do.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the motion which is referred to in the Long Title of the Bill the Leader of the Opposition, and Deputy Gerry Collins, made reference to the fact that it appeared that the recital in the Long Title was defective inasmuch as it failed to use the phraseology which is necessary under Article 28.3.3º of the Constitution.  In other words, it was not expressed to be for the purpose of securing public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion. Deputy Jack Lynch suggested that, perhaps, the Government instructed the draftsman to leave out the phrase &ldquo;in time of war or armed rebellion&rdquo; on the basis that this would glorify those who were engaging in unlawful activities and elevate them to a status which they might see but which I imagine neither the Government nor the majority of Members of this House would accord to them.  The point was made, and argued, but it was not replied to by the Taoiseach.  As far as I am aware, the point was also made in the Seanad and, as far as I know, was not replied to by the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured last night to find out if there was any case in point on the question.  There was not a case that precisely decided the point but the point never arose before I went through the Emergency Powers Acts which were <Col N="372" /> passed during the war and each one of them in the Long Title correctly expressed what is required to be expressed under Article 28.3.3º. Therefore, there could never have been a case taken precisely on that point.  A number of cases were taken in the course of which various submissions to try to set aside the orders made under the Emergency Powers Acts were made.  One of them was that while the recital of what is necessary under Article 28.3.3º was made in the Acts it was made in the Long Title and not in the enacting part of the Act.  That submission was made in more than one case and it was quite rightly decided against by the Supreme Court.  The nearest that one can get to this precise point among all these various cases is in part of the judgment of the then Chief Justice Sullivan in the matter of the application of Patrick McGrath and Thomas Harte for relief by way of <i>habeas corpus</i> reported in the 1941 Irish Reports page 68 where the Chief Justice in giving the judgment of the Supreme Court on the appeal in that case against the refusal of <i>habeas corpus</i> says at page 76:</P>
      <P>The Emergency Powers Act, 1939 is (in the long title thereof), expressed to be &ldquo;An Act to make provision for securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war,&rdquo; etc.  The Emergency Powers Act, 1940 is expressed to be &ldquo;An Act to amend the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, for the purpose of making better provision for securing the public safety and preservation of the State in time of war,&rdquo; and the Emergency Powers (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1940, is expressed to be &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the Emergency Powers Act 1939, for the purpose of making better provision for securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war&rdquo;.  In our opinion these Acts are clearly expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war, and we see no reason for having this purpose stated in the enacting portion of the statutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> It is, therefore, set out by the then Chief Justice that as long as the words &ldquo;for the purpose of making better provision for securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war&rdquo; are included in the Act irrespective of whether it is in the Long Title or in the enacting part proper, then the Act is valid, provided the entirety of that formula is included in some part of the Act.</P>
    <P>The entirety of that formula is not included in the Bill.  Part of it is and the latter part of it is not.  It was a suggestion of Deputy J. Lynch and Deputy G. Collins, which was not denied or replied to in any way by the Taoiseach in this House last night when he spoke for an hour, not on the debate but on some kind of effort to critise individual members of the Fianna Fáil Party, which is of course a device resorted to by everybody of any party who has nothing positive to say for himself and can do nothing else but criticise those opposite.  It is not replied to by him.  The point has not been denied, and we wait to hear in the hope that we will get an actual proper and reasoned reply to this debate unlike what we got to the last one.  If this submission is wrong or if there are any grounds for believing it is wrong, we would like those grounds set out in some detail.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the judgment I have quoted that the entirety of that formula is necessary to be expressed in the Act; whether in the Long Title as here, or elsewhere in the Act does not matter.  What does matter is that it has to be expressed, and this has not been done.  If it has not been done, the Act does not achieve the purpose which it sets out to achieve, that of avoiding the other provisions of the Constitution and in particular the provisions in Article 40 about <i>habeas corpus.</i> If we are right in that, it would seem that the Act, while of course it will be valid as an Act of Parliament, will not be valid in excluding the operation of Article 40 to anything done under it.  The point is one of considerable importance.  If the Minister does not concede this and does not amend the Long Title accordingly to bring the Act within Article <Col N="374" /> 28 of the Constitution, the Bill when, presuming, it is passed in this form by both Houses of the Oireachtas and sent to the President for signature, should then be referred by him to the Supreme Court to decide before he signs it whether or not it is valid for the purposes of Article 28, in the light of the failure of the Bill to contain the formula which Article 28 makes necessary and which each of the numerous earlier Emergency Powers Acts during the war did themselves contain. I hope that the President, when considering this, might well consider having the advice of the Council of State in relation to the question as well before he makes a decision as to whether or not there should be a reference of the Bill under Article 26.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to come to in relation to this Bill is one which I made when I spoke on the motion passed yesterday which is referred to in the Bill.  That is that it is noteworthy, and I think it has not been noted by the media or the public generally, that neither this Bill nor the Criminal Law Bill which more or less goes with it, repeal any provision of the Offences Against the State Acts of 1939 or 1940, or, for that matter, 1972. In particular, section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, is not repealed by this Bill.  Assuming that this Bill is passed in substantially the form in which it is now, there will be no repeal of section 30.  Section 30 will remain in force and, of course, it will be open to the gardaí to avail of the powers available to them under section 30.  No doubt they will do so and will continue to do so.  That allows, as the House is aware, the arrest and detention for the purpose of questioning for a period of up to 48 hours of a person who is suspected of particular types of crime or having been involved or about to become involved in a particular type of crime.  At the end of that 48-hour period if there is a nominal release, for example, a release as was the practice in the past before someone was arrested and charged, a release as far as the doorway or the steps of the Bridewell in Dublin, it is open to the same gardaí then at the expiration of that 48-hour period to re-arrest and redetain the person concerned under <Col N="375" /> section 2 of this Bill for a further 48 hours, and then under a certificate of the chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána to detain them for a further five days.</P>
    <P>Without repeating any of the processes which are open to the Garda, this is a total period of detention without trial and without charge, not of 48 hours as we have at the moment or of seven days as it has been suggested by the Government is the alternative from 48 hours, but in fact of nine days.  I made this point at some length in the course of the debate here on Tuesday last on this motion.  No doubt if I were wrong the Taoiseach in replying to the debate last night, and he had of course unlimited time in which to reply, would have said that I was wrong.  He has not said that I am wrong.  Neither did the Minister for Justice in his speech in this House last night opening this debate.  I have no doubt that if I were wrong the Minister would have said so.  I am inviting him even now while he is present in the House to say to me that I am wrong if he believes I am wrong.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to know what is appropriate.  It depends on which part of the House one is in at a particular time.  It seems to me&mdash;and it has not been denied although there have been ample opportunities to deny it&mdash;that it is open without any repetition whatever of the use of powers under this or the existing legislation to detain somebody for nine days without bringing him to trial or without even charging him.  The Government themselves admit that the additional <Col N="376" /> seven days detention which they propose here is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It was fair that they should announce it because it obviously is a breach.  It is a sign of the times that apart from the Minister's announcement of it, I have not heard much comment on that.  It appears that it no longer matters whether or not legislation which is now before the House is in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I am not berating the Government specifically or alone in this.  I can remember a time when it did matter, which is not so long ago, and a time when the people who blandly now, with their eyes open and in full knowledge of the breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, would go, and did go, almost apoplectic about what they feared might possibly be a breach.</P>
      <P>I am referring to the 1972 Act where it subsequently turned out that there was no breach.  I remember Deputy Richie Ryan, now the Minister for Finance, nearly blew his gasket at the prospect of this country deliberately breaching the European Convention on Human Rights.  At that time, as Deputy Thornley has put it, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, now Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, was a liberal humanist, and the thought at that stage that the Government and the Irish Parliament would consciously breach the European Convention on Human Rights was a matter which he could not contemplate.  As Deputy Thornley has put it, happily for people such as that their consciences can, indeed, become elastic and have become so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 of this Bill is curious.  It is quite new in any form of emergency powers legislation.  The net effect of it is that this is not just a 12-month Bill. It is renewable by Government order virtually for ever, and the only final halt that can be called to this Emergency Powers Bill which is before us now is a resolution that the state of emergency which this House in its wisdom decided last night existed has come to an end.  There are a series of provisions in section 1 the net effect of which is that the Act need never go out of force until this so-called state <Col N="377" /> of emergency ends.  I would ask Deputies who think that, perhaps, there might be nothing wrong in the fact that the Government should be allowed by its own order without any reference whatever to the Oireachtas or this House to keep emergency legislation of this kind in force to look at the emergency powers Acts from 1939 up to 1945.  Even though they were passed at a time of genuine national and international emergency of the deepest and most severe kind, nowhere were these Acts capable of continuing in force for more than 12 months unless the Oireachtas by legislation decided to reenact them for a further period of 12 months.  That is what happened right through the war.</P>
    <P>There were, of course, a number of amending Acts of the original Act of 1939 but as well as that every year there was what was described as emergency powers continuance Acts. In spite of the enormous difficulties that Ireland and Europe generally were in in those years from 1939 onwards the Government and the Oireachtas of the day did not think it proper that powers such as those given in an Emergency Powers Act should be continued for more than 12 months without the legislative decision expressed in an Act passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas to renew it for a further period.</P>
    <P>Each period of continuance or renewal was not a blanket one.  It was for 12 months only.  That was done right through the war until the 3rd September, 1945, when the last such Act was passed which more or less coincided with the end of the war. The war in Japan, as far as I remember, ended about ten days after that and the last Act expired on the 2nd September, 1946.  It was not renewed and in spite of the efforts of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, who quite honestly, should know better, and some other people who might be excused, there has not been in this country an effective state of emergency since the 2nd September, 1946, which is 30 years ago today. Once those Acts have expired as they did by virtue of their own provisions on the 2nd September, 1946, it was <Col N="378" /> impossible for a Fianna Fáil Government, a Coalition Government or any other kind of Government that there might have been in the intervening 30 years, to bring back into force any emergency legislation because that emergency legislation could only have been re-enacted by the Oireachtas by reference to the national emergency that was declared by resolution of the two Houses on the 2nd September, 1939 and which referred specifically to the war then commencing in Europe.</P>
    <P>No Government&mdash;and let us recall that there were nine-and-a-half years of Coalition Government in the past 30 years&mdash;neither Fianna Fáil nor Coalition thought it right or proper to seek to introduce any emergency legislation or reactiviate any emergency legislation in the past 30 years for the very reason that it was not open to them to do it, the emergency referred to in the resolution of the 2nd September, 1939, having clearly come to an end at the end of 1945.  I know there is provision in the second amendment to Article 28 to enable that situation to continue for some time after the end of hostilities and it did continue for some time after the end of hostilities. Hostilities in Europe ended in the early summer of 1945 and hostilities in the Pacific ceased in the middle of September, 1945 but nonetheless the Acts were allowed to remain in force until 2nd September, 1946.  After that it was not open to any Government to seek to use the protection of that resolution which was passed on 2nd September, 1939 to hang emergency legislation on it, and, to the credit of all Governments in the intervening 30 years, none of them attempted to do so.  When the present Government in its wisdom or otherwise&mdash;I think it is very much otherwise in this context&mdash; decided that it was necessary to bring in emergency legislation it was advised &mdash;and obviously properly advised&mdash; that it could not do it under the resolution of 2nd September, 1939, which technically had never been rescinded and that it would have to bring in a resolution referring to the existing situation. The Government did that.  I believe it has done so defectively, that the form in which it did it is defective <Col N="379" /> in the sense that the wrong recital appears in this Bill.  However, that is a detail even though an important one.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that section 1 here goes far beyond the provisions of any of the wartime Acts when there was a real emergency that everybody could feel palpably.  In effect, although it is a very long section, when one reads it through it means that the Government by order can keep this Act in force for as long as the resolution passed last night remains unrescinded and the time limit, such as it is, on this Bill is the extent of the time during which that resolution remains unrescinded.  That could be a very long time because it refers to armed conflict in Northern Ireland and it would be an optimist and, perhaps, not very much of a realist who would say there will not be armed conflict in Northern Ireland in the reasonably foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his speech, part of which was on this Bill, said that one of the great safeguards under the Bill was that we now had an independent Director of Public Prosecutions and that this was not so in the past, the implication being that before the Director of Public Prosecutions was appointed there was something improper or selective in the bringing of prosecutions by one or more attorney generals.  I deny that any such inference was justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why the statement should have been made unless that inference was intended is difficult to see.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs likes to make this kind of miserable point and, for once, I may descend to his level and point out that under this Bill there is no offence and there are no offences. Therefore, there is no question of a prosecution and nothing to be decided either by the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General. This is one of the significant things about the Bill, that there is no offence.  It is a short Bill through <Col N="380" /> which one can glance in a half-minute. The only thing it provides for is the right to detain without trial or charge&mdash;internment in effect.  It is not called that by name but that is the effect of it as I demonstrated earlier, detention or internment if you wish to describe it as that without trial or without charge for nine days when taken in conjunction with section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which is not repealed. There must be very few Bills, if any, in our legislative history that are like this Bill in that they do not create any offence and provide only for arrest and detention without charge.  The question of the Director of Public Prosecutions making up his mind does not arise.  He does not decide who is to be interned or detained under this: the Garda do it. Let us hope when it is passed that it will remain that only the Garda will decide on the arrest of people and that the power will not be widened to any group beyond them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is disturbing is that in the comparatively long term, the second part of the detention provided for here, the five-day period, the decision in this respect is to be made by a chief superintendent.  I have thought about this, whether it is appropriate that a chief superintendent who is not answerable to anyone other than his superiors, not answerable to this House or the public, should have the right to detain somebody without charge or trial for five days or whether, as is done in Britain and the North, the decision should be made by the Secretary of State in Northern Ireland, the equivalent of whom would be the Minister for Justice here.  As a former holder of that office, I am not too sure that I would wish to have to make those decisions but from the public point of view I can see a far greater safeguard in the fact that the Minister for Justice for the time being should have to make the decisions and should be answerable to the representatives of the people here for those decisions.  It is a far more serious decision to intern or detain somebody for nine days without trial or charge than to imprison him after conviction for, perhaps, 12 months because the implications of detaining <Col N="381" /> him are far greater than if he had been found guilty of some offence or crime for which he could and should legitimately be sent to prison.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the fact also that this Bill, assuming it is correctly expressed, can be passed only because of the motion passed here last night but that motion, while empowering the passing of this Bill, does not confine its operation to this Bill.  There is nothing to stop a dozen or 50 other Bills described as emergency powers Bills and having that very onerous provision being introduced and passed by the Government having a majority in this House.  They cannot be passed without the consent of the House but it will not again be necessary, while the motion passed last night remains in force, to have any such motion passed to enable any further legislation to be brought forward.</P>
    <P>The first of these Bills&mdash;one hopes the only one but certainly we got no guarantee of that last night from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice&mdash; relates to the detention of people without charge for nine days.  I approached this measure before I heard the Taoiseach speak on Tuesday with a pretty open mind.  I would have no objection to giving powers of detention for seven or nine days if I thought it would achieve anything.  I am not satisfied that it will.  It has not been demonstrated to me that it will.  If, as has been stated occasionally, the Garda find a 48-hour period inadequate&mdash;perhaps there have been occasions when they have found it inadequate&mdash;there is nothing to stop them releasing the particular individual and redetaining him for another six or 12 hours.</P>

      <P>I, too, believe it is wrong.  It is very hard to envisage a case where, if a charge is going to be brought, that charge could not be brought at the expiration of 48 hours. <Col N="382" /> The Minister tells me, and I am glad to hear it, that the reuse of section 30 would be an abuse, in his view, and if it happened he says it was wrong.  Unfortunately, it will not be an abuse, when this Bill is passed, to detain a person for 48 hours under the existing section 30 and immediately afterwards detain him for five days under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister thinks it will, then there is an obligation on him to put in a provision to prevent that happening.  He could do that by repealing the relevant section of the 1939 Act and, if he does not wish to do that, he could put another section into this Bill to prevent that happening.  We cannot speculate as to what other forms of emergency power legislation may arise in the future. We will have to wait and see.  We express the hope, not with any great confidence, that no more such legislation will arise, but far more onerous Bills could arise in the future than the one we are discussing now, serious as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties about this seven-day or nine-day period&mdash;the Minister says he will take steps to ensure it will not be a nine-day period&mdash;is the fact that the ordinary prison rules will not presumably apply to people detained because they will not necessarily be detained in a prison.  The section says they may be detained at some other convenient place.  Whatever that may be I am not too sure. I suppose it could be a small Garda station, or a prison, or some other convenient place.  It would, I suppose, be rather illogical if prison rules applied in these places.  One is concerned, therefore, that the detainee should have access to legal and medical advice.  These would be accessible to him in a prison.  His family and relatives should be informed as to his whereabouts.  The Minister should amend this Bill to cover that situation.  On Committee Stage, if the Bill goes that far, we will certainly introduce amendments to ensure regulations being made allowing <Col N="383" /> for access to legal and medical advice. A person detained for seven, or nine, days should not be any worse off in terms of his rights compared with somebody remanded in custody pending trial.  Such a person while in custody is entitled to see his solicitor, every day if he so wishes, and to see the prison doctor, every day if he so wishes.  There should also be provision for the immediate notification of the family of the individual detained.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's introductory speech twice last night.  It did not take very long.  It covers just two pages.  It is unfortunate in a matter of great moment like this we should get just two pages from the Minister: &ldquo;This is what is in the Bill.  You can like it or lump it and I do not greatly care whether you like it or lump it because I have a majority of four, five or six, or whatever it is, behind me and we will pass the Bill anyway and I will just sit down now and hear what you have to say and, despite what anyone says here or elsewhere, the Bill will go through.&rdquo; Even though the Bill is so short there are many matters in it that are unusual, indeed unique, matters that have not been seen for 30 years to this very day and one would have expected that these would have been explained and their merits and demerits gone into in much greater detail.</P>
    <P>One would have hoped, above all else, that the need for such provisions would have been adequately demonstrated. It has not.  It is quite patent it has not.  All we had demonstrated in the long recital from the Taoiseach was the number of very serious crimes which have taken place over the last three-and-a-half years.  Long as the list is, it was by no means complete.  He could have made as long a list again of all kinds of serious problems that have taken place since this Government came to office.  The bringing into the building housing the Special Criminal Court of explosives and the use of those explosives by prisoners to blow their way out of the cells was one thing aimed at the administration of justice.  The other was the tragic and horrible murder of the British Ambassador and the young <Col N="384" /> lady travelling with him.  Having given us the list of crimes, the Taoiseach described them as culminating in these two most serious of all.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear by numerous speakers on this side and by some, I think, on the Government side, and not denied by anyone, that if this state of emergency we now enjoy had been in existence two or three months ago neither of these two crimes would have been inhibited, these two crimes which are the justification for this legislation.  The existence of a state of emergency would not have inhibited these crimes or prevented them happening. It would not have prevented those things happening because legislation was not relevant to them.  What was relevant to them was ordinary police security.  Unfortunately, it fell down and fell down very seriously.  I am sorry to have to say that but it is undeniable.  The primary reason it fell down was because of the unhappiness so rampant in the force today and the foolish way it is being administered at present&mdash;the inspections taking place at present about which there are endless complaints.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that, on the one hand, we have the Government telling us that we have a state of national emergency and at the same time senior officers of the Garda Síochána going around the country reprimanding sergeants and gardaí in country stations because their bicycles are not sufficiently polished and because minute and technical remenants of regulations which might have had some bearing 30 or 40 years ago, but which have none whatever today, are not being complied with.  That is a futile exercise and does cause the unhappiness and disaffection which exists today and which, in turn, may well be responsible to quite a degree for the unfortunate breaches of security which have happened over the past year or two.</P>
    <P>I have refrained from making the kind of speech the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made&mdash;recriminations about what happened in the past; justifications for what he did in the past; half-hearted apologies for the <Col N="385" /> fact that he has been held up in public as the leading hypocrite in this country.  I have not gone into that at all even though I have every justification for doing so.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to refer, not to all the goodies that are in Volume 264 of the Official Report and what was said on 29th and 30th November, 1972, and 1st December, 1972, but to what happened in this House on 15th February, 1966.  There was an official Labour Party Bill, before the House, supported by all members of the Labour Party which then, happily for the Labour Party, did not contain the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but a group of people whom he in that very year described as poltroons, when the entirety of the Labour Party sought to get this House to repeal the Offences Against the State Acts of 1939 and 1940.  There was a debate on that Bill in which a number of Labour speakers put forward the necessity for repealing those Acts on the grounds that they were improper, excessive and undesirable and which, in a democratic society, should not exist. It was described as the official view of the Labour Party and ratified at annual party conferences.  The then Minister for Justice, now Senator Lenihan, said that the purpose of the Acts was to enable the State, in times of difficulty, to defend itself and its institutions and that it would be unwise to seek to repeal them. There was a division called.  The whole Labour Party, as it then existed, voted for the repeal of those two Acts and they were supported by quite a number of Fine Gael Members. I was looking at the list and there are some very interesting people who voted at that time for the repeal of the Offences Against the State Act.  One of them must be one of the greatest converts of all time from his views as of 15th February, 1966, the present Minister for Defence, then Deputy Donegan, who was very irked indeed that there should be such disgraceful and onerous laws on the statute book as the Offences Against the State Acts of 1939 and 1940.  Another was <Col N="386" /> Deputy Richie Ryan, now Minister for Finance.  Another was Deputy James Tully&mdash;of course he was in the Labour Party anyway&mdash;and yet another was Deputy Clinton, now Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, indeed a fairly representative list of people who now form the greatest law and order government this country, I suppose even Europe, has ever known.</P>
    <P>The only remaining thing I want to say in relation to this Bill and the whole package now before us is to contrast, as I did to some extent the other day, the atmosphere that exists here today, existed yesterday and the day before in the House in relation to the debate now taking place, and about which there is disagreement in the House as there was before, with that which existed here in November and December, 1972.  I want to contrast the helpful and constructive speeches made here today, yesterday and the day before from these benches with the kind of speeches made by, above all others, the two Ministers who now sit opposite me, the Ministers for Justice and Posts and Telegraphs, one of whom described the Offences Against the State Act, 1972, as a fraud, the other of whom described that Act as something that one would not see even on the statute book of South Africa.  If that Act could not even be seen on the statute book of South Africa are there words or expressions in the English language strong enough to describe the Bill we are debating today?  I do not think there are.  I suppose one could say that, outside of communist countries, South Africa is the most repressive country in the world today.  If the 1972 Bill was so bad that it would not even be in the statute book of South Africa, in the statute book of what country could this Bill and the motion we passed last night be placed?</P>
    <P>It has been remarked by a number of speakers here that there is no feeling of an emergency in the country at present.  So far as security is concerned at any rate there is a very strong feeling that can best be summed up by a headline I saw in one of this morning's newspapers.  We owe £889 million in <Col N="387" /> foreign debts.  That is certainly an emergency.  But there is no feeling of emergency in the sense of present and gripping fear felt by people.  I should like to contrast that feeling today, which is best demonstrated by the fact that outside the gates of this House, last night, anyway, and again this morning when I came in, and presumably it is still the same, there was not one person other than a couple of gardaí having a chat and the odd foreign tourist, with the nights of 28th and 29th November, 1972, when there were 6,000 people howling in Molesworth Street, howling to burn this House down?  Do you remember on that night when there were 1,000 unarmed gardaí at the front and back of this House?  Do you remember on that night when there were 100 armed troops in the roadway between the back of Government Buildings and the side of the new block here waiting to be called in if and when the 1,000 gardaí had to give way under the assaults of the mob which assaulted them continuously for two nights?  Do you recall that, at that time, there were Members of Parliament for Northern Ireland egging on that mob?  Do you recall that, at that time, there were Members of this House giving every succour and encouragement to that mob?  Go out to Molesworth Street today; you will meet three gardaí and they are not even needed.  There is the occasional tourist walking up and down, looking in and wondering what the building is.</P>
    <P>That is the difference between 1972 when people in this House had to stand up and be counted and when people in this House had to defy a mob 50 yards from the gates who were endeavouring to burn down this House and everyone in it.  That was the time when it took courage to deal with the people we hear so roundly condemned by all and sundry today but when I and my fellow members in Government in 1970, 1971 and 1972 deplored the activities of those subversives and condemned them we got very little sympathy in this House.</P>
    <P>There was a very different atmosphere in this House then from what is here now and there was a very <Col N="388" /> different atmosphere outside the House.  The people who happen to be in Government at this time are very lucky indeed that there are people on this side of the House making the kind of speeches that are being made, suggesting amendments to Bills, trying to help out and trying to preserve some sanity at a time when the only question of a national emergency is not an emergency that can be cured by what we are discussing today.  It can only be cured by the resolution of the Government to tackle the real problems and, if they are not prepared to do it, let them get out.  They should call an election in order that the people can do what they so patently want to do, namely, to elect a Government who can deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the members of the Government that they are not dealing with a national emergency in security at this time.  There were people who had to deal with it in November, 1972, and precious little help they got on that occasion to deal with what was a real emergency.  We showed we could do it and, on our return to power, not alone can we deal with the real security emergency as we did in those days but we can deal with the even more important economic emergency that is paralysing the country.  For the sake of the country that is what we seek above all else to have the opportunity to do very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion that was passed last night I asked some specific questions I hoped the Taoiseach or some member of the front bench would answer.  However, these questions were not answered and I can only assume that this Bill, like the motion yesterday, is a non-event. In other words, there is no emergency of a national nature, no danger to the safety of the institutions of the State arising from an armed conflict or war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach who spoke at length made no effort to answer specific questions.  Instead, he took up the time of the House in a quite unstatesmanlike manner; he clouded the issue by making snide remarks about the lack of action by previous Governments <Col N="389" /> or their over-reaction in other circumstances which he did not consider to be as serious as the circumstances of today.</P>
    <P>The Government have at their disposal knowledge that is not available to other Members of this House and I asked that an effort be made to tell the House if there was a situation that could be accepted as constituting a threat to the safety of our people and to the preservation of the State.  I did not ask the Taoiseach to tell us what it was.  I accepted that it might not be prudent for the Government to publicise information at their disposal and I was prepared to accept an assurance from a Government speaker that behind the scenes there was a reason and justification for the passing of the motion before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not refer to that question.  Instead, he proceeded to chip away at what had been done in the past, to make little of difficult circumstances encountered by previous Governments.  He went on to talk about his experience of repressive legislation.  He told us that when he was a member of the Opposition, as he was for many years, it was not only just a matter of illegal organisations or repressive legislation which they had to fight against.  In those unspecified times he said they were not allowed to speak outside without being howled down, that busloads of people were brought from all kinds of places into public meetings held by Fine Gael in order to prevent them being heard and to deny them the right of free speech. He added that these people who were brought in were &ldquo;tanked up&rdquo; if they were not making enough noise.  He told us they were &ldquo;tanked up by the tacateers&rdquo;&mdash;I think those were the terms he used.</P>
    <P>He chided people who do not agree with him on this occasion for talking rather lightly of the present situation instead of answering the questions put to him that have a relevance and an important relationship to the measure we are discussing.  It is only right to refer to the fact that he and the party he lead in opposition have not much to be proud of if we want to go back <Col N="390" /> over the years on what repression really meant.  He and his political party have nothing to be proud of so far as shouting down is concerned or trying to usurp the powers of government when we consider the relationship that existed between the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the Blueshirt movement of the early thirties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should beware of talking in that way in order to try to extricate himself out of a very difficult and dicey situation as far as the motion declaring a national emergency and this Bill are concerned.  He should be careful in defending himself that he does not leave himself open to much more serious charges so far as his predecessors and his party's predecessor, Cumann na nGaedheal, later Fine Gael, were concerned.  I do not want to go back even further to talk about what the Taoiseach and those who went before him, whom he has succeeded both from a party point of view and otherwise, did, how they repressed, discriminated and bludgeoned their way through.  It is there for anybody to read about.  I do not intend to go into this any further because it is not the relevant point we should be talking about.  The Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, decided to dig into those things in a very unstatesmanlike manner.  He should be aware that too much of the digging may not be to his advantage.</P>
    <P>All through the Taoiseach's rather disjointed contribution on the close of the debate on the motion yesterday he attempted to justify the extraordinary situation we now find ourselves in of being in a national emergency as a result of the procedures in this House and in the Seanad.  He attempted to justify that extraordinary situation which nobody, including himself, bebelieves exists.  There is no evidence that it exists.  The Taoiseach attempted to justify this by going back again and making little of the difficulties met by previous Administrations when they had to take particular actions.  If he does not agree with those actions what is his record in the House so far as his disagreement in relation to them is concerned?  He is usually regarded as an honest man but how can he live up to that reputation of honesty when he <Col N="391" /> tries to justify the present outlandish situation by denigrating the Government of some 20 years ago for the actions they felt they were obliged to take in the circumstances of the time? It now appears that the actions they took were not merited so how can that be used as a justification for doing something that is equally as wrong, even by the Taoiseach's own standards?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement last night was disjointed, perhaps ill-conceived, and utilised merely to confuse the situation still further with catch-cries poked in here and there to try to revive the flagging spirits of his own supporters in the benches behind him, to get them worked up emotionally to feel that there is some great cause they are fighting for in their support of this Bill following on the stupidity of yesterday.  I have asked the Taoiseach and members of his Government a very pertinent question on many occasions.  I have also asked it of the previous Government.  What organisations have been proscribed under our existing laws?  I got no answer.  They sing dumb on this.</P>
    <P>It appears as if there is only one organisation proscribed, that is the IRA.  What sort of obsession have the Government got regarding the IRA, ignoring the fact that there is no evidence, despite all their best efforts and the efforts of the Garda and others, to prove that the IRA have been responsible for all the 37 deaths spoken about here or even the majority of them?  Why are we not looking further afield?  Why are we so reluctant to name the other organisations that we have evidence of over the years that have perpetrated damage, injury, and perhaps death on the people this side of the Border?  Why are they being ignored?</P>
    <P>The Government, in their lofty towers, may not be aware that people are very cynical in regard to this issue.  Is there no violence except IRA violence?  Why are the members of the Government blinkered to the degree that they only see violence emanating from one source?  How can the Government, under the <Col N="392" /> authority of what was passed yesterday, in all honesty ignore what I have already said and ignore even still further the violence of the Establishment in the Six Counties, the violence of the British Army in the Six Counties?  How can they on this particular day ignore that violence of a vicious and brutal nature has been perpetrated time and time again by the British Army, their secret agents, their special regiments, their SAS and their murder squads on the people of this country, and not necessarily confined to north of the Border?  How can they, with any semblance of honesty, derogate, as they are now doing and have done, from the Convention on Human Rights when on this day we should expect to see our case against the excesses, brutalities and torture methods of the British Army proved?  How can we at the same time with any decent face on things derogate from that convention when we as a Government on behalf of our people, and in particular on behalf of our people in the north, went all the way through the various processes during the past five years of European commissions and courts in an effort to bring home to the world what had happened?  In these circumstances how can we assume such a contradictory role and continue to be obsessed with the idea that violence emanates only from one source?  I cannot understand how people can be so blinkered as to be able to see only the one source of violence and danger when on more than one occasion it has been hammered home to us that the real enemies of our people circulate freely among us, are not even proscribed in so far as membership of their organisations is concerned, let alone to be identified publicly, hounded or harassed by our security forces.</P>
    <P>After all these years of so much investigation what information is there as to who was responsible for the bombings in Dublin in November, 1972?  There is no answer forthcoming. Consequently we can take it that there is no knowledge as to who was responsible or may we take it that there is knowledge available to the Government in this regard which <Col N="393" /> would prove embarrassing to their course of action at present and to their emphasis on the violence emanating from one source only?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely emergency powers are woven inextricably with the declaration of the emergency which to my mind is a phoney, a situation which does not exist.  Article 28 of the Constitution is being used as an umbrella for this measure but we are being told calmly that this was not necessary since there had been a state of emergency in existence since 1939. I have asked that the Government inform us as to reason for this measure. I had assumed that there were reasons for their actions but in the absence of any explanation to this effect from the Taoiseach I realise that I assumed wrongly.  However, if for security reasons there are some grounds for this measure which cannot be made known to us we should at least be told that such grounds exist.  Instead, we have not been told anything to suggest that there is justification for this legislation.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether the real purpose of this Bill and of the motions passed by both Houses yesterday is to enable the Government to use the powers they are seeking, not for reasons of public safety or the preservation of the State against armed conflict, but to cover up the disastrous situation in which the country finds itself financially and economically.  In their wisdom they may foresee the more pressing difficulties that will arise from this situation of financial bankruptcy in the coming winter months.  Naturally if that is so they cannot tell us because such an emergency would not conform with the Article of the Constitution on which this whole charade depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision to extend by order the period of the operation of this Bill, that is, a year, causes me some concern. Does such provision conform with the Article of the Constitution <Col N="394" /> which makes it possible to bring this measure before the House?  Once a national emergency has been declared it remains in existence until such time as it may be declared to have expired and this must be done by way of motion in each House of the Oireachtas.  If I am right in this regard how can it be extended by order?  I doubt if there is any such provision in the Article of the Constitution concerned.</P>
    <P>But assuming that what is proposed conforms with the Constitution, there remains the situation as set out in section 1 (2) (b) that:</P>
    <P>at any time when section 2 of this Act is in force, that that section shall cease to be in force on and from a date specified in the order.</P>
    <P>That falls into the same category as paragraph (a) of that subsection.  But the provision that is even more difficult to grasp is in paragraph (c) of the same subsection which reads that the Government may by order provide that:</P>
    <P>at any time when section 2 of this Act is not in force, that that section shall come into force again and remain in force for a period not exceeding twelve months from the commencement of the order.</P>
    <P>Therefore, not only may we expect to have a termination by order of these provisions but we can have a revival of the effective part of this legislation, namely, section 2, at any time by order of the Government.  Of course as is the standard practice with the orders of this House and as is stated here, any such order made in such manner by the Government under this section 1 will have the full force of law unless it is annulled within 21 sitting days of this House by a majority of the House.  Such an order could be made before going into what could be an extended summer recess, and the 21 sitting days would be a long time in coming. Yet what would purport to have been done by that order in relation to the operations of section 2 of this Bill would continue to be in effect or would have been brought into effect merely by an order the annulment of <Col N="395" /> which is the only thing open to this House.  Since the Government who would have made the order are the people who dictate when the House shall meet, then if they do not want an annulment, even though it might be the wish of the House to do so, they can frustrate such annulment indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is just window dressing. Window dressing has been talked about from the Fianna Fáil benches yesterday and was referred to by the Taoiseach scathingly last night.  Even the Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, in talking in the debate in 1972 on the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill referred to window dressing, although he has been quite happy since then to use the widow dressing himself and to add to the frills to the window dressing at the moment.  Section 1 is merely a sham which is in keeping with the whole business.  I suppose, therefore, it is only right that it is a sham but it is important that it should be seen to be such.</P>
    <P>There is another point that was mentioned here again in a negative way in furtherance of the bringing in of this declaration of an emergency which enables this kind of legislation to be introduced.  Past Governments and Administrations have been chided by speakers of the front bench over there for their failure to do anything about the real cause of our troubles around which we have built this myth of a national emergency on this side of the Border.  Maybe there was not much done or that could be done.  I shall not go into that here.  But, on the one hand, having made the charge about so little being done, they boast about what they have done in regard to the root cause of the trouble, that by consultation and discussion with British Government Ministers they got them to agree that if and when a majority of the people of the Six Counties, not of this country, agree that Britain should go, she will not stand in their way.  I think the Coalition have a bloody cheek coming in here whispering about that, not to mind boasting about it as they have <Col N="396" /> done.  Neither the Government nor I nor anybody else here has any right or mandate to say that our time-honoured rightful claim to all of the land of this island can be thrown away and how any group in any part of this territory of the island of Ireland can dictate when or how or in what place it can be given away or retained by somebody else.  I take exception to that because it has always been held until quite recently that it is all the people of this island who have the right to decide what is the fate of this island, what its future is to be.  While they may have been thwarted over the generations and over the centuries, that in no way takes away from the rightfulness of the claim of the majority of the people of this island to determine its future.  I would say to those who are boasting that it is a shameful performance on their part.  They are really selling out and making political capital out of the situation.</P>
    <P>If you feel unhappy about section 2 of the Bill, do not be reassured by what has gone before.  It is interesting that that should have gone first.  It is just part of the act of bamboozling some of those who may feel somewhat conscience-striken about supporting the Government who are bringing this kind of legislation through the House, who when they were the Opposition objected strenuously not so very long ago to legislation that is now there and that is regarded by many as being sufficient to the needs of our time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On this business of the Garda and Army, or others unidentified having powers of stopping and arresting&mdash;I do not differentiate between them one way or the other &mdash;I take particular exception to it and will in no circumstances abide by it myself.  Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána (on production of his identification card, if demanded, where he is not in uniform) may without a warrant stop, search, question and arrest any person, or do any one or more of those things in respect of any person, if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person has committed, is committing or is about to commit an offence under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or an offence which is for the time being a a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of that Act, or if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person is carrying any document or other article or thing, or is in possession of information, relating to the commission or intended commission of the offence.</P>
      <P>A person can be stopped by a non-uniformed person of whatever force. This is what I say is so damnably dangerous and it shows the stupidity and lack of knowledge of the real situation for those of us who are close enough to the Border to know what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will totally and completely disregard an order to stop in or near the Border area if the person giving the order is not clearly identifiable as a member of our own security forces.  I say this because it is at one's peril that one stops in those regions.  I prefer to face the consequences of such action rather than to take what might be my lot if I should stop.  I am quite sure <Col N="398" /> that the great majority of the people I represent and those living in the Border areas will see the absolute folly of what is being proposed here.  It is not only dangerous but there is the risk that people may be hijacked on and around the Border areas or, for that matter, in any part of the country.  I am sure that the Minister for Defence. Deputy Donegan, who is a close neighbour of the Border himself, is bound to be aware of what I am saying. This measure is so dangerous that it will set people up.  This facility is being offered under the guise of this Bill, unintentionally no doubt, in ignorance and in stupidity, but it is nevertheless unforgivable.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposed detention for seven days, I requested the Ceann Comhairle that this should be explained to those of us who do not understand why it is needed.  Another speaker has asked: what is it that one can expect to get from a person detained for seven days that one cannot get from him in 48 hours?  I ask that question again.  What useful purpose is served by seven days?  The Taoiseach spoke last night about things being so complicated throughout the country that it is necessary to hold somebody because he might interfere with somebody else that they are trying to get after.  That is a bit far-fetched.  It is not an answer to the genuine question&mdash;why seven days' detention?</P>
    <P>Why, also, the provision that a person so arrested, so detained, may be removed to and kept in custody in a Garda station, prison or other convenient place?  Is the reference to &ldquo;some other convenient place&rdquo; merely a convenient way of ensuring that it is not known, to anybody outside the immediate security forces, where a detainee is within the seven days of his detention?  Is that the purpose of it? Is it designed to conceal from anybody concerned with the person so detained where he might be?  Are we to take it as well that all the rights of the person detained are withdrawn?  Has he no right to communicate with family, friends, solicitor, business associates or anybody else?  Is that so?  This would appear to be the situation.  Why is that sort of treatment necessary?  Why will it be necessary to deny the natural and <Col N="399" /> normal rights of anybody in detention?</P>
    <P>It is an absolutely disgraceful situation that we are going to utilise the powers conferred in this phoney national emergency in legislation such as this.  We are going to deny the basic fundamental rights of people who may be detained, innocent or guilty, though the great majority will be innocent. They will be denied any communication with the outside world.  We are not given to understand that the authorities will be obliged to convey to the detainee's family that he is, in fact, in detention.  It is madness in these circumstances to expect the public to go along with that.</P>
    <P>There was talk about the similarity, or the lack of similarity, between now and the previous declaration of emergency in 1939.  There was no doubt in 1939 that there was a real emergency.  There was no disputation in a real sense within the Houses of the Oireachtas as to the declaration of that state of emergency.  There were no fears expressed as to the validity of the intentions of the Government of the day and what they might do, how they might abuse or misuse what powers would become available to them under the Constitution as a result of the declaration of an emergency. The main thing was that there was no division among our representatives at that time.  Immediately thereafter we had the unusual situation of politicians from both sides of this House on the same platforms&mdash;I do not mean political platforms&mdash;pushing the idea of joining the local defence forces and so on.  In other words, they knew it was an emergency and there was no division among the representatives and no division in the public mind.  That is the difference between that situation and the present situation.</P>
    <P>We genuinely seek guidance as to how there is an emergency in this country.  Without that, even going back before the resolution was passed yesterday, is there a possibility that the Constitution can be invoked <Col N="400" /> as to the validity of the motion rather than, as is laid down, that it may not be invoked in respect of any laws passed thereunder?  I have not sufficient expert legal knowledge to know if that is so, but it seems to me to be a sensible reading of the situation. The lack of reasons for which we passed the motion yesterday must come into place somewhere as far as the Constitution is concerned, even if we go no further than the Article under which we are relying for those powers.</P>
    <P>All these measures are tied together.  I admit we are not being fair but we cannot avoid talking about the motion which has already been passed and the Bill which is yet to come.  Perhaps a constitutional lawyer might have a look at this.  Is there no basis on which declarations made as a result of motions being passed here must conform to some norm?  We cannot say : &ldquo;This is an emergency.  Let us pass it and tell the Seanad to do the same.&rdquo; This in effect, is being done.</P>
    <P>If there was more than a Government simple majority in both Houses and if these measures were passed by a two-thirds majority, it could be taken as a fair consensus of opinion that a state of emergency did exist.  Here we have a very dangerous situation.  We have a Government-dictated majority in this House and in the Seanad.  While Government-dictated majorities are a necessary part of the way in which we operate this democracy, on this vital issue the simple majority, dictated by the Government, is dicey, and something should be done about it.  If nothing can be done under the Constitution in regard to yesterday's motion, we should be thinking about tomorrow, the day after and even the year after.  A Government-dictated simple majority can declare a national emergency when none exists simply by the Government telling their followers in both Houses to vote for their motions.</P>
    <P>The seven-day detention period is very questionable.  Why are seven days so important?  What can the gardaí find out from a suspect in seven days that could not be found out after 48 <Col N="401" /> hours, unless it is a wearing down process?  If so, the five extra days are very important.  It is not unusual for a man to be released after 48 hours and be very quickly apprehended again.  We already have in existence the practice of a four-day period of detention for interrogation.  The two-day detention period can go on indefinitely. Of course, recourse might be had to a higher court but by the time it met and decided on the case many days would have elapsed and the operation would have been concluded.</P>
    <P>The unbroken period of seven days may have a sinister meaning.  Is that so?  I have to ask these provocative questions.  Because I am asking these questions reasonably and sensibly no attempt is being made to answer them. Although I represent quite a small group, as a Member of this House I am entitled to equal consideration as any other Member.  I get it when it suits the Government but I am also denied it when it suits them.  In regard to this type of question, it obviously does not suit them to accord to me the rights of a Deputy, that is, answers to reasonable questions put to the Government or their spokesmen.  Again, I ask why seven days?</P>
    <P>Why must there be secret places of custody?  Will any rights be accorded to people detained for seven days in places other than Garda barracks or prisons?  In such institutions one could, by inquiry, find out where the man had been sent.  Will we get these answers or will this measure be bulldozed through with a big splash in the papers that it was passed by so many votes?  If the public are not informed about the laws, why they are there, why they deny the elementary rights of the population, you will not and cannot expect to get co-operation from the people.  Indeed, far from co-operation you will get obstruction.  If the Government are really convinced that a state of emergency exists and if they have talked themselves into believing this, they should tell the Members of this House and the public just why these measures were introduced and how they will be used.  Any assurances given must be based on the wording of the laws that are going to be passed by a head count <Col N="402" /> in due time.  There is no assurance at present.  A great deal has been omitted. This gives rise to concern as to what abuses there may be.  It is the Government's duty to explain what has been written into this measure and to tell us of their proposals to ensure that the rights of individuals are not trampled on in this phoney situation.</P>
    <P>Is it possible that the seven days' detention can be repetitive?  If a person has been detained for seven days without being charged and is then released, is there anything to prevent further detention by a different garda?  Some other garda&mdash;and there are thousands of gardaí&mdash;may have different ideas and could be waiting to catch a person who has just been released after seven days.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this legislation is ill-conceived. It has not been demonstrated to be necessary.  It should not be given approval by this House.  I believe, as many Members on that side of the House believed many years ago, that we have more than enough law.  Before 1972 I remember Fine Gael waxing eloquent in their condemnation of the then Government for not doing enough with the existing laws.  They charged that Government with not operating the existing laws to the full.  When the laws were being strengthened in 1972 the Fine Gael spokesmen who derided Fianna Fáil for not utilising the pre-1972 laws and who opposed the new laws on that basis are now saying that none of these laws, including the additions in 1972, is sufficient, that they want all this as well.</P>
    <P>We should be given a better explanation than the one given to us by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs regarding his conversion.  I do not mind his conversion.  That is a matter between himself and his conscience. It seems to satisfy him but it did not convince me.  Surely some other Government members can give us an explanation for this staggering change. We are entitled to an explanation for this late conversion.  I believe, as I did pre-1972 and as I did after the 1972 enactment, that there are enough laws and that it is not on the Statute Book that we are <Col N="403" /> going to secure the safety of our people or the preservation of our State.  That cannot be done by writing more laws.  Security will not be better as a result of these laws.  Side by side with our belief of there being no improvement as a result of these laws, we must take into consideration that any infringement of the rights of the ordinary people would be on the negative side.  In other words, the disadvantages are clear but the advantages have not been shown.  A proper explanation has not been attempted by any of the front bench spokemen, with the exception of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, of the overwhelming conversions of the members of the Government who want these laws.  Any explanation must take into account today's situation.</P>
    <P>The situation today is not as dangerous as it was then on that front, that is, if we are sticking to the public safety and the preservation of the State, and the dangers through war or armed rebellion, whether within the State or outside of it.  In my estimation there is danger, but it is not under this heading.  It is under other headings such as our general chaotic economic position which cannot be dealt with under Article 28 of the Constitution.  Perhaps what may arise from it will have to be dealt with under that.  Perhaps the Government are even more far-sighted than I credit them with, and perhaps they are looking ahead.  Perhaps they see this danger coming and they are using the situation in the Six Counties as an umbrella to get these measures through in anticipation of trouble which they see around the corner because of the disastrous economic situation, unemployment, the money situation.  Perhaps that is what it is all about.  Time will tell.</P>
    <P>On foot of yesterday's performance passing the motion saying there is a state of emergency, there is a national emergency, the Government should give us every possible bit of information and knowledge they have in regard to the operation of this extraordinary piece of legislation which is under consideration at the moment. <Col N="404" /> I would ask the Government speaker who will close this debate to please give us some information.  We have been denied it up until now.  Reasonable questions have gone unanswered. They are being asked again and I hope they will be answered.  There is no excuse for ignoring questions legitimately and reasonably asked about reasonable subjects.  There is no excuse for the Government to deny us that information, particularly when it is in the furtherance of their own proposal that the information is being sought.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Defence, who is in the House at the moment, to try to influence whoever will be speaking for the Government later on to give us some of the answers which were not given yesterday, and to answer the questions that have been asked today, not just to satisfy me but because they are being asked by the public.  They should be given some indication of what is intended, and how it is proposed to operate these measures.  We should be given some assurance that the very dangerous provision that members of the Defence Forces out of uniform can stop one on the road at any time will be scrubbed.  Detention for seven days and then a repetition of that should be clarified.  We should know the rights of persons who are detained and who they may communicate with: their families so that they can inform them where they are, their solicitor to defend them against any charges, their medical practitioner in the case of someone who may not be well although that may not be apparent.  All these things are absolutely essential.  The Government will be very remiss in their duty to the House and to the public if they do not give us all that information.  It will be to their own loss in the long run, not that I am concerned about their loss.  Indeed, I hope to add to it anywhere and everywhere I can.  That goes without saying.</P>
    <P>At the same time, that is no reason why I should be ignored in this House when I ask questions.  I am trying to be reasonable in my approach, and I take a very poor view of being ignored particularly after the recent by-election in <Col N="405" /> north-east Donegal.  It may have been said since 1973 that I was a lone voice here.  I am not alone any more.  I did not come in here on a sympathy vote in 1973.  We did not win the by-election on sympathy in 1976.  Some cognisance should be taken of the fact that out of three seats in north-east Donegal, I and my colleague hold two of them, one won in a by-election in a straight conflict with the two major parties.  I do not think that should be sneezed at.  The Government may try to ignore it and hope it will go away but it will not, no more than the troubles in the Six Counties have gone away despite the fact that they have ignored them in various ways for quite a long time. Nor will they go away as a result of this big bruhaha about the great fellows we are here and what we are doing.  I will not say what I think about what they are doing, but I want the Government spokesman this evening to say what is being done, how it is being done and how it is proposed to be done, and particularly what the safeguards for the public are.  We are entitled to that.  I ask the Minister for Defence to try to prevail on whoever will be replying to the debate on Second Stage to help us all by clarifying these matters before the next Stage of the Bill, particularly for the benefit of the public whose vital interests are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney has asked for an explanation as to why there have been conversions.  I cannot speak for anyone but myself.  &ldquo;Conversions&rdquo; is the wrong word.  This Parliament is bedevilled by party politics and party allegiances.  When I took my stand in 1972 I believed I had taken the right decision.  Before I made up my mind I had grave misgivings because I wanted to do the right thing. Other members of this party found themselves in the same position.  Not unlike Opposition Deputies at the moment they have now also shifted their ground.  My reply to Deputy Blaney is that it is not a question of explaining the &ldquo;great conversions&rdquo;. It is a question of explaining the attitudes that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me this emphasises one point I have been advocating since the <Col N="406" /> troubles started in Northern Ireland, and since politics became a very serious matter for public representatives, particularly Deputies who represent constituencies such as Deputy Blaney and I represent.  Politics nowadays is no longer only about bread and butter.  Politics is about children who are losing their lives in the streets of Belfast.  Politics is about parents and families who are losing their lives. Politics is about people.  People in politics who do not recognise the seriousness of the role we have to play, particularly Deputies from the northern part of the country, are not coming to terms with the obligations and public duties given to them by the electorate who sent them here to represent them.</P>
    <P>At times even chastising members of my own party, I have tried to be as responsible as God will allow me to be with the common sense He has given me to arrive at my decisions.  If I have been offensive in my public pronouncements to any person in my own party or in the Opposition, it has been because I believe the word I am speaking is the word I should use responsibly. Had the Government of the day discussed with the Opposition the measures they proposed introducing in 1972 there would have been a more united front to the subversion and terrorism which is endemic in our society at present.  As public representatives we must face this in a responsible way.  The trouble then was that Fianna Fáil wanted to do the good things and get the credit for them and not bestow any credit on public representatives representing the Opposition parties.  I now find myself in a similar position.  The present legislation would have been strengthened by closer co-operation with the main Opposition party.  I recognise that Fianna Fáil members are not that far removed from my political thinking on the question of subversion here.  We share many views on this matter and it is our common objective to suppress subversion from whatever source it raises its head.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the sooner the political parties here realise this and raise themselves above the petty <Col N="407" /> divisions which separate them <i>vis-á-vis</i> Northern politics, the sooner we will be facing the reality of the situation and doing justice to the 1½ million people who are still part of the Irish family north of the Border but are outside our jurisdiction.  I again appeal to the leadership of the three main parties to work out some type of bipartisan policy that will relate in a most meaningful way to the community north of the Border.  I have given great study to this matter and exchanged viewpoints with people of diverse opinion across the board north of the Border.  I make that statement at the expense of somebody saying: &ldquo;Harte is having a go at his own Government&rdquo;. I am not, I am loyal to my Government and will continue to be so.  I will support them in every measure possible because I have confidence in the members of the Government in relation to the politics I share but party politics is bedevelling all politicians here.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to interrupt the Deputy but I am anxious that he deal with the provisions of the Bill before the House. There is a specific item of business before the House and Members have an obligation to relate their remarks to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There would have been united agreement about these provisions had there been consultation beforehand.  There would have been more united agreement in 1972 had there been consultation beforehand. The Government have brought an end to an emergency situation brought in by Fianna Fáil in 1939 and introduced one in 1976.  This emphasises the reality of the situation. It is spelling out clearly that there is little difference at present between the political parties in relation to the North.  We may have had our differences in the past and about that I will not try to camouflage my criticisms of the Fianna Fáil Party. This is a very valid and honourable position but since the new generation of leadership emerged in the North of Ireland they have made us understand <Col N="408" /> that they too want to be part of any agreement.  They have made us understand that agreement north of the Border must be worked out with their consent and that their consent, willingly entered into with the majority group in the North of Ireland, must receive our total support. That is a call on all parties here to enter into a bipartisan agreement so that no matter what legislation comes before this House in relation to our relationship to the northern part of the country it will have general agreement.</P>
      <P>I support completely bipartisanship and I hope somebody will understand what I am talking about some day. This is a repressive law but it is not repressive in as much as the members of the Government want it to be repressive. If this law is repressive, if the 1972 laws introduced by Fianna Fáil are repressive and if the 1939 powers were repressive it is because people forced politicians who wanted to do the right thing for society into a corner to fight back and defend society.  While I concede that the Bill is repressive and that repressive measures will restore order and contain men of violence I should like to state that repression itself will not restore peace unless there is political progress.  Irrespective of what we do unless the people north of the Border come to some political agreement the next generation will be showing its head north and south of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Security and politics run parallel and one will not succeed without the other.  Governments have the authority and the power to provide security but they must also have a commitment to provide political progress.  If we fail as a Government to help create conditions conducive to political harmony in all of this island we are failing to recognise the full responsibility which is ours.  Our obligation is greater than being the custodians of law and order and our mandate is greater.  We have been given a mandate to lead, to guide society in a direction which will provide our people with a reasonable opportunity to identify with the things that are common to us.  We must <Col N="409" /> never lose sight of our duty as public representatives to strive earnestly to find solutions reasonably acceptable to all traditions on this island.  We must never allow ourselves to shelve decisions in the hope that the problem will go away when our past is clearly telling us that unless solutions are found we are condemning another generation, perhaps not yet born, to the cruel miseries to which the inaction and complacency of past politicians have sentenced this generation.</P>
    <P>Repression is not the normal code of my political thinking nor is it part of the framework of the friends I have in Government.  I never want it to be part of me.  I would hate if anyone called me a right wing politician or if any responsible person classed me as a reactionary.  I hope my attitudes will be recognised for what they are and for what I mean them to be.  I would like to think that my whole approach to the major issues of our society has been one of open politics.  That has been my aim and if I have not succeeded it is not my fault.  My clear public duty is to the society in which I live&mdash;that must always be my first priority.  My duty to any individual in society must be one of concern but never dictating the need over that of the greater good.  The foul and vicious actions in the catalogues of murder, arson, intimidation, robbery, destruction and the poison which is being bred in the minds of our teenagers particularly in Northern Ireland, forces people like me and my colleagues into introducing legislation which in normal circumstances I, and they, would oppose.  The threat to the smooth running of southern society has made it impossible for us who cherish more noble ideas, to foster or champion such things as human rights.  Democracy as we know it is under attack and the authority of Government is being treated with contempt. The right of elected leadership to represent the people has been challenged. The laws of Parliament are being flouted in a game of cat and mouse antics more in line with a banana republic than a society in western civilisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Bill is concerned, security, law and order are tasks demanding the attention of all of us.  In that context I am putting my view before the House in a helpful way.  I do not want to deal with the aspects of the Bill in detail.  I am supporting the Bill and I make no apology as a public representative for doing that.  I am merely bringing my views to the House as to why I am supporting the Bill and why I believe that we as a society must be more open with our politics.  I believe that I am in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the people who are outside the mainstream of law and order at the moment, the people at whom this Bill is aimed, have a clear choice.  They have a choice of staying on the road they are on and challenging society.  If that is their choice, then this or any succeeding Government will have to meet that challenge with more repression, making it more difficult for society to widen its doors.  Those people have another choice, that of peace.  I welcome them as one who has tried to understand both sides of the political divide and both sides of the militant wings of the two main traditions in this island.  I invite them to use this door.  There is much to be done for society, particularly the aged, the underprivileged and the handicapped of our society.  There is more to be done for them than will ever be done in my lifetime or in the lifetime possibly of any Member of this House and certainly in the lifetime of the para-militaries, as they are commonly called nowadays.  They should not ignore the call of the people who are marching the streets of Belfast and of Dublin.  They cannot ignore this call, and I earnestly implore them not to push people like me into a position of being repressive, because that is not my normal code.  I make this earnest appeal to them to leave down their guns.  They have a part to play in building an Irish society whether they have been born into a republican tradition or a loyalist tradition.  We <Col N="411" /> cannot all be politicians or parliamentary representatives.  We cannot all be elected to local authorities, but we can be involved in community development and in the creation of a society in this island in which loyalist, republican, Catholic and Protestant can give their full consent.  I would ask them not to be stupid, to abandon their narrow, sectarian views whatever code they belong to, and come back into the mainstream of politics.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House is necessary because the Government must come to terms with the situation that has developed over the last number of years.  If they cannot come to terms with it now they will have failed in their prime duty given to them by the people in the 1973 general election. If there were a general election and the present Opposition were returned to power at the polls then it would be their obligation to come in here and introduce laws to protect society.  I submit to any Deputy in this House, from Deputy Keaveney, the newest Member to Deputy Breslin, also from Donegal, one of the longest serving Members, to Deputy Lalor who is now in the main chair of the Fianna Fáil Party, that our obligation is greater to society than it is to any one individual, and the priorities in that regard are shared by all political parties irrespective of what constituencies they represent, what party they represent or what age group they come from.  It is clearly the responsibility of every one of us to protect society against people who conspire against society either for political motives or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Regarding the people who normally argue that they are politically motivated and that therefore they need political status, respectability of some description, I have not yet been able to see what exactly they mean by political status, affiliation or motivation. Any person who carries a gun or purposely goes out to injure persons or the property of other people cannot claim to be politically motivated. Political motivation to me is people who become involved in politics at community level, at local level or at national level.  There <Col N="412" /> should be no equivocation on the thinking of what the purpose of any subversive group may be, whether it is tinged with the colour of green republicanism or orange loyalism.  It makes no difference.  We are all the one people living in this island and our challenge is to find accommodation under a political system.  That political system cannot be found by people using guns and bombs and destroying other people's property.  If by their foul deeds they force a Government such as we have into introducing legislation that will combat and curtail their movements, then they are the repressors.  We are the custodians of the people and if we do not share that responsibility in Government and in Opposition we are being less responsible than we are meant to be as parliamentary representatives.</P>
    <P>I believe that security, law and order, and politics demand the attention and support of all political parties of this House, and while it is the responsibility initially of the Government to introduce legislation such as we have before the House and while it is the responsibility of the Opposition to finecomb that in the interests of their own supporters and their own political philosophy, the overriding factor involved is that we have one common purpose in mind. Our job is to protect society.  If there are people who disagree with us who want to claim political status or political motivation there is no law that I know in our statutes that will stop anyone from getting up on his soapbox at any corner of any village or town and saying what he thinks either in support of or being critical of the present Government or Opposition.</P>

I am merely saying that in supporting that I also have another obligation, an obligation to broaden <Col N="413" /> politics, to open another door so that if those people who challenge society want to come back into the mainstream of society there is a way for them to do it.  I and members of my party would welcome all shades of opinion from people who are politically minded and willing to assist in the creation of a society in Ireland which we can be proud of as much as we are ashamed of what is happening at the moment.  One of the inspirations in our society at the moment is the marches of the women in Belfast for peace.  What they are doing publicly should not be ignored by public representatives in this House or in the North.  There is a very demanding call on all of us to get away from the moulds that have put us into the parties and slotted us into the positions in which we now find ourselves.  There is a greater challenge in Ireland today.  We can identify, overcome and suppress the things that are bad in our society.</P>

      <P>Because of this party's anxiety to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our citizens and to ensure that there will be no more upset to that well-being we feel it necessary to oppose the provisions of the Emergency Powers Bill.  The Leader of my party opening the debate last Tuesday morning spelled out on our behalf the dedication within Fianna Fáil to co-operate with and assist the Government in every possible way towards not alone outlawing all illegal organisations in this country but in arranging for their downfall.  Deputy Harte in making a point found himself like other speakers from the Government expressing his regret for his non-co-operation with the Government in 1972 and accepting that with his greater knowledge now he appreciates that he and his colleagues should have co-operated more effectively with the Government at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte said that since then Fianna Fáil had shifted ground.  I think Deputy Harte himself has explained who has shifted ground. <Col N="414" /> We have been consistent.  We introduced legislation to enable the appropriate forces within the State to deal with the subversive movements.  We were removed from office early in 1973 and one of the factors that contributed to that removal was a promise made by the present Taoiseach on behalf of the participating parties in the present Coalition that law and order would be more effectively controlled and maintained by the incoming National Coalition Government.  We now have the Emergency Powers Bill introduced into this House by the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Government, on the basis that there had been increased lawlessness and increased subversion during the period since the present Government took office.  The Taoiseach said as justification for the introduction of this Bill that since 1974 people had been killed in this State as a result of bombings connected with the situation in the North of Ireland. I do not accept that this Bill will do more to prevent violence of this sort.  What we all want to see is an end to this violence and we want to see illegal organisations wiped out because they are not serving this country in any way.  One of the factors referred to by Deputy Harte and referred to and welcomed by the Leader of my party is the emergence of the women's peace movement.  This movement must be supported.  Its emergence does not arise from the two atrocities referred to as the Government's reason for introducing these Bills but arises from even greater atrocities in the city of Belfast.  This development makes me believe that events have gone ahead of this slow-moving Government.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are genuine in their approach to this matter.  The sincerity of Fianna Fáil was questioned by the Taoiseach in the most unstatesmanlike speech ever made by a Taoiseach in this country yesterday although the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Deputy Harte admitted that they were wrong in their questioning of the sincerity of the Fianna Fáil Government in this regard in 1972.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister for Justice will try to give more justification than has already been given for the introduction of the Emergency Powers Bill.  The Taoiseach moving the motion explained that there were two major reasons for the introduction of this Bill&mdash;the Green Street bombings and the murder of the British Ambassador and Miss Cooke.  We have been endeavouring to ascertain from the Government whether they believe that this measure together with the one coming up will improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Malley, mentioned that the Minister for Justice made a very short speech in introducing this very important measure.  I have seen criticism of the Bill in the Press in respect of there being no explanatory memorandum.  The first part of the Minister's speech could be described as the belated explanatory memorandum. The remainder of it is technically <Col N="416" /> written for him by the Garda Commissioner and is an apology rather than an explanation for the introduction of the measure.  Deputy Halligan made a very good maiden speech here yesterday and was complimented by the Taoiseach.  He apologised in a way by saying that it was traditional to do so.  I thought it was rather embarrassing for the Deputy that he had present neither the leader, the deputy leader nor any member of his own party with the exception of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Deputy Mrs. Desmond who graciously came in and Deputy Coughlan who ungraciously came to listen to him.  I thought this was very bad.</P>

Were it not for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs there would scarcely have been a Labour Deputy here for this whole debate.  The Tánaiste has never appeared in the House apart from voting. It seems there are mixed views in the Labour Party on the Emergency Powers Bill with apologies by the chairman of the party in the Seanad voting against it, being voted against here or not being voted on at all.  Then I have to sit here listening to speakers lecturing Fianna Fáil on their responsibilities while their colleagues in their own party do not seem to need lecturing. Deputy Harte spoke about discussion and he rightly faulted his own party for not having had discussion with the Opposition.  Peculiarly, it appears that this legislation was introduced without a great deal of discussion on the Government side and that is probably why the bold boys in Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice said that the power of seven days' detention in section 2 of the Bill was regarded by the Garda Síochána as a most important weapon in their fight against the activities of subversives. He did not say the Government so regarded it.  My assessment of this Bill is that it has been introduced by way of reaction to the murder of the British Ambassador and Miss Cooke arising from the fact that, naturally, the Minister for Justice asked the Garda to explain why sufficient precautions had not been taken in the surveillance of the ambassador's residence with particular reference to the short strip of road where the murder took place.  It seems to me to have been the result of slack surveillance. As I see it, the automatic reaction from a defensive Garda Commissioner in this regard was: &ldquo;We have not enough power.&rdquo; In four different ways in an extremely short speech the Minister for Justice went out of his way to say that this measure was regarded by the Garda Síochána as a most important weapon in their fight against subversive activities. Further on he said that the ordinary legal process is inadequate and that the Garda needed to be able to carry out their investigations free from obstruction and from the conspiratorial activity of the suspects.  He said that the Garda&mdash;not himself&mdash; regarded the proposals in the Bill giving them an extended period for the detention of suspects for serious crime as very important.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the power to keep suspects in custody for up to seven days was being sought because the Garda felt it would strengthen their hand in combating subversives.  He said it three times in order to spell out the fact that this is not a Government decision but the Garda have been pressing them to give this power.  He said it was the considered view of the Garda that the measure was needed and that the Government proposed the Oireachtas should give it to them.  That is the fourth time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> If this measure fails&mdash;and nothing has been said so far by the Government side to convey that it will succeed&mdash;what will be the position? This aspect of the matter has already been dealt with adequately by speakers on this side.  We have had measure after measure but the situation has deteriorated.  The law and order Government have had to admit that things have got much worse since the non-law and order Government disappeared three-and-a-half years ago and they now want more measures.</P>

      <P>The result is they cease to have the appearance of being genuine.  This legislation is not recommended by the Government.  The Government are proposing here to give the Garda the powers they are seeking.  A number of attacks have been made on this legislation.  I want to say quite clearly that I have sufficient confidence in the Government not to accept the generally expressed opinion that this legislation will turn the country into a police State.  The Minister gave as the reason for this legislation a request by the Garda.  He said that four times in his introductory statement: the Garda asked for this power.  Why do the Government not say this is the right thing to do?  The Minister says the Garda say they will be better able to deal with subversives if they get this power and the Government propose to give it to them.  The one thing the Minister did not say in his brief statement is that the Government believe <Col N="421" /> the Garda are right.  If the legislation proves ineffective then the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Cabinet will be able to say they never said the legislation would be effective.</P>
      <P>In the selling of this legislation the Taoiseach drew attention to the deaths that occurred within this State&mdash;37 people killed and 189 injured&mdash;and he gave that as the basis for this legislation.  I have a question to ask and I hope the Minister will try to answer it.  It may be an impossible question to answer but nonetheless it must be asked.  Can the Minister give a guarantee on behalf of the Government that, if the Garda get this power, it will be more effectively used than the powers they have already so that we will not be given yet another statistic in a year's time covering more deaths?  If the Minister cannot do that, then he cannot justify this legislation.</P>
      <P>We are all for essential and appropriate action to deal with subversives. One will find no man speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil opposed to that and that was spelled out quite clearly by Deputy Jack Lynch.  Ministers and spokesmen for the Opposition have said&mdash;and we can stand over this&mdash; that we know this to be so.  We are speaking for 99 per cent of the people of this country in condemning the IRA and other unlawful organisations. By his histrionics last evening the Taoiseach&mdash;going back in depth into history&mdash;is guilty of having made 50 per cent of the people about whom I am speaking&mdash;that 50 per cent being Fianna Fáil supporters&mdash;immediately think that the people at present in Government just cannot be right because we do not trust a Cosgrave-led Government in this country.</P>

      <P>Briseann.  There are many people who want to see the <Col N="422" /> country progressing and who are pronounced and dedicated enemies of the present-day IRA.  But the Taoiseach last evening re-kindled fires because he cannot get rid of the old hatred he has for Fianna Fáil.  People look upon him&mdash;and I had always regarded him, now I discover wrongly&mdash;as a decent man.  His reply to the debate last evening was abominable.</P>
      <P>I must refer to the Taoiseach's reference to this measure, when moving the motion because the Minister hardly referred to it at all.  In regard to the necessity for the Emergency Powers Bill and the Criminal Law Bill the Taoiseach talked about the number of armed robberies and attributed all of them to subversive organisations.  I was the victim of a robbery.  I do not say it was an armed robbery.  In comparatively recent times a number of Deputies have had their homes broken into and suffered losses as a result.  They were not actions of subversive organisations. Law and order from that point of view has gone to blazes.  There are not enough gardaí to carry out normal work.  I get back to the point that it is detection rather than more repression that is needed.  Quite frankly, I am worried about this seven days detention.  I am worried also about the fact that the Minister spelled out what the Garda said: if they could keep these lads in for seven days they would get them.  What it boils down to is that if they could keep those lads in for seven days they would get more out of them.  If a genuine IRA man is being held by the Garda and the necessity arises for squeezing information out of him, that is all right by me.  But my concern is for the innocent man who may be taken into custody and kept for seven days in an effort to squeeze information out of him he just has not got.  That is also my concern with regard to the ordinary law-abiding citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will endeavour to do more to justify the necessity for having introduced this Bill than he did in his introductory remarks.  It is rather remarkable that so many fingers can point to a Fianna Fáil Party so dedicated to the eradication <Col N="423" /> of the Provisional IRA and other subversives, whereas the Government have not got the full backing of their two parties.</P>

      <P>In a way it was unavoidable that the debate on this Emergency Powers Bill would inevitably broaden into discussion of the emergency motion itself.  In my reply I intend as far as possible to keep to the terms of the Bill and to deal with the points raised in regard to it.  There will be a certain number of what I might call net technical points with which I will deal.  There will also be a number of policy considerations which were raised, which require comment and which may inevitably lead to a broadening of my reply in the realm of the emergency resolutions.  I beg the Chair's indulgence should I transgress order in that regard.  I will deal with the points as I have them here, not necessarily in the order in which they were raised in the debate and not necessarily in the order of either my or, possibly, Deputies' consideration of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised questions regarding the long title.  He was worried that the long title to the Bill might be defective and, as a result, the entire measure might be defective. Apparently, he was echoing a point made by his Leader in the debate on the motion.  I was not in the House and did not hear that point made. But Deputy O'Malley makes the point that the long title should refer more explicitly to time of war, should use certain words contained in Article 28 of the Constitution, that failure to use those words may constitute a fatal gap in the long title and, therefore, in the Bill and that the constitutional protection which the Bill gets from the resolutions would be thereby annulled.  I am satisfied with the advice available to me&mdash;and in previous debates where constitutional issues were raised at length by the other side I had to rely, and in the upshot was entitled to rely, on the constitutional advice given to me.  It is with some confidence I take that advice and report it to the House <Col N="424" /> now.  My advice is that the long title is satisfactory and proper.</P>
    <P>The Constitution of 1937 contains a provision, which I understand is normal in constitutions, to deal with situations of national emergency. That provision is contained in Article 28.3.3º.  This sub-article applies to enactments of the Oireachtas when the conditions laid down in that sub-article are met.  In a time of war or of rebellion the Oireachtas may enact legislation which is immune from constitutional challenge by virtue of that Article.  By an amendment enacted in 1939 the Oireachtas has a similar power, when the armed conflict is taking place outside the State and the State is not a participant.  The resolutions have to be passed first before any consequential legislation can be introduced and, of course, before they can obtain immunity.  It is not every Act of the Oireachtas passed after the resolution that obtains this immunity.  The Oireachtas must express in a particular Act that it is passed for a specific purpose so as to obtain this immunity and it does this in the long title.  That purpose must be to secure the public safety and preserve the State in three different situations.  First, in time of war in which the State itself is a belligerent; secondly, in time of armed rebellion against the State and, thirdly, in time of armed conflict in which the State is not a participant but in respect of which both Houses have passed resolutions.</P>
    <P>The Government have been advised that it is proper that the Oireachtas in the long title should indicate which of these provisions it considers to be the relevant one in the particular situation and this has been done in the Bill which has been circulated. We do not think any amendment to the long title is needed although, of course, there will be a technical amendment to insert the date of the passing of the resolution.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley indicated that he looked for authority to support the view of his leader but confessed that authority seemed very scarce.  However, he referred to one case entitled &ldquo;in the matter of an application of <Col N="425" /> Patrick McGrath and Thomas Harte for certain reliefs&rdquo; reported in the 1941 Irish Reports and he quoted from some of the words of Chief Justice Sullivan in that case.  As Deputy O'Malley referred to it, I got the case and I have read the judgment of Chief Justice Sullivan.  It is a short one and I cannot see anything in it which sustains the point he made&mdash;quite the contrary.  The Chief Justice specifically says that there is no need to put in the body of the enactment any reference to the emergency powers, that as they are quoted in the long title that is adequate.</P>
    <P>I am advised, and I am satisfied with that advice, that the long title as drafted in the Bill clearly covers the situation.  I have no doubt about that.  I do not propose to amend the long title on the grounds that the amendment is unnecessary other than in the technical way I have mentioned to introduce the date of the passing of the resolution in the long title.  I shall be moving that amendment on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will have to be an amendment because the Bill as presented has blanks.  The amendment will be to fill these blanks.  Another point raised was that consequent on the passing of the Bill the legal position will be to permit nine days detention, not seven.  This arises from the fact that section 30 of the 1939 Act which provides for the holding of a person for two successive periods of 24 hours is not being repealed, that consequently under the 1939 Act we will have power to hold for two days, under the proposed Emergency Powers Act there will be power to hold up to seven days and that if <Col N="426" /> these were operated consecutively there would be power to hold for nine days.  That is a reading that is open to be made but I submit to the House it is an incorrect reading and, even if it were not an incorrect reading, I submit to the House it is something that will not happen.  The reason it will not happen is that there will be a direction by the Government to the Garda Síochána that if their powers of detention are to be exercised they are to be exercised only under one or other of the proposed pieces of legislation but never under both.  That is a direction I expect will be honoured fully and completely.</P>
      <P>The reason it is not proposed to repeal the 1939 Act is that it is a piece of our permanent legislation.  It has been there since 1939 and, unhappily, there is no sign on the constitutional horizons of this island that the time is within sight when that piece of tough legislation can be repealed. While, hopefully, there will be a time when the emergency powers will fall, either because the Government do not make an order reactivating them or because both Houses have annulled the emergency resolution, there could still be a time when the need for the 1939 Act would exist. Hopefully it would be in cold storage but nevertheless I think it would be imprudent to repeal section 30 of that Act.  That power should be there so that in the event of the emergency powers going off the legislative scene and the need arising the powers under section 30 of the 1939 Act would be available.  There could be a serious gap if they were not available.  I submit to the House that they will not be used consecutively because the Government will give a clear and unequivocal direction in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I was distressed to hear the point made frequently from the other benches that there had been abuses of the power of the Garda Síochána to hold people for 48 hours. I am not aware of them.  There may have been isolated cases in which because of an excess of zeal or for some other reason persons were detained for successive periods of 48 hours.  I am satisfied that would be <Col N="427" /> an abuse and a wrong exercise and use of these powers and that such abuse would be amenable to correction in the courts.  I would be glad to have details and will ensure that steps are taken to ensure that there is no repetition and that if there are any sanctions to be applied for that abuse and breach that they will be applied.  Likewise, for the same reason I am satisfied that it would be a serious abuse to use the new seven-day power in successive periods. Not merely would it be an administrative abuse, I think it would be illegal and would give rise to certain legal consequences.  That is the second reason I submit to the House that there will not be consecutive use of that power, that there will not be consecutive periods of seven days' detention in regard to a particular person or consecutive on the two days.</P>
    <P>The powers under the 1939 Act and under the Bill now before the House relate to a particular situation as set out in section 2 (1) of the Bill before the House and as set out in section 30 (1) of the 1939 Act.  They set out, albeit fairly widely but nevertheless precisely, the circumstances in which a garda can avail of the powers under the Bill.  I think it will be quite clear to Deputies on reading it that it would be impossible for a garda validly to arrest for a consecutive seven days and allege the same reasons or use the same powers because of their very nature they would have been exhausted.  I am advised that a subsequent arrest would be invalid and would give rise to legal sanctions.  In any such attempt the citizen would be in precisely the same position as he would be with regard to unlawful arrest in the general area of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not here when I developed the point.  I said that under the Bill the circumstances in which these powers can be <Col N="428" /> exercised with regard to an arrest without a warrant and detention for seven days relate to certain specified conditions in the Bill, that of their nature when the powers are exercised and when the provisions come into operation of necessity they must exhaust themselves, that to attempt to repeat the exercise would be manifestly wrong and, consequently, any arrest would be invalid and would give rise to action.  The constitutional immunity, in my opinion, would not apply because the matter would be unlawful. It would not be within the terms of the Bill.  It would have to be within the terms of the Bill to secure the constitutional immunity.  For those reasons I am satisfied, and so submit to the House, that with regard to the interpretation of the expression on the other side, while technically open to be made, that there could be nine days detention in practice it will not be possible for it to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say it did not happen.  The point I am making is that one would gather from the speeches from the opposite benches that it was a matter of common practice.  I am satisfied it certainly was not.  It may have happened in isolated cases.  I invited Deputies, if they were aware of such cases, to bring them to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was asked: &ldquo;why seven days?&rdquo; I suppose if the provision in the Bill was five days Deputies would ask why five days, if it were eight days, why eight days? I hesitate to say it in this context <Col N="429" /> but I suppose seven days has certain biblical connections.  Seven days is a recognised period and I believe it strikes everybody as a reasonable period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven days appears to the Government to be a reasonable period.  Deputies O'Malley, Blaney and Desmond wanted to know what safeguards a person would have. He will have precisely the same safeguards he now has.  If he is arrested he is immune from ill-treatment.  He has to be treated properly.  Those safeguards are not removed by the Bill.  The only immunity given by the Bill is that it relieves the Garda from the obligation of bringing the person before the court at the first available opportunity.  Their obligation to do that is now postponed for up to seven days.</P>
      <P>All the other obligations and all the other rights which a person in custody has continue and are not interfered with.  They are not diminished or taken away by the constitutional immunity.  That immunity relates only to this specific case.  It relieves the custodian of the obligation of bringing the arrested person before the court at the first available opportunity.  All the other rights are there.  All the other safeguards in our whole body of law, common law and statute law, are available for the protection of people in custody and for the safeguarding of their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of anxiety has been raised in this connection regarding the question of legal access.  Those rights are not being interfered with.  They are not being taken away or diminished.  The rights which an accused person has at the moment to legal advice when in custody will continue in exactly the same way. There is nothing whatever in the Bill to take them away from him. It has been suggested that the right <Col N="430" /> to have a medical adviser somehow becomes relevant.  There is a rather sinister implication in that which I want to reject categorically. The implication in it is that on being given these powers the Garda will abuse them and there will be need for medical advice.  Maybe I am wrong in taking that implication but possibly it is the implication that most reasonable people would take. It is an implication I want to refute very categorically.</P>
    <P>Another point that was raised related to the exercise of the powers by a chief superintendent, that it was a chief superintendent who extends the time after the first 48 hours for an extra five days.  It was put forward by Deputies that this power should not be given to a chief superintendent, that it should be given to the Minister for Justice.  It was raised, perhaps, ironically, by Deputy O'Malley who felt it was too great a power.  I would contrast the power in regard to ordinary detention of a person for an extra seven days to that which he gave to a chief superintendent to give evidence of his belief, which could result in detention not for seven days but for a much longer period.  He was content to do that and it is somewhat inconsistent now to complain that a chief superintendent is not a proper person to certify detention for a further five days.  Deputy Desmond raised the point also from the other side of the coin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is validity in what I say.  This is the argument which strikes me.  Deputies may not agree with it.

      <P>With regard to Deputy Haughey's ambitions I do not know what steps he has taken to realise them.  There is no point in having ambitions unless you are moving to realise them.  It would be a bit pointless. Deputy Haughey, from what we hear, is not a pointless man.  However, we are becoming diverted from the Bill.</P>
      <P>I believe the powers are properly left with the chief superintendent because if they were to be given to the Minister he could only act on the advice of the chief superintendent. The point was made that at least a Minister is answerable in the House.  He is also answerable for acts of the Garda.  I have had questions here in connection with alleged Garda actions so the question of Parliamentary answerability, if I may use that word, is not removed.  It is still there I do not see anything wrong in leaving the power to the chief superintendent. The matter of administrative convenience is of relevance in this area and if the extended period had to wait on the availability of the Minister it might be seriously inconvenient.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Collins can show me the record where I have done that then I will concede it but I am not aware of having done so. The question was raised as to why there was a provision for custody in a Garda station, in a prison or &ldquo;other convenient place&rdquo;.  A lot of Deputies took exception to that wording and regarded it as rather sinister.  I want to assure the House that nothing sinister was intended by them.  The reason why this provision for a place other than a Garda station or a prison has been inserted in the Bill is due to a couple of unfortunate incidents when Garda stations were attacked and efforts were made to release prisoners, who were held in them in areas where there may have been just the ordinary Garda station partly available, by a large number of antagonistic and hostile people.  Consequently it was considered right that there should be power to detain persons in places other than Garda stations or prisons.  There is nothing more sinister than that in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney asked whether the emergency will continue until terminated by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  It is stated clearly that annulling resolutions will have to be passed before the power can expire but the Bill may fall into disuse after 12 months unless the Government make an order reactivating it.  It could then continue in existence for a further 12 months but could lapse at the end of that time for a period of six months after which time the Government could make an order reactivating it.  Therefore, there could be a situation in which the powers under the Bill might not be in constant operation but this would depend on the exigencies of the situation. However, the entire Bill will fall <Col N="433" /> when both Houses pass annulling resolutions.</P>
    <P>These powers have been criticised by some Deputies as being inadequate and rather small beef to warrant the implementation of the emergency resolution.  Other Deputies have criticised them on the grounds that they are too severe, that they are tantamount to internment.  Deputies opposite do not know which way to turn in regard to that argument. I have never proposed nor do I propose now to put forward these powers as being a solution to our terrorist problems.  No person with common sense would put forward that argument.  I say this having taken advice from the Garda that the powers will be an invaluable weapon in the armoury of the Garda Síochána in their fight against terrorism.  Before I advised the Government to seek these powers I obtained information from the Garda which led me to believe that in a number of past crimes they would almost certainly have detected the perpetrators and brought them to justice if the powers proposed here had been available.  The information given to me was conclusive.  For reasons of confidentiality I am sure the House will understand that I cannot give those details here and there is also the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I was given an instance of where the proceeds of a notorious robbery would have been recovered if these powers had been available.</P>

      <P>The question of that power has been raised fairly frequently in this debate and there has been a rather gloating approach by the Opposition regarding the <Col N="434" /> situation in which they think the Government find themselves and in which I, in particular, find myself, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the debate in that regard. It is only right to recall the context of that debate which was that these Draconian powers&mdash;and they are Draconian powers&mdash;were being offered to Parliament by a Government which had a history of equivocation in the area of the enforcement of law and order.  There was a notorious case in which the funerals took place in Mullingar of two people who had been executed in England.  At those funerals shots were fired over the graves.  The parties who fired those shots were identified. Their photographs appeared in the public Press.  A file in regard to that serious offence was prepared and submitted by the Garda in the normal way to the Government and to the law officers of the day seeking direction for prosecution.  I have read that file.  The case was cut and dried.  There was a strong recommendation by the Garda officer concerned that a prosecution lay and should be taken.  However, no prosecution was taken.  That was equivocation was taken.  That was equivocation in the enforcement of the law in a terrorist area.</P>

The Government decided they would not permit this and took steps accordingly to prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the attitude of the Opposition? There was no attitude expressed at the time but subsequently it slipped out here during an adjournment debate on the 5th May, 1976.  Their spokesman for Justice, Deputy Collins, he who would be expected to articulate this unequivocal detestation of terrorism that we have been hearing about from the benches opposite, while speaking in relation to this matter which was a serious challenge from the subversives who wished to throw down the gauntlet in regard to the Government reaction and to the Government's defeat of their challenge as reported <Col N="436" /> at column 775 of the Official Report for that day, said:</P>
