      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The recommendation was received on 11th December, 1975.  The Government considered that the interim increases recommended by the National Prices Commission would not provide sufficient additional revenue in RTE's financial year ending on 30th September, 1976, having regard to the authority's statutory obligation to be self-supporting.  The new licence fees are expected to bring in additional revenue of the order of £2,200,000 in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Surely the proper statutory body to decide on these matters is that set up by the Government&mdash; the National Prices Commission.  Therefore, can the Minister say how the Government were in a position to decide that the recommendations of the commission in regard to RTE would not bring in sufficient revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably, the Deputy is aware that the Government are not bound to accept a recommendation of the NPC.  The reasons for the Government taking the decision referred to here are fairly clear from the figures.  RTE had accumulated debts in the period 1st April, 1974 to 30th September, 1975 which were estimated at £943,000.  They forecast a further deficit of £1,419,000 in the financial year to the end of September, 1976.  The interim increase recommended by the NPC would have yielded about £960,000, that is, compared with the existing deficit of £943,000 in RTE's financial year, ending 30th September, 1976.  This was regarded as inadequate in the context of the authority's statutory obligation to be self-supporting.  Consequently, the Government decided to grant the increase.</P>

      <P>I have explained why the Government took this decision.  The NPC appear to have had in mind the recommending of an interim increase and to consider, during the period of that interim increase, what the total increase should be.  It appeared to the Government that this would result speedily in two levels of the licence fee.  We did not think this would be in the public interest and thought it would leave RTE during that time in possible breach of section 24 of the Broadcasting Authority Act.</P>

      <P>As I stated in a reply I gave on 6th November, 1975, to a previous question by the Deputy, it was necessary for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to invite competitive tenders for the printing of these stamps.

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Will it be the position then that the printing of stamps of this nature will be caried out abroad at all times in the future or is it the intention of the Minister to make facilities available to have the work carried out here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of an expansion of the facilities is one for the Revenue Commissioners and, therefore, for the Minister for Finance but the position is as I have stated: where possible, printing of stamps will be undertaken by the stamping branch but there is no other printing establishment in the country approved for this work.</P>
      <P>Regarding price, I should like to add that I am not in a position to disclose contract prices but the price of these stamps is covered many times over by the philatelic sales.  These sales mainly are carried out abroad.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister carried out any investigation in regard to this contract with a view to ascertaining how many man hours were involved in the printing abroad of those stamps so that we might have some idea of the employment that would have been created at home for our unemployed had the work been carried out here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo; but I am satisfied that RTE, the only State-sponsored body under the aegis of my Department, is fully conscious of the desirability of giving maximum support to Irish industry by purchasing Irish goods wherever possible.</P>
      <P>During 1975 my Department purchased from foreign firms goods to the value of about £679,000 where Irish manufacturers had submitted tenders.  During the same period my Department purchased goods manufactured, processed or assembled in Ireland to the value of about £10.57 million.</P>

      <P>There are three relevant sections.  Section 23 of the 1960 Act provides for Exchequer advances to RTE for capital purposes, and there has been no excess there. Section 27 provides that they may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, borrow money by means of the creation of stock and so on.  RTE have been given authority under that section to borrow up to £3.433 million.  They have not exceeded this limit.  Approval for this borrowing was given pending an increase in the present statutory limit for repayable advances under the section I referred to previously.</P>

      <P>It has been answered as far as I am concerned.  I have nothing to hide.  These are quite lengthy statements which would occupy a lot of time if they were read out in full. If the Deputy wants information about a specific firm, I will answer the question if he puts it down, but he has asked for a very long piece of information which can only be given in the form of a tabular statement and which will be, as is customary, circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the number of EEC and ECMT authorisations granted to Irish hauling companies or individual hauliers by his Department in the years 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976; the names of the hauliers in each year; and the number of authorisations granted in each case.</P>

      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Allocation of Ireland's Quotas of EEC and ECMT Multilateral Authorisations for the carriage of goods by road for 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why only two EEC authorisations were granted to a company (name supplied) in County Wexford this year in view of the fact that three EEC and one ECMT authorisations were granted in the years 1974 and 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland received 50 authorisations for 1976 under the EEC Community quota licensing system for the international carriage of goods by road for hire or reward and 13 licences under a similar scheme operated by the European Conference of Ministers of Transport.</P>
      <P>The EEC authorisations are valid for transport between the nine member States of the EEC while the ECMT authorisations are valid for transport between 18 countries, namely the nine member States of the EEC and Austria, Greece, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Yugoslavia.  Both types of authorisation are intended primarily for multilateral transport but bilateral use is not, however, ruled out.</P>
      <P>All of the EEC/ECMT authorisations have been allocated to those applicants who, in my view, have demonstrated that they are so equipped and organised as to make the greatest use of the authorisations. In the case of applicants who already held EEC/ECMT authorisations, I also took into account the use made by them of the authorisations.</P>
      <P>The company named by the Deputy were allocated three EEC and one ECMT authorisations for 1975.  In the covering letters from my Department, which accompanied the authorisations, it was explained to the company that the authorisations would expire on 31st December, 1975, and that the allocation of authorisations for 1975 would not necessarily entitle the holders to authorisations for 1976 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>The company applied in November, 1975, for seven EEC/ECMT authorisations for 1976.  The company's application was carefully considered in conjunction with the many other applications received and on the basis of the information furnished in the application, particularly the company's usage for multilateral journeys of their 1975 allocation, the merits of the other applications, which this year were greatly increased in number and the limited number of authorisations available for distribution, I decided to allocate two EEC authorisations to the company for 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that the bulk of international road transport is dealt with on a bilateral basis and a haulier does not need either EEC or ECMT multilateral authorisations in order to engage in international transport of a <Col N="1479" /> bilateral nature.  Bilateral permits are, however, usually required for such transport and these can be obtained by hauliers direct from the transport authorities of the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>With a view to facilitating Irish hauliers in obtaining bilateral permits, I recently concluded a bilateral road transport agreement with the French authorities.  The agreement will enable Irish hauliers to obtain permits to operate to, from and in transit across France direct from my Department instead of from the French authorities as heretofore.  The agreement will come into force on 1st March, 1976.  My Department are currently negotiating road transport agreements with a number of other EEC countries.</P>

      <P>When the licences were issued in 1974 or in 1975 it was explained to the holders that it did not necessarily mean when they got those authorisations that they would be given licences in the following year. The person about whom the Deputy is asking a question had four licences for 1975 and during 1975 he made over 200 journeys out of this country, quite a considerable number, but of these only 19 required the use of multilateral licences; the others were all bilateral journeys.  I considered four licences to make 19 journeys was more than enough.  It might even be argued that two licences to make 19 journeys was more than enough.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why no EEC or ECMT authorisations were granted to a company (name supplied) in Wexford who are the second largest exporters of beef and mutton in the country this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No application for EEC or ECMT authorisations was received from the Wexford company named by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application was however received from an associated company and this application was given careful consideration in conjunction with the many other applications received.  On the basis of the information furnished in the application, the merits of the other applications, which this year <Col N="1481" /> were greatly increased in number, and the limited number of authorisations available for distribution, I did not find it possible to allocate any authorisations to the company.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained, the bulk of international road transport is dealt with on a bilateral basis and a haulier does not need either EEC or ECMT multilateral authorisations in order to engage in international transport of a bilateral nature. Bilateral permits are however usually required for such transport and these can be obtained by hauliers direct from the transport authorities of the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>With a view to facilitating Irish hauliers in obtaining bilateral permits, I recently concluded a bilateral road transport agreement with the French authorities.  The agreement will enable Irish hauliers to obtain permits to operate to, from and in transit across France direct from my Department instead of from the French authorities as heretofore.  The agreement will come into force on 1st March, 1976. My Department are currently negotiating road transport agreements with a number of other EEC countries.</P>

      <P>Yes.  they can apply for bilateral agreement to the Government of the country concerned.  We have only one formal agreement signed, that is with the French authorities. However, we are engaged in discussions with other countries to try to set up bilateral agreements with other countries which would have the effect that hauliers in Ireland who want to travel to those countries instead of applying to Bonn, if they want to go to Germany, will be able to get permits from the Department of Transport and Power.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but it would be most undesirable if I were to step in because the responsibility is on CIE to put forward a pension scheme.

The extracting of that continuously from the records of these companies would require very considerable effort.  In regard to the technicalities involved it could not be done instantly.

They, and consultants whom they employed, were satisfied that they were capable of doing the work.

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware this firm is in liquidation on the directions of the court. Any fraudulent behaviour would, of course, come to the notice of the liquidator in the course of his investigation of the company's books.  He would have it within his competence to refer the matter to the court for whatever action should be taken.  In these circumstances it would not be appropriate for an investigation with which I would be concerned under the Companies Act to be carried out, given that the liquidator is in a position to do the job.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mistaken when he says this question arose 12 months ago.  It has, in fact, been going on for quite a number of years now.  On 29th January, 1973, officers of my Department wrote to Carlow County Council as follows:</P>
      <P>I desire to inform you that the Department proposes to erect a new Community School at Muine Bheag shortly.  It is essential that the new building be sited adjacent to the existing vocational school which was built in recent years so that the accommodation in that school can continue to be used as part of the whole complex.  It seems from a survey of the area that the only site that would be suitable under the circumstances is the site adjacent to the vocational school...which we understand is the property of the Council.  The Department would be glad, if the Council would agree to sell the site to the Department.</P>
      <P>I might add that in addition to a large range of teaching facilities the school will include a Sports Hall and tarmacadam play areas for tennis, basketball etc.  We would also hope to purchase additional land in the vicinity for use as playing fields. All the school facilities and recreational facilities will be available to the Community in general.</P>

    <P>That was in January, 1973.  In fact, this question goes back to 1970, or earlier, as the Deputy may know.  In the first part of his supplementary question he mentioned 12 months ago. Now I take the same view as my predecessor did: the place to put the <Col N="1498" /> community school is on the site of the existing vocational school.  The delay involved is not something for which I have special responsibility and the question about the price of transferring the national school does not arise at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that 12 months ago a public meeting in Muine Bheag were in complete agreement that this was not a suitable site and they wanted the community school on a separate site.  The Minister must be further aware that the proposed site is unsuitable because it will take playing fields from the children in Pairc Mhuire.  At this late stage would the Minister give an undertaking when he will be able to take a definite decision and let the people know if he is going ahead with the school on the proposed new site?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the debate on this Bill I was dealing with section 4, which, as I indicated, rewrites sections 2 and 3 of the Explosives Substances Act, 1883, to take account of present day circumstances, particularly <Col N="1536" /> to take account of the fact that the wording in that Act is no longer appropriate.  It spoke of offences being committed by a British subject outside the British dominions.  It has been necessary to rewrite the section in modern terms.  In effect, the section now rewrites sections 2 and 3 of the 1883 Act, so that section 2 of that Act now states: that a person who is in the State or, being an Irish citizen, outside the State unlawfully and maliciously causes an explosion will be guilty of an offence and a person who in the State or, being an Irish citizen outside the State, unlawfully and maliciously does any act with the intention of causing an explosion or who has in his possession the means of causing an explosion shall be guilty of an offence, whether an explosion does or does not take place.  The House will note that, as worded, it makes the offences in question, of causing or planning to cause explosions, extra-territorial offences not merely in regard to Northern Ireland but also to Great Britain.  It was a desirable change to rewrite those old sections in modern language and to take account of the exigencies of present times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said in relation to section 3 applies equally to section 4.  All the Minister can do is to rely on the integrity of our judges.  That integrity I accept, but those judges are, however, as impotent as anybody else when it comes to deciding a case when evidence has been manufactured.  That portion of the section which provides that an Irish citizen may be tried here for committing an offence outside the jurisdiction leaves that position open. Ultimately, people accept the law, accept the judicial process and accept the process whereby they may be tried, convicted, punished and imprisoned only where there is confidence in the police officers who investigate the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is confidence in the integrity of those who prosecute a case and where there is confidence in the honesty of those who try the case, the people accept the law.  In the case of an Irish citizen accused of having, <Col N="1537" /> for example, explosives in his possession with intent in Belfast or Birmingham, one of the three essential ingredients will be missing because, despite the integrity of those who prosecute in this State, from the Director of Public Prosecutions downwards, and despite the accepted honesty of our judges, those judges and State prosecutors must rely completely on the evidence of the Belfast or Birmingham police officers.  Such officers will say that when they took, for example, &ldquo;Paddy Murphy&rdquo;, into custody and examined him forensically they found traces of nitroglycerine on his finger nails.  In those circumstances, where such a case will depend solely on the word of such a police officer, &ldquo;Paddy Murphy&rdquo; may be sentenced to 20 years in prison.</P>
    <P>I object to giving persons in the security forces in Northern Ireland, with their known record, such a power. Even more objectionable than the power given to such a police officer is the position the Minister will be placing our judges in.  Our judges can only act on the evidence they hear.  I mean it as no disparagement of our judges, rather as a compliment to our Garda, when I say that our judges are not accustomed to dealing with cases involving policemen conspiring among themselves to suborn justice.  Any legislation that has the ultimate effect, no matter how innocent its purpose, of weakening the respect and regard our citizens have for the honesty and integrity of the judiciary is bad legislation.</P>
    <P>An example I shall give may show how offensive this section is.  Some weeks ago we had the entire British Press screaming its collective indignation because Dr. Sheila Cassidy had been subjected to inhuman and degrading torture and ill-treatment in Chile.  Ambassadors were recalled, envoys were sent forthwith to file complaints to the UN Sub-Commission dealing with human rights.  Everything was done bar sending a gunboat to Chile.  I should like to postulate the position as to what might have happened had Dr. Sheila Cassidy been an Irish citizen and this Bill had become law.</P>
    <P>I suppose for starters the Minister <Col N="1538" /> would have said that rather than protest we should not go overboard about it.  Supposing Dr. Cassidy was an Irish citizen and flew home to complain, accompanied by two Special Branch detectives who made signed statements to the Garda.  If those gentlemen with their signed statements went to court and swore that Dr. Cassidy, an Irish citizen, had on a given date in Chile an explosive substance under her control with intent by means thereof to endanger life, and that they had arrested this lady in Chile and found gelignite in her handbag, the lady, instead of flying off to the UN to protest about her barbaric treatment would be standing in the dock in Green Street charged under section 4 (3) (b) of this Bill.  She would be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 20 years.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me how the three judges could decide such a case other than in accordance with the sworn evidence of the detectives from Chile?  No matter what denials that lady might give in her own defence at Green Street the detectives from Chile would be able to produce finger-print evidence, or other forensic evidence, to substantiate their sworn evidence. That is what is possible under this section and that is the position of contempt the Minister is placing our judiciary in.  The Minister will be striking the first blow at the laws of the State by demeaning, in the eyes of the public, the judges who have to administer such a law.  If the Minister says that Chile is too far away to use as an example and that the reality of the Bill is concerned with Northern Ireland and Great Britain, my reply is that Chile is far away geographically only.  The torture, inhuman and degrading treatment inflicted on Dr. Cassidy, British citizen in Chile, is similar to that which was meted out by forces of the British crown to our citizens in Northern Ireland.  The only difference is that in Dr. Cassidy's case she was a British subject and, apparently, it is not proper to inflict such indignity on British subjects, though the British can inflict similar and worse in any part of the world they choose, whether it be Aden, Kenya, Cyprus or Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> It would have been laughable had two Chilean Special Branch detectives travelled to Heathrow and so accused Dr. Cassidy on her arrival, because nobody would have believed the word of the Chilean officers in circumstances where it has been officially tolerated by the Chileans that their officers could so ill-treat a person. However, why should we give any more recognition to the word of a British or Northern Ireland Special Branch officer whose own antecedents were as bad if not worse?  Their crimes against people of this country seemingly have been officially tolerated and condoned, if not encouraged, by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Possibly the only other distinction that could be drawn between Chile and Northern Ireland&mdash;I mention it in case the Minister overlooks it&mdash;is that in Chile the first protestors on the scene against such inhuman treatment are the Socialist International group.  Their voices are strangely muted when it comes to dealing with similar happenings in Northern Ireland.  I have no doubt that this will change with the incoming president of that group whose accession to office is dependent upon and motivated by British support when he assumes office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to deal with some technical matters arising out of this section. I should like him to confirm or otherwise my opinion that what section 4 does is to amend the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, and that quite apart from this piece of legislation that Act will now stand by itself as an updated part of our law and that offences can arise under it.  In addition, I should like him to confirm or otherwise that section 2 will operate to make offences under the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, as amended and updated, offences that will come within the general provisions of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, I am in some difficulty about the actual wording.  The new section 2 of the Explosive Substances Act, will speak about &ldquo;a person <Col N="1540" /> who in the State, or being an Irish citizen outside the State unlawfully ...&rdquo;.  That will become a scheduled offence under this legislation. Section 2, which makes it an offence under the provisions of this Bill, speaks about &ldquo;where a person does in Northern Ireland an act that, if done in the State, would constitute an offence...&rdquo;.  Is it not the case that double wording is involved here?  The Explosive Substances Act will speak about &ldquo;a person who in the State...&rdquo; and this legislation will talk about &ldquo;where a person does in Northern Ireland an act that, if done in the State, would constitute an offence...&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister will elucidate that for me when he replies because it appears to me that there is some confusion of words, if not of facts.</P>
    <P>I must confess to having mixed feelings about this section.  I agree with Deputy Collins that the section is subject to the general criticism the rest of the Bill merits, namely, the general undesirability of making the operation of these provisions of our law subject to the good faith of persons outside our jurisdiction in whom, quite frankly, we have not got good faith.  I should like the Minister to deal with this aspect of the section in his reply.</P>
    <P>Will these provisions enable our authorities to initiate action in the Six-County area against persons who have been responsible for bombing outrages in this State?  It is fairly widely believed that the explosions which were perpetrated in Dublin&mdash;two major explosions in Dublin city and the more recent explosion at Dublin airport&mdash; were caused maliciously by persons from outside the State, almost certainly from the Six-County area, who came into this State.  Perhaps our security forces know more about this matter than they have had occasion to make public.  It seems to me that under the provisions of section 4 our authorities would be able to seek to have the persons concerned prosecuted in the Six-County area and that is something all of us would welcome.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some positive information about the situation.  Has he any knowledge of the persons or has he any information <Col N="1541" /> about the persons who are suspected of having perpetrated these atrocities? Does he have any indication whether the Northern security forces or the British have any information about these people?  God knows, the British Government and their different agencies have this island of ours saturated with intelligence forces of one sort or another.  Surely by now they must have a fairly clear idea of who was responsible for these atrocities?  If they have, is the Minister aware of any such knowledge?  If so, will he tell the House whether when this section becomes law we will be able to seek to have proceedings initiated?</P>
    <P>As the Explosive Substances Act, 1833, will be part of our criminal law on its own merits, apart from this legislation, will the Minister state if it will be possible for us to initiate extradition proceedings under these amended sections of the Act, apart from the Bill now before the House?</P>
    <P>On the section&mdash;I know Deputy Collins and my colleagues share this view&mdash;while we find it as repellent and objectionable on general principles as the other provisions in the Bill nevertheless we consider that the atrocity of indiscriminate bombing in public places is such an appalling development and is so brutal and inhumane that we would be prepared to let this section go without any great objection to it because of the nature of the offences with which it deals.  This development of indiscriminately placing explosives in public places is one which nobody can countenance and is a particularly abhorrent development.  Even though I have said we must be very careful in confronting particular situations not to throw overboard our whole system of protecting the rights of the individual, nevertheless in regard to this type of offence we would be prepared to go a long way with the Minister in seeking to have it stamped out, if that is possible in the present situation.  I would be grateful to the Minister if he would speak to us about the situation in regard to the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Haughey has expressed the universal <Col N="1542" /> abhorrence of the urban bombings, probably the most fiendish crime being committed in modern day terms.  Having regard to all the fiendish crimes that have been committed, this is probably the worst, because of its callousness and the amount of harm it can inflict.  Of course, we all share this abhorrence&mdash; I know Deputy Collins feels it too, but if it had been expressed in the course of his speech I might not have found it as lobsided as I did.  It is really straining things to bring in the Chilean situation by way of analogy because one of the important distinctions is that the UK is a parliamentary democracy, whereas Chile is a military dictatorship.</P>
      <P>I think it would ill become anybody in this Parliament, particularly the Opposition, to make that bald comparison and not make that distinction. The person to whom the Deputy referred does not have any redress against that military dictatorship as would a person living in a parliamentary democracy, both by taking that democracy before an international tribunal, like the European Court of Human Rights, or seeking&mdash;and getting&mdash;redress and compensation in the domestic courts, as has happened in the UK.  In fairness, in order to have the argument balanced, I felt I must put that on record.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey addressed himself to the section and I am grateful to him for it.  The first point he raised was in regard to the wording.  He asked if we were saying the same thing twice.  We are not.  I think I should deal with the Explosive Substances Act, 1883 which is being amended by this section.  It covers &ldquo;a person who in the State or (being an Irish citizen) outside the State&rdquo;, and so on.  For example, if a person from here committed an offence in the UK and was detected here he would be guilty of an offence here without more ado, but if a person of French nationality committed an offence under this section in Northern Ireland he would be caught by virtue of section 2.  This is the distinction between the two sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He asked whether extradition would <Col N="1543" /> arise in the context of a person in Northern Ireland guilty of having caused explosions down here.  Such a person would be in exactly the same position as a person found down here charged with an offence up there.  A person found up there alleged to have committed an offence of causing an explosion down here would be subject to extradition if the extradition process was in operation.  It would be a matter for the authorities here whether to seek extradition.  I imagine extradition would be sought and it would be a question then for him to plead that he was entitled to political exemption.  If that person's appeal were successful, he could then fall to be prosecuted in the domestic courts in Northern Ireland by virtue of the corresponding Act.  He would have to be prosecuted to a conviction on evidence supplied principally by the Garda Síochána&mdash;whatever evidence would be available to them by way of fingerprints, direct evidence or whatever it might be.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, with regard to the explosions which have taken place down here, we do not have any evidence nor are we aware that there is evidence in the other jurisdiction which could lead to the conviction of the guilty persons.  The fact that there is no evidence for crimes that have already taken place does not take from the desirability of having this law on the Statute Book.  We hope that circumstances in the future of having to look for such evidence will not arise because we hope that such dastardly crimes will not be repeated.  The fact that the legislation will be on the Statute Book may in itself be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred&mdash;I just make a passing reference to this because I do not want to broaden this into a general debate&mdash;to the jurisdiction being saturated&mdash;I think that is the word he used&mdash;with intelligence people from the UK.  That is not something of which I have any knowledge nor do I think that is the position.  It introduces an emotive element into this area that we could well do without because the very heinousness of the <Col N="1544" /> crimes we are attempting to deal with already have raised emotions, feelings that could be damaging to the mutual interests of our two countries and our two peoples, because one of the cases which the amending section is intended to deal with is that of the urban bomber in Great Britain; the bombs that have been placed there and have exploded there have done much harm to the relationship between this country and the UK and have put quite some prejudice on the position of Irish people who live and work in Great Britain.  It is very important that, when we are debating the Bill which gives us power to try here persons suspected of urban bombings in Great Britain, we should be seen to be adamant in our determination to ensure that such persons would not escape the law.  We owe that to our exiles.</P>

      <P>There are a couple of points I should like the Minister to clarify.  In the section as it stands, amending the 1883 Act, there is mention of a person &ldquo;who in the State or (being an Irish citizen) outside the State...&rdquo; and the section talks about committing an offence or planning to do it, or having an explosive substance. What is the position in regard to a non-Irish citizen planning to cause an explosion within the State or having helped to cause it?  That is clearly where it is a non-Irish citizen.  What is the position in regard to natives of the Six Counties&mdash;are they and will they be regarded for the purposes of this Act as citizens of the State, as they are entitled to be, or may they opt out and claim they are citizens of Great Britain?  One would be outside the Six Counties, anywhere, a non-Irish citizen, or a citizen of the Six Counties committing or causing or planning to be caused any of these things.</P>

A person resident in Northern Ireland causing an explosion in this jurisdiction would also be caught <Col N="1545" /> by the new section 4 which amends section 2 of the 1883 Act, which section is replaced by section 4 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>That is what I thought.  Surely it is strange and this is the kernel of what I have been asking the Minister&mdash;that a non-citizen of either North or South, planning or causing or having a substance to cause an explosion, or even supplying it, is in no way caught by the Bill nor will he have been held to have committed any offence in so far as our law is concerned.  If the law and jurisdiction in which he planned or conspired to cause an explosion here or in the Six Counties were to catch him, he could find a safe haven here under our jurisdiction, even if the plan had been carried out and an explosion had been caused here by that planning.  Is there not a strange anomaly there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is true.  This Bill does not make it an offence for aliens to conspire abroad to commit an offence here.  We have not gone so far in this Bill.  That would be broadening the concept of extra-territoriality to an unusual degree.  I do not say that some circumstances would not justify it.  We make this provision with regard to Irish citizens because we have a certain responsibility for the acts of Irish citizens committed anywhere abroad.  To discharge that responsibility we extend our powers and obligations by this legislation.  We do not take power to deal with aliens conspiring abroad.  We do take power to deal with aliens if they conspire in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of the same thing would be the position of an alien resident here but conspiring abroad to cause or do any of these things.  He may come and go, but he is an alien, he does his planning and conspiring outside the island, outside our jurisdiction, outside the four shores of this country, but in relation to the offences specified here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not be <Col N="1548" /> covered by the Bill, but I would find it difficult to conceive of him being able to do that without being guilty of the offence of conspiring here. Some part of his action would be probably related to his residence here. I cannot go any further than that.  It would probably be a crime against our domestic law, but if he so comported himself that he did not do that there would be no offence committed by him.  That is the present law and the Bill does not propose to change that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the dubious possibility of his being amenable to some law or other.  What is the position, as the Minister sees it, under our law and the supposed law of the alien who outside our jurisdiction plans any of these things which would constitute an offence if he were a citizen?  What is his situation thereafter if he should come into our jurisdiction?</P>

      <P>Our laws do not give us power to deal with him.  They give us power to deal only with domestic crimes unless we take specific extra-territorial powers to deal with them. This Bill does not purport to deal with the general body of aliens.  Consequently the alien, in the example adduced by Deputy Blaney, would not be guilty of any offence under our law as it presently stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He must commit an offence within the jurisdiction.  It could be possible that the mere fact of his coming into the country could be part of the conspiracy and that that would render him amenable to our criminal code.  Of course, it would be a very difficult matter of proof at that stage, but it could be possible that by coming in he would be furthering the conspiracy which he had been planning abroad.  Apart from that, there would not be any way of dealing with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is something strangely lacking in what the Minister is attempting to do.  It seems to be designed for a limited number of possibilities only.  An alien may conspire abroad to carry out explosions and do all sorts of damage but, even though we know this, that person can walk in and out of the country.  It seems an extraordinary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If as a result of the conspiracy an explosion took place here and that person were to be found here, then he would be a party to the actual offence of causing the explosion and would be amenable to our laws. Generally the Bill is not designed to deal with such aliens.  It is designed to deal with the problem as we have it in this island and in Great Britain, because this is where the bombing problem is happening.  We are not under attack by virtue of a conspiracy anywhere else in the world.  Should it so happen that that dreadful day will come, then we will certainly have to look at our extra-territorial legislation to take powers to deal with the situation. As I said the need for such legislation does not, happily, arise at the moment.  We hope that it will not arise, but should it arise then we would have to take power to extend the extra-territoriality of our laws. With the spread of international terrorism and the facilities of modern travel and communications, it is not <Col N="1550" /> out of the question, but hopefully it will not arise for us here.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with the problem of explosions in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  In so far as they involve extra-territoriality, we take powers under this Bill to deal with them.  We do not go farther than that in relation to aliens.  We do go farther in relation to Irish citizens, because every country has a responsibility under international law for the acts of its citizens if those acts damage its position in the international family.  To that extent we do take power over the acts of Irish citizens abroad, but we do not go so far as to take power over the acts of aliens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I still find it extraordinary that this should be the situation. I find it more extraordinary that the Minister should indicate that such conspiracy has not taken place outside the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.  We do not know whether such conspiracy has not already taken place outside Britain and Ireland in relation to explosions that may have occurred here.</P>
      <P>In regard to residents or citizens of the Six Counties, the Minister says they are caught by the existing laws, or reciprocal laws, or a combination of both, in the Six Counties.  What is the situation in regard to a Six-County resident or citizen claiming non-Irish citizenship&mdash;in other words, British citizenship&mdash;planning an explosion on this side of the Border and amenable to the laws of the Six Counties?  Is he amenable to our laws if he comes across the Border thereafter?  This would be a Six-County resident claiming British citizenship who would have conspired to cause an explosion on this side of the Border and who is amenable to the laws of the Six-County jurisdiction but crossing the Border afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He would clearly be caught by section 2 subsection (2) which provides:</P>
      <P>Where a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  in Northern Ireland, aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence specified in the Schedule,&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> One of the offences specified in the Schedule is the offences under section 3 of the 1883 Act of planning to cause an explosion or having an explosive in his possession.  He would be caught by virtue of that section irrespective of the fact that he was not an Irish citizen and was claiming UK citizenship. If that person was detected in this jurisdiction he would be amenable to the laws of this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is quite right when he says we do not know if there are aliens conspiring abroad.  It is something we cannot know.  We have to assume it is not happening because there is no evidence of any aliens conspiring against us.  If that situation changes, and I certainly hope it will not, we may have to look at our laws again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the House thinks it appropriate that these three sections be taken together.  There is no real reason in practical terms for amending sections 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 of the Larceny Act in the manner in which it is proposed to do so and especially in this Bill.  The primary reason for amending the law is if the existing law has proved itself defective in practice or, in the case of criminal law, has become difficult to operate. My experience and my information in relation to the provisions of the Larceny Act are that in respect of housebreaking, larceny, burglary, sacrilege and all such matters there is not the slightest difficulty in regard to prosecutions. Of course, the offence of sacrilege will now disappear from our Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill tries to convey the impression that there were technical concepts and technical difficulties associated with the prosecution of these types of offences under the 1916 Larceny Act.  This is not so.  In regard, say, to housebreaking it had to be proved that a break-in had taken place, that an entry had occurred and a legal formulation of what each of those two consisted of had developed as it will develop in relation to any section or part of law that comes before the courts frequently.  There has been no difficulty in proving burglary, robbery or housebreaking cases where the facts warranted such prosecution and convictions. Where facts did not warrant such convictions they often proved sufficient to convict of lesser offences which may have been all that the accused person had committed in the first place.</P>
    <P>The more general and overall objection to these three sections is that they are taken verbatim from the English Theft Act, 1968.  There is nothing wrong with that as such but it seems ludicrous to take a few isolated sections of our existing legislation and replace them with a verbatim transcript of a few isolated sections of an English Act while at the same time ignoring that the entire of the Theft Act is based on a new concept that is still absent from our law.  The Theft Act is based on a total repeal of the 1916 Larceny Act and involves an entirely new concept of what constitutes theft. If the Minister wished to amend the law in relation to burglary, robbery and housebreaking, the proper course for him to have adopted would have then been to bring in new legislation which would supplant totally the Larceny Act and, if necessary, use the new concepts devised in the Theft Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will wait a minute.  He is getting <Col N="1553" /> the worst of both worlds by taking isolated provisions from the Larceny Act and replacing them with isolated sections of the Theft Act.  Some of the new provisions seem less stringent than the old ones.  For example, subsection (2) of section 27 of the Larceny Act provided for a break-in with intent to commit any type of felony, whereas the substitute section, 23, would seem to limit the felony which he may intend to cause.  The only sections of the Larceny Act which may occasionally give rise to trouble&mdash;and I am talking of trouble only from the point of view of prosecutions&mdash;are those sections dealing with receiving stolen property, something which can be exceedingly difficult to prove.  It was to overcome these difficulties that the English Theft Act introduced the concept of handling stolen goods rather than receiving them.  Curiously, this section of the Act is not being incorporated in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the real reason for these amendments to our Larceny Act concerns the problems associated with extradition.  Since the Theft Act came into force in England, and the great majority of extradition warrants coming to this country are for offences of this nature, there have been many problems because of the two Statutes being different.  All the court here can do is look at the description on the warrant which comes from England and decide whether the factual material set out in the warrant constitute acts which, if committed here, would amount to criminal offences.  In practice, what has been happening is that in cases of persons being wanted in England for theft under section 1 of the Theft Act such warrants were thrown out by the courts because they did not correspond with our law.  The situation then developed whereby essential fraudulent warrants were sent from England which, instead of saying that so and so is wanted in England for dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of depriving the other permanently of it, would say that such a person dishonestly appropriated property belonging to another by taking or carrying away the same property with the intention <Col N="1554" /> of permanently depriving the owner thereof.  This was not an offence under English law but it was the type of warrant that the English authorities solemnly sent here.  Then, the Irish courts had to construe such warrants as being equivalent to the offences of larceny under section 2 of our Larceny Act and the person concerned would be duly returned to England.  I make no argument regarding the merits of such persons in any case but the fact remains that during the past two or three years a fraud has been perpetrated on the Irish courts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>...it is to be assumed that a statement of facts such as the one appearing on the warrant executed in this case, or any warrant sent here for execution, is a truthful statement of the facts of the case in respect of which the arrest is sought. If it should transpire in any case, that the statements of facts set out in the charge were not supported by any evidence then, of course, a very serious situation would arise and the Courts would be obliged to examine such warrants in a completely different light, because to setout <Col N="1555" /> statements of fact on a warrant, for the purpose of giving the charge the appearance of corresponding to an offence under Irish Law, when these factual statements are not capable of being borne out by evidence, would be to practice a fraud upon the courts of this country.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is now trying to get things back on the road as it were; and if he is to be congratulated at all, it is for making these efforts to remedy the situation. He has returned to some sort of grace but it would be better if he admitted what has been going on and said that this portion of the Bill was designed to cover the position.  However, if one goes by the Explanatory Memorandum, instead of apologising, as I think he should, for what has happened, the Minister comes here with these sections as something that is advancing the criminal law.  It does nothing of the sort.  If he had wanted properly and effectively to get over the position in which the courts are not being treated as they should be, it would have been a simple matter to put a schedule of offences to the existing Extradition Act and have those offences deemed to correspond with certain offences in England.  It might have been expecting too much to expect that it would happen in that way.  I should like to hear the Minister deal with the case I have made and, if I am wrong, I shall be the first to admit it and to apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1556" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extremely serious matter for a Deputy, a spokesman of the Opposition, to make the allegation here that warrants being sent for execution under the extradition process are fraudulent and it is something I must reject and protest about.</P>
      <P>I will leave the subject because it is not relevant to what we are debating despite Deputy Collins's effort to drag it in.  The present position is that all law relating to the dishonest appropriation of property is old-fashioned.  It is on the statute books since 1916.  It needs to be updated, amended and codified possibly, and it needs to take account of the refinements that have been made in it by judicial decisions over the years.  This is a very major piece of law reform, and it will necessarily take some time when our resources can be directed to it.  The opportunity was taken in this Bill to reform that law in regard to a number of instances dealt with in sections 5, 6 and 7.  Deputy Collins said the present laws do not give rise to any difficulties in these areas.  I think he is mistaken in that.  I recall personal experience in regard to seeing and being involved in prosecutions of offences under these sections.  The law is most complicated and complex and has anomalies.  Sections 6 and 7 replace the present offences of burglary, and the other offences under the 1916 Act which involve breaking and entering buildings, with a new and simplified offence of burglary and a new offence of aggravated burglary.  The existing offences are extremely complicated.  There are separate offences depending on the kind of building entered, whether the entry is or is not by breaking; whether entry takes place by day or by night. These make for unnecessary complications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amending of these three provisions by the introduction of the new sections in this Bill simplifies the law and makes it more readily understood to practitioners and others interested in discovering what it is and makes it simpler for both prosecuting and defending counsel.  They will know that the law is clear and there will be an avoidance of the present position where justice may be evaded for lack <Col N="1557" /> of form in an indictment due to failure to comply with, or to acknowledge all these technical differences as to the type of building, whether it is day or night, whether it is breaking or entering Not frequently but not infrequently &mdash;and I speak as somebody who took full advantage of the complexity of the law&mdash;we have had persons escaping the consequences of their acts not on the merits of whether they were guilty or not but on technical faults in the prosecution of the case.</P>
    <P>Anything that clears up that situation is to be desired and the amendments proposed here do clear up the situation.  The fact that they are limited to these three areas does not take from the improvement they make or the advisability of making the change.  I do not differ from Deputy Collins on this &mdash;it would be more desirable if we were to bring in a brand new Act relating to the dishonest appropriation of another person's property.  That would be a major law reform and it will have to wait for another day. When we have the opportunity here of making changes to improve the present criminal law we should take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>There is the further necessity that, because we are making these extra-territorial offences, we want as far as possible to have the law in both jurisdictions on all fours.  Otherwise, we will have an anomalous situation in which something in one jurisdiction would not be an offence when committed extra-territorially but would be an offence within the other jurisdiction if committed domestically.  We must be careful not to run into anomalies and that is one reason why the changes are being made here apart from their desirability in their own right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey welcomed, and I appreciate the welcome he gave to the amendment of the law relating to burglary involving force.  He welcomed the new offence of aggravated burglary by pointing out that regrettably it is becoming more common and that it is important to have it clearly marked on our statute book as a serious offence carrying very heavy penalties.  I make no apology for bringing in these limited reforms&mdash;any reform is good <Col N="1558" /> albeit limited&mdash;and they are necessary in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Sections 5, 6 and 7 involve the repeal of sections 24 to 27 of the Larceny Act, 1916.  I think the Minister has acknowledged that the case still stands that he is repealing only three sections or four sections and introducing these three sections here in their place.  This is not a tidy way or the best way to do it.  Would the Minister say if he sees these particular offences &mdash;he has not said so; I am not arguing that these are not the ones immediately in his mind&mdash;as being the kind of offences for which the powers given under this Bill are designed, as distinct from the other offences under the Larceny Act?  He has more or less said that what he is doing here is bringing the law up to date as regards certain sections of the Larceny Act.  That is not the full story.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has also been saying that he is tidying up the criminal law generally and bringing it up to date.  He is doing the very opposite and making criminal law as untidy as it could possibly be because what he is doing in that sense is taking out three specific sections or areas that have hitherto been covered under the Larcency Act and putting them into what might be called this extra-territorial piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is no element of a person committing an offence outside the country in relation to something which would be an offence here, such as the <Col N="1559" /> ordinary case of robbery or burglary, the Minister must realise that he is now confusing the criminal-law to the extent that he is introducing those sections concerning these reprehensible offences into an area which is not appropriate to them.  I imagine that the vast majority of robberies, or burglaries or aggravated burglaries will have nothing whatever to do with the extra-territoriality which is behind the principle of this Bill.  The Minister, because some cases might have, has transferred whole sections of our criminal law into this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read sections 5, 6 and 7.  Section 5 states and the wording is followed in sections 6 and 7:</P>
      <P>The Larceny Act, 1916, is hereby amended by the substitution for section 23 of the following section:</P>
      <P>There then follows the new section 23, followed by the new section 23A and the new section 23B.  Therefore, the Larceny Act, 1916, is amended after the passage of this Bill irrespective of whether or not there is extra-territoriality. In so far as that is concerned two of those offences, section 23, robbery and section 23B, aggravated burglary, are included in the Schedule and are made extra-territorial offences. But our domestic law, which is the Larceny Act, 1916, is amended and stands by itself as amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made by Deputy Collins still stands.  The Larceny Act, 1916, has long since been amended in England by the Theft Act. If the Minister wants to bring this up to date he should have taken a comprehensive look at it and amended the lot.  Robbery and burglary are only aspects of larceny.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister did.  But having done so he could still have included, having brought in an amending Bill to deal with all those matters and bring our law up to date, some of those offences in that new Bill in the Schedule to <Col N="1560" /> this Bill.  Why did the Minister not do it that way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To replace the law relating to theft or larceny and other dishonesty would be a major reform of the law.  It would require considerable research.  Considerable resources in manpower and time would have to be given to it, which, quite frankly, we did not have.  It would be my ambition to be able to promote a totally amended Larceny Act or Theft Act but this would take a lot of study, analysis and research.  It would not be enough, in my opinion, to copy entirely the Theft Act 1968, from the United Kingdom because certain deficiencies have manifested themselves in its working.  We would have to do research on how it has operated in that jurisdiction.  We would have to see if this research would be applicable to our jurisdiction.  We would have to look at our case law since then.  Deputy O'Kennedy will appreciate that it would be a major piece of law reform.  It does not give me any pleasure to say that we have not had the resources to do that.  Possibly the Law Reform Commission might be an appropriate body to deal with this.  Their programme has not been settled yet and I do not know if this will be part of their brief or whether criminal law will come within their ambit at all.  We are left with the second best.  I concede that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it is the second best.  It is more likely the third best.  There is a section in the Larceny Act, 1916, section 29, which could, on the Minister's presentation of the need for this Bill, have appeared here too.  This section states that every person who utters, knowing the contents thereof, any letter or writing demanding of any person with menaces and without any reasonable or proper cause any property or valuable thing shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for life.  That section is probably as relevant to extra-territoriality as those the Minister has dealt with&mdash;robbery and aggravated burglary.  The Minister has better knowledge of the pressures under which people may be operating, <Col N="1561" /> North or South, and the intimidation which may be applied North or South by unlawful organisations.</P>
      <P>I am using this as an illustration of what the Minister is doing.  He is taking particular sections and introducing them into this legislation.  When the Larceny Act, 1916, was introduced, no matter how much out of date it is now it was the result of a very detailed analysis of the criminal law as it then stood.  It was appropriate to its time.  It was comprehensive and has stood the test of time reasonably well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Research of a kind went into it.  It is not for the Minister or me to say what research went into it.  There was a certain type of research which enabled a comprehensive Bill to be presented.  Why has the Minister not found it necessary to make any reference to section 29 of the Larceny Act, 1916?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The genesis of the list of offences in the Schedule is to be found in the Law Enforcement Commission Report.  The Schedule follows the offences indicated by the Law Commission as being the offences which should be made extra-territorial. As the Deputy will have seen from reading it, they are all serious offences being committed by terrorists at the present time.  The offence in section 29 of the Larceny Act, 1916, to which he refers, is the offence known in every-day language as blackmail.  It might possibly have been a desirable offence to include in the Schedule but it was not one of those recommended by the Law Enforcement Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that it is a common terrorist offence in so far as threatening would be concerned.  The menaces <Col N="1562" /> part of it would be the serious element and that is covered in some cases by the offence of robbery, which is a scheduled offence.  The offence of robbery, as redefined, involves the use of force.  Likewise, in the unlawful seizure of vehicles there is probably the use of force there.  This is covered under section 10. The menaces element of section 29, the blackmailing section, is included in sections 5 and 10.  The reason why blackmail, as such, is not included in the schedule of offences is that it was not one of the offences recommended by the Law Enforcement Commission.  Where it is a serious offence in the terrorist sense, it is covered by sections 5 and 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 relates to a new definition of robbery and says that a person is guilty of robbery if he steals.  In addition, to constitute the offence he must, immediately before or at the time of doing so, steal. In order to do so he must use force on any person or put or seek to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.  First of all, he must steal and then he must use force or put a person in fear of force. That is robbery, which is certainly different from demanding money with menaces or blackmail, as the Minister calls it, and it is certainly not related to what is covered in section 29 of the Larceny Act; neither is it covered in section 10 which deals with and is confined to unlawful seizure of vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely used these two sections to show that the idea of menaces or a person imposing his will on another person by force was covered and that the ordinary blackmailing offence, which is what section 29 deals with, is not what one would normally call a terrorist type of offence.  However, let me say in passing that I welcome this indication by the Opposition that the number of extra-territorial offences should be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that, and I know when the Minister smiles as he says it, he does not <Col N="1563" /> believe it himself.  I am simply saying on the basis of the case presented by the Minister that if he wants to be consistent he should have gone even further.  We reject this; we have made that very clear, but in an effort to be consistent, which the Minister is not being, we are saying that if a person under section 29 as it stands receives a demand for money by threat in a letter&mdash;and I would have thought that would be a fairly common occurrence in present circumstances&mdash;such an offence is not covered in this provision which relates only to physical robbery, burglary or aggravated burglary. The Minister has fallen into the trap of taking just a few sections of the Larceny Act and amending them, the few he thinks that are related to this extra-territorial jurisdiction which is being conferred, and he has left others.  In doing that he has confused the position in the criminal law generally and he may have excluded something that he should have included. Let me come back to the definition of section 5:</P>
      <P>A person is guilty of robbery if he steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so and in order to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Those two ingredients must be there; it must happen immediately before the time of doing so and in order to do so.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.</P>
      <P>What definition of stealing are we concerned with here?  What precisely is meant by using force?  Would it be a physical assault in the terms of the normal definition of assault?  Applying physical force could simply involve putting your hand on or pushing a person who does not wish that you should do so.  Would that be force in the sense of this provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all may have a certain notion of what robbery involves, and maybe that is why the Larceny Act did not define it precisely.  This statutory definition the Minister is now putting in here may go much too far and may include things which in the normal <Col N="1564" /> concept of robbery should not be included in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if we can, in this Bill, catch people who are guilty of the offence of stealing by force we should do so, and that if we can do so in a simple section, that is what should be desired.  That is what, I submit to the House, this section does.  &ldquo;Stealing&rdquo; would, of course, have the definition in the Larceny Act, 1916.  There would have to be no claim of right, and all the other ingredients of the offence of larceny under the 1916 Act.  The only way to define force is to get an English dictionary, but it will be for the courts to decide whether force was used or not.  Force would not require any legal definition.  It would be a matter for the court to decide if force was used and if the stealing amounted to stealing under the Larceny Act, and if so, an offence would be committed.</P>
      <P>Before the Deputy goes on to say that the definition of stealing in the Theft Act, 1968, differs from the definition in the Larceny Act, 1916, let me say that the 1968 definition is so wide that it automatically embraces the definition in the 1916 Act.  I cannot conceive of any situation where a 1916 &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; definition would not fall within the 1968 definition. But under section 5, the new section of the Larceny Act, 1916, stealing will have the meaning given to it by the Larceny Act, 1916.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been tidier if the Minister had indicated with reference to the Larceny Act that &ldquo;steal&rdquo; will have the definition that is given to it in the Larceny Act, 1916.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not have any other meaning, because the Larceny Act, 1916, has this new section in it; it will be part of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take that point and go on to the next point about which I am more concerned, and I think the Minister is too.  The Minister has introduced into this criminal law of ours a provision which can mean that a person who would catch or push a person and in the <Col N="1565" /> course of that take 50p or £1 out of his pocket is liable on conviction to imprisonment for life.  It cannot all be left to the courts to decide.  I am not putting a definition on force, but it is the application of physical activity to a person against his will.  If I were to push or pull the Minister that would be force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>And if the Deputy were to steal from me at the same time, I would say that was robbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is robbery. If I take £2 or £3 out of the Minister's pocket, that is an offence punishable by life imprisonment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Minister has introduced these sections into the Bill because his mind is coloured by the territorial aspect.  He is thinking in terms of IRA men or bank robbers operating with guns.  I am not condoning what might be done, but he is bringing about a situation where youngsters who engage in robbery under section 5 are liable to penal servitude for life.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would accept the principle that the maximum penalty under the Bill here is an indication of the gravity of the offence and an indication of the attitude which we legislators have to that offence. Otherwise why should there be a maximum penalty of seven, ten or 12 years?  When we say here &ldquo;liable to penal servitude for life&rdquo; we thereby indicate&mdash;because this is the greatest penalty of the criminal law at the moment&mdash;that, in our view, this is amongst the most heinous offences known to the criminal law.  It is fine for the Minister to say the courts, in applying their common sense, will not impose that penalty.  We should not have to rely on the courts to <Col N="1566" /> apply their common sense and goodwill.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what the experience in England has been.  The Minister did not tell us that.  Having regard to the meaning of words in the normal sense, and the legal interpretation which will be put on those words, the Minister's new interpretation of &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; is far too wide.  It is not for us to amend the section.  We have gone beyond hoping that the Minister will amend it.  If we were talking in terms of the application of physical force with a weapon, or otherwise, we might be more <i>ad idem.</i>  The Minister is talking in terms of force broadly and generally.  Force has a very broad meaning.</P>
      <P>This extension of the definition of &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; this new definition, is far too wide.  It will apply to people who have no intention of robbing banks for IRA purposes.  It could apply to young boys from delinquent backgrounds for whom we all have a special responsibility.  I am not condoning what they do, but it might be well for us to condemn ourselves for allowing social circumstances to arise which lead to delinquency. Under this section they will be guilty of an offence which is punishable by penal servitude for life.</P>
      <P>The Minister depends on the common sense of judges.  I do, too.  I have that much in common with him.  The Minister is aware that there have been some examples of some judicial decisions which might have been influenced more by bias, be it political or otherwise, than by common sense. We do not have to go back too far. The Minister may be aware of some decisions which were not based on common sense.</P>

I will defend fiercely the record of the Judiciary generally but an individual judge might go a bit off the rails <Col N="1567" /> for one good reason or another. This can happen in the nature of things.  This section will enable him to do some very strange things. We are not discharging our responsibility by introducing such a wide-ranging definition of &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; which will be punishable by life imprisonment.  We could not impose a heavier sentence.  The Minister must be very concerned with that.  He put in the section because he is concerned about IRA men robbing banks, and so on.  The Minister knows our position on the Bill generally.  We would do everything we could to ensure that no IRA men, or others, rob banks.  Perhaps we would deal with them more effectively than the Minister, but we will not go into that argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To mark the seriousness of the crime of robbery.  &ldquo;Robbery&rdquo; is defined as doing something with force, as stealing with force.  The seriousness of that crime has to be marked by imposing a high maximum sentence, the highest the law can lay down.  Deputy O'Kennedy knows very well that that does not say that it is the penalty to be applied universally. The penalty to be applied can be at any level within that maximum.  This is to give the courts power to punish a heinous offence as it deserves to be punished.  There can be trivial robberies, even though it sounds a contradiction in terms.  A trivial robbery where there is a minimum amount of force and only a small amount of property stolen will be dealt with by the courts accordingly by imposing a suitable punishment.  The punishment must always fit the crime.  We must always hope that is what the courts will provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old law there were two offences and, to my way of thinking, that was unsatisfactory.  We had to wait until 1965 in the case of <i>Smith v. Desmond</i> before the law was clarified in regard to this offence.  That was an unsatisfactory position.  The Bill is now repeating in statutory form the clarified legal position.  Under the old unclear law there were these two offences, one carrying life imprisonment, and the other bearing the title &ldquo;simple robbery&rdquo; and carrying a <Col N="1570" /> maximum penalty of 14 years.  If Deputy O'Kennedy's argument is logical that the maximum penalty denotes the seriousness of the crime, and that we are out of all proportion here, I would submit to him that that argument applies equally to the old offence of simple robbery and that a maximum of 14 years denotes an extremely serious offence and could equally apply to his argument about pushing me.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's argument is that because there is a very serious maximum penalty provided here the section is somehow inappropriate for dealing with lesser offences.  I would point out to him that what we are doing here is done throughout the entire criminal code. A maximum penalty is provided and it is then for the court to assess the seriousness of the crime within that maximum.  That is all we are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this marks the seriousness of the <Col N="1571" /> offence.  Of course, a penalty of this nature does just that.  I would like to think that at a time when there is a growing awareness of what I might call the &ldquo;seeds of criminality&rdquo; and the social causes of it&mdash;that is what we are talking about here; we are talking about pure criminal law&mdash;we would take account of that and the penalties we would impose in legislation would take account of the background.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the maximum penalty we would impose would have regard to that.  One cannot introduce an amendment to the criminal law, as the Minister is doing now, in its normal sense.  Let us leave out the bank robbers and the IRA and the para-military groups and so on. The Minister should not be here introducing substantial amendments to the criminal law without having regard to the advances that have been made in the whole area of criminality and the social studies of the background of habitual delinquents. The Minister is, in fact, now closing his mind to all of that in relation to this particular section dealing with the definition of robbery because his mind is coloured by one thing only and that is IRA men with guns.</P>

I will not argue this at any great length but I do not want my position to be misrepresented, as the Minister is prone to misrepresent it.

      <P>It would appear that the Minister is proposing here that we go backwards in penal legislation. The type of offence proposed by the new section 27 (a) (i) with regard to firearms is identical in phraseology with section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act of 1883.  That section provides <Col N="1574" /> that if a person has explosives in his possession or under his control in such circumstances as to give rise to reasonable suspicion that he does not have them in his possession or under his control for a lawful object, and so on, he shall be guilty of an offence. The essential difference is that under the old Act a person had to have the explosive substance knowingly in his possession.  The absence of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in the proposed new section means a person can be convicted for having ammunition in his possession without knowing it was ammunition and he can be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.  Somebody could give me a small box, the size of a cigarette packet, and ask me to hold it for him.  If I leave it in my briefcase or in my room and forget about it and never look at the contents, and if a few weeks later my room or bag is searched, under this section I could be convicted and sentenced to five years although I had no knowledge of the contents of the package. Is that not so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is saying that because the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is not in the section it creates an absolute offence and intent does not arise or <i>mens rea</i> does not matter, but of course it does.  The fact that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is not there does not create an absolute offence.  In this section there still has to be <i>mens rea.</i> This section was criticised in that it transfers and shifts the burden of proof. I dealt with this when replying to the Second Stage debate because Deputy O'Connell raised it.  He said that the effect of this section would be that a person accused of an offence under the section of possessing a firearm or <Col N="1575" /> ammunition would be guilty until proved innocent.  That is wrong.  The section says:</P>
      <P>A person who has a firearm or ammunition in his possession or under his control in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable inference that he has not got it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose shall, unless he has it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose, be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>This does not mean that a person is guilty until he proves his innocence. The memorandum states:</P>
      <P>The essence of the offence will thus be the suspicious circumstances in which the person in question has the firearm or ammunition.  Where the defence is that the accused's purpose was lawful, the new section casts an evidential burden on the accused of proving this.  That is to say, if the prosecution proves the possession or control and the suspicious circumstances, and the accused's defence is that his purpose was lawful, it will be for him to give, adduce or elicit sufficient evidence to raise an issue fit for consideration as to the lawfulness of his purpose.  If he fails to do so, he will be guilty of the offence.  If he succeeds in doing so, the prosecution will have the usual burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that his purpose was not a lawful one.</P>
      <P>There are two burdens of proof, the evidential and the persuasive.  The persuasive burden of proof means an accused must prove that the matter is such on a balance of probabilities. There are many enactments similar to section 8&mdash;those that provide that a person is guilty of an offence if he does such-and-such without reasonable excuse, or without the leave of some authority.  Those enactments cast an evidential burden on an accused person, but not a persuasive one.  It is common enough for a person to have to discharge an evidential burden.  If he does so, the full burden falls back on the prosecution.</P>

      <P>Fair enough.  A man had firearms in his possession unlawfully and for that he is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.  Would the Minister contrast what he has done here with what has been done under section 5?  I should have thought the Minister had some zeal in dealing with people who carried firearms unlawfully.  He seems to have his priorities reversed when he said that:</P>
      <P>A person who has a firearm or ammunition in his possession or under his control in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable inference that he has not got it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> In other words, he is in unlawful possession of firearms.  I would have thought that such a person is, to say the least of it, a greater danger to society than the person who may knock somebody over for the purpose of robbing his pockets.  The Minister may have his own views on this but he does not appear to take a very serious view of a person carrying firearms unlawfully&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not &ldquo;carrying&rdquo;, that is in the next section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in his possession or under his control.  &ldquo;Control&rdquo; has been defined as physical possession. It seems to be inconsistent, judging by the Minister's standards, if the term of imprisonment is a measure of our attitude to how heinous the offence is.  He seems to have turned the public attitude upside down.  The public, I am sure, would be more concerned about dealing with people carrying firearms unlawfully, or in possession of firearms or explosives unlawfully, than they would be about people who are guilty of what is called &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used loose language when he talked about &ldquo;firearms unlawfully&rdquo;.  We have two distinct offences here under sections 8 and 9.  Section 8 deals with possession of firearms in suspicious circumstances. The next section deals with carrying firearms with criminal intent. There is a world of difference of criminality between the two.  For the former, the maximum penalty is five years, which, in comparison with life imprisonment, is not a terribly serious punishment but taken by itself it is enough to enable the court to impose a very serious punishment for the offence of having something in suspicious circumstances.  We might have our suspicions of what the suspicious circumstances might be, but are we entitled to visit our suspicions on the person to the point of imposing an ultra-draconian penalty by virtue of our suspicions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the two sections make a proper distinction.  The first, &ldquo;possession <Col N="1578" /> of firearms in suspicious circumstances&rdquo;, is marked with a maximum of five years, because there must be an element of doubt which the word &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; implies.  The second section is much more serious, &ldquo;carrying a firearm with criminal intent&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 5 deals with the possession of firearms in suspicious circumstances.  In layman's language that is what it is and what it will amount to.  In my view the maximum is adequate for that bearing in mind that the offence under the next section is a more serious one.  A person will be convicted under the next section if he is shown to have had a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence or to resist or prevent arrest of himself or another.  In such circumstances he will be guilty of an offence carrying a maximum penalty of ten years.  That marks the seriousness <Col N="1579" /> of that offence and it can be distinguised from the preceding one where there is this element of circumstances of suspicion and where there is no active use being made of the firearm.</P>

      <P>We might.  It would depend on the facts of the case, and what the Director of Public Prosecutions felt the facts would sustain by way of an indictment.  Nevertheless, we have to provide for all grades of <Col N="1581" /> robbery from the simplest to the most complicated, the most heinous and the most serious.  Consequently, the maximum punishment we provide must be appropriate to the most heinous.  Here we are dealing with a specific offence of having something under suspicious circumstances.  Nothing was done and there was no proof that anything would be done; something that is distasteful because a firearm is involved.  We provide a maximum penalty which we think is appropriate to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to deal with the contemporary crime of what is colloquially known as hi-jacking of vehicles.  This section makes such an offence a serious one because these vehicles are being taken for the commission of very serious criminal offences.  In many cases they are being stolen for bombings or bank robberies. If vehicles were not stolen, many of these horrible bombings would not take place.  The taking of a vehicle by force is, in contemporary terms, a very serious crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has indicated, this is an unwelcome characteristic of our time and has been used, unfortunately, to cause death and destruction.  There has been an increasing tendency in the normal criminal development to unlawfully seize vehicles and it is appropriate that such a section should be introduced.  Its introduction is timely.  Perhaps, in so far as the criminal law should reflect the capacity of the legislators to deal with the development of crime in any <Col N="1582" /> generation, it would be as well if this section was included in a major amending Bill, which this Bill is not.  When the Minister and his advisors have the time and the facilities to do so they might consider incorporating it in a Bill which would deal with the criminal law of larceny in its broadest sense in a comprehensive way which this Bill does not do.  Perhaps on that occasion he will have our support. We support the purpose of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In this House we have tried to be even more realistic bearing in mind the attitude of the Minister to reasoned amendments in the Seanad.  We put down only three amendments in this House, two of which were debated and were very narrowly defeated.  There is one further amendment to come.  Having regard to the Minister's attitude in the Seanad and to our two amendments which were voted on, there seems little point in trying to help him change his mind in relation to any of the details in the Bill.  In discussing this part of the Bill I am very conscious of the Minister's attitude and of the views he expressed in this House with regard to what I said on earlier sections.  However, <Col N="1583" /> there are a few aspects that must be referred to.</P>
      <P>In section 11 (2) (d) it is provided that the accused while in custody in Northern Ireland for the purpose of taking evidence shall be immune from detention and any kind of suit or legal process in certain circumstances. One of the matters that considerably disturbs our party is the fact that nowhere in the Bill is there protection for the accused from interrogation while he is in Northern Ireland. Not merely is there no protection for the accused from interrogation or sustained questioning while in Northern Ireland, there is no protection from such interrogation given to him by any of the provisions of the corresponding English Act, namely, the Criminal Jurisdiction Act, 1975, and the relevant provisions contained in Part I of Schedule IV.  These sorts of rights should be explicitly spelled out not merely in our own legislation but, even more importantly, in the sections that should correspond in the British Act.  If we are to have a system, as the Minister seems determined to have, of sending an accused person to Northern Ireland, or at least by statute providing for his attendance there, it seems to us that he must be given statutory immunity from questioning and interrogation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference in section 11 (2) (d) to immunity from detention must refer to the type of detention that was in Northern Ireland until recently.  It is clear that the accused if he is in Northern Ireland will remain there in RUC or Special Branch custody.  The Minister must be aware that it is in relation to persons in police custody in Northern Ireland, and during their interrogation and continued questioning while in such custody, that the greatest number of complaints have arisen about the Northern Ireland security forces.  Here I am not merely talking about physical brutality.  I am concerned that under the provisions of this Bill any person in Northern Ireland can be subjected to continuous interrogation by those people in respect of whom the Strasbourg <Col N="1584" /> judgement is soon apparently to be in the hands of the Government, if they have not got it already&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They have it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On this side of the House we are reasonably confident that if they have not got it they know full well what is in it&mdash;they have known since before Christmas.  The Minister may consider that this fear is unreal but I do not think it is.  It seems to me to be more unreal to have a steadfast belief in the <i>bona fides</i> of the Northern Ireland security forces &mdash;it has been indicated that the Minister and people in his party have such a belief.</P>
      <P>In this context one matter that disturbs me, and which relates specifically to my fear that persons in such custody in Northern Ireland may be so interrogated, is a comparison between a section of this Bill and the corresponding section of the English Act.  In this section it is provided that at the conclusion of the taking of evidence the accused shall be brought by the Garda Síochána as soon as may be to some convenient point of departure from the State and there delivered into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  The corresponding provisions of the English Act would appear to be paragraph 4 (5) of Schedule IV.  There is no provision that the accused person is to be delivered out of the custody of the RUC to the Garda Síochána as soon as may be.  It merely states that at the conclusion of the proceedings he is to be delivered back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  Either the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; in this draft Bill mean something or they do not.  If they mean something in our Bill, we are entitled to wonder why they are absent from the English Act.  If the Minister takes the view that these words are meaningless he should say so because then the protection supposed to be given to an accused person by our Bill is meaningless.  We are entitled to assume there was considerable corelation between the two Governments in the phraseology of the English Act and our Bill.  Obviously there must have <Col N="1585" /> been because they both provide for dual procedures.  That being the case, and it also being the case that we in this jurisdiction are aware of what has happened to persons in police custody in Northern Ireland, we are entitled to ask the significance of the absence of this phrase from the English statute.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very involved in this matter because of his commitment to accused persons, and he cannot wash his hands of it and say it is a matter for the British to enact their own legislation.  It is very much a matter of reciprocal procedures.  If the Minister wants the House to approve of the Bill he must satisfy the House absolutely&mdash;and the citizens&mdash;on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated this point on many occasions both in the Seanad, where the Bill was initiated, and here.  We have had it at great length on the amendments tabled by the Opposition and it would be futile now to repeat all the arguments adduced and answered already.  Immunity from legal process is granted by our Bill and the British Act: there is already immunity, and that includes the matter of interrogation. If there is any breach of that immunity there is a remedy in the hands of the person whose immunity has been breached.</P>
      <P>For its working this Bill depends on co-operation and good faith on both sides.  Should this not be forthcoming there is the sanction behind this Bill that it will cease to be worked.  I have no doubt that that sanction will be effective and that immunities given in both measures will be honoured in the spirit and the letter.  On the question of returning an accused at the end of adjourned proceedings, either party can apply to the commission in the North.  The interpretation of both measures must be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the fears and apprehensions of the Opposition with regard to the safety of accused persons going North are not well founded because there is now a sanction in our hands to ensure those immunities <Col N="1586" /> will be respected through this reciprocal legislation.  That sanction will be effective.  We have debated this at considerable length and I have made that point already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says this area has been debated at length but I do not think every point has been brought out.  The Minister said that the Opposition were being reasonable in regard to other sections of the Bill, but this does not mean that we accept the Bill in principle.  We may accept sections 4 to 10 from the point of view of the law but this does not mean we have changed our position so that we would accept the implications of section 11 any more than that we have changed from our belief that this Bill is not the practical way to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>I mention this because the Minister referred to what Senator Lenihan said in the Seanad, that the Bill is beyond amendment.  What the Senator said is correct in relation to the principle of the Bill as distinct from the reasonable amendment we put forward in favour of a court covering both areas. The question Deputy Collins has been dealing with, and which I should like to go into a little further in relation to the immunities which the Minister guarantees, is that we do not see where the guarantee arises in the first instance.  The Minister said earlier that if section 11 (2) (d) does not protect a defendant or a witness who has had voluntarily to surrender to another jurisdiction, protect him from anything that could occur to him while in another custody, there are sanctions that can be invoked.  The difficulty the Minister has here is that that immunity would have to be breached before he could take any action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were discussing an amendment earlier, I understood the Minister to say that the sanction in the event of any breach would be that co-operation would cease.  The weakness I see in this is that in effect there must be a victim, a casualty, before the Minister could take any action. The Minister said earlier that if the other authorities were not fulfilling the letter of the law the Government <Col N="1587" /> here would suspend the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>How could this be done?  This is a Bill which when signed by the President has written into it the requirement that in the event of a prosecution being brought and a book of evidence being forwarded to the Attorney General, if it is approved by him and the Garda, it must go ahead.  I do not want to put the Minister into a difficult position but can the Government suddenly stop the operation of an Act of this kind?  Would I be more correct in suggesting that if the Minister were not satisfied it would then be necessary for him to come into this House and ask to have this Bill suspended, in the event of his advisors being satisfied that the letter of the law in relation to the immunity whilst in another custody was not being properly fulfilled? These questions are particularly relevant to section 11.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in the Bill which directs the mechanics for the working of it.  The Bill declares that certain acts done in Northern Ireland are offences against our law and they are liable to be prosecuted in the normal way.  Any offence against our law will be prosecuted through submissions filed by the gardaí, with the Director of Public Prosecutions, who will then decide.  If we have the unlikely situation presented by the Opposition that there had been an abuse of the immunities granted by the other jurisdiction, the law officer of the Government would advise the Government of what had been taking place and there would be a number of options open to us.  We could say: &ldquo;We are not going to prosecute for this offence because it is all part of a reciprocal arrangement which has been breached.  Have you a satisfactory explanation?&rdquo;, and go through the whole process as to what did happen.  If satisfied then that the position justified it we would refuse to proceed with the prosecution, and if necessary would come in here to repeal the act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is being realistic, because this is one of the most important sections in the Bill.  As with the other sections, we are treating it with our usual analysis and expedition, as has been our practice throughout the whole discourse. We have not attempted to obstruct the passage of the Bill itself, but the machinery of the Dáil provides that there be adequate and reasonable discussion on important sections of the Bill.  Our <i>bona fides</i> in relation to the general discussions on this Bill can be seen by the speedy manner in which sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 were dealt with.  These were clearly subject to the expressions made by various <Col N="1589" /> speakers on this side of the House in relation to sections 2 and 3 of the Bill. The sections I have just mentioned were given speedy passage.</P>
      <P>In addition to the reply to Deputies Collins and Brugha, the Minister might deal with the question of witnesses and what provisions are made in this section relative to the proper care and custody of witnesses who may be going to the North giving evidence in the cause of an accused.  I accept that the next section, 12, does deal to some extent with that problem, but not wholly.  It has been suggested that the witness might in some way be under suspicion and might have been involved in the alleged crime with the accused, and he is a pertinent witness to that accused's case.  What is his position when he goes north, for instance if he can give the accused an alibi in relation to the crime of which he is being accused?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a misunderstanding. The Deputy puts the witness going north to give evidence for the accused.  Is this an accused who had been arrested here for an extra-territorial offence here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in reply to one question, but what is the position in relation to the taking of evidence in Northern Ireland for a criminal trial in the State?  What is the position of an accused?  Does the accused not have to go north in that case?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a witness.  If a witness is in this jurisdiction he gives his evidence in this jurisdiction.  He does not have to go north.  The position <Col N="1590" /> is that witnesses who are resident in the North and are unwilling to come south to give evidence may give evidence on commission, as provided for in section 11, and the accused only goes north for the purpose of the taking of the evidence of those witnesses. In a case of a witness who is prepared to come south or who is living in the South the question of giving evidence in the North does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the operability of the section itself, I refer the Minister to the statement that the accused be delivered when and so often as may be necessary to the custody of the police in Northern Ireland. How long, how often, and is there to be a limitation as to the number of times on which the accused is to be carted back and forth across the Border?  How long does this exercise continue, and does the Minister think this is a particularly cumbersome form of transaction?</P>
      <P>Another matter which may arise is the question of natural justice, the entitlement of a person to be tried in his or her own courts.  Section 11 (2) (b) would appear to be abandoning that very important principle. There are provisions in the Bill for the attendance of a solicitor or barrister or legal representative of the accused in his absence, but I always feel that the accused person must look at the demeanour of his accusors. It is an important principle and we feel that in relation to the people applying the law in the North of Ireland&mdash;the RUC and the British army&mdash;it would be very important that an accused would be in the presence of his accusors.  When the Minister states that the operation of this section generally will depend on co-operation and good faith on both sides, we on this side of the House unreservedly support the element that it will certainly operate in good faith as far as this side of the Border is concerned but can we depend on the good faith of the people on the other side of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not operate there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the tragedy of the Minister's argument.  This is where we have been endeavouring to point out that the Bill cannot operate. We know the history of the Strasbourg case.  We read in our evening papers that the Minister has now this torture case before him and his Government, that the torture case is upheld by the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the charges laid against the United Kingdom Government were correct in every detail, according to the latest information in this evening's newspapers.  This shows up the nonsense of the Minister's argument. If good faith is found to be wanting on the other side, the Bill does not operate.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the legislative process should be used and abused in that fashion.  The Minister might reply to this.  If the torture case publicly becomes a reality, is upheld, and the charges in it have been well founded against the British Government, surely good faith cannot apply there, and we cannot hope for good faith in the future, if it has been found wanting in the present and in the past.  If there is one breach of good faith in the future when this Bill becomes an Act, is the Minister saying that he will come into this House and apologise for wasting the time of the House producing this Bill which the Leader of our party has said might be found to be unconstitutional?  If we are talking about good faith let us talk about the principles of natural justice, which will be found wanting anyway. The Minister says our fear's are not well founded.  Of course they are extremely well founded.  They are founded on the fears we have of the operability, of those people in the North whom we are suspicious of, reasonably suspicious and with well-founded suspicions.  The Minister asks us to take the operation of the Bill in the North in good faith.</P>

Has the Minister considered the situation where evidence is being taken on commission in the North of Ireland, and the accused has plenty of witnesses who for very good reasons do not want to go there because they could be involved in other crimes apart from the one with which the accused is charged, who are afraid to put a foot above the Border?  Why are they not entitled to go up and give an alibi to the accused, in his absence, or in his presence?  Why are they not allowed to go up and give evidence the same as witnesses in any other court in the world?

      <P>Deputy Brosnan has posed a situation of an accused person who cannot have his own witnesses coming in and giving evidence for him because they are afraid to give evidence in the North.  The accused person he is speaking about is being charged in our courts in the Republic with an extra-territorial offence.  It is in those courts that the witnesses for the accused will give evidence and that the witnesses for the prosecution will give evidence.  Therefore, there is no need whatever for any witness on behalf of the defence, to travel North to give evidence.  His evidence will be taken in the courts where the trial will take place, namely, the courts of this jurisdiction.  If witnesses from the North want to come South to give evidence, they may do so.  The only reason we are providing for the taking <Col N="1594" /> of evidence on commission in Northern Ireland is that some witnesses may be too apprehensive to come South to give evidence as regards the nature of the crime; but what Deputy Brosnan is afraid of just does not arise.  There is no question of witnesses not being able to go North to give evidence, because they will be available to give evidence here.  The court is being held in the South, and the question of going North does not arise.</P>

      <P>Again I am asking the Minister to consider the preliminary stages where evidence is being taken in the North on commission, and where <i>prima facie</i> evidence of identification, of the crime and so on is given by prosecution witnesses.  If the defence have witnesses they should be allowed to bring that evidence at that stage in the North.  What objections has the Minister to that?  They may be apprehensive about going north for various reasons.  They may be involved in other matters up there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the mechanics of this matter there are a number of questions I should like to ask the Minister for clarification.  Subsection (1) says:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the trial by a special court established under Article 38.3.1º of the Constitution of an offence under section 2 or 3 or of any appeal in relation to the trial, the court of trial shall, at the request of the prosecution or the accused unless it is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice to do so, and may of its own motion, and any appellate court may at such a request or of its own motion, by order provide for the issue of a letter of request to the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland for the taking, in the presence of the members of the court making the order, of evidence in Northern Ireland by a judge of the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland from a witness specified in the order.</P>
      <P>In the case of a defence request to the court, and perhaps also in the case of a person requesting another court, it is qualified by the words at the end of line 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> ...unless it is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice to do so...</P>
    <P>What circumstances is the Minister trying to cover there?  What eventuality does he foresee whereby it would not be in the interests of justice that the request of the defence and, presumably, of the prosecution be complied with?  What is the purpose of that qualification?  Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether he would prefer to answer each of my questions as I ask them or to answer all together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would let us have them all together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The second question arises generally from the provisions of this section.  Can the Minister tell us what machinery is to be made available to ensure that a witness, whether requested by letter or ordered by a court here to give evidence, gives that evidence to the proper body in the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated in subsection (1) of section 11 that the taking of evidence on commission will be in the presence of members of the court making the order.  That can be coupled with subsection (3) (a) where thereafter a statement of evidence will be regarded as admissible only if, according to my understanding, all the evidence has been taken in the presence of all the members of the court.  Is this a proper interpretation of the provision?  Must all members of the court which made the letter of request be present for the taking of all the evidence in order that such evidence may be admissible as evidence when it comes back to their court?  I should like to know, too, whether in this or any other section there is provision whereby a witness giving evidence on commission in the Six Counties, on foot of a letter of request from our court, will be immune from being taken into custody or proceeded against in any way by the authorities in the Six Counties for other offences unconnected with, or connected with, but particularly unconnected with, the case in question?  Deputy Brosnan may have had this in mind when he <Col N="1596" /> was speaking.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is such a safeguard and, if so, is he satisfied that it will be adhered to in a jurisdiction over which we have no control?</P>
    <P>The other question I put to the Minister relates to subsection (4) (a) where it is provided that an accused will be brought to a convenient point of departure from the State and there delivered into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  What is meant by a convenient point?  Is it the physical marking of the Border but, if not, what right will the police of the Six Counties have to cross the Border to receive the accused from the custody of the Garda Síochána or, alternatively, what right will the Garda Síochána have to cross the Border while still retaining the accused in custody before handing him over to the police of the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>Also, what is the purpose of providing in that same section for a person being taken into custody not more than 24 hours before the time of delivery to the other forces?  One might ask what is the purpose of this time limit in regard to somebody who is on bail and who, contrary to that bail, is being taken into custody.  Why not provide for an arrangement whereby the accused, in the most unlikely event of his wishing to go into the custody of the Six-County authorities, would not require to have his bail suspended to be taken into the custody of the Garda Síochána for an hour, never mind 24 hours?  For whose convenience and for what purpose is this 24-hour provision being made?  These are questions I should like the Minister to answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first question relates to the issuing of the letter of request&mdash;that a court must issue it unless it is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice to do so. This is to give the court power to refuse in any case where it considers that the application is, for example, frivolous or is purely a delaying tactic or that it is not a <i>bona fide</i> request to provide for the taking of evidence material to the case.  The court would have to have that reserve power.  It would be a matter for our judges to <Col N="1597" /> decide the merits of an application.  If they considered an application not to be frivolous or not to be merely a delaying tactic they would have to grant it but the provision is a safeguard so that the courts can ensure the power will not be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether this provision is intended to be solely and simply a safeguard against frivolous or delaying tactics? Surely the court at that stage is unlikely to be in possession of the facts that will enable it to reach such a decision.  We are talking here of the preliminary stages of a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the start of a case it would be most unlikely that the court would be in a position to make a decision as to whether an application was frivolous or was being used as a delaying tactic.  Consequently, the court would not be entitled to refuse the application, but I can envisage a situation in which a court which had been caught once would not be caught a second time.</P>
      <P>As a case went on and the court became seised of all the ramifications of it, the court might be able to identify an application made later in the case as one coming within the category of frivolity or delaying tactics.  We cannot anticipate here at what stage that would become apparent to the court. We must rely on the good sense of the court to recognise it when it happens. I have no doubt that should there be any doubt in the court's mind about it the benefit would be given to the person making the application and he would get his letter of request.  The section says &ldquo;unless the court is satisfied that it is not in the interests of justice to do so&rdquo;&mdash;and it would not satisfy itself for light reasons; there would have to be strong and compelling reasons before a court would refuse to grant the letter&mdash;the request would be granted.  I could not envisage that situation arising immediately. The court would have to have some evidence or information in order to make up its mind and become satisfied.</P>

      <P>If the Minister envisages the situation which that case <Col N="1598" /> covers or qualifies why not state that it would be for frivolous reasons or for the obvious reason of merely delaying tactics?  Why should those two not be put in rather than saying that the court is satisfied in a global sort of way that it would be in the interests or not in the interests of justice to do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>I think the better phrase is &ldquo;in the interests of justice&rdquo; because there might be a hypothetical situation based on some reason other than frivolity or a desire to delay.  I cannot think what it might be now, but some other situation could present itself which might not be covered by either of those two but which, in the interests of justice, the court would have to take into account.  I think the broad phrase &ldquo;in the interests of justice&rdquo; is best, bearing in mind that the court must do justice as between the State and the accused.  In the interests of justice in that context the court makes up its mind rather than on a direction from us here that only in two instances, frivolity or delay, could it make such a decision.  There may be other situations and we must leave it to the court to decide at the time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy next asked what power would there be to compel witnesses to attend in the North.  Courts in the North will have power to compel attendance of a witness living within their jurisdiction.  A <i>subpoena</i> will be issued which will compel attendance of the person to whom it is directed. Failure to comply with it would attract the penalty normally attracted by failing to meet a subpoena.  Likewise, if the letter of request is sent to this jurisdiction to hold the commission here the commissioners would issue a subpoena against the witness here.  The courts within the jurisdiction where the commission is taking place will have their ordinary, inherent powers and powers under the particular Act to compel the attendance of witnesses.  The power in Northern Ireland is contained in the British Bill, in Schedule IV, paragraph 2, subparagraph (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is feasible under the laws of the Six Counties to bring witnesses before the commission, what assurance has the Minister that in all cases without prejudice to any accused that power will be invoked by the authorities in the Six Counties particularly if it is a witness who is being called at the request of the defence in relation to a charge which the authorities in the Six Counties may have raised in the first place and on which we would have acted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing now with the situation where the commission is being held in Northern Ireland. There are two categories of witnesses to be called before that commission, witnesses for the prosecution or witnesses for the defence. Witnesses for the prosecution will invariably be people resident there who do not want to come south.  Presumably, if they are subpoenaed they will attend.  They may be members of the security forces or civilians but presumably they will be anxious to see justice done and if there is evidence to assist towards that they will be anxious to give it.  If they do not answer their subpoena they are subject to the sanctions of the law and to grave penalties.  If they persist in refusing to attend or remain mute of malice or persist in failing to give evidence then it is likely that the prosecution will fail if their evidence is critical, or the prosecution will be at risk.  There will be a certain gap in the prosecution case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, in the case of a witness for the defence.  I think it is unreal to expect, bearing in mind the circumstances in which a trial might be taking place, that such a person would not be prepared to come south.  I imagine such a witness would be prepared to come here, but in the unlikely event of a defence witness not wanting to come south that person would be liable to be summoned to give evidence before the commission or, again, he would be subject to the same penalties for failure to do so. It would be for the court here then to <Col N="1600" /> decide whether lack of his evidence prevented the court from coming to a decision on the merits of the case. The court would have to take into account how valuable that evidence would be.  Counsel for the defendant would indicate what the witness was going to say; this would be a normal procedure.  If the like were to happen in a domestic trial here in the ordinary way and a defendent said: &ldquo;I wanted John Brown to give evidence for me but he skipped to England.  The case cannot go on without him; his evidence is vital to me,&rdquo; it is then for the court to decide whether John Brown's evidence is, in fact, vital or whether it is a ploy by a defendant to try to make the absence of a witness a reason for his acquittal.  The same criterion would have to apply in this case, that if a witness for the defence failed to answer his <i>subpoena</i>, it would be a matter for the court to decide whether it was a ploy to keep him out of the way and not have his evidence and then say that his evidence was essential to disproving the prosecution's case or whether it was a scheme to confuse the issue.  All the law can do is provide for the subpoena process and for the witnesses to be prosecuted if they fail to give evidence. If prosecution witnesses fail to give evidence that would probably &mdash;almost certainly&mdash;be fatal to the prosecution case.  If defence witnesses fail to give evidence, it may or may not be vital depending on the view the court takes of its importance and all the circumstances in which the person is missing and refuses to attend.</P>
    <P>There is power to compel witnesses to attend to give evidence before the commission whether the commission is in the North or in the South.  There is power to subpoena them and punish them if they fail to answer the subpoena. If they still persist in their refusal the consequences I have indicated would follow in relation to that particular trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be two categories of defence witnesses: one would be the reluctant witness, antagonistic to the accused but who, if he <Col N="1601" /> were to come before the court, would blow apart the prosecution case made by his authorities in the first place. What assurance is there that such a person will be sought by the authorities in the Six Counties and brought before a court if necessary?  The second category is the willing witness for the defence who may not wish to show his face or be associated with the accused in giving evidence for his defence because of his fear that as a result he may find other charges laid against him?  In other words, he is not available to the authorities in the Six Counties who may be seeking him. That brings us to the immunity of witnesses.  Can a willing witness for the defence, without a subpoena from the authorities in the Six Counties, offer himself to the commission to give evidence?  What is the position of such a willing witness for the defence if he should fear that by coming before the commission he will be arrested, apprehended, or charged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the witness who is resident in Northern Ireland.  His evidence would come to be taken on commission only if he were unwilling to come to the South to give evidence.  If he is apprehended, for the reasons the Deputy has suggested, that by showing himself as a defence witness he is identifying himself with a certain cause or showing himself to have knowledge of a certain incident, I imagine that if he wanted to give his evidence he would be anxious to give it in the South.  His first option would be to give his evidence in the South because that is where the trial would be taking place.  There would be no question of his having to give his evidence on commission.  The evidence will normally be taken in the South unless a witness wants it otherwise.  It is inconceivable that that type of witness would want it otherwise than in the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is power given in the Bill to the court to prohibit publication of the names and addresses of witnesses. That power is there to ensure the protection of witnesses.  Therefore the type of willing witness the Deputy refers to has two safeguards. <Col N="1602" /> Firstly, he does not have to give his evidence in the North and consequently does not have to show himself in the North.  He gives his evidence in the South.  Secondly, he can ask for prohibition of publication of his name and address.</P>
    <P>The other type of witness the Deputy referred to is a witness resident in the North who would be reluctant to give evidence.  I presume what the Deputy has in mind is that he would be a witness of Loyalist loyalties who could exonerate a Republican defendant and that he is not anxious to come of his own volition to give evidence.  The Deputy is worried about how <i>bona fide</i> would be the efforts to get him and subpoena him. I am satisfied that they would have to be <i>bona fide</i> because his availability and whereabouts would be known to the defence.  They would be in a position to make this exact information available to the court. The commissioner would then be in a position to direct a subpoena very specifically and would be in a position to ask very direct and awkward questions if the subpoena was not served, why it was not and, if it was what efforts were made to enforce it.  I am satisfied there will be enough knowledge on the part of the defendent, who knew of the availability of this man and wanted him, to ensure that he would be available.  It would be an odd situation that the defendent or his counsel would summon a witness who was reluctant to come and about whose evidence they would not be exactly sure.  Assuming we had that situation and that for good reasons of their own they wanted him, they would be able to direct the attention of the summoning authority to his whereabouts, and if there was anything suspicious about his non-appearance they would be able to cause a fuss about it.</P>
    <P>This matter would be critical from the defence point of view and one which would be opened and pleaded before the trial judges.  They would be able to take that situation into account.  The question of immunity does not really arise.  If a witness is living in Northern Ireland and he <Col N="1603" /> chooses to give evidence before the commission in Northern Ireland he has opted to give evidence there and is obviously moving around freely and without constraint.  Therefore he is not worried about his immunity.</P>
    <P>The other situation is a witness living in the South who might be apprehensive about going to the North.  As I already explained to Deputy Brosnan, he does not have to go North because the trial is taking place here and hopefully it will be the exception where evidence is taken on commission.  Hopefully the main evidence will be taken before the court down here.  Therefore, if a witness is living down here and for his own reasons, good or bad, he cannot go North or does not want to go North, he does not have to do so.  He can give his evidence down here, so the question of immunity does not arise. It is his right as a citizen down here.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked if all members of the court have to be present.  They have.</P>

      <P>While the Minister has indicated various combinations of circumstances I do not think he has fully outlined all the various combinations of circumstances which may arise.  In regard to a willing defence witness the Minister says that, if he is resident in the Six Counties and does not wish for his own reasons to appear before the commission there, he has the alternative of coming South.  He may have the same reasons for not coming before the court in the South as he would have for being reluctant to go before the commission in the North. Where does the accused person stand in relation to this witness who is apprehensive of coming before our courts or the commission in the North where the same sort of reasons would apply on both sides of the Border?</P>

      <P>I am afraid that, if he is not willing to come to court to give evidence on behalf of the defendant, who presumably would be his friend, his acquaintance or associate, then the defendant will have to suffer on without his evidence.  The law cannot go any further than to provide the mechanism for the summoning of a witness and for his punishment if he disobeys that summons and, in that event, allowing the court to take into account his absence and the effect of the absence of his evidence on the case for the defence.  At that stage it would be a matter for the court to decide if he was <i>bona fide</i> absent and, as a result of his being <i>bona fide</i> absent, if the defendant was seriously prejudiced in his defence.  In that situation the court would probably acquit. On the other hand, the court would be at liberty to say that he is absent through malice, that his absence makes no difference and that they are not satisfied that any evidence he could give would be relevant to the case. The court would have to make an adjudication in his absence.  At the moment it happens in criminal trials that a witness for the defence cannot be found, refuses to turn up or absconds and the court has to deal with the case in his absence.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the decision of the Government to deprive a large section of the community of new house grants and demands their immediate restoration.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment asks the Dáil to take note of &ldquo;the Government's decision to provide from the Exchequer in 1976 a record amount of finance for housing.&rdquo;  The Minister must have been hard-pressed to put down such a meaningless amendment. One could say what is in this amendment about any year's expenditure compared with the previous year's. Such a statement might have some relevance in stable conditions, but it is meaningless in the highly inflationary conditions in which we live.</P>
      <P>The Government's capital budget was no consolation for the house building industry with its miserable increase of 4.3 per cent for housing at a time when the projected inflation rate was 16 per cent, and I would emphasise the word &ldquo;was&rdquo; because since then we have had the calamitous budget which will raise the inflation rate considerably higher.  There was a fair cutback in the money being made available in real terms.  The tragedy is that an industry which is capable of giving such a quick and worthwhile return in the employment field if it is properly financed and directed, is left floundering through lack of a sound policy.  This is nothing short of disgraceful when we have 117,000 people unemployed, and which shows the Minister's amendment to be the mockery it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972-73 we built approximately 22,000 houses with £46 million, while the Government last year built, if I may take the Minister's figures, about 25,000 houses for almost three times that amount of money.  This is a pointer to the complete incompetence of the Government in controlling inflation, and it also points to the nonsense of referring to amounts of expenditure without reference to inflation. <Col N="1606" /> I asked a question last week about the increase in the average gross price of new houses from June, 1973, to September, 1975, and the increase was given as 38.5 per cent. I wonder how this can relate to the fact that it has cost in money terms considerably more if we are to take the figures I have given for the cost of building the 22,000 houses as compared with the cost of building the 25,000 houses.</P>
    <P>The private sector of the house building industry has been in a state of crisis for the past two years.  This has been recognised by everybody, by public representatives at all levels and in all parties, by the Congress of Trade Unions, by the Federated Union of Employers, by those who are involved in building the houses and those who are involved in buying them, and by the media generally&mdash;in fact, by everybody in the country except the Minister for Local Government and the Government who keep trotting out statistics relating to house building time and time again as if these figures were a panacea for all ills.  No matter what cries for assistance arose from this hard-pressed industry, the Minister simply brushed them aside.  He repeated his now well-known, and, may I say, well-worn housing statistics, and he attributed all opposition to political opportunism.</P>
    <P>I shall deal later on with our proposals in this field.  I would point to the fact that the proposals we made for loans and grants and qualifying income limits were accepted <i>in toto</i> by many and varied groups throughout the country as being realistic and as being urgently necessary.  I think we can take some pride from the fact that motions which were passed by the General Council of County Councils and by municipal authorities were almost word for word with and in the exact same form as the motions we had put forward in our policy for the general election and the local elections.</P>
    <P>We have to consider a serious psychological situation.  I am convinced that the Minister has now reached the stage where he believes his own propaganda, where he believes that <Col N="1607" /> all is well with the house building industry, where he believes that there is no crisis despite all the evidence to the contrary.  If he does not believe it, I cannot understand how he has taken the decisions over the past six months which any person would hesitate to take even if the industry were enjoying prosperity.</P>
    <P>If he did not believe this propaganda, how could he over the past six months have removed the State grant from over 50 per cent of house buyers? How could he raise the interest rate on the SDA loans by 2 per cent to a now colossal 12½ per cent?  How could he remove the Government subsidy from the building societies, allowing them to raise their interest rate to 12½ per cent?  How could he refuse&mdash;seeing that the increase in the cost has gone up, as per the question I put down, by 38½ per cent&mdash;to increase the SDA loan and the qualifying income limits?  If he is so engulfed in his own propaganda as to believe that these hammer blows to the ailing private sector of the building industry will not severely damage that industry. then the prospects for this very great industry are very grim indeed.</P>
    <P>It is only when those who are in a position to help recognise that there are problems that there is any hope that anything of consequence will be done to help the industry.  So long as the Minister persists in holding the view that there is nothing wrong, so long will this industry continue to deteriorate. I would hope that he will change his mind in relation to it.  At this stage I think I could ask with some justification why the Minister and, to some extent, the Government, appear to be bent on wrecking the private sector of the house building industry. Can it have anything to do with the Minister's many charges that the criticisms of those who are involved in the industry are politically motivated?  If that is so, I can assure him that Governments in the past have always had similar feelings about any group that strongly pressed its case to the embarrassment of the Government concerned, and I have no doubt this will continue to be the position <Col N="1608" /> in the future.  However, Governments and Ministers in a democratic society must accept criticism and continue to act responsibly.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered whether the Minister felt that it was necessary to uphold socialist principles by stultifying the initiative of individuals who are willing and anxious to provide through their own efforts a home for their families.  Whatever the reason is, the damage which has been caused to the industry generally and the problems and difficulties besetting individuals and families because of the present non-policy are very real, and unless something is done quickly to counteract the present trend, then the future for this industry is very bleak.</P>
    <P>The policy of my party is to continue to develop the industry and to increase the number of local authority houses, to ensure that they are of a high standard, that they are sited in a suitable environment, and to give every possible assistance to those who desire to build or to buy their own houses.  In May, 1973, the level of the SDA loans obtained from local authorities to enable people to build or buy their own homes was increased to £4,500.  The qualifying income limit was fixed at £2,350, or £45 a week, for such loans.  At that time the average gross price of an SDA loan house was £5,700 and the average income of industrial workers, for example, qualified them for loans.  Quite clearly at that time, and previous to it, it was intended that people such as industrial workers would qualify for such loans. Indeed, many of them availed of the opportunity afforded to them.  They do not qualify now because of the qualifying income limit.</P>
    <P>Building and construction costs have escalated since that time.  The average price of a house built under the SDA loan scheme in September, 1975, the latest date for which I have statistics, was £7,900 and, again, as per the question I asked, that is an increase of 38.5 per cent.  To build or buy such a house prior to December, 1975, a person with an income of £2,350, or less, would qualify for an SDA loan of £4,500 which is the maximum loan. He would then need to procure £3,400 <Col N="1609" /> elsewhere.  When the Minister was questioned as to where he would find this extra money, he declared as a solution to the problem that the person concerned should save.  I would agree that thrift is a virtue.  I, too, would advocate that those intending to get married should save as much as they can towards the cost of purchasing a house.  Any reasonable person would agree that a young man or woman who could save £3,400 on a salary of less than £2,350, or £45 a week, in these days of constantly escalating prices, would merit the award of a very special medal.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the manner in which the Minister repaid those who took his advice and scrimped and saved on a meagre salary since this advice was given.  On 1st January, 1976, he removed from most of those people the State grant of £325 while, at the same time, his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, surreptitiously permitted increases ranging from 15 per cent to 25 per cent in the price of building material.  In that way the Government, with one stroke of the pen, wiped out a saving of £1,000 by adding £1,000 to the cost of the house to the people concerned who proposed to build or buy in the coming year.  In my view, this was not only a mean but a very cynical action. It did little to encourage the ordinary man in the street to have any faith in this Government.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that the applicant for an SDA loan has no alternative but to borrow most of the extra money from some other financial agency at a very much higher rate than he pays on the local authority market, bad and all as that is at present.  Out of his, in present day conditions, very meagre salary or wage, he must repay the principal and interest on both loans at the same time.  Thereby he is spending a very high proportion of his income on housing with a resultant financial squeeze on all other aspects of living.  As I said previously, this has caused very considerable stress and strain which arise from the financial problems which have resulted from this position.  In many instances, it has caused a nervous breakdown.  In many instances, the wife is forced to <Col N="1610" /> continue working in outside employment after marriage.  While I have no objections whatever to a wife working in outside employment after marriage if she so desires, it is quite a different matter altogether if she is forced to do so by a necessity of this kind.</P>
    <P>We should remember that the applicant who borrows £4,500, which is the maximum loan, will now pay £48 a month, as opposed to £45 a month at the end of December, 1975.  The latter figure is very much larger than that which was payable before the June budget of last year.  In other words, repayment on the SDA loan amounts to about 25 per cent of his income, which income must be less than £45 a week. Over and above this he must repay the principal and interest on the extra money, the extra £3,400 which it was necessary for him to borrow at a high interest rate.  Also involved in the purchase of a house are the cost of the furniture, the solicitor's fees, the surveyor's fees, and so on.</P>
    <P>To add further to the problem of the unfortunate applicant, the Minister has now removed the State grant from all those who do not qualify for the supplementary grant, who are the majority of house purchasers.  I want to stress this.  The income limit to qualify for a supplementary new house grant for a single person is £1,950, or £37 a week.  For a newly-married couple it is £2,050, or £39 a week. These are the figures with which we must concern ourselves and not the £2,350 per annum, small and all as that is, which was so well stressed by the Minister and his Department in the statements issued after the decision to withdraw the grants.</P>
    <P>The income limit of £2,350 applies only to a man with a wife and three children dependent on him.  The majority of those who are anxious to build or buy their own homes are either young men who propose to get married in the not-too-distant future, or young married couples.  These are the people who are being forced by the Minister to forego the State grant of £325, the grant which the Minister and his Department described as having only minimal effect on those intending to build or purchase their own homes.  If <Col N="1611" /> one were to relate the £325 to the total cost of the house, it might be said it constituted a relatively small portion of the cost.  If the person buying a new house had only to find £325 we might agree it was a relatively small sum.  Of course this is not the case at all.</P>
    <P>We must relate the £325 State grant to the £3,400 he needs over and above the SDA loan and the now new total of £3,725 required could hardly be described as minimal for anybody not to mention those who have less than £37 a week.  I should like to stress this again.  The figure of £3,725 is just about two years' gross salary for a single man who would be entitled to a State grant.  To find that kind of sum on that sort of income is impossible.</P>
    <P>The fact is that for over 50 per cent of applicants who normally qualify for the State new house grant, the price of the house will rise by £325.  They must find this money on top of the already high amount of extra money they need.  This means that a single man who is anxious to get married and to buy or build his own house, if his income is more than £1,950 a year, or £37 a week, must find another £325. It means that a married couple without a family whose income is over £39 a week must find an extra £325.  It means, in effect, that a very large number of those people will be forced to decide against providing their own houses and depend on the local authorities to do so.  I do not need to add that these days the local authorities have very limited resources.</P>
    <P>I noted with some interest the reaction of some Government Deputies in their efforts to support what I might term the insupportable decision of the Minister in relation to the grants.  They stated that the grants simply went into the builders' pockets. I wonder if these Deputies have ever heard of the certificate of reasonable value issued by the Minister's Department in relation to house prices?  Are they aware that, when reaching their conclusions on a fair price for a house, the Department take cognisance of the fact that the State grant is paid to the builder?  Are they aware that the <Col N="1612" /> Minister himself recognised this when he stated recently that he would react strongly to any attempt by builders to increase house prices by more&mdash;I emphasise more&mdash;than the £325 per house as a result of the removal of the State grant.  The case made by the Department simply will not wash.  The fact remains that prices are rising by £325, which the unfortunate purchaser with more than £37 or £39 a week must pay.</P>
    <P>Hard on the heels of this catastrophic decision by the Government and the Minister came another decision of a similar nature.  This time the interest rate on SDA loans was increased for the second time in a few months and the rate now stands at a staggering 12½ per cent. These loans, intended to encourage people to provide homes for themselves, are now like the carrot too far ahead to reach.  The various decisions taken by the Minister call into question the whole Government policy relating to private house building.  Is it proposed to undermine it completely?  Remember those paying this 12½ per cent interest are people with incomes of less than £45 a week.  This is often forgotten, and unless we relate the shockingly high interest rate of 12½ per cent to the income of the borrower the real significance of the problem is not realised.  Unless we relate the maximum SDA loan of £4,300 to the average price of a new house at £7,500 it is not possible to appreciate what the position is.  It is only when all these factors are taken together that the frightening situation can be sufficiently emphasised.</P>
    <P>To come back now to housing grants, on 1st January, 1976, which was a bank holiday, the announcement about the removal of the State grants was made.  On the same day the Minister for Industry and Commerce secretly sanctioned a very large increase in the price of building materials.  I say &ldquo;secretly&rdquo; because it did not appear in any of the papers for quite some time, in fact, not until my colleague, Deputy John O'Leary, raised it.  On 2nd January, 1976, the rise in the interest rate on <Col N="1613" /> SDA loans to 12½ per cent was announced.  This was in line with the familiar Coalition exercise of confusing the people and thereby avoiding debate.  I refer to this specifically because of the now long forgotten promises of &ldquo;open Government&rdquo; by the Coalition before they got into office.  The attempt to bemuse the people failed however and the country received the information with shocked surprise.</P>
    <P>The arbitrary manner in which the announcement was made and the complete lack of consultation has deprived a great many small builders and many private individuals of their rights and, as far as I am concerned, of their money.  The Department are well aware of the fact that in many instances, either because of lack of staff or ignorance of the rules and regulations, many small firms and individuals did not apply for grants until the new houses were well advanced.  In fact, because the builder or the person buying the house was aware that part of the grant would not be paid until a certain stage in building had been reached, he did not apply for the grant until the house had reached that particular stage.</P>

      <P>Although they were technically at fault this was not the first time this happened and previously the Department never failed to pay.  Many people throughout the country now find themselves in a shocking position, little short of taking the money out of their pockets, because the Department refuse to pay them.  Those concerned had decided, with encouragement from the Government, to build their own houses. They commenced building.  In many instances they had partially completed building on the distinct understanding from long experience that, so long as they complied with the regulations relating to planning permission, size, materials used and so on, they would get the State grant.  By a deliberate decision of the Government this is now being denied them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> This was an arbitrary decision and a decision wrong in principle.  The people are in justice entitled to the grants and they should be paid them.  I would remind the Minister that in the past when grants were increased the Department's line always was that, if the foundations were poured prior to the date on which the increase in grants was effective, the houses concerned were not regarded as entitled to the increased grant.  If this was the case when such a decision suited, then equally it should be the case now and, where the foundations were poured prior to 1st January, the grant should be paid.  It would be equally easy now to determine the date on which the foundations were poured as it was on previous occasions when it suited the Department to lay down that particular condition.  It is far from sufficient to say, as has been said, that those who have got certificates of reasonable value before 1st January are to be paid because it takes quite a considerable time in many instances to negotiate these certificates and many builders were in the process of negotiating them on 1st January last.</P>
    <P>Apart from the quandary in which future applicants will find themselves, the basic unfairness of the decision to withdraw State grants is all too apparent.  The vast majority of recipients were far from being rich people.  Rich people in the main built houses of a size outside the scope of the grants.  I was rather amused, indeed, to hear the Minister say on the radio that the grants were being reserved for those who were most in need, as if a married couple with a gross income of £40 a week are not in need of assistance to buy or build their own home costing an average of £8,000.  The fact is that the vast majority of those to whom grants no longer apply need them badly.  These grants were performing a worth-while public and social service in helping to provide houses. The cost of the grants for this social purpose was laid on the shoulders of all the people through taxation and it therefore fell relatively lightly on each individual.  The Minister's decision has determined that this burden must in future be borne by a small number of people individually and each must carry <Col N="1615" /> on his own shoulders the £325 originally given in grant.  So far as I can see, the individual is of little consequence where this Government are concerned. The reasons for my belief are not confined simply to the motion before the House because, as far as the Coalition are concerned, initiative is out.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the Government's decision will now be that many of those wanting to build their own homes will be unable to do so.  This will increase the already long waiting list for local authority houses.  Those who were hitherto enabled to provide homes from their own resources will be in competition for local authority houses and this new group will be added to the queue.  This will increase the demand for local authority houses and, I would emphasise, for the money to finance them.  It is difficult to see where the Government will, even in the short-term, save money by their decision with regard to housing grants unless it is their intention not to build any houses for those whom they are now depriving of the wherewithal to build houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>There will be little use in the Minister replying that more local authoity houses are now being built than previously, because the number being built is far from fulfilling present needs and still only amount to one-third of houses built each year.  Even if finance were available, which it is not, it is not possible to suddenly provide a large number of extra local authority houses.  Schemes would have to be prepared and various technicalities have to be gone through before they can even be started.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, many privately built houses on the market are awaiting purchasers.  Builders have land ready and waiting for the rapid erection of further houses should the Government show any real interest in the industry.  Far from showing any interest, the Government's attitude is the opposite.  Their actions are ensuring an acceleration of the slowing down process in the building industry. Local authorities might be permitted to buy houses which are at present <Col N="1616" /> available for sale but remain unsold in the private sector, but as local authorities have not sufficient money to finance their own projects, this proposal is hardly feasible.</P>
    <P>The Minister's only defence of his action is to repeat his housing statistics. There are large numbers of houses, unsold, which have been built by various builders, large and small, and many of them are lying idle.  Nevertheless, they are useful statistics.  If the sales position was bad in the past, what will it be like in the future?  The price of houses has been increasing rapidly and regularly.  Now we have taken away the £325 grant and the cost of building materials has increased, as was disclosed by Deputy J. O'Leary.  This is estimated to add another £700 to the cost of a house.</P>
    <P>The basic problem for the purchase of a new house in recent years was that it has become increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between the price of the house and the maximum loan available, especially on the very low qualifying income limit.  Many severe social problems are being caused by the fact that the repayments of loans eat up much of the family income.  Because of the increases occurring daily in the cost of living under the present Government, the people concerned are unable to stand the strain.</P>
    <P>There are over 22,000 building workers unemployed, approximately 25 per cent of our total work force. There are more than 8,000 building workers fewer employed in the private sector than there were 12 months ago. Those workers were providing for their families, making their contribution to the economy but now they are standing in queues outside the employment exchanges.  The only contribution the Government are making for their future is to ensure that any prospect they might have of re-employment is now shattered.  There was less cement sold on the home market last year than the previous year.  As I said on an earlier occasion, there is no better indicator of the health of the building industry than the sales of cement.  Recently a number of employees <Col N="1617" /> in Cement Limited were declared redundant.</P>
    <P>The removal of the grant, the increases in building costs, building materials, SDA loans and interest rates, all point to the fact that bad as the position in the building industry was last year, it will be worse in the coming year.  Because of the serious deterioration in the building industry, workers continue to lose their employment in ancillary industries and also the building retail business.</P>
    <P>The really sad and disheartening aspect of the Minister's decision on grants and his general housing policy, is not simply its impact on the individual or the family wishing to buy their homes, it is not simply the impact on the present unemployment situation, but rather on the fact that the building and construction industry is the one industry which is capable of rapid expansion and development. It is the one industry which can produce jobs quickly.  A new manufacturing industry is necessary and very useful, but its capacity to provide a large number of jobs quickly is limited.  The difference between the number of jobs created and those actually filled can be immense.  In circumstances where there are 117,000 people unemployed, one would have thought that the Government would have treated the building industry as a top priority.  Whatever reductions were effected elsewhere, extra money should be available here in real terms&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;in real terms&rdquo;&mdash;to provide employment.</P>
    <P>With reference to the highly inflationary situation, to speak of increased spending <i>in vacuo</i> has no meaning as any housewife can tell you.  What is very real is the fact that there are 8,000 workers fewer in employment this year than last year. Very real also is the fact that there are large numbers of workers in ancillary industries who have lost their employment.  Very real, too, is the capacity of this industry to develop and provide employment.</P>
    <P>The position is deteriorating rapidly and the Government appear to be looking at it in a hypnotised fashion, unable to do anything.  Saving £750,000 <Col N="1618" /> out of a total expenditure of £2,250 million to such disastrous effect is symptomatic of the puerile approach of the Government to our economic problems.  Instead of cutting back in real terms the Government should have made more money available for house purchasers.  The SDA loans and grants were the workingman's means of providing a home for himself and his family.  There is no point in his case referring to moneys which are available in building societies and banks for housing purchase because he cannot borrow from these agencies with an income as low as £37 per week.  The only alternative these people have now is to go on the local authority housing list and wait for we do not know how long before they get a house.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy, I want to emphasise, is to help the person who wishes to provide his own home to the fullest extent.  When we were in office we had a rapid and well directed development in housing construction. More houses were built each year. More people were put into employment. More people were working in the ancillary industries.  I want to repeat that when we return to office we propose to increase the loan levels to a realistic figure.  We propose to increase the qualifying income limit to a realistic level and to restore the new housing grants and increase them.</P>
    <P>The people are no longer satisfied with excuses or emphasis being laid on inflationary amount of money. What they want to know is what increases there are in real terms because there is a considerable decrease in the amount of money, in real terms, being made available this year.  Because we are very concerned about the unemployment situation, one of our first priorities when we are returned to office will be to revitalise this important industry, to allow it to create jobs quickly, thereby checking the unemployment figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O.J. Flanagan) Oliver J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O.J. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Local Government, I move the following amendment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the motion be amended by <Col N="1619" /> deleting all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and substituting the following : &ldquo;takes note of the Government's decision to provide from the Exchequer in 1976 a record amount of finance for housing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Was Deputy Faulkner serious when he made his contribution or was he displaying a lack of knowledge or a high degree of parliamentary ignorance in regard to the housing situation and the progress of the Government in this regard?  Was he serious when he said it was necessary to invest more money in housing when one considers that last week, and the previous week, Fianna Fáil speakers, one after another, told us that they did not want any more taxation.  They told us that taxation was too high, that the taxpayers were being bled to death and that it was unjust and unreal of the Government to impose any other form of taxation on the people.</P>
    <P>Can Deputy Faulkner, or any Member of Fianna Fáil, tell us where to obtain all this money, money which is so lavish when they are in Opposition but never available when in Office?  The Government have been criticised for not putting enough money into housing but during the last two years, when housing was falling off in every country in western Europe, it was increasing here.  Fianna Fáil should note that fact.  I will be disappointed if some Fianna Fáil speaker, before this debate concludes, does not tell us the method they would use to make this money available. When I hear a Deputy, who is so highly thought of, such as Deputy Faulkner speak of &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; I think seriously.  When he used that word Deputy Faulkner did not blush or smile.  He had the countenance of a very serious man but he seemed to have forgotten the injustices of Fianna Fáil when they deprived the <i>Farmers Journal</i> of all advertising and slashed all the food subsidies at a time when there was economic stability throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner either forgot those important details or he deliberately <Col N="1620" /> refrained from mentioning them because he did not want them put on the record of the House.  Deputy Faulkner did not mention that new house grants were shut off to all urban dwellers as a result of a decision of a Fianna Fáil Government from 1939 and were not reintroduced until the Housing Act of 1948 was passed.  Deputy Faulkner did not mention that injustice.  In spite of the fact that grants were not available to urban dwellers for new houses during those years the construction industry survived. There was more justification for the recent move by the Government to relate the payment of financial aid from public funds to the genuine needy than for the move made by a previous Government which resulted in grants being paid irrespective of means or income.</P>
    <P>There is justification for the Government's move particularly at a time when every Department is undergoing a financial examination to see what economies can be achieved in an effort to relieve the taxpayers.  On examination of the situation, can Deputy Faulkner justify the paying of a grant of £325 to a wealthy person for the erection of a superior type house? Can he justify the payment of such a grant to speculative contractors and builders, all of whom are not angels or saints?  Was it not correct to ensure that, at a time when financial examination was being carried out in every sector of the economy and moneys were going to speculators and into the pockets of wealthy people, the person in the lower income group was safeguarded. It was right that some steps should be taken to safeguard those in the lower income group, the ordinary workers who had enough courage, foresight and determination to build their own homes.  Was it not right in a time of financial crisis that sufficient money by way of grants should be available for those who needed it?</P>
    <P>That is what prompted the Government and the Minister for Local Government to see that justice was done to those most in need of financial assistance, those who are put to the pin of their collars to finance the building of their own homes.  Such people need not worry.  The vast <Col N="1621" /> majority who have obtained new grants or supplementary grants from the councils will qualify for new house grants from the State.</P>
    <P>Not only in relation to this motion but on previous occasions Deputies opposite have voiced criticism about the tremendous hardship imposed on young people who wish to buy their own homes.  It takes courage, dedication and willingness on the part of the young people to save sufficient money to buy their own houses.  We all appreciate the many sacrifices they make; they should be commended rather than criticised or discouraged. At a time when £1 million a day is spent on alcohol, tobacco, pop records and glossy magazines, it is heartening to see so many young people with sufficient moral fibre and affection for each other to make them willing to save towards a deposit on a house.  Couples who work and save together in this way in order to make a home will be the solid citizens of the future.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision in relation to grants must be considered against the background of the huge increase over the past three years in the public capital provided for housing and also the need, accepted by all sides, to control the growth of public spending.  Deputy Faulkner and others must be aware that in 1972-73 the public capital programme provided £46 million for housing&mdash;this year the total will be £122 million. Those are the facts.  But, despite that, Deputy Faulkner tells us the building industry is facing gloom, that the Government's record of housing is not good.</P>
    <P>The output of houses and the general record of the Government have not been equalled in this or in any other country.  If Deputy Faulkner goes to the trouble of reading the bulletin of housing statistics he will see that since Fianna Fáil were put out of office there has been a steady growth year after year in the number of houses provided by local authorities as well as in the number of houses erected privately.  A vast amount of money has been made available for house purchase, yet Deputy Faulkner <Col N="1622" /> and others have criticised the Government. They have done this at a time when there has been an increase in the public capital programme from £46 million to £122 million, or well over one-fifth of all capital expenditure by the Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil would like to utilise any statement they can get into print, mischievously or otherwise, for the purpose of deceiving the public.  To say there has not been a tremendous expansion in the number of houses and in the amount of money spent on house building is not only false but is a deliberate effort to mislead the public.  Those of us on this side of the House are dedicated towards housing the people and we have taken practical steps in this matter.  We have ensured that the necessary finances are available to those anxious to provide their own houses.</P>
    <P>That should answer the question why the adjustment and review of these grants has taken place.  I venture to say that Deputy Faulkner never knew that from 1939 until 1948 Fianna Fáil deliberately shut off all urban dwellers from new house grants.  Now that party have the nerve to tell us that they are critical of what has been done.  What was done was right and proper to ensure that the necessary money was and is available for those in need.</P>
    <P>Certificates of reasonable value under section 35 of the Housing Act, 1966, have been issued by the Department in recent months in respect of many houses costing between £15,500 and £19,900. Do Fianna Fáil Deputies honestly think that the purchasers of such houses would be deterred from buying them just because the Government did not feel it should defray £300 of the cost?  Alternatively, at a time when pressures on the taxpayer are severe, should he be expected to subsidise this type of affluent purchaser?</P>
    <P>These may appear to be extreme cases, but a quick reference to the Department's Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics will provide further relevant and interesting information. Building societies have been the major <Col N="1623" /> source of mortgage finance over the past year.  The average loan for a new house which the societies approved in the quarter to last September was £7,720, indicating a purchase price of about £10,500 and a borrower's income of some £4,700 a year.  The associated banks are committed to lending £40 million in housing loans in the two years ending 30th June, 1977 next.  The average new house loan which they approved in the quarter to 30th September, 1975, was £8,520, suggesting a purchase price of about £11,500 and an income for the borrower in the £5,000 a year bracket.</P>
    <P>In the light of these figures might I ask what relevance has a grant of £300 or £325?  The other side of the coin is the case of the person with an income of up to £2,350 a year, qualifying for a local authority loan and grant.  The average new house prices, gross, for which such loans were approved in the September, 1975, quarter was £7,907.  Combined grants from the Department and the local authority of £650 in such cases&mdash; indeed, up to £900 a house in special category cases&mdash;are both meaningful and wholly justified.  And that is why the Government have decided to continue paying grants to these classes.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to point out that the effect of the decision is nothing like as extreme as Deputies opposite have suggested.  In the nine-month financial year 1974, some 51 per cent of all persons who were paid new house grants by the Department also received supplementary grants from local authorities.  Last year, it is provisionally estimated, the proportion qualifying was 46 per cent.  On this basis it seems certain that a substantial proportion of all purchasers of grant-type new houses will continue to benefit from the combined grants.</P>
    <P>Another point which must be corrected is the suggestion that the withdrawal of the new house grant from persons ineligible for supplementary grants will oblige them to find an additional £325 by way of deposit.  A house-purchase loan generally covers 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the cost of a house, so that the additional <Col N="1624" /> deposit required where a grant is not payable will be about £65 to £80, the balance being funded in the purchase loan.</P>
    <P>The grant is only one of the financial aids from public funds to encourage individuals to build or buy their own houses.  The other direct subventions by way of rates remission and exemption from stamp duty will continue to apply to grant-type houses which are satisfactorily completed and, if speculatively built, are sold at a price certified to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>The combined value of these two concessions could amount to £1,200 in the case of a £10,000 house.  In addition, of course, income tax relief will be allowed in respect of the annual interest element in the repayment of mortgage loans.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to limit new house grants to persons genuinely in need of assistance is in line with their general policy to divert moneys provided for social and allied purposes to the maximum extent possible to the people who need it most.  This policy has been reflected also in the notable expansion of the public housing programme which, last year, gave us the greatest output of local authority housing in the history of the State.  Not only was the ultimate target of 8,000 new dwellings set by the National Coalition achieved, it was exceeded by at least 700 new completions.  This achievement set the seal on the commitment of the present Government to public housing.  It ill becomes the Opposition to be putting down critical motions about housing when they, as a Government, had such a deplorable record in housing, particularly in local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The Government committed themselves in this way to housing.  The target they set themselves three years ago has not alone been achieved but a substantial number of extra houses have been built.  The building industry is in a sound state and has nothing to fear.  It has a bright future under the present Government.  The criticism offered by Deputy Faulkner is designed for party political purposes. He could not make any case tonight. <Col N="1625" /> He had no facts and no figures and he knew that any he could quote would be against Fianna Fáil.  He knows that the targets embarked on by the Government three years ago when they took office have been achieved and surpassed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the savage attack made by the Minister for Local Government and the Coalition Government on a large section of prospective house buyers, we felt it incumbent upon us to come to their aid.  For that reason we placed this motion on the Order Paper.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the decision of the Government to deprive a large section of the community of new house grants and demands their immediate restoration.</P>
      <P>The Government, as is their usual manner when Private Members Motions are discussed, have come forward with an ostrich-like amendment which reads:</P>
      <P>...takes note of the Government's decision to provide from the Exchequer in 1976 a record amount of finance for housing.</P>
      <P>We heard the Parliamentary Secretary speak of the record amount of money, £122 million, but let us look at what that £122 million bought in comparison with the £46 million that Fianna Fáil spent.  In 1972, Fianna Fáil succeeded in building 22,000 houses for £46 million. The Coalition built 25,000 houses for £122 million.  They are welcome to that sort of twisted economics, which shows nothing but the galloping inflation rampant in this country today. To be involved in such figures of inflation is not a record to be proud of.  If the £122 million was being spent at the rate and was buying what was being bought by Fianna Fáil you would have some reason to be proud as a Government.  Instead of being proud, this Government should be ashamed to be associated with such galloping inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the history of the previous Coalition was one of attack and destruction of the building industry at <Col N="1626" /> that time, and here we are again in exactly the same situation.  They cannot say they were not warned.  Under various Private Members' Motions put down in this House we repeatedly called for an increase in the SDA loans, an income limit to the loan, and for at least a 50 per cent increase in the new house grants.  But what did we have?  We had the savage decision to cut grants.  Now we have the Parliamentary Secretary crying false tears because we on this side were suggesting that the new house grants were only going to people buying £19,000 and £20,000 houses.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary suggest that a married man buying a house, earning £41 or £42 per week, and now being deprived of the State grant, is a wealthy man?  Is that the Parliamentary Secretary's idea of a wealthy man, when these are the average earnings for those who are fortunate enough to have jobs at present&mdash;and there are very few people in that situation because of the increasing unemployment?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said there would be assistance for people in genuine need.  There was assistance in the £325 State grant, but where has that assistance gone?  It has gone in typical Coalition fashion, in destruction of all kinds and especially of those trying to improve their lot such as a young couple trying to buy a house.  People in need should have no worry, according to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He praised the courage, dedication and willingness of young couples to buy homes, but what assistance are they getting for their courage, dedication and willingness?  They are getting no assistance.  They are being harrassed by this Government in a way which has not happened prior to this except under the previous Coalition regime.</P>
    <P>Just in case the Parliamentary Secretary feels that this decision to cut grants is being attacked only by the Fianna Fáil Party, I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3rd January, 1976. The National Association of Building Co-operatives, in a statement, said it unreservedly condemned the decision of the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> This decision will directly affect housing co-operative members, because the amount of the State grant, (£325), has been used to directly reduce the total deposit paid by them for house purchase through a co-operative.  At a time when housing co-operatives are having considerable difficulty in keeping total deposit amounts down to a figure of £2,000 to be paid from the purchaser's own savings, this latest restriction must be regarded as an undeserved and severe setback to the people trying to help themselves.</P>
    <P>It further says:</P>
    <P>Therefore, the description of the grant as being of marginal assistance shows a surprising lack of sensitivity to the real needs of the house purchaser.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that that has more meaning to the people than the flimflam type of approach of the Parliamentary Secretary, who refers to £19,000 and £20,000 house purchasers. Surely the situation of a reputable organisation like the National Association of Building Co-Operatives who are trying to work for the benefit of young couples and people trying to buy houses in the middle income group, has more relevance than the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>A further quotation, from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1st-2nd January, 1976, reads:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the loss of the grant, as well as being a financial blow to the purchaser, will also be a big psychological setback.  Overall, it will make the struggle which one goes through to buy one's own home that bit more difficult.  While it may be a difficult time for the Government necessitating such drastic measures, it is also a difficult time for the purchaser.  The building industry has already carefully documented for the Government the problems they are facing.</P>
    <P>We have a Government that are completely immune to proper representation from any organisation.  They were elected on the basis of having <Col N="1628" /> clear discussions with all sections of the community prior to making major decisions, but look at this major decision to make a savage attack on prospective house purchasers.  Of course, if we wanted an example of how the people felt about the broken promise of negotiation with all sections, all we had to do was look out at Kildare Street today and see what the students thought about negotiation with this Government.</P>

      <P>If the Government insist on going ahead with this foolhardy decision introduced in such a small, mean and niggardly way, and announced on a bank holiday, surely if they are to keep any semblance of credibility the least they can do is to make the regulation from the date the foundations were poured into the ground and not the type of niggardly and mean approach they took on it to announce a date on a bank holiday hoping that nobody would notice it and notice the 20 per cent increase that was announced a day later on building material costs.  What are they saving?&mdash;£750,000 out of a total amount of £2,200 million being spent this year by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary feel that it is only Fianna Fáil and maybe some outsiders such as the National Association of Building Co-operatives who are attacking them&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary for the record is nodding his head to say that is all&mdash;I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Assistant Whip of the Government what he thinks of it.  Last night at a meeting of Dublin County Council the Assistant Whip of the Government, Deputy Desmond, speaking on a motion of mine condemning the Minister on this particular issue, said he thought it <Col N="1629" /> was an unfortunate decision to make just for a mere £750,000.  I do not think even the Parliamentary Secretary will say that Deputy Desmond would be included as one of the camp followers of Fianna Fáil or suggest that he was some speculative builder who has close associations with Fianna Fáil, which are the usual snide remarks from that side of the House.  Surely Deputy Desmond could be taken to be a supporter of the party or of the Government&mdash;well, sometimes he can, it depends on the issue, but on this particular occasion Deputy Desmond felt he must criticise and that it was an unfortunate decision to cut the grant.</P>
    <P>To speak about the State grant and supplementary grant in a vacuum is incorrect.  One must also look at the total picture, and that is the situation with regard to the SDA loans.  On 5th February, 1975, on a Private Members' Motion, column 1784 of volume 277 of the Official Report, when we on this side of the House were asking the Minister for Local Government the amount of the loan available and also to increase the income limit, one of the reasons the Minister gave for there being no need to increase the income limit and also the amount available is as follows:</P>
    <P>Regard must also be had to the continuing high demand for local authority loans.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>These figures certainly do not suggest any slackening off in demand for loans facilities from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>At that time we advised the Minister that there was a slackening off, that it would come unless he increased the loans.  The figures from Dublin County Council for loans at the last period in 1975 and for the first month of 1976 have shown a decrease month by month.  Every month there has been a decrease in the number of loan applications made.</P>

      <P>In January, 1975, there were 154 applications and in January, 1976, there were 97 applications. To take the Minister at his own words only last February, the decrease has now been proven and surely the time has come to increase the amount of the SDA loan.  The Government have admitted by their own figures that the average house price for SDA loans was £7,907. Now, unfortunate buyers have to struggle through with an SDA loan limit of £4,500.  To become eligible for the £4,500 loan it is necessary to be earning less than £2,350, which is about £46 per week.  How is it possible to save the balance between the SDA loan and the price of the house if a person is earning less than £45 per week, because the deposit is approximately £3,400?  How is it possible to find £3,400 when a person is earning less than £45 per week? They are the full facts, using the Government's own figures.  The Parliamentary Secretary said we were afraid to use statistics.  They are the statistics, they are the facts, and they cannot be denied.  Surely three things should happen in that situation.  One, the grant should not have been eliminated; two, the SDA limit should be increased from £4,500 to at least £6,000; and, three, the income limit for eligibility should be increased from £2,350 to £3,000.  At the same time, with these appalling figures, the Government had the audacity to take note of their decision to provide from the Exchequer in 1976 a record amount of finance for housing.  What is it achieving?</P>

      <P>One of the tragedies of the decision to eliminate the grant, the failure to increase the SDA loan, and the failure to increase the income limit is that it is going to increase dramatically the number of applications for local authority houses.  When you are at the stage where thousands of people are on housing lists, and cannot be housed, the last thing in the world we need is extra numbers put on an already overburdened housing list.  This is all the Minister's decision has succeeded in doing.  It is going to transfer to the housing list thousands of people who would have been prepared to buy their own homes.  They will now find themselves unable to do this because of the steep increases in prices, because of the lack of decision to increase the SDA loans and the income limit, and because of the decision to eliminate the State grant for all other than those who would be eligible for the State grant. Of course, the eligibility limit for the supplementary grant is appallingly low, despite the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary, who suggested that anyone earning slightly over £40 per week would be in a position to buy a £19,000 house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past few weeks a number of questions have appeared on the Order Paper seeking information from various Ministers regarding the importation and the acceptance of foreign goods and asking, too, whether the Ministers concerned had impressed on the Departments the <Col N="1632" /> necessity for purchasing Irish-manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>We have a very serious unemployment situation: there are almost 130,000 people out of work but there is a total lack of responsibility on the part of Ministers in so far as those unemployed are concerned.  When we have raised these questions the answers we have received have been misleading in many ways.  I have carried out some investigations in regard to purchases on behalf of Departments during the past couple of years and I have found that our present situation is being sabotaged by the various Departments including the Department of Defence. The Government, as a whole, must bear responsibility for this.</P>
      <P>On January 16th, 1975 we asked a question regarding the purchase of footwear for Naval Service personnel. We were told that a contract was placed with Irish manufacturers in May, 1974 on the basis of a tender submitted and on which it was stated that the footwear concerned would be manufactured in a factory in Ireland. We are all aware of the situation within the footwear industry, of the numbers who have lost their jobs and of all those others who are on short time.  However, to get back to the tender, it was found when the delivery was made that some of the items were foreign manufactured.  This was at a time when many of our State-aided industries were going out of business. The Minister went on to state that it was not understood how the contractor got the impression that it would be in order to supply foreign-made shoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brosnan raised this matter in the House and he expressed the hope that the Minister's reply would dispel any annoyance that was being caused by the supply to the Naval Service of footwear that carried the Saville Row status symbol.  It is said that an army marches on its stomach but we want to ensure that our Army march on Irish leather.  In reply to the Deputy the Minister said that on 24th April, 1974, the controller of stores invited tenders from 13 firms, all of which were Irish, for the supply of a 1,000 pairs of boots and 300 pairs of shoes for the Navy, that the tender <Col N="1633" /> accepted was endorsed to the effect that the articles would be manufactured by the firm who were tendering, that samples were asked for and received but that no indication was given that the items would be manufactured in England.  The Minister told us that when the delivery was received in October it was found that the shoes were marked &ldquo;British made&rdquo; but that the boots bore no marking to indicate where they were made although it was confirmed later that they were made in Dublin.  The Minister told us that the price difference in the tender accepted was greater than the margin of preference normally allowed under Government contract rules to Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get information from the Departments in relation to these matters.  On some occasions we are told that a tender is received from Irish manufacturers but it does not appear to matter where the goods are manufactured.  The Minister for Defence may not be responsible for this situation except in so far as the area of collective responsibility is concerned. One would imagine that the great socialist, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, would impress on the personnel in his Department the need to buy Irish-made goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week in reply to a question tabled by me asking the total number of boots purchased in each of the years 1973, 1974 and 1975 for the Defence Forces and the Naval Service, the contractor in each case and the country in which the boots were manufactured, the Minister told us that the numbers of pairs of boots were 33,000, 39,000 and 37,000 respectively and he concluded by saying that all the boots were made in Ireland with the exception of 400 pairs of special type sports boots which were not made here but which were ordered from an Irish supplier.  The Minister said that the country of origin of those boots could not be stated definitely. Perhaps they were made in Hong Kong, in Britain or elsewhere. <Col N="1634" /> Deputy MacSharry, too, has been endeavouring to extract information from the Departments in this regard.  He has been endeavouring to get across to the Ministers the fact that Irish-manufactured goods are as good as, if not better than those made in Hong Kong or elsewhere.  I wonder if the Minister will now inquire as to where those 400 pairs of boots were made.  Surely they could have been made by Irish manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I tabled a question regarding the purchase of low-loaders. On June 24th last I asked the Minister why he allowed the purchase of British-built low loaders when similar machines of Irish manufacture were available.  The Minister told me that the type of machine in question was not manufactured in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I believe we have technical personnel capable of designing low loaders suitable for the requirements of the Department of Defence, the Air Corps, the Naval Service or any other Department.  We have Irish technicians and Irish engineers capable of fulfilling these requirements and to say that at a particular time a particular type of low loader was not available is not good enough when we have 130,000 people swelling the labour exchange and dole queues.  It seems to me that the Government are bent on ensuring that they have the maximum number on the dole at all times because they are making no effort to ensure that goods of Irish manufacture are used by the Departments. Here I want to quote the Minister when he said that, of course, they&mdash;Irish firms&mdash;did tender but their type of low loader was a different and not suitable.  The technical personnel in the Department of Defence and elsewhere are quite capable of producing drawings and specifications that could be worked on by Irish technicians, as is being done in the case of the Timoney armoured car.  They are being very successful. This has been done before on many occasions.  I believe our workshops are capable of producing whatever is required by the Department of Defence or any other Department within a reasonable field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> A few days ago, on January 27th, Deputy MacSharry asked the Minister for Defence if, in view of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, he had advised all State-sponsored bodies under his Department to support the campaign and if he would indicate the amount of foreign purchases of manufactured goods, on contract or otherwise, by his Department and by State-sponsored bodies in the past 12 months, excluding goods which were not manufactured in Ireland. The Minister said he was not responsible for any State bodies and that the total amount purchased in the last 12 months was £4,270.  He broke that down to: BICC for £1,857; James Stoll, £1,150 and BICC, £1,261.  Two days later I got a letter from a person in my constituency referring to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on January 28th in which the Minister for Defence stated that his Department had only spent £4,300 on foreign imports in 1975, and wondering if the figure included £3,800&mdash;now the fat is in the fire&mdash;for 18 deep fat fryers which the company had tendered for. These fryers were of Irish manufacture but the order was given to a competitor who supplied Italian-manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>Here is a situation in which an Irish manufacturer tenders and the goods could have been made in Ireland but the Minister's Department accepted Italian-manufactured goods. I want to remind the Minister and the Government that there are still 130,000 people on the labour exchange and in the dole queues.  It is time the Government discontinued sabotaging the national effort because this is nothing short of industrial sabotage. the national effort because this is nothing short of industrial sabotage. I hope they have now come to their senses and that a deeper probe will be made in this and other Departments in relation to the purchase of goods. We shall do an in-depth study to find out exactly what has been happening because the replies to questions we put down were somewhat misleading.</P>
    <P>I have not confirmed this but I had a letter from a person in Athlone today saying the Army were using <Col N="1636" /> blankets manufactured elsewhere than in Ireland.  The Minister should examine that position.  In the short time available I have indicated some of the problems that concern Irish workers on the dole.  If the Department of Defence and other Departments continue on the lines they have been pursuing, the situation will become worse.  The other day we had a motion here condemning the building of £11 million worth of ships abroad. We heard about the Irish Life problem regarding the importation of foreign furniture.  Today we heard Deputy O'Malley indicating that a British firm had got a fabrication order in the region of £600,000 while our own people are capable of doing such work.  This is a sad situation.  I would expect the members of the Labour Party to have spoken out against this type of thing but their own Ministers are involved to a very large extent in relation to purchases for the Department of Defence and other Departments.  I have some sympathy with the Minister for Defence in that he is not entirely responsible and may not be fully aware of some of the things that are happening.  It is necessary to ensure that in future there will be no recurrence of what we have just heard about.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise many other matters but I shall not do so.  The Minister knows well the capacity of Irish technicians in the service and in the Army workshops.  He knows there is development work going on in connection with the Timoney armoured car and on robots.  Occasionally, he has expressed his pleasure at this type of development and the efficiency of the personnel.  Nevertheless, there are these defects and weaknesses and from this on I trust the Minister will take a more active interest and ensure that his colleagues in other Departments will make certain that where possible goods required will be purchased here at home.  It is a disgrace that with shoe factories going out of existence, we have people in the Naval Service wearing Saville Row shoes.  The people themselves who joined the service for patriotic purposes resent being forced to wear British-made equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> I could say much more about the purchase of equipment.  I understand that in the case of immediate need it may sometimes be necessary to get equipment quickly&mdash;when forces are being sent overseas for instance&mdash;but in this particular case there was ample time, the samples were there, the material was accepted when it should have been sent back.  Why did the Department not send it back?  This suggests grave irresponsibility on the part of those concerned.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to give a clear undertaking that he will do his part &mdash;that would satisfy me&mdash;in regard to the purchase of home-manufactured goods.  I do not hold him fully responsible but there are defects and I want him to ensure that where possible Irish-manufactured material will be purchased and that an opportunity will be given to our designers and craftsmen to meet our production needs in regard to items such as low loaders and other equipment which can be made in the excellent workshops we have here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I accepted my seal of office from the late President, Éamon de Valera, I held myself fully responsible for the activities of my Department.  Therefore, when I hear Deputy Dowling talk about sabotage by various Departments I take full responsibility for anything that happened.  That is the way a politician should act.  No more loyal group of servants can be found than the civil servants in the Department of Defence.  In fact, the sort of hullabaloo and fairy tales we have just heard are typical of the complete ineptitude of the Opposition.  I was almost tempted to quote Kipling when the Deputy started on the boots but I will spare him that.  The position is that the boots were not bought by my Department. As he knows very well, the purchasing department for the multifarious needs of the Government, apart from certain specialised items which are bought by the Department of Defence, is the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy quoted quite extensively from a reply by my colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on <Col N="1638" /> the 16th January, 1975 from the Official Report, Question No. 62.  I should like to quote a couple of the items he left out:</P>
    <P>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien: A contract for the footwear in question was placed by my Department in May, 1974, with an Irish manufacturer on the basis of a tender in which it was stated that the items would be made in his factory in Ireland...</P>
    <P>I further quote from the same day, col. 498, from a colleague of the Deputy opposite, who tabled the question:</P>
    <P>Mr. Brosnan: I thank the Minister for his explanation which I fully accept and I hope it dispels the annoyance of many people, including the recipients of this foreign manufactured footwear branded &ldquo;Saville Row&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>I now quote from col. 499 where the Minister said:</P>
    <P>...The sample boot received gave no indication of where it was made. I am not quite satisfied here in that I think it would have been well if inquiry had been made as to where it was made...</P>
    <P>In October it was found that the shoes were marked &ldquo;Saville Row, British made.&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>These are the shoes only.  There were only a few pair of shoes.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>The boots bore no mark indicating where they were made but it has been confirmed that they were made in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a few hundred pairs of shoes that were slid quietly past the recipients for which the Minister involved expressed the greatest regret.  It was fully accepted by the colleague of the Deputy opposite.  This disposes of the boots.</P>
    <P>In relation to the low loaders, I was questioned here on the 27th January in relation to the purchase by my Department during the previous 12 months of foreign made goods.  I would remind the House that the total figure which it is my duty to administer is <Col N="1639" /> £73 million and the figure of foreign purchases which might have been purchased at home was £4,270.  That puts the matter into perspective.  My nearest contact with the Army before I became a politician was a company officer in the voluntary aid section of the Red Cross during the Emergency. The Deputy opposite served in the ranks.  That taught me one thing.  I do not go to military men and tell them precisely what sort of goods they need, what sort of equipment they need.  The files in my Department tell me that the specific type of specialist low loader was necessary and was not available in Ireland.  That was the only reason why a few low loaders were bought.  They were not bought, as was suggested by the Deputy last week, in the previous 12 months but ordered in November, 1973 and delivered in June, 1974.  I will not go to the military men and say: &ldquo;You must not buy this.  You must buy that.&rdquo;  They have too serious a responsibility in that regard to be thrown aside at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that 18 deep fat fryers of Italian origin were purchased by my Department.  Those deep fat fryers were purchased from an Irish firm giving very considerable employment in the Deputy's constituency.  In a debate on the Irish Life furniture contract on the 3rd February at column 1064 of the Official Report the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Nolan said:</P>
    <P>...If they had given those contracts to Irish firms, even when they were 16 to 20 per cent over and above the amount of the contracts of firms in the UK and elsewhere, I do not think any Member of this House, or any person in this country would say anything except congratulate the Ministers, particularly because of the financial position of the country...</P>
    <P>I do not give names of firms across the House nor will I, but I say that 20 per cent could not have got the firm that complained to Deputy Dowling within an ass's roar of the price that was quoted by the firm that supplied and are employing many people in his constituency.</P>

On the 17th September next I hope to open a £1 million barracks in Monaghan. I have yet to find the barracks that Fianna Fáil built during their term of office.  That is my record as far as Irish manufacture and Irish employment are concerned.</P>

      <P>I admit completely, as any man who takes his place in this House should admit, that he is naturally a political animal who must be political across the House, fight his corner and go for what he believes in. Deputy Dowling has a responsibility, perhaps, nearly as serious as mine.  He has not been helpful in trying to portray the image of a good defence and a good security situation.  He is pernickity and snipes away at small things that people complain about because they think they have a grouse. He has a very thick political hide.  He is like a political rhinocerous that rolls around in smelly mud in the hope that some of it will stick to other people. It will not stick to me.  I am proud of our efforts in Defence.</P>

    <P>The estimates should be taken as indicating the approximate order of magnitude of the hypothetical savings involved.  Because of the complication introduced by a threshold the calculation <Col N="1513" /> of a more precise figure would involve a considerable degree of work on the part of Departments and other public sector bodies.</P>
    <P>The figures do not allow for the effects of a cut on overtime payments and allowances in the nature of pay nor for the effects on pensions and pension increases.  Neither do they allow for the effects on income tax receipts under PAYE.  If a similar cut were applied to other public servants whose pay does not fall on the Exchequer&mdash;for example, local authority employees, employees of various State-sponsored bodies&mdash;the Exchequer might also be expected to benefit indirectly to some extent.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the loss to the Exchequer from the introduction of a concession enabling all tourists travelling to this country with their cars from places other than Northern Ireland to purchase petrol of a value of £25 based on a price free of duty at the present level would be of the order of £3 million.  If this concession were extended to Northern Ireland tourists this figure could probably be doubled.  The foregoing estimates are based on the assumption that abuse of a duty-free scheme could be contained: such schemes, however, lend themselves to large scale abuse and <Col N="1514" /> the ultimate loss in revenue could be very substantial.</P>

      <P>Duty free facilities are already available on aircraft and ships travelling between this country and continental Europe: were the usual duties paid on beer, spirits and tobacco at present supplied from Irish stocks for sale duty free, the resulting revenue to the Exchequer could approach £1 million.  It is difficult to estimate the loss of duty to the Exchequer which could result from the introduction of duty free facilities for beer, spirits and tobacco on sea and air routes between this country and the UK, including access to duty free shops at airports, because of uncertainty as to the impact on sales which the removal of such duty might have but it is possible that the loss of duty could be of the order of £6 million.</P>

Currently adult immigrant workers are guaranteed a net monthly salary of 8,000 francs (£100.63) plus free board and lodging.  Working hours are not controlled and paid holidays range from 20 to 22 days per year depending on age.</P>

    <P>The main purpose of the Industrial Relations Bill, 1975, the text of which will be circulated shortly is to provide for the replacement of the Agricultural Wages Board by a joint labour committee for agricultural workers.

      <P>There is no provision in the free transport scheme under which transport can be made available in individual cases.  I am, however, having the case raised by the Deputy further examined to see whether the assistance made available up to now through the Southern Health Board can be continued.</P>

      <P>In the time available I have not been able to obtain detailed information but the information supplied to me on a provisional basis suggests that there has been no significant increase in crime in the particular areas in east Cork where stations have been closed.</P>
      <P>I am not considering at present any proposal to reopen Garda stations in east Cork Garda division but a review of police deployment is being carried out by management consultants who are engaged on an assignment in relation to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Since 15th March, 1974, the closing date for entry for the last Garda Síochána entrance competition which was held in May, 1974, about 1,840 applications for entry to the force have been received by the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Vacancies in the force are being filled by the appointment of candidates who were successful at the last entrance competition and, as far as can be foreseen at this stage, the recruitment needs of the force up to September next will be met from the results of that competition.</P>
      <P>The rate of intake of recruits depends on a number of factors and it is not possible to say precisely how many persons will be recruited between now and the end of the year. The estimate is that about 170 will be needed, of whom about 120 will be recruited on the results of the 1974 competition and a further 20 by special competitions for bandsmen and radio technicians.</P>
