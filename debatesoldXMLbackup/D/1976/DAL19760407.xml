      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to the taxation and other changes announced in the budget and it also provides for a number of other matters which I shall mention later.  Apart from changes in tax rates, the main thrust of the Bill is towards the equalisation of the tax burden.  This standing objective of Government policy is being further pursued by a variety of measures including some extension of the tax base, <Col N="1051" /> more uniformity in treatment of different categories of income tax payers and further anti-evasion provisions.</P>
    <P>I have often thought that the ministerial practice of devoting much of the Second Stage introductory speech to a seriatim explanation of each section is a rather pointless exercise when the purpose of each section is already clear enough from the previously published Bill and the accompanying explanatory memorandum.  I, therefore, propose to depart from this practice and trust Deputies will regard the departure as both a compliment to their intelligence and literacy and a worthwhile saving of parliamentary time.</P>
    <P>Much of the Finance Bill is necessarily concerned with amendments to existing law.  Compensation of what is involved in a particular section is often not apparent without a careful study of the original Act.  It has occurred to me that it would be helpful to legislators and the public alike if the index to the Bill and the marginal notes were to briefly explain the matter to which the original section being amended referred. I am, therefore, hoping to effect <Col N="1052" /> appropriate changes to this Bill at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Before I come to the Bill itself, there is one other matter to which I wish to refer&mdash;that is the disposition of people to the payment of taxes.  The great democratic delusion is that people are entitled to free services from the State.  A belief based upon an impossibility is obviously fallacious.  The services rendered by the State are not free.  They may not be charged for at the time and place at which they are rendered but they are paid for before or afterwards in taxes.</P>
    <P>The resistance&mdash;to whatever extent&mdash; of some people to taxation is no doubt attributable in part to the fact that some taxpayers feel that they are obliged to part with money in return for which they received no immediately apparent benefit.  The discussion of the annual budget in terms of millions has left little impact upon the individual and family consideration of each taxpayer. I would, therefore, like to illustrate the type of benefits which the typical family of parents and three children enjoy in return for payment of taxation in Ireland.</P>

    <P>Thus will be seen at a glance that an average family can receive back from the State about £1,600 annually, over £30 per week in benefits.  But that is not the end of the story.</P>
    <P>The State subsidy for each tenant of a local authority house is worth on average £200 a year; the income tax relief for housing loan interest is worth on average about £60 a year to the taxpayers concerned; an unemployed man with three children has total social welfare benefits at a level equivalent to some £1,850 a year; a widow contributory pensioner with three dependants gets £1,150 a year and a pensioner couple up to £1,150. In the case of university education, in addition to the special grants which average about £400 per eligible student, the State contributes an average of £840 for every student in the system.  There is also very heavy capital investment by the State in education, for example each additional place at primary level costs a sum of the order of £450 and at second level about £1,000.</P>
    <P>State aid to agriculture averages out at about £550 for every worker employed.  In industry, State aid for industrial job creation averages £3,500 per job and an average of almost £1,000 is contributed for <Col N="1053" /> every worker trained or retrained by AnCO.</P>
    <P>We risk damaging community contentment through a dichotomy of protest that taxes are too high and State benefits are too low.  When&mdash;as now &mdash;taxes and linked revenues cover only £66 of every £100 spent by the State and £34 of every £100 spent has to be borrowed, there is obviously no scope either for a reduction in taxes or for an increase in State expenditures. With those sobering thoughts in mind and subject to what I said earlier about not covering all the Bill in detail, I now turn to some specific provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill relates to income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax and capital gains tax.  Although sur-tax and corporation profits tax have effectively been repealed, it is still necessary to provide for them in the Bill as some of the measures in the Bill could affect amounts of taxes which are still unpaid.  Some of the provisions appearing in the Bill will of course need some amendment in order to take account of the recently enacted Corporation Tax Act, 1976. The Bill for that Act was still under parliamentary discussion when the Finance Bill was being drafted.  I propose to bring forward appropriate amendments to the Bill on this account on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide for the continuation for 1976-77 of the rates of income tax which applied in 1975-76 and for the increases in personal allowances which were announced in the budget.  A point I might perhaps mention is that the new married personal allowance of £1,010, when added to the working wife's allowance of £230, will give a total of twice the amount of the single personal allowance of £620.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains two further income tax provisions for married persons specifically and I feel that they will be welcomed.  Section 4 will dispense with the present requirement that a claim for the separate income tax assessment of a husband and wife must be renewed each year.  The purpose of section 11 is to enable a married woman to complete <Col N="1054" /> a separate return of her own income.</P>
    <P>The income tax free personal allowances improvements since 1974 are now costing the Exchequer some £80 million annually.  The advancement of the due dates for payment of Schedule D tax, as announced in the budget is provided for in section 6.  There are some points relating to this matter which are worthy of mention.  Tax liabilities under Schedule D are not being increased by the present measures.  These liabilities are continuing to be computed on the preceding year basis of assessment.  At present the tax liability on profits does not have to be paid until long after the profits have been earned.  The new provision modifies this unduly favourable position and the provisions of section 6 must therefore be viewed as an essential element in the Government's determination that those within the tax net must be treated as equally as possible.</P>
    <P>A measure which may be associated with the advancement of the due dates of Schedule D tax is the proposed change, outlined in section 29, in the provisions relating to payments on account in cases where tax is the subject of an appeal.  The section ensures that where a payment on account is made which turns out to be less than 80 per cent of the final liability, an interest charge will apply to the balance of tax unpaid.  Hitherto the payment of substantial amounts of Schedule D tax could be delayed for lengthy periods, and interest charges avoided, by the payment on account of sums which although corresponding with liabilities in previous years were in fact much less than the actual liability of the year of assessment.  Section 29 is accordingly designed to ensure that payments on account are made in realistic amounts.</P>
    <P>A further measure relating to the equalisation of tax burdens is contained in sections 15 and 16 of the Bill. Section 15 of the Bill will extend PAYE to employees and pensioners at present excluded from the scope of that scheme.  The decision to make this change was announced in June, 1975. <Col N="1055" /> Over 100,000 people, including Members of the Oireachtas, the Judiciary, civil servants, national teachers, the Garda, the Army, employees of the Central Bank, of the Commissioners for Irish Lights and of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and certain employees of the Bank of Ireland are affected by the change.</P>
    <P>In my budget statement on 28th January last I said (a) that the change would take effect from 6th April, 1976; (b) that I had had discussions with staff associations in the public service on means whereby the transition to the new system could be eased; and (c) that the estimated cost of the easement was being taken into account in the budget for 1976.  As recently announced, the easement decided upon by the Government, and which is provided for in section 16 of the Bill, will mean that one-half of the tax assessment for 1975-76&mdash;which is based on income in 1974-75&mdash;will be set, in three equal instalments, against PAYE tax due for the years 1976-77, 1977-78 and 1978-79.  Thus in each of those three years the relief will be equivalent to one-sixth of the tax assessment for 1975-76.</P>
    <P>In considering the easement I took account of the fact that employees in the private sector who were changed to PAYE in 1960 were given a remission of six months' tax.  That remission was given in its entirety before PAYE deductions commenced.  I also took into consideration the fact that the change to the new system will involve a considerable increase in tax liability for the groups affected and that this could cause hardship in cases where workers had entered into binding commitments.</P>
    <P>In order to correct any misapprehensions which may exist I should like to make quite clear the effects of the change to PAYE for the taxpayers concerned.  The change will mean that the tax liabilities of those affected will be considerably increased.  It is estimated that the gross PAYE liabilities of the groups in question will total some £76 million in 1976-77. This compares with an estimated amount of some £60 million which <Col N="1056" /> would have been their tax bill in 1976-77 if they had been allowed to remain on the old basis of assessment instead of being changed to PAYE. Thus it is obvious that the change to PAYE will result in a much heavier tax take from the public service in 1976-77 than would otherwise be the case, even when one deducts the value of the remission instalment of some £6 million being allowed in the year 1976-77.</P>
    <P>The fact that income of the year 1975-1976 will not be taken as a basis of tax assessment has misled some people into thinking that this will in some way confer an exceptional benefit on public service taxpayers.  In fact the contrary is the case.  As I have shown, the Exchequer stands to gain substantially from the public service taxpayers by reason of the substitution of 1976-77 incomes for 1975-76 incomes as the basis of assessment.</P>
    <P>Sections 30 and 31 are concerned with the tax deductions which may be claimed in respect of expensive motor cars used for business purposes. Deputies will recall that the Finance Act, 1973, provided that capital allowances for cars would be restricted to a maximum of £2,500.  Because of the increase in car prices since 1973, an increase in this limit to £3,500 is now appropriate.  In the 1973 legislation however no tax restriction was provided in respect of the running expenses claimed for business purposes. Accordingly, as announced in my budget statement, it has been decided to restrict the tax deduction in respect of the running of expensive business cars.  The limit for both the running expenses and the capital allowances restriction will, with effect from 29th January last, apply to cars costing more than £3,500, and sections 30 and 31 provide accordingly.</P>
    <P>Two sections in the Bill are concerned with the taxation of benefits-in-kind received by employees.  The principal legislation on this subject was introduced in 1958 but it has not applied to employees who are paid from outside this country and are thus outside the scope of the PAYE system. Section 22 is therefore designed to ensure <Col N="1057" /> that all employees are equally treated as regards benefits-in-kind. Such benefits may in some cases be very substantial in relation to the taxable salary.</P>
    <P>Section 23, the other benefits-in-kind section, provides for the introduction of a minimum charge where an employee has available to him for his private use a car provided by his employer.  Our approach to this matter is influenced by the fact that the overwhelming majority of motorists have to meet their total motoring costs out of after-tax incomes.  It must be borne in mind that where a taxpayer has available to him the private use of a car provided by his employer there is a very considerable benefit to him even though his private motoring might be relatively limited.  Apart from the capital cost of providing a car, there is a saving to him of the fixed motoring costs of depreciation, road tax and insurance.  It seems reasonable, therefore, to hold that the availability of a car for private use constitutes a benefit-in-kind&mdash;of a certain minimum value &mdash;irrespective of the extent of private use.  In present circumstances a minimum benefit, as provided in section 23, of £300 or 15 per cent of the cost of the car, if greater, can hardly be regarded as excessive.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the taxation of farming profits which is dealt with in sections 18 and 19.  In February, 1975, following an agreement between the Government and the Irish Farmers' Association, the whole question of farmer taxation was referred to the National Economic and Social Council for examination.  The report of the council was received by me on the evening before the January budget.  The report has since been under examination which is continuing.  In the meantime however it is necessary that certain measures in relation to the taxation of farming profits should be provided for in this Bill.  These concern the notional basis of assessment to tax and certain anti-avoidance measures.</P>
    <P>Section 18 extends for 1976-77 the option of the notional basis of assessment and also contains an anti-avoidance provision.  The purpose of the anti-avoidance provision is to eliminate <Col N="1058" /> a doubt which has arisen as to whether a farmer who opts for assessment under the notional basis can claim loss relief where the notional basis calculations produce a minus figure, that is, where the total of rates, wages and depreciation exceeds 40 times the rateable valuation.  It was never the intention that loss relief should be available in those circumstances.  Section 19 counters attempts to avoid tax by the fragmentation of farm holdings.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to mention other anti-evasion provisions of Part I of the Bill.  For too long the opinion has been held in some quarters that the evasion of tax is a tolerable activity which is to be practised if possible. The truth of course is that it is not merely anti-social but also illegal. In its consequences it is no different from many other illegal acts against the community which society rightly considers shameful.  The white-collar crime of tax fraud is no less shameful than simple theft and is not entitled to a more lenient attitude by society.</P>
    <P>At present the power of the Revenue Commissioners to demand the production of books and records is limited to cases where no tax returns or unsatisfactory returns have been made. This limitation clearly offers considerable scope to would-be evaders.  Section 33 closes the loophole by enabling Revenue officials to inspect business records for income tax purposes.  It should result in the more certain detection of cases of tax evasion and help to curb such evasion in future.  Section 3 is a consequential administrative measure.</P>
    <P>A particular field in which further anti-evasion measures are needed is the construction industry.  As I explained in my budget statement, the 1970 scheme of tax deductions from payment to certain sub-contractors has proved to be defective and open to abuse.  Section 21 accordingly provides for revised arrangements.  Tax will be deductible from payments made to a sub-contractor by principal contractors unless the sub-contractor has obtained a specific Revenue certificate of authorisation and the principal contractor has received specific authority <Col N="1059" /> to pay without deduction.  The issue of certificates will be subject to stringent conditions.  As these arrangements cannot be put into operation until next December, the Bill also provides&mdash;in section 20&mdash;for transitional arrangements, which were introduced by a financial resolution on budget day and will operate until 6th December next.</P>
    <P>Anti-evasion provisions are also contained in sections 1, 14 and 17.  The basic purpose of these sections is to ensure that PAYE tax, and tax which is deductible from payments to sub-contractors, are not retained by employers or principal contractors but reach the Exchequer without delay.</P>
    <P>Two sections in the Bill arise from matters announced in my financial statement of 26th June, 1975.  The first, section 25 provides for the exemption from tax of payments made to employers under the premium employment programme.  The other, section 27, provides that interest on housing loans made by banks under approved schemes at specially reduced rates will be subject to a reduced rate of tax so that the net return to the banks will be the same as if the bank had lent the funds at ordinary commercial rates.  As I said last year, the Government welcome the co-operation of the banks in this very important sector.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 26 provide for the continuance for one more year of the stock relief introduced last year and for its extension, with retrospective effect to 1974-75, to individuals.  It should be noted however that the relief for the third year is being expressed as a deferral in the first instance.  Stock relief is a matter to which I will give further consideration as the year progresses but at this stage I think it well to provide only for deferral of tax in respect of the third year of relief being afforded by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>A provision to reduce tax avoidance &mdash;as distinct from evasion&mdash;is contained in section 13.  The combined effect of the 20 per cent income tax surcharge to be imposed on retained income of certain discretionary trusts and of income tax at the standard <Col N="1060" /> rate will be total income tax of 55 per cent, as compared with the present maximum personal income tax rate of 77 per cent.  In the absence of this new provision, wealthy individuals could resort to discretionary trusts to an even greater extent than they do at present for the investment of their spare funds and the accumulation of earnings on that investment, because the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, contains provisions to counter tax-avoidance by such persons through another device, namely, closely controlled investment and service companies.  I am satisfied that the exclusions from the surcharge which are set out in section 13 are adequate to cater for discretionary trusts set up for worth-while purposes and in accord with public policy.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 32.  The Government adhere to the view expressed in my financial statement on 28th January last that it would be inequitable to continue the tax exemption hitherto enjoyed by agricultural and fishery co-operatives. The circumstances which gave rise to the exemption are not those that obtain now.  Inequity arises from the unfair competition of agricultural co-operatives against firms subject to normal taxation.  I cannot over-emphasise the necessity to broaden the tax base fairly so as to ensure general public acceptance of our taxation system.  The Government will not be deflected from pursuing this essential task.</P>
    <P>The Government are, of course, fully aware of the special problems of agricultural and fishery co-operatives and are therefore, studying the matter most carefully in the light of the submissions which were made by representatives of those co-operative and of the discussions which both the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and I have had with those representatives.  Following those meetings, I have carefully considered what would be an appropriate response to the particular problems posed.  The detailed package which will be necessary will require quite an amount of draft work in order to fit it into the new corporation tax code but I am hopeful that it will be available in a few weeks for all concerned.  At this <Col N="1061" /> stage, however, I consider that I should give Deputies the broad outline of the new tax provisions.  These will affect profits arising on or after 6th April, 1976 only, and not earlier ones.  This I hope will remove the major anxiety expressed to me about the effective date of operation of the new tax provisions and the need to retain funds to pay tax.  Co-operatives can make provision to meet the due tax which will fall for payment in 1977 and later.  Broadly, the corporation tax code with its allowances and reliefs which is applicable to companies will apply to co-operatives also.  As a transitional measure to take account of heavy capital investment in recent years, the co-operatives will be able to claim the balance of capital allowances over normal wear and tear allowances in the first year under corporation tax if they so wish. I feel that the provisions outlined will be welcomed by those concerned.</P>
    <P>One other section in Part I to which I would like to refer is section 24.  This section continues for the year to 5th April, 1976 the provisions whereby an Irish resident is chargeable to tax on the amount of any tax credit to which he is entitled under the 1973 double taxation agreement with the United Kingdom as extended in 1975 for one year.  As recently announced, active steps are being taken towards the conclusion of a new agreement.  Such agreement would, of course, come before the House in due course.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with customs and excise.  Sections 35 to 38 confirm the budget increases in excise duties on beer, spirits, tobacco and wine.  Much publicity has been given over the last week to representations made to me for a reduction in the increase in excise duty on beer which if given might be matched with reductions in the brewers' and traders' margins of profit.  In determining what increase in excise duty on beer to recommend to the Dáil, the Government carefully balanced both the necessity to increase revenue and the capacity of individual forms of consumer expenditures to bear additional taxation.  The tax increase on beer approved by the Dáil on 28th January last was between excise duty and VAT 6p per pint, I repeat 6p per <Col N="1062" /> pint and no more.  Subsequently with effect from 1st March the breweries, albeit with the approval of the National Prices Commission, and traders generally, without the approval of the National Prices Commission, increased the price of a pint of beer by a total of 4p per pint.</P>
    <P>The pattern of beer consumption following the budget, but prior to the trade increases in price, would indicate the correctness of the Government's tax calculations.  Relevant to any consideration as to whether the price of beer should be reduced is the purpose to which recent increases are applied.  Every penny of the 6p tax increase is returned to the public benefit, the other 4p increase goes to the private interests which imposed them.  Having considered with care every aspect of the situation the Government are satisfied that the correct course is to adhere to their original taxation measures which were designed to result in additional revenues of approximately £23 million in the current year for the public benefit.</P>
    <P>Section 39 increases the duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oil by 9.36p per gallon.  In addition, this section imposes an excise duty of 2p per gallon on all hydrocarbon oils, other than dutiable petrol and diesel. Section 40 imposes a new excise duty of 2p per gallon on gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form, and contains the legal and administrative framework for the implementation of the duty.  This section also provides for the imposition of the duty at a rate of 10p per gallon, at a date to be appointed by order under section 41. A rebate system will ensure that the 10p per gallon rate will apply only to gas intended to be used for automotive purposes and that other gas will continue to bear duty at 2p per gallon.  Section 41 provides that the duty rate of 10p per gallon imposed by section 40 shall apply to gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form intended to be used as motor vehicle fuel.  The resulting price to the user of liquid petroleum gas in a motor vehicle will therefore be comparable to the price of diesel.  The legislative and administrative framework necessary for the <Col N="1063" /> implementation of the duty are contained in this section.  The penalty provisions for contravention or noncompliance with the requirements of this section are set out in subsection (9).</P>
    <P>Section 42 empowers the Revenue Commissioners to amend or revoke any order made under section 139 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, under which they may require the entry of goods about to be exported. This provision is required to put beyond doubt the legal basis of the requirement that goods for export must be entered.  This facilitates the Revenue Commissioners in the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions on the exportation of certain goods and in the compilation of trade statistics&mdash;which are then furnished to the Central Statistics Office for inclusion in publications and periodical returns issued by that office.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides for an increase to £500 in the penalty for the irregular use of rebated hydrocarbon oil in road motor vehicles and confirms the powers of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to forfeiture, in certain circumstances, of a vehicle in respect of which an offence is committed. There has been a very significant increase in detections in the illegal use of rebated hydrocarbon oil in recent years.  The existing penalty of £100 was fixed as far back as 1940. Section 44 increases to £500 the indictable limit for customs proceedings in the District Court.  The present limit of £100 was fixed in 1963.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides for the customs entry of aircraft, ships and the like imported into the State and for payment of the appropriate duty.  A penalty of £500 and forfeiture of the vessel is provided for failure to comply with these requirements.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains a few stamp duty provisions.  Section 47 extends from two to six years the period during which a refund of stamp duty may be claimed.  Section 48 provides for the continuation of the exemption from duty of those types of new houses which would have qualified for <Col N="1064" /> a State grant prior to 1st January last &mdash;from which date eligibility for grants was restricted by reference to income criteria.  Section 48 also amends the Finance Act, 1969, by limiting the exemption allowable thereunder in respect of dispositions by local authorities under the Housing Act, 1966. There is obviously good reason why an exemption should apply to houses sold by local authorities to their tenants.  However as building land bought by private housing developers, other than from local authorities, is subject to stamp duty, there is no good reason why such land bought from a local authority should be exempt; accordingly exemption will not in future be allowable in respect of dispositions of building land by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I now come to Part IV of the Bill which deals with value-added tax.  The provisions in this Part of the Bill fall into three categories, firstly, the VAT changes announced in my Financial Statement on 28th January last; secondly, consequential matters arising from those changes; and finally some anti-avoidance and miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>First of all, I will deal with measures related to the January budget:</P>
    <P>Section 53 provides for the changes in the rates of VAT which were announced in the January budget and came into effect on 1st March.</P>
    <P>Apart from changes in rates, other matters covered by the budget and dealt with by section 60 of the Bill include the ending of the VAT exemption for short-term car hire and the application of the 20 per cent VAT rate to fur clothing which had previously been zero-rated.</P>
    <P>As regards both short-term car hire and fur clothing, the Government carefully considered the cases advanced by various interests affected to abandon or at least defer the implementation of the proposed change. They decided however that they would not be justified in according any special concession in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> Certain transitional arrangements in relation to cars and motor cycles are necessary on the changeover to the new two-tier rates of 25 per cent and 10 per cent which replaced the former rates of 30 per cent and 6.75 per cent.  These arrangements are provided for in section 63.  They will ensure that new cars and motor cycles which bore tax at manufacturer or import level before 1st March, 1976, at the old 36.75 per cent rate, will be liable only at the 6.75 per cent rate on any further sales of these vehicles by wholesalers or retailers up to and including 30th April, 1976.  Without this provision, such vehicles could, fortuitously, be liable for excessive VAT.</P>
    <P>In the remaining Fourth Schedule items such as radios, television sets, gramophone records and so on, are, since March, 1976, liable to VAT at 40 per cent comprising an effective 30 per cent at manufacturing level and 10 per cent at subsequent levels.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that during the past few years a considerable number of amendments have been made to the first four Schedules to the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, which set out the classification of goods and services for the different VAT rates.  Further changes are now needed in view of the January budget changes and of other provisions in this Bill.  So as to provide a clear, simple and unified reference course for all concerned, section 60 provides for re-enactment in consolidated form of the amended Schedules.</P>
    <P>I should also refer to the abolition, with effect from 1st March last, of the 1 per cent VAT credit allowed to VAT-registered customers of unregistered farmers and fishermen.  The abolition is being effected by means of the repeals outlined in Part II of the Fifth Schedule to this Bill.  The flat-rate credit of 1 per cent to farmers' customers was designed to secure that such traders would be willing to pay a slightly higher price to farmers and fishermen and thus compensate them for any input VAT borne by them on purchases of farm requisites.</P>
    <P>In view however of the considerable <Col N="1066" /> increases in income that have accrued to farmers since VAT was introduced in 1972, and having regard to the considerable income tax exemption enjoyed by the agricultural community generally&mdash;less than 1 per cent of agricultural incomes but about 18 per cent of non-agricultural incomes are taken in income tax&mdash; I feel that the abolition of the 1 per cent VAT credit is fair in all the circumstances.  In this connection I should like to mention that the extensive zero ratings of agricultural inputs have not been changed.  For example, fertilisers, animal feeding stuffs, seeds, animal oral medicines and other items are zero rated so that no input VAT arises for farmers on purchases of these items.  Furthermore direct refunds of the VAT incurred on certain grant-aided outlays on farm buildings, land drainage and land reclamation remain available to farmers.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Bill contains a number of measures to counter avoidance practices and to tighten up the VAT legislation generally. The twin objectives of these measures are the safeguarding of tax revenue and the prevention of trade distortions.  Sections 51, 52, 54 and 59 are anti-avoidance provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides for the redefinition of self-delivery which is contained in section 3 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.  The existing definition is somewhat vague and some doubt has arisen as to the scope of the term &ldquo;use&rdquo; contained therein.</P>
    <P>Section 54 limits to 10 per cent, which is the new second tier of the top VAT rates, the amount of VAT which may be deducted by VAT-registered traders where top rate goods are used other than as stock-in-trade. The primary aim here is to ensure that a person who, as a registered manufacturer or assembler of top rate goods, is normally entitled to full credit for VAT on purchases of such goods will not be able to avoid the first tier of VAT.  For example, a manufacturer of television sets will not now be able to avoid the manufacturing or import stage of the top rate by a practice of hiring rather than straightforward selling of the sets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> Since the ceiling on deductions of top rate goods is defined in part by reference to their use otherwise than as stock-in-trade, it is necessary to make it clear by means of section 59 that stock-in-trade does not include goods held for self-delivery.</P>
    <P>To counter a weakness in the law which has led to some distortion of trade, section 52 of this Bill provides for some changes.  At present it is possible to buy alcoholic drink which is in bond and thus avoid VAT on the excise duty which arises when that drink is eventually removed from bond.  Traders who do not have a warehouse must charge VAT on a price which includes the relevant excise duty.  While the practice does not appear to be widespread, it is only fair that competing traders should not be put at a VAT advantage or disadvantage and section 52 is so designed.</P>
    <P>The basic objective of sections 56 and 57 is to secure the prompt remission to the Exchequer of VAT due by traders.  The approach follows closely the approach adopted in relation to the paying over of PAYE income tax collected by employers.</P>
    <P>Section 58 of the Bill provides for control of the relief allowed to VAT-registered traders in respect of inputs used by them in both VAT taxable and VAT exempt activities.  The review period is being extended from one year to five years so as to ensure that a true apportionment will be made as between exempt and taxable activities.</P>
    <P>Section 62 will ensure that VAT due by traders to the State will have the same preference in bankruptcy, receivership and winding-up proceedings as that already attaching to income tax collected by employers under PAYE.</P>
    <P>I now turn to Part V of the Bill&mdash; sections 64 to 79&mdash;which deals with excise duties&mdash;road tax&mdash;on mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Government have been very concerned at the widespread evasion of road tax.  It is a hard fact that there were approximately 40,000 prosecutions for motor tax offences last year. <Col N="1068" /> Although it is impossible to be precise about the full cost of the evasion to the Exchequer, it has been estimated at some £4 million a year even before the introduction of the new tax rates. This is over 16 per cent of the road tax paid in 1975.  The majority of motorists are quite rightly aggrieved at this scandal and I have received many representations on their behalf. It is high time this injustice ceased. The Government have decided therefore that new and stronger anti-evasion measures should be introduced.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill to counter evasion of road tax do two things; on the one hand they make provision for the introduction of a system of continuous liability to road tax and, on the other hand, for the strengthening of existing provisions and the increase of penalties for offences related to vehicle registration and licensing.</P>
    <P>Continuous liability, as provided for in section 70, basically means that the owner of a vehicle will be liable for road tax, whether he uses the vehicle or not, in much the same way as a person is liable for a television licence. However, a motor dealer will not be subject to continuous liability in respect of vehicles which he keeps in the course of his business.  This new system is a vital part of the Government's anti-evasion policy.  Because of the need to revise administrative procedures at local level and to prepare regulations it will not be possible to introduce it immediately.  But the intention is to introduce it at the earliest practicable date.</P>
    <P>Section 60 provides that the classes of vehicles to which continuous liability will apply will be specified by Government order, to come into effect only after it has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Initially it will be applied only to certain classes of vehicles, particularly private cars.  A vehicle which is permanently incapable of being used, has been broken up or destroyed, has been exported permanently or has been stolen and not recovered will cease to be subject to continuous liability.</P>
    <P>In addition to continuous liability, this Part contains, as I have already <Col N="1069" /> mentioned, a number of provisions designed to strengthen existing anti-evasion measures and to increase penalties. These provisions can be introduced almost immediately and should ease the problem of evasion pending the introduction of continuous liability. In the longer term, a number of these provisions, while applying to all vehicles, will be of particular importance in the case of vehicles not subject to continuous liability.</P>
    <P>Section 65 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister for Local Government pursuant to this Part of the Bill.  Section 66 specifies the general application of this Part of the Bill to all vehicles liable to road tax subject to the exemption from certain provisions of vehicles used by motor dealers under the authority of a trade licence.</P>
    <P>A person who keeps a vehicle is required under section 67 to notify the local licensing authority of both the keeping of the vehicle and the transfer of his interest in the vehicle. This section confirms the existing legal requirements which have previously been provided for only in regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 68 provides that where road tax is not paid within 14 days of the expiry of the previous tax, it shall be recoverable by the local licensing authority as a simple contract debt.  This section will enable the authorities themselves from their own records to take proceedings in cases of unpaid tax.  However, this will not affect the existing powers of the Garda to prosecute those whom they find using untaxed vehicles.</P>
    <P>At present only the user of an untaxed vehicle can be prosecuted for unlicensed use of that vehicle. As a result the unsatisfactory situation at present exists that if an untaxed vehicle is parked in the public road the Garda can only prosecute for unlicensed use where they can identify the user, that is, they must wait for the user to return to the car so that he can be identified.  Section 71 removes this anomaly by providing that, henceforth the registered owner of the vehicle, if he has authorised its use, <Col N="1070" /> will&mdash;as well as the user&mdash;be liable for the use of an untaxed vehicle. An employee will not be liable if he is using the vehicle on the orders of his employer.</P>
    <P>Fines imposed for the use of an untaxed vehicle are often not a sufficient deterrent to repeated evasion by unscrupulous persons. Section 72 provides that the court shall, in addition to any penalty which it may impose, order the payment of the arrears of road tax due to the licensing authority.</P>
    <P>Section 73 provides that both the user and the keeper of a vehicle shall be subject to prosecution for the non-display of a current tax disc. Section 74 brings this offence within the scope of the &ldquo;fines on the spot&rdquo; procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 75 put the onus of proof on the defendant in any proceedings for an offence under this part to show the existence of a current road tax licence, that this vehicle was not subject to continuous liability or that he had not authorised the use of his vehicle, as the case may be.  This section will enable cases to be dealt with quickly by removing delays arising from the need for the licensing authority to provide documentary evidence which may not be readily accessible.</P>
    <P>Evasion of road tax is a sufficiently serious offence to warrant a hefty maximum fine.  Sections 76 and 77 provide for this&mdash;£100 in each case. Section 77 also provides for the settling by regulation of the fee payable for a duplicate registration book&mdash;up to now the maximum fee of 25p has remained as fixed in the 1920 Roads Act.  Under section 78, liability for road tax relates to use of the vehicle in a public place, whereas up to now it was confined to use on the public roads.</P>
    <P>Section 79 provides for the new annual rates of road tax for private cars which came into effect on 1st March, 1976.  It also specifies that the additional proceeds arising from these new rates will not be taken into account in determining the amount to be paid into the Road Fund in respect of road tax and related charges.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am not optimistic of his success, but there is no harm in hoping, and I certainly hope he will be successful.</P>
      <P>This Government have produced a number of Finance Bills which at best were irrelevant to our economic problems and in some cases were positively damaging to our economy, but I suggest that never have they produced a Finance Bill more irrelevant or more damaging than this Bill now before the House.  To consider this Bill in context one has to examine the major problems facing our economy and to consider whether the provisions of this Bill will help to solve those problems or make them worse. I do not think there will be any dispute about the fact that the major problems that our economy is facing today are inordinate inflation, massive unemployment, a huge national debt, and the impact of pay and incomes generally on all of these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Parts II, IV, V and to some extent in Part I of this Bill there are provisions having the effect of increasing the consumer price index by about five percentage points.  This is quite apart from such things as the earlier increase in the tax on petrol, the increase in fares, postage, phones, social welfare contributions and so on, in respect of which the Government have direct responsibility.  I do <Col N="1072" /> not think that even the most committed supporter of the Coalition and not even the Minister for Finance himself could contend that the provisions of this Bill are doing anything to solve our problem of inflation.</P>
    <P>The ridiculous nature of the approach of the Minister in imposing such huge tax increases to which we have adverted on a number of occasions is highlighted by the British budget announced yesterday.  It is interesting to contrast the approach of the British Chancellor with that of the Minister for Finance.  Each was in many ways facing the same kind of problem, and whatever one may think of the British Chancellor one cannot but accept the fact that he displayed a great deal more wisdom in his approach to the application of higher taxation than did the Minister for Finance, whose increases in taxation imposed on budget day and proposed to be made permanent in this Bill are such that without any doubt, in some areas at least, the effect will be to reduce the amount of the revenue to the Exchequer rather than to increase it.  I hope to come to that matter later; there is a glancing reference to this by the Minister in the long speech he gave us introducing the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The evidence shows that in regard to the first of the major problems facing the economy which I have mentioned, that is, inflation, the provisions of this Bill, far from doing anything to help, are deliberately not just hindering but deliberately fuelling inflation.  The result is that we have just recorded one of the highest quarterly increases in the cost of living in our history.  I am not certain of this, but I think there is only one quarter ever in our history in which we recorded an increase slightly higher than the one recently announced. The fact that this huge increase has occurred at a time when other countries are reducing their rate of inflation will, I hope, put an end to the claim which we have heard <i>ad nauseam</i> from the Coalition and their apologists about world conditions and not being able to do anything about them.  If neighbouring countries <Col N="1073" /> facing the same world conditions are able to reduce their rate of inflation at a time when ours records one of the highest increases in our history, there is something wrong here at home, and not even the Coalition can deny that.  I would suggest it is becoming clear to those who are not aware of the fact up to now that the major problem here at home has been the mismanagement of our economy over the last three years.</P>
    <P>There is an even more serious aspect of this matter than that mismanagement of our economy.  It now appears that members of the Government do not know what is happening and do not know the consequences of what they are doing.  I say that because less than a fortnight before this huge increase of 7.3 per cent in the consumer price index for one quarter was announced, the Taoiseach, speaking in New York, said:</P>
    <P>My Government has taken firm measures to curb the inflation generated within our own economy and the indications are that our measures will be successful.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to know what exactly he had in mind.  What were the firm measures the Government had taken?  What were the indications that these measures would be successful? He said that less than a fortnight before the announcement of almost the highest rate of increase in the consumer price index we have ever had.</P>
    <P>There have been similar statements from time to time by the Minister for Finance.  The implications of that are even more serious than the mismanagement of our economy.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance, and presumably any other member of the Government, is aware of what is happening, is aware of the consequences of this Bill, of the increase of five percentage points in the consumer price index, part of which only was recorded in the recent increase.  I say part of the increase because that 7.3 per cent increase in the last quarter was recorded on 17th February and some of the increases in VAT provided for in this Bill did not begin to operate until the 1st March.  Therefore, the full extent of the tax increases <Col N="1074" /> provided for on a permanent basis in this Bill has yet to be recorded in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>When we hear this kind of statement, the evidence is clear that members of the Government simply do not know the consequences of what they are doing.  I find it very difficult to understand how the Taoiseach could make such a statement or how the Minister for Finance could make similar statements when they suited the particular purpose they had in mind, if they were aware of the consequences of the measures introduced in the budget and those now proposed to be implemented in this Bill.  I, therefore, suggest that it is quite clear in regard to inflation, one of our major problems, that the Bill makes our position worse and does nothing to help us in what should be our battle against inflation. That battle is now becoming more acute with the success of a number of our neighbouring and competing countries and, in particular, with the indications of some degree of success attending the efforts of the British Government in their battle against inflation.</P>
    <P>While it is true that any improvement in the British economy should redound to some extent to our benefit, if they are succeeding even to a modest degree in combating inflation while we at the same time are recording almost our highest ever increase in the rate of inflation, then it bodes ill for the future of our manufacturing industry in particular and for the service industries which depend on manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The second of the major problems facing us, and against which this Bill must be measured, is unemployment. It is clear now that for quite some time the unemployment figures recorded have been hovering fairly steadily in the region of 117,000.  Of course, those recorded figures do not include most of the school leavers of last year or of this year, who will be very shortly coming on the market with no hope of a job.  If one were to include the unregistered school leavers of last year and this year, I estimate that they would number in the region of 90,000 or even more. When they are added to roughly <Col N="1075" /> 117,000, we see just how serious and dangerous a problem we are facing. We are entitled to look at this Bill very closely to see what it is doing, since it represents the implementation of a number of important aspects of the Government's budgetary strategy to tackle this unemployment problem. What we find when we examine this is that the effect of the increased taxes in this Bill will undoubtedly be, and has already been, to cause more unemployment.</P>
    <P>If one thinks of tourism as an example one can see that the effect of the increased taxes imposed under this Bill on petrol, beer, spirits, cigarettes, tobacco, car hire and so on, add up to making tourism here less competitive and causing further unemployment in that area.  The same kind of thing is happening, and will happen to an even greater extent in the future, in public houses, breweries, distilleries and in any manufacturing industry producing non-essential goods where the profitability situation has been fairly marginal.  In all those cases the effect of these increased taxes is undoubtedly the creation of further unemployment.  The same applies to various service industries which are dependent mainly on manufacturing industry and the kinds of producers I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Car assembly is an obvious area where there is already a considerable problem, which will get worse.  It is true that there was a rush to buy cars both before and subsequent to the budget before the 1st March, the date of the believed imposition of the additional VAT.  There is an area of doubt in that regard relating to motor cars.  In so far as this artificial rush to buy cars might have disguised the consequences of the taxes imposed, that effect is wearing off and it will be quite clear soon that the consequence of what is being done in this Bill is to make even more acute the problem of unemployment in the car assembly industry.  That is an area of major concern in regard to the problems facing this country.</P>
    <P>When we examine the problem of inflation, we find that this Bill is not <Col N="1076" /> alone not helping but is specifically making the problem worse.  One cannot say that this is an incidental spin off from those increased taxes that could not have been anticipated. On the contrary, the consequences are so directly arising from the increased taxes that one must accept that the Government were aware of them, anticipated them and were prepared to have them occur before they decided to impose those taxes. It is not credible to say that those taxes were imposed and the decision was made to impose them by the Government in the belief that they would not produce unemployment.</P>
    <P>The third of the major problems affecting our economy, and by which one can judge this Bill, is the whole question of the national debt. Although it is reasonably well known, it is worth repeating and it is a very sobering thought, that in three years the Government succeeded in bringing to approximately two-and-a-half times the total amount of the national debt incurred in the previous 50 years.  If you take the estimated revenue from all the taxes being imposed under this Bill and put them all together you find that, taken together, they will not be enough to pay the increased cost of servicing the additional borrowing of last year and a small proportion of this year's borrowing.  The cost of servicing the national debt arising in that regard is more than will be brought in by all the taxes imposed under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The extent of our borrowing has gone so far that the Government have had to borrow through the European Economic Community with all the other members of the Community guaranteeing repayment and conditions imposed which substantially reduce the Government's room to manoeuvre.  No matter how bad our economic situation has been at any time in the past, either during the war or back in the twenties, to the best of my knowledge no Irish Government in the past, not even a Coalition, had to accept such humiliating conditions as this Government have had to accept in order to make the huge borrowing they <Col N="1077" /> have made through the EEC with the guarantee of our fellow members of the EEC that we will repay it, that guarantee, of course, giving the right to impose those conditions and our situation having been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the Government had to accept the conditions.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that the conditions were in line with the policy we were following.  Many people would not accept that that was true.  Even if it were true it is one thing to decide on a policy which you are going to follow but it is quite another thing to have imposed on you as a condition of borrowing money that you will follow certain policies.  For our Government to decide freely that they will follow certain policies, well and good, but for them to be told that they must follow certain policies or do without the money they want and to find themselves saying: &ldquo;We need the money so we have to get it; we will accept these conditions&rdquo; is a different situation and there is no use trying to gloss over it.  It may be that the conditions imposed are in the best interests of the people but that is not the real point.</P>
    <P>The point is that our economy has been allowed to get into such a situation that we are subjected to this kind of humiliation which never was imposed and never could have been imposed at any stage in the past, no matter how bad our economic situation was.  I suggest that is a measure of what has been happening to this unfortunate country in the last three years.  As I said previously, the only equivalent to what has happened in commercial life is the putting in of a receiver.  Since the cost of servicing the national debt is growing faster than our revenue we are going backwards and our position is getting steadily worse.  If we are to reverse this situation we must get growth into our economy.  I suggest that the effect of the provisions of this Bill, in particular the taxation provisions, will be that it is very likely to be another year of zero growth or even negative growth as we had in 1975.</P>
    <P>The fourth major problem of our <Col N="1078" /> economy is the problem of pay and incomes.  The Government have not even a pretence of a policy on incomes. If they had they simply could not introduce yet another Finance Bill deliberately increasing the cost of living, in this case by five percentage points.  There is no conceivable way in which a Government, who either have a policy in regard to pay and incomes or who even seriously sought such a policy, could introduce a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is utterly unrealistic to demand a wage freeze in the case of lower paid workers when the increase in the consumer price index in 1976 is likely to be in the region of 20 per cent.  In particular, it is unrealistic of the Government to seek a pay freeze from lower paid workers when much of that likely increase in the consumer price index is a direct consequence of Government action, and much of it is a direct consequence of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt about the fact that repeatedly we on this side of the House have said here and outside the House&mdash;and I will say it again now &mdash;that pay restraint is essential if our economy is to have any hope of recovering. If ever a Government created a climate inimical to pay restraint this Government did so.  This Bill and other Government measures are clear evidence of the kind of climate the Government have created which is totally inimical to pay restraint. The Government have acted consistently as if budgetary and taxation measures have no bearing whatever on pay claims.</P>
    <P>One might reasonably have hoped that by now they would have learned this elementary lesson.  This Bill is a monument to the continuing ignorance of the Government on that fundamental issue.  It is not as if the Government were not told about it.  It is not as if the Government had no experience of what happens.  We have only to go back to the first budget of last year, the January budget of 1975, which was introduced in the knowledge that negotiations were about to take place on a national pay agreement. The Government brought in a <Col N="1079" /> budget which, at that time, had the effect of increasing the consumer price index by four percentage points. Of course, the inevitable happened. The national pay agreement was negotiated in the light of these likely increases in the consumer price index. Indeed, it contained provisions directly relating pay to the increases in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>There was no mystery about this. In fact, months before we had been telling the Government this would happen.  The only point I wish to make in this regard is that, at that time, quite apart from any other incident, the Government saw what happened and saw for themselves that the consequence of introducing a budget and a Finance Bill which increased the consumer price index in that way was that those increases were taken into account in negotiations on a national pay agreement.  One cannot accept as an explanation or excuse from the Government that, in introducing this Bill which will increase the consumer price index by five percentage points, the did not understand or believe it would affect pay claims.</P>
    <P>The strange thing is that the Government have been acting as if they believed that.  As a consequence of other factors already existing, plus the consequences of the taxation in this Bill, plus such things as changes in prices of agricultural products, and other increases in the pipeline like ESB charges, and so on, the likelihood is that there will be an increase in the consumer price index in 1976 in the region of 20 per cent.  Is it reasonable in those circumstances for the Government to be demanding a pay pause from lower paid workers?  Does it make any sense?  Can one look at this Bill and the proposed increases and say: &ldquo;Well, in relation to pay and incomes this Bill and its provisions take account of the reality of the situation and the necessity for restraint in pay claims and, indeed, according to the Government, the necessity for a pay freeze for nine months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I find it impossible to reconcile the provisions of this Bill with repeated statements by the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1080" /> the Taoiseach and other members of the Government that a pay freeze for at least nine months is essential to our future.  I think I am not wronging the Minister for Finance if I paraphrase a recent speech by him in this regard in which he said if we do not have this we will suffer national crucifixion. How does one reconcile that approach and this Bill with the deliberate increase in the price of almost every item one can think of?</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister for Finance would try to explain it by saying the Exchequer has to find revenue.  Yes, but is it realistic for the Government to demand restraint from everyone in sight and to exercise no restraint themselves? A situation in which revenue has soared to such an extent that one has to impose this kind of taxation and still end up with a huge current deficit&mdash;bigger than we have ever had before&mdash;is clear evidence of lack of restraint on the part of the Government. It is incredible.  It is inexplicable in rational terms that the Government should on the one hand demand a pay freeze and, on the other hand and at the same time, deliberately increase the cost of living in this way.  As I said earlier, we have recently recorded one of the highest increases ever in our history in the cost of living, most of it due to the deliberate action of the Government as enshrined in this Bill.  It is inexplicable in rational terms.</P>
    <P>I suppose that should not surprise us too much.  The Minister for Labour does not see anything inexplicable or irrational in telling us, as he did recently, that statutory control of pay is not on.  This comes from the Minister who piloted through this House and is now enforcing a statute which controls the incomes of those employed in the banks.  God knows our problems are great enough.  If we are saddled with a Government whose approach to these problems is totally irrational, there is very little hope of solving those problems.</P>
    <P>One gets a distinct impression that the Government believe talk is a substitute for policy.  For approximately 18 months we have had from the Government a White Paper and a stream of speeches, some exhortatory, <Col N="1081" /> some threatening, on the subject of pay and incomes.  Recently the speeches have become quite contradictory, the line being taken depending on which wing of the Coalition the speaker comes from.  The whole business has now degenerated into a continuous, ineffectual bleating utterly lacking in credibility.  What is being clearly revealed is the total inability of the Coalition to agree on, to implement and to stick to a policy on the question of pay, a question they acknowledge freely to be vital to any hope of economic recovery.  I suggest in this area of pay and incomes, as in the other two major areas I have mentioned, namely, unemployment and inflation, we are finding once more that the provisions of this Bill not alone do not help in regard to pay and incomes but are specifically geared to produce a result which has made the conclusion of a national pay agreement more difficult and may well have caused it to be impossible.</P>
    <P>I said earlier when the Minister was leaving that I hoped he would be successful and I repeat that hope now.  Fianna Fáil pioneered national pay agreements.  We know now important they are and we went through a great deal of political obloquy in order to bring about national pay agreements.  When in Government we were prepared to say what we believed was in the national interest and we acted accordingly.  As a result, we succeeded in producing a climate in which national pay agreements were negotiated and concluded. They have their drawbacks but we believe that on balance they are the best course in the national interest.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly pointed out to this Government that their actions, particularly in their Finance Bills, have been such as to render more difficult the conclusion of further national pay agreements.  In particular, we have told the Government in relation to this Finance Bill and its provisions, most of which were announced on budget day, that those provisions are making it virtually impossible for trade unions and employers <Col N="1082" /> to act in the national interest by concluding a national pay agreement which would, as the Government seek, constitute a pay freeze for nine months or at the very least would constitute stringent pay restraint.</P>
    <P>I find it impossible to understand or to explain the approach of the Government in regard to the imposition of taxation and the total disregard of its consequences on pay claims.  I cannot explain it and I cannot understand it.  Neither can the Minister for Finance explain it; I have asked him to do so on many occasions but no rational explanation has been forthcoming.  If we are to be subjected to this kind of government, at least I hope the public will be aware fully of the irrationality of the approach that is involved.  It is my impression that more and more members of the public are becoming so aware and the sooner the better so far as I am concerned.  Once people know what is happening, once they know of the total lack of policy, logic or rationality in the economic approach of this Government, we can rest assured the day is closer when they will give the answer that such a situation requires.  As soon as possible they will give themselves a Government who, whatever faults they might have, at least will try to tackle the problems facing the country in a rational, common-sense manner, as they demonstrated they could do in the past.</P>
    <P>Recently we have had some strange speeches from members of the Government, quite apart from those I have mentioned.  Some time ago we had one of the strangest speeches ever delivered by any member of an Irish Government, namely, the speech made by the Tánaiste in Wexford in which he called for an economic plan.  We are still trying to work out on whom he was calling for the plan; a strong suspicion has grown that he was calling on Fianna Fáil because he had not a hope of getting it from anyone else.  We do not know who it was because he did not tell us.</P>
    <P>Even more recently the Tánaiste spoke in Cork and said that the <Col N="1083" /> bubble had burst and that we could never return to the growth and rising living standards of the sixties.  That was the time when Fianna Fáil Governments were running the country but, of course, the Tánaiste was not going to leave it at that.  In order to make it clear that he was not giving us any credit for the growth and rising living standards of the sixties he said this was true all over Europe; the bubble had burst and never again could we go back to the days of the sixties when we had rising living standards.</P>
    <P>The main reason he gave for this was the increase in the cost of oil, with the implication of the transfer of wealth from Europe to the oil-producing countries.  In that context he also mentioned the disarray on the international monetary scene.  Allowing for all those factors, what the Tánaiste said was nonsense and if that is the kind of thinking there is in the Government it is no wonder we are in our present state.  In the course of discussion of the first budget introduced in this House after the oil crisis I pointed out that the estimated cost of the oil crisis at that time to the economy was between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of our GNP and that the consequence of that was if we achieved a growth of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, strictly speaking we would not have an increase in our standard of living.  We would simply be paying for the increased cost of oil.  Of course, that is not a permanent situation.  It does not mean that if we had a 3 per cent or a 4 per cent growth rate every year our standard of living would never improve.  However, that is the implication in what the Tánaiste has said, that we have no hope of achieving growth in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that.  Of course the oil crisis has set us back and we have to produce greater wealth to overcome the difficulty.  But we can do it; there is no good reason why we cannot. Other countries are doing it.  I do not say it is easy or that it can be achieved overnight, but it can be done <Col N="1084" /> and must be done if this country is to get anywhere.</P>
    <P>In the budget debate immediately after the energy crisis broke I urged that the Government's budgetary and general economic policies should be geared to the fact that this transfer of wealth was taking place.  They ignored the whole situation.  It seems that the main impact of the oil crisis on the Government has been to provide an excuse, a cover-up for their failures, their incompetence and lack of ability.  If we followed right policies here and if we gave determined encouragement to exports we could achieve growth and if we achieve growth we will achieve increased employment, increased revenue for the Exchequer and increased resources for investment in our future.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the attitude of the Tánaiste in this regard.  He is not alone in the Government in this approach.  One finds in this Bill a very good example of the kind of approach which ignores the necessity for making growth a priority in our economic plan.  There is provision in the Bill to impose tax on agricultural and fishing co-operatives.  The Minister dealt with this in his speech.  He has signalled that he is back-pedalling a bit but he has made loud noises about the importance of the principle of equity which he sees involved in this.  The Minister for Finance and some of his colleagues are great men on this topic, but he excels.  I wonder does he really understand and believe what he says. I suspect he does not because I have pointed out on a few occasions to him the total lack of logic in what he says. Yet, he persists in saying it.  In his speech he says that it would be inequitable to continue tax exemptions hitherto enjoyed by agricultural and fishing co-operatives and continues:</P>
    <P>The circumstances which gave rise to the exemptions are not those that obtain now.  Inequity arises from the unfair competition of agricultural co-operatives against firms subject to normal taxation.  I cannot overemphasise the necessity to broaden the tax base fairly so as to ensure general public acceptance of our taxation system.  The Government <Col N="1085" /> will not be deflected from pursuing this essential task.</P>
    <P>Previously the Minister used slightly different words to say the same thing. What he is saying is that he and the Government are determined to bring about a situation in which equal tax is paid on equal salaries.  That sounds like a fair, plausible proposition, but the Government do not mean a word of it.  I shall explain why I say that.</P>
    <P>When the Minister trotted out this alleged great principle originally, I pointed out that for many years we have operated a system in which a manufacturing firm exporting its product and making&mdash;for argument sake &mdash;£100,000 net profit in a year pays no tax on that net profit because it gets the benefit of export tax relief whereas another company could be making exactly the same product, not exporting it and making £100,000 net profit but will pay 50 per cent tax on that.  Similar incomes are not paying similar tax.  When I pointed this out to the Minister and said that the logic of what he was saying was that export tax relief was to be abolished he became very annoyed and said I was endangering the best interests of the country.  But he said the same thing in his budget statement.  Again, I pointed out the nonsense he was talking and the Taoiseach took occasion when speaking on the budget to make it clear that it was not proposed to abolish the export tax itself.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that, whatever the reason is for imposing tax on agricultural and fishery co-operatives under section 32 of this Bill, it is not equity.  If that were to be the reason the Government should be logical and ignore the economic consequences of exemptions given in regard to tax and stand on the equity principle, if that is what is meant.  If one examines the situation in regard to these co-operatives in the economic sense one finds that the national interest is best served by not imposing this tax on them.  I hope to develop that in more detail later.  To me, the problem is posed in this way: do you, because of a concern for equity and equal treatment as between taxpayers, impose this tax and ignore the economic consequences? <Col N="1086" /> Or, do you have regard to the economic consequences, recognise the importance to our prospects of growth and recovery in our economy, recognise in particular the importance to our exports, of cultivating and encouraging these co-operatives to expand, and ignore the equity principle?</P>
    <P>For me there is no doubt at all what is the right thing to do.  We should get our economy moving.  We should get growth into our economy and then start talking about equity.  I am getting tired of the Government, the Minister for Finance in particular, telling us the importance of equity in the taxation system, because as they apply this alleged equity the economy is getting smaller and smaller&mdash;it decreased by 3 per cent last year&mdash;and as the economy gets smaller the demands on it are getting bigger.</P>
    <P>Of course it would be possible to have equity if everybody was broke. We believe in the rising tide that lifts all the boats.  If one wants to achieve equity one must get growth in our economy.  It is sheer hypocrisy and self-delusion to be talking about achieving equity in the taxation system if the economy is shrinking. That is the thinking behind section 32 of the Bill.  I have no apology to make to any Member, or anybody outside this House, for saying that our first priority should be to get growth into our economy thereby creating jobs and revenue and ensuring that the Exchequer is able to pay its way.  We should get rid of the deficits we have at present and for which we have to borrow so much, and enable the Exchequer to do the kind of things we all want to see it doing in regard to health, education and social welfare.  To do that we must get growth in our economy and growth is not produced by an obsession with theoretical equity.  If pursuit of theoretical equity in taxation has the effect of reducing the size of our economy we are not helping anybody here.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the concern for growth which we on this side of the House have consistently urged, and practised when we were in office, only <Col N="1087" /> gets some lip service now and again from the Government: in practice it is not getting support from the Government side.  I am speaking not only of section 32 but of all the other activities of this Government which seem in this sphere to be motivated primarily by a tax gathering outlook and to be unconcerned in reality with economic management and, in particular, with economic management designed to achieve growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>This is borne out, apart from all the other elements available, when one looks at the disturbing fact that under this Government the proportion of Exchequer spending devoted to capital purposes has been going down while the proportion devoted to current has been going up.  For instance, last year's capital programme estimate of expenditure was £489.8 million and the actual amount spent was only £467.3 million, which I suggest is of some significance when one looks at the current side and finds that the estimate which was huge was far exceeded.  The result was that we had an enormous deficit and this year it is estimated that we will have a much bigger deficit on the current side.</P>
    <P>This is symptomatic of the thinking involved in section 32: forget the growth, appear to produce equity and to hell with the consequences if equity is produced.  The consequences of that mentality for us are becoming extremely serious.  When we have in the region 117,000 registered unemployed and in the region of 90,000 school leavers later this year unregistered, and when we have our inflation taking off again, it is time that the Government devoted some concern to achieving growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about equity when we are getting growth and can pay for equity.  The climate that is being produced by the Government, a climate in which it would appear that more and more people have decided that they are not prepared to invest their money or their effort because it is not worth their while, is one which is contributing <Col N="1088" /> to the shrinkage in our economy, to the 3 per cent drop last year in our GNP.  It is a climate which is directly encouraged and fostered by the kind of thinking involved in section 32.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister said he was not going to go through the various provisions of the Bill in detail, but, he seemed to do that almost as much as has ever been done.  I suspect that the purpose of what he was saying was to give him an excuse to come out with the figures he gave about the contribution of the State to the average family.  The figures are interesting. I have no doubt that some people will dispute them in due course; I have not had an opportunity to check the impact of them, but they are interesting. It is no harm that attention should be drawn to what is paid out by the State because there is an undue tendency to think in terms of revenue being devoted almost exclusively to paying the public service.</P>
    <P>However interesting and educational these figures may be the fact is that the overall cost of running the country, whether it consists of the kind of payments out the Minister mentioned or of the pay to the public service, or any other heading, the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and the Government is to ensure that the overall cost of all of these things does not go so high that we cannot pay. That is what has happened in the last three years.  The Minister for Finance and his colleagues have allowed the cost of all these things to escalate to such an extent that we have been running these huge deficits and borrowing abroad to pay, but we have come to the end of our tether.</P>
    <P>I know it is virtually impossible for a Minister for Finance to cut back on existing expenditure.  There are some exceptions, but by and large that is true.  We never expected the Minister to do that, but we expected that he would exercise the responsibility cast upon him in his position as Minister for Finance by controlling the overall increase in expenditure so that it stayed within the limits of what we could afford to pay.  Failure to do this by the Minister has resulted in something that is bringing us close to collapse in our economy.  Failure one <Col N="1089" /> year was bad enough; failure two years was much worse; but failure three years in succession is almost intolerable.</P>
    <P>It need not have happened.  It happened, I believe, not because of ignorance or inexperience.  That might explain the situation in the first year; but when it has happened three years in succession it can only be attributed to an effort on the part of the Government to buy political popularity and to gamble with the future of this country. That gamble has not come off. We are all paying the price.  Unfortunately, one sees a small proportion of the price we are being asked to pay in the various measures of taxation provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It has already been made quite clear that the level of increase in tax on such things as beer, spirits, petrol and motor cars is not only an enormous and shocking burden on the average person but is gravely depressing to the economy.  It is not only depressing demand but, in regard to pay claims, is having the effect of damaging our economy.  If one adds to these the VAT increases right across the board, one sees how misconceived and irresponsible has been the approach of the Government to the management of our economy as exemplified in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to go into detail on these matters.  Different aspects of these matters will be dealt with on Committee Stage by subsequent speakers.  There is one small point in regard to the imposition of increased taxes on car drivers to which I wish to advert.  We have had a succession of enormous increases in taxes on petrol and now we have an increase in car tax.  The excuse given by the Minister for Finance has been, apart from revenue, that he wanted to discourage the use of excessive amounts of petrol for which we are paying so much more as a nation.  A useful way of achieving a smaller consumption of petrol would be for the Minister to provide incentives to people to use smaller cars.  One could say that the increases imposed in this Bill are such as to render the use of large cars unattractive, but positive incentives could have been introduced which would have lent a good deal <Col N="1090" /> more credibility to the Minister's claim that he was concerned to reduce the amount spent by the country on petrol and oil.</P>
    <P>In section 26 there is a provision in regard to the valuation of stocks. I hope the Minister will advert to this in his reply.  He did refer to it in his introductory speech, but it would appear that there is a clawback provision in that section.  If that is so, I should like the Minister to explain why he is providing for it.  Is he merely keeping options open which would enable him to obtain a clawback? If that is what he has in mind, would he explain why he is doing so? It would appear that this provision is to some extent taking away the benefits that were being provided to companies who are very badly affected by inflation in recent years.  Some explanation is required for the approach involved in section 26.</P>
    <P>I want to register a complaint, Sir, in regard to the explanatory memorandum issued with this Bill.  I know that with almost any Bill it is difficult to get an explanatory memorandum which is sufficiently detailed to convey what is in the Bill and yet sufficiently simple to be of any advantage to people as against the terms of the Bill itself.  This is true of any Bill and is probably more true of a Finance Bill than any other.  But, allowing for all that, I do not think that the explanation of what is involved in Part V of the Bill is adequate.  I recognise the difficulties involved, but there is a very important change proposed to which I think more attention might have been given.  The Minister adverted to it today, but I doubt if many people are aware of what is involved in the proposals in sections 69 and 70.</P>
    <P>What is involved is that the Government would be able to make an order in respect of a particular class of vehicle.  The Minister has indicated that it would be proposed to make it in respect of private motor cars.  Once that order is made, a person will be liable for road tax whether or not he is using his car. In fact, the only exemptions provided for in this regard are garages who have cars in the course of business <Col N="1091" /> and two other categories, provided application is made.  One of them deals with the situation where a car is stolen and the other deals with a car that has been broken up completely, or is shown to be incapable of being used.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, that is the situation. I wonder if the implications of this have been thought out by the Minister.  I can see very clearly the implication for the purposes of administration. It makes life a lot easier from the point of view of the administrator if this is done.  Effectively what it is doing is saying: &ldquo;As long as there is a car registered in your name and tax is not paid, you are presumed guilty until you are proved innocent&rdquo;.  Since one of the things for which a person could be exempt is if the car was stolen or was rendered immovable for some reason or another, he has to apply for exemption and there will be many people unaware of this situation and they will be caught for tax in respect of a car which was in their eyes laid up.</P>
    <P>The situation, I suggest, is even worse than that.  There are many people who cannot afford to tax a car for the whole year every year but who do not want to part with them because things may improve in the future, or it might cost them money effectively to dispose of their cars at the moment.  There are people who because of age or health do not use their cars in the winter months.  There are various reasons why people would decide deliberately and voluntarily not to use their cars at certain times.  Under present arrangements, provided they make that decision and take the cars off the road, they are not liable for tax.</P>
    <P>But under this Bill they will be liable and in cases of people who simply cannot afford to run their cars for six months in a year and who at present would lay up their cars, perhaps on blocks in the garage, it will not be sufficient to apply for exemption&mdash;they have got to go on paying the road tax whether they are using the cars or not.  It would seem to me that in order to come within the exemption <Col N="1092" /> proposal a person would have to remove some essential part of the car and perhaps he might have to dump it with the Garda or the local registration authorities, a very unwelcome move, in order to prove that the car was unusable and came within the section.  If the Minister does not envisage this happening, he is saying: &ldquo;I do not care whether you can afford the car or not.  So long as you are keeping a car you will have to pay the road tax&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right that this kind of thing should be introduced. It will, of course, not have any effect on people who have some money, people who are reasonably well off. The people who will be affected by it are those who are marginally able to run cars, and I mentioned in particular older people who do not run their cars in the winter months.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that, even if there were enormous administrative advantages involved in this, it would justify the introduction of this approach.  I do not believe that the administrative advantages in this respect would be at all commensurate with the hardship and inconvenience which sections 69 and 70 will produce in combination. I very strongly urge the Minister to rethink these provisions, which are unfair and unjust and which I do not believe are necessary for the purpose of the more effective administration of road tax.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that I support in general efforts to make road tax more effective and I think the Minister was right in implying in his introductory remarks that it is unfair to those who pay road tax that so many people should avoid payment.  However there are steps which can be taken to improve the collection of road tax and this proposal will not alone go too far but is quite unjust and uncalled for and should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposal for the taxation of co-operatives, at a time when the economy is under extreme pressure, and the co-operatives&mdash;the major producers and exporters&mdash;are vital to bring about an early recovery, it is extraordinary and particularly insensitive that the Government should <Col N="1093" /> be devoting the time and energy of the Department of Finance to measures designed to tax the country's co-operative societies.  It has been decided to terminate the exemption enjoyed by agricultural and fishery co-ops with effect from 6th April, 1976.  I understand that, while the termination will not be reflected in the tax receipts in 1976, the revenue gain is expected to be as much as £3 million a year thereafter.</P>
    <P>I suggest that these proposals are hurried and that what the Minister said today in regard to the back pedalling he is doing in connection with them, that he is unable to reduce the tax, is further evidence of the hurried nature of this proposal which has already, I suggest, caused consternation and resentment among the country's 165,000 co-operative members. I suggest it is unlikely that the yield to the revenue will be anything like £3 million in a year.  It is much more likely that the removal of the tax exemption from co-ops will result in an increase in consumer prices for a wide range of produce including fish, meat, vegetables and dairy produce. It will also lead to an immediate increase in redundancies in the co-op organisations and a rise in the overall indebtedness and a fall in investment in the co-operatives whose proportion of reserves will be further reduced. All this is supposed to take place because the continuance of the exemption is difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the Minister found it difficult to justify this very longstanding incentive he would have been far wiser, in the interest of the whole economy of the country, to have undertaken a comprehensive review of the co-operative societies and of their role in our economy as a basis on which to plan for taxation.</P>
    <P>I have tried already to point out that the doctrinaire approach of the Minister to taxation shows little evidence of any concern for the immediate task of creating employment and stimulating exports.  This seems to be another example of the kind of Coalition taxation witchhunt to which we have been subjected from time to time.  It is occurring at a time when <Col N="1094" /> the resources of the Government should be directed to the promotion of economic growth and increasing the real incomes of our people.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to recall that these various co-operative societies were established to fulfil a vital social and community task: co-ordinating the marketing of farm and fishery produce, arranging group purchasing and promoting the production standards and general welfare of the farming community.</P>
    <P>The non-commercial profit nature of co-operatives is reflected in the special circumstances which surround their activities.  The co-ops are not places for the large-scale investor, the speculator or the profit-orientated <i>entrepreneur</i>.  The co-ops operate on extremely low margins and the maximum dividend payable is 10 per cent. The net profit of the co-ops, as a percentage of sales, is only 2.1 per cent nationally compared with an average of nearly 7 per cent earned by public companies.  They depend to a large extent on the retention of surpluses as a means of building up their reserves.  The taxation of these surpluses will result in depletion of this source of funding for what is, as I have already said, a low proportion of reserves.</P>
    <P>Almost of their nature Irish co-ops are under-capitalised.  Of their total resources share capital accounts for a mere 7 per cent while finance from loans and creditors accounts for 70 per cent.  Therefore it is more important now than ever before that the co-ops be given greater freedom from the controls of the various lending agencies by increasing their own reserves.  The proposals in this Bill will have the effect of lessening the co-ops reserves and of increasing their dependence on borrowing as a source of finance.  Consequently the co-ops will go even deeper into debt and will find the cost of servicing such debt through high interest charges an increasing burden on their operations.</P>
    <P>These added costs will lead directly to increased prices to the ultimate consumer and to reduced competitiveness on export markets.  It is reasonable to expect that co-ops will price <Col N="1095" /> theirs goods and services to their members in such a way as to leave no surplus at the end of the year.  If that happens both the Minister for Finance and the co-operative movement will be the losers since there will be no surpluses of any consequence for the Minister to tax and no reserves to strengthen the financial position of the co-ops.</P>
    <P>These co-ops have helped many thousands of weaker and smaller farmers to remain viable in their purchasing and selling activities.  They have reduced production costs by lowering the purchasing and selling margins.  Frequently they have either prevented or done away with exploitation of producers and consumers by speculators.  In that way alone I suggest they have done a valuable national service by rationalising production and keeping prices down.  At present they could be criticised on the grounds that they have shown a great reluctance to dismiss staff in the interests of efficiency.  Some people do criticise them on that ground, but they give permanent employment even in the most isolated rural areas.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill will leave the co-ops with no alternative but to use redundancy as a means of maintaining their competitiveness.  Of course this will mean more job losses at a time when there is very little prospect of this Government providing alternative employment for such people, especially those in rural areas. Approximately 36 per cent of the members of these co-ops farm in designated areas.  In addition many small farmers who would not otherwise be liable to income tax will be taxed now through their co-op activities.  In practice they may find it less advantageous to do their business through the co-op. This is an ill-advised, ill-considered proposition, one put forward hastily on a theoretical doctrinaire argument which does not stand up in practice, which is likely to affect small farmers far more than large farmers but which, above all, is likely to damage the overall interests of our economy, not having any regard to the interests of individual farmers or individual non-farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> The overall requirements of our economy are that we use every resource we have to get growth into our economy, to encourage exports.  We will never be able to pay the increased price of oil unless we increase our exports; that is the only way we can do it on a long-term basis.  If we do not get growth into our economy we will get worse and worse, we will have more unemployment and inflation until we grind to a halt.  When growth is what we need it does not make sense to tax these co-ops, which are such an important part not only of life in rural Ireland, of the economy of agriculture and of the economy of the country as a whole, particularly in relation to exports, and do anything which would discourage their activities or render them more difficult. On the contrary we ought to be looking for ways to encourage that kind of activity, in particular to encourage exporters of any kind of goods, be they agricultural or non-agricultural. That is where the salvation of this country lies.  Instead of that we are fiddling around with this kind of nonsense in this sector, wasting the time and energy of people who should be devoting it to getting the country moving.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of thing with which we have been saddled under this Government for the past three years that becomes difficult to take at times when one looks around and sees the situation deteriorating daily, when one sees the waste of time and effort in this House and outside it in totally irrelevant legislation, theoretical legislation that might have some relevance if the country were booming and people were making huge fortunes, instead of which the economy continues to shrink, with more people becoming unemployed and those who are not unemployed are struggling marginally merely to keep their heads above water.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is an Alice in Wonderland situation.  This country cannot stand this kind of thing.  Section 32 in its thinking and in its terms illustrates what is wrong with the approach of this Government to our economic problems.  The Minister stated today something demonstrably untrue in relation to the <Col N="1097" /> acceleration of payment of income tax by the self-employed: that he is trying to achieve comparable treatment between these taxpayers and those under PAYE.  Whatever arguments one may achieve, that is not being achieved. If people are not given an exemption of half a year's tax, as is being done in the case of all of those being brought in under the PAYE system, and was done in the case of those who were brought in under it years ago, one cannot claim that there is anything like party or equality of treatment.  There are other arguments involved, but it is a different situation.</P>
    <P>What is being done with the taxpayers involved is that the Minister is calling it acceleration of payment, but in fact it is collecting a great deal more tax from them.  When I adverted to this matter before on 10th March, I pointed out that the self-employed person will have to pay four half-yearly payments&mdash;that is, two years' tax&mdash;between 1st July, 1976, and 1st July, 1977.  I do not care what terms the Minister uses to describe that situation, but it is certainly not equitable or comparable to the treatment of other taxpayers.  Many of those who will be affected are the owners of small businesses, shops and so on.  If they are obliged to pay two years' tax in a 12-month period at a time when business is rock bottom, what does the Minister think will be the effect and result of that?  One gets no prizes for foretelling the consequences of that in practice.  More people will be put out of business and jobs; more people will be depending on the Exchequer for their subsistence.  Why is this being done?  Is it another stab at equity by the Minister for Finance?  Is that what it is all about?  Whatever the reason it is misjudged, ill-judged and misguided. It can only do damage to our economy.</P>
    <P>One eventually becomes tired of pointing out the consequences of the actions of this Government, particularly in the taxation field.  We have done this time after time.  I can produce evidence that in almost every case we were right.  I would far prefer that the Minister would pay attention to what we are telling him, than have <Col N="1098" /> to acknowledge in due course that we were right.  What we are telling him now is that this proposal to, in effect, charge two years' tax in a 12-month period on the self-employed is going to do enormous damage.  It is going to put people out of work and out of business.  It is not necessary and it is ill-judged.  I would urge the Minister to drop that proposal, to drop the proposal in regard to the co-ops, and to try to stand back briefly and have a look at the overall economic consequences likely to result from the provisions of this Bill.  I am certain that, if the Government do that, they will find that the requirements of our economy would suggest that we take this Bill away immediately and adopt totally different proposals, the aim of which would be to reduce the tax burden on those on whom we can depend to create a growth in our economy&mdash;proposals that would provide incentives to people who could create jobs and contribute to the country, whether they are in farming, manufacturing or the services sector.  There is no time for doctrinaire distinctions. We have got to get this country moving. This Bill is going to hold us back and sink us further into the mire.  The proposals in this Bill are so damaging to the national interest that it cannot get the support of this side of the House.</P>

      <P>Any place I go in this country today&mdash;and this applies to my colleagues as well&mdash;people come up to me and say &ldquo;You do not know me. I know who you are.  For God's sake, when are you going to get this shower out?  If you do not do it soon we will have no country left&rdquo;.  We have been saying that sort of thing for the last few years.  Everybody in the country is saying it now.  Everybody is getting worried.  Everybody now sees the writing on the wall.  When talking about the economic situation that exists here at present one has this consolation: no matter what you say about it you cannot be accused of exaggeration, because it is so serious that it is impossible to exaggerate the true nature of it.  It is estimated that the national debt by the end of 1976 will have reached a figure of almost £3,000 million.  In <Col N="1099" /> March, 1973, when this Government took office the accumulated national debt after 52 years of self-government was £1,200 million.</P>
      <P>At the end of this year our national debt will have increased in 3½ years by more than it was after 52 years. There are members of this Government who would seek to suggest that things are not too bad and that in so far as they are not so good it is due to factors outside our control.</P>
      <P>This Bill is put in its proper context and shown up for what it is by what happened in the House of Commons yesterday.  There you have the only other country in the EEC in serious economic difficulty.  Their difficulties are not dissimilar from our own and while the magnitude of them may not be as great, the nature of them is somewhat analogous.  There you had a budget introduced by Mr. Denis Healey, Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer in a party where nearly 50 per cent of its parliamentary members voted a very left wing member of the party as leader of the party, and the whole nature of that budget is diametrically opposed to the budget of the Minister for Finance introduced here at the end of January, the legislative provisions of which are now contained in this Bill.  There were minor increases in Britain yesterday on things like drink, cigarettes and petrol, minor increases in some cases one-tenth or less than the increases imposed here.  You had the offer very clearly made to the nation as a whole, and in particular to the trade unions, of significant reductions in income tax provided restraints on incomes were agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the contrast between the situation here, a situation sought to be perpetuated by this Bill, and the situation there.  There is a realisation at long last in Britain that constant increases in taxation, whether indirect taxation by way of VAT and excise duty, or direct taxation by way of income tax, are rapidly becoming counter-productive.  People are getting to the stage where they feel it is no longer worth the effort of working <Col N="1100" /> harder and trying to earn more because the harder one works the more one loses in the long run.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's <i>Times</i> there is a table in a reply given by Mr. Robert Sheldon, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, showing, for a married man with two children the initial rates converted into £ sterling at which income tax is charged and the maximum chargeable in each of the EEC member states, in Sweden, the United States of America, Canada and Japan. The figures are set out and they include the Irish figure.  In that there is a mistake because they show the top rate of tax at 70 per cent, not taking into account the 10 per cent imposed last year and reimposed this year.  The situation is that the Irish threshold is almost the lowest at which tax begins to become payable.  A few are a little under it but it's almost the lowest.</P>
    <P>The initial rate of tax payable here is far higher than it is anywhere in all these other countries, apart from Britain, and the maximum rate of tax, taking into account the 10 per cent imposed last year and reimposed this year, is higher in Ireland than in any of these countries, apart from Britain.  I believe the British have come to a realisation of the unacceptability of a high rate of taxation generally and I only wish the Minister for Finance here had done the same.  Unfortunately for us he labours under the impression that the higher the taxes you impose, whether by way of direct or indirect taxation, the more money you expect.</P>
    <P>If this party were in Government at the moment I believe we would take the kind of approach Mr. Healey took yesterday.  We would encourage people to work again.  We would encourage people to spend money and buy goods.  We would encourage an increase in the general turnout within the economy.  This is the only way in which the problems created by the present Government over the last three years could even begin to be solved.  I believe the British realised that.  It is tragic that we should still have trotted out to us today this rubbish we have been getting so constantly for the last three years from <Col N="1101" /> the Minister about the main thrust of this Bill being towards the equilisation of the tax burden and so on and how necessary it is to achieve equity and that nothing matters except input in taxation.  We are of course rapidly achieving equalisation of the tax burden by equalising everybody's tax rates upwards and effective and real incomes downwards.  The Coalition Government are, in the process of doing this, gradually destroying the economy and I do not think that even they can now deny that this is happening.</P>
    <P>I have warned on a couple of occasions over the last three or four months that the economy was going in that direction, that unemployment was going higher and higher, that expectations were being kept up by the Government in circumstances in which they were not justified and that an enormous crash was going to come when the Government could no longer borrow money to pay social welfare benefits, as they have been doing over the last couple of years, and that when that happens there would be for the first time for many, many years people hungry on the streets and there would be a revolution. Some may have thought that what I was saying was a bit farfetched or that, if it were to happen, it would not happen for a long time to come.  I was glad to see that warning taken up in the last few weeks by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who spoke the other night on very similar lines and warned of the possibility of this happening. I am afraid it is no longer just a possibility.  If the policies pursued by this Government continue it will become an increasing probability and virtually certain in a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley dealt with the obtaining by the Government of a loan of some £155 million from the European Economic Community some weeks ago.  This is apparently the only money which the Government are able to borrow from abroad.  They are able to borrow from abroad not on their own credit, not on our credit as a nation, but because the other eight <Col N="1102" /> members of the EEC have underwritten that loan and have guaranteed its repayment to Saudi Arabia and the other countries where it was raised if the Irish Government failed to repay. In addition to that indignity it was made a condition of the loan that the EEC would supervise the spending of that money and would allow it to be spent in certain ways only and would not allow it to be spent in certain ways in which borrowed money was spent last year and the year before by the Coalition.</P>
    <P>We have been an independent nation for 55 years.  This is the first time ever that an Irish Government failed to raise money abroad on their own credit.  It is the first time ever that an Irish Government and the Irish people were subjected to the indignity of being told that money would be lent to them only because other countries were good enough to guarantee them at the bank, and only if the Government undertook to spend the money in a way those who arranged the loan approved of.</P>
    <P>Our independence was won hard by the sacrifices of a great many people.  Our political independence was maintained and supported down through the years by the hard work of a great many people in trying to build up the prosperity and economy of this country.  All those sacrifices and all that work have now been set at nought by the situation we see today in the indignity of what we are subjected to in trying to borrow money from abroad.</P>
    <P>Even tiny countries with less developed economies than ours do not have to suffer these indignities when they seek to borrow money.  We should be thankful that we are members of the EEC.  We have become so bankrupt that nobody will lend money to us unless the Community, which have been sneered at and derided by members of the Government in recent months, come to our aid because we cannot raise it under our own credit.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the effect of this Bill on our tourist industry. Tourism is our second biggest industry, second only to agriculture.  It has had many difficulties in recent years.  In the past few years 115 hotels <Col N="1103" /> closed and there are now 712 hotels registered.  A prominent firm of accountants in Dublin, at the request of the Irish Hotels Federation, have gone through the accounts of all registered hotels in great detail in recent years.  In 1974, the latest year for which detailed figures are available, 32 per cent of our hotels were losing money and 20 per cent were only breaking even.  That meant that over 50 per cent of our hotels were not making a profit.  Many of those who were making a profit were making a purely nominal profit.  The figures for 1975 are not yet available but the federation are satisfied that they will be worse than for 1974.  How much worse has not yet been ascertained.</P>
    <P>The income in real terms, not just in inflated or deflated cash, which this country earned from tourism has dropped by 16 per cent since 1969. This industry, unfortunately, is very much on the downslide.  It needs reasonable encouragement.  If it did not get reasonable encouragement, the very least it needs is not unreasonably to be discouraged.  I asked the House to look at the provisions in this Bill and in the budget and the effects they will have on the tourist industry generally.</P>
    <P>Many of our tourist interests sell holidays to Americans and continentals a long time in advance of the actual holiday, frequently six, nine or ten months ahead.  A great many holidays that will not be enjoyed until this summer were sold to Americans, French, Germans and Belgians as long ago as last autumn.  Many of those package holidays included self-drive cars.  They were free of VAT last year but today they are subjected to 10 per cent VAT.  Those who arranged the holidays have endeavoured, as far as they can, to see if they can pass on the extra 10 per cent to those who book the holidays, but there is no possibility of their doing it.</P>
    <P>The holiday-maker from America or the Continent is not interested in the foibles of the Minister for Finance.  He says: &ldquo;I booked for a particular figure and I will pay that and no more&rdquo;.  The number of car <Col N="1104" /> hire firms and holiday operators generally who are running into very serious difficulties as a result of this single instance is enormous.  In addition, a great part of the activities of hotels have been subjected, as from 1st March, to an increase in VAT from 6.75 per cent to 10 per cent. That is not just an increase of 3¼ per cent, it is an increase of approximately 47 per cent on the existing VAT rate. The amount of VAT they have to pay is about 47 per cent higher than they had to pay before the 1st March.</P>
    <P>What effect does the Minister for Finance think increases of that nature will have?  Has he the faintest shame about the infamous promise made in that 14-point plan that prices would be strictly controlled and maintained at the level that operated in February, 1973?  Are the Arabs to blame for an increase in VAT of about 47 per cent on all items in one fell swoop?  One assumes that the Arabs are not to blame, but one would not have been altogether surprised if the Minister had announced that in some way or another they were. Are the German Government, for example, to blame because the Minister increased VAT from 1st March by approximately 47 per cent?  Most positively they are not.</P>
    <P>I can recall not much more than a year ago the Minister for Finance going to a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the EEC and lecturing other Governments, such as the German Government, on the fact that they were not following the right policies and that he could not arrange things as he wished because all other Governments would not co-operate with him and follow the right policies that would get Europe and the Community out of the recession it was then in.</P>
    <P>The German Government need not be blamed by anybody.  Least of all can they be blamed by the Minister for Finance in Ireland because the German Government have reduced inflation to a figure of 5½ per cent, 5¾ per cent, 6 per cent while the Minister for Finance in Ireland presides over an economy where, instead of inflation getting any better, as it is in every <Col N="1105" /> country in the world, it is getting very substantially greater and where in the last quarter alone the increase was 7.3 per cent.  That does not include the huge increases in VAT imposed by the Minister for Finance on 1st March last.  When it is converted into an annual rate, an increase of 7.3 per cent in a quarter represents more than 30 per cent per annum.  There is every possibility this may be repeated when the huge VAT increases are taken into account in the next quarter.  If it is repeated over a 12-month period we are well and truly back again in the banana republic league with South American type inflation figures.</P>
    <P>Not alone is there no effort by the Government to control this but, on the contrary, there is a deliberate effort to increase those figures.  More than half of that 7.3 per cent is due to what the Minister for Finance did on 28th January last when he introduced a budget with increases in taxation all over the place.  If this Bill is enacted and if all those increases are made a permanent part of our revenue law, what future is there, for example, for the 712 hotels which remain open in the country at the present time with over 50 per cent of them making no profit whatever? Were it not impossible to sell an hotel in the country at the moment, as it has been for the last 12 months, except at a complete give away price, up to half of those 712 hotels would have been sold by their present owners because there is no future for them.  If there was a market for hotels in the country at the moment the banks who are owed substantial sums of money by hotel owners, away above what the figure should be in many cases, would have long since moved in on the mortgages to realise their security and would have sold the hotels.  The banks have declined to do that, not because they want to go out of their way to help the hotels in question, but because they are looking after their own long term interests.  If they were to flood the market with hotels the possibility of selling any of them would be even more remote than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>The security which the banks hold <Col N="1106" /> for their loans is negligible at the present time because it is unrealisable. If industry generally was in the position the hotel industry is in at the moment there would be closures all over the country on a very much higher scale than the existing high scale because the amount of capital that is needed is greater in industry. Families who have been in the hotel business for most of their lives will do anything rather than see their premises close down.  They will even act foolishly and lose more and more money and spend their time working at something out of which they are not getting anything, and are unlikely to get anything for a number of years to come.  Their difficulties are compounded many times over by the incredible provisions of this Bill in relation to VAT, its introduction to car hire and the increase of the 6.5 per cent to 10 per cent, an increase of 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>Increases in VAT on things which directly affect the tourist industry, such as those I have been talking about, are by no means the end of the story.  We had a huge increase in the cost of petrol of 13p. Petrol now costs 88½p per gallon, which is 13p more expensive than it is in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Is that, in the eyes of the Minister for Finance, supposed to be an inducement to people to come here?  Is this supposed to be an effort by him to support the second biggest industry in the country?  As Deputy Colley said, the Minister for Finance gives the impression of somebody who decides on a figure and never makes the slightest effort to work out in his own mind or in the minds of his advisers what the consequences, economic and social, of what he is doing will be? How could any rational man force the price of petrol up by 13p more than it costs in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and expect the tourist industry to have a good year this year?</P>
    <P>Tourists coming to the country like to have a drink when they are on their holidays.  There will not be many of them who will do that this year because I know of no country in the <Col N="1107" /> world, except some of the more expensive places in one or two countries like Switzerland, where the price of drink in an ordinary licensed premises is higher than it is today in Ireland. The cost of a pint of stout in Dublin at the moment varies a bit depending on the type of premises in which one is drinking, but it is fair to say that the average price is about 40p.  If a man was in the habit of drinking five pints of stout a day, which is not an abnormal quantity for those who drink stout, he will now spend £2 a day or £14 a week on what, particularly for the ordinary working man, may well be his only form of relaxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the development strategy for the north Mayo area which was prepared for Mayo County Council by a firm of consultants in 1975 and which related to the period up to 1991.</P>
      <P>I understand that copies of the consultants' report have been circulated by the county council to all State Departments. While I would expect, therefore, that Departments would take account of the report in the making of decisions relating to the north Mayo area, I should point out that action arising from the report is, in the first instance, a matter for Mayo County Council.  It is for them to decide whether, and if so to what extent, the proposals made by the consultants should be incorporated into the county development plan and the council's various work programmes and, having done so, to submit appropriate projects for financing as and when they become necessary.  The question of a blanket commitment of funds to carry out the recommendations in the report does not, therefore, arise. Any proposals for particular schemes which are put forward by the county council will, of course, be considered as sympathetically as possible.  They cannot, however, be considered in isolation since demands are arising in other aeras.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that the funds made available by my Department to the Mayo local authorities for sanitary services, housing and road works increased from £1.44 million in 1972-73 to £3.48 million in 1975.  This illustrates my commitment to providing the maximum possible support for the development of the necessary infra-structural services in areas where industrial and other forms of development are taking place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The public capital programme allocation of £1.3 million to the National Building Agency for 1976 will finance work in progress at 31st December last on the construction of houses for industrial workers and will meet certain housing commitments assisted by the European Coal and Steel Community.  Apart from this provision there are no funds <Col N="1111" /> at my disposal for the construction of additional houses specially for industrial workers.</P>
      <P>Industrial workers who qualify in the normal way for rehousing by the local authority, in accordance with the approved statutory scheme of letting priorities, or for local authority housing loans, or State or supplementary housing grants may, of course, be assisted in their rehousing out of the £117.75 million allocated to me under the 1976 public capital programme for these purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responsible only for the allocation of funds to local government and out of that there is a special priority.  The Department of Local Government, through the National Building Agency, erected some houses for industrial workers and for others during the years on an agency basis.  This is not being done so I assume the funds will become available through the IDA or from the Department of Industry and Commerce. I cannot say where the money will come from because it is not a matter for me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no such applications awaiting my approval. Under devolved procedures, it is the housing authority's responsibility to deal with them within the overall capital allocation for the year.</P>
      <P>I have notified Donegal County Council that their total authorised capital expenditure for 1976 on the local authority housing construction programme is £2,132,000.  This is an increase of almost £225,000 on the corresponding level of authorised expenditure in respect of 1975.  I intend to review the level of expenditure and output on the programme generally later in the year and additional allocations may then be made for new work to be started in the last quarter of the year.</P>
      <P>I am glad to take this opportunity to inform the House that Donegal County Council completed 351 local authority houses last year and 832, or an average of 25 a month, since 1st April, 1973.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The claim on behalf of the Limerick fire brigade referred to by the Deputy, was conceded by Limerick Corporation in June, 1975, and was sanctioned by me in January last.  In December last, Galway County Council advised my Department of a claim on behalf of Galway firemen.  The matter has since been the subject of correspondence between the county council and my Department.</P>
      <P>I am aware that strike notice has been served by the firemen on Galway County Council.  I do not, therefore, consider that a statement by me would be helpful at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister's Department accept that there is an agreement between Galway County Council and the union representing these men which gives parity with Limerick firemen to Galway wholetime firemen and that, having conceded the claim to Limerick firemen and applying parity, surely there should be no delay in sanctioning this claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not actual parity but there is a relationship or there appears to be a relationship between the two.  In one case there was agreement before the date on which special claims were stopped. <Col N="1117" /> The other claim did not come in until afterwards.  I am suggesting that Galway County Council should refer the case to the Labour Court.  If the Labour Court recommend it, it then fits into the category in which it can be paid; otherwise it would be a breach of an arrangement that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the claim lodged by Galway came after the Government directive?  I understood both claims were lodged in May, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Galway the claim was lodged on 20th May, 1975, and on 27th February by Limerick.  Actually, what matters is when it was processed and it was not processed or accepted by Galway Corporation until after the June arrangement. In the case of Limerick it was accepted before June.  There is, therefore, a very big difference in the two issues.  If both had been before 26th June the difficulty would not arise.  I am suggesting an easy way out in the hope that this will solve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no reason why they should have held it up anymore than Limerick would wait until Galway had decided.  They were both in the same position if they felt there was a real parity and, therefore, each of them could have processed their claim at the one time as often happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the parity arrangement is between the union representing Galway wholetime firemen and Galway County Council.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will make a statement in regard to the decision to grant, on appeal, planning permission for the erection of a supermarket, shops, professional suites and a public house on the &ldquo;Harp Site&rdquo;, Ballyfermot, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeal site of 1.03 acres at Ballyfermot Road formed part of a seven acre site owned by Dublin Corporation and known as the &ldquo;Harp Site&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;Harp Site&rdquo; had always been earmarked by the planning authority for commercial purposes and is zoned for &ldquo;residential services&rdquo; in the Dublin Development Plan, 1971.  In 1967 the corporation granted outline permission for commercial development on the entire site but subsequently in deference to the wishes of the local residents as expressed in the community plan prepared by the Ballyfermot Community Association, they revised their thinking for extensive commercial development on the site.  The community plan envisaged a limited development on part of the site including a cluster of shops and a licensed premises. The corporation accepted the community proposal and limited the commercial development to an area of 1.03 acres.  They advertised this smaller site for tender in 1972 and on the 21st March, 1973, they decided to grant outline permission to the successful tenderers for development consisting of a supermarket, shops, professional suites and a licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of appeals and a considerable number of objections were lodged with me against the decision of the planning authority and an oral hearing was requested.  The grounds of appeal were lack of educational/ community facilities in Ballyfermot, the adequacy of existing shopping facilities and the question of possible <Col N="1120" /> traffic hazard.  When the oral hearing first opened in April, 1974, a statement was made on behalf of the appellants that in the few weeks immediately preceding the date of the hearing, the vocational education committee had stated that they needed the entire seven acre site for a community school.  The planning authority representatives stated that the corporation would be willing to make the remaining six acres still in corporation ownership available to the vocational education committee but they regretted that the committee had not made their case before the appeal site had been sold by the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that when the site of 1.03 acres was agreed on there was a suggestion that the corporation would be prepared to make available .88 acres as a car park on condition that the developers would develop it as a car park for communal use.  It appears now that this area, together with the remainder of the site, is available to the vocational education committee for the purpose of erecting their school.  In other words, 1.03 acres is the only portion on which permission has been granted.</P>

      <P>The oral hearing was adjourned a number of times over a period of 16 months to allow time for negotiation for the acquisition of the appeal site between the Department of Education and the developers who are now the owners of the site. On the 6th March, 1975, the Department of Education advised me that the negotiations had proved unsuccessful as the sale price sought was considered prohibitive.  They indicated, however, that they were satisfied the proposed school could be provided on the remaining six acre site although conceding that the extra 1.03 acres would be of considerable benefit to the school project if it were possible to acquire it.  The oral hearing was finally resumed on 4th September, 1975, and concluded.  In the light of the information that there was no prospect of the appeal site being used for the school complex and having considered the report of the person who conducted the oral hearing, I refused the appeal.  The site consists of 5.81 acres, plus 1.03 acres.</P>

      <P>I am not an expert on those matters but the Department of Education, and the vocational educational committee, seem to be satisfied that it would be possible to have the school there.  That site was not used for 20 years and the pity is that somebody did not think of this before the decision was made.  Originally, the whole site was for commercial development and then the corporation did what they considered to be the sensible thing.  They have since found that had they held the whole site it would be more useful but that cannot be helped now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975 was essentially designed to awaken public interest in the conservation of the architectural heritage.  I believe that the activities undertaken in connection with the year succeeded admirably in this.  The various school and other competitions, seminars, student projects, exhibitions, lectures and so on were particularly successful in arousing the interest of the general public, and particularly of young people, in the conservation of the built environment.  The two national projects&mdash;Holycross, County Tipperary and St. John's Square, Limerick&mdash;and the other projects undertaken by local authorities and voluntary groups will serve as lasting reminders of the potential for adaptation of old, historic buildings and for urban conservation and renewal.  Publications on various aspects of the architectural heritage which became available during the year should also have a lasting effect.</P>
      <P>To foster interest in the architectural heritage, I have sponsored a film &ldquo;Places for People&rdquo; which will be on general release throughout the country shortly.  A 16mm version is available from the National Film Institute of Ireland for showing to schools, clubs and similar organisations.  As part of a programme to develop further public interest, An Foras Forbartha are currently running a series of public lectures on the architectural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the various promotional activities undertaken during 1975 will be reflected, not only in increased public interest in the architectural heritage, but also in the activities of public authorities and, in particular, in determining the objectives of local development plans <Col N="1126" /> and in the implementation of planning control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Revenue Commissioners endeavour to have Inland Revenue affidavits certified as speedily as possible to enable representation to be raised to deceased persons with the minimum of delay.  Certain difficulties arose however between the date of abolition of estate duty, that is, 1st April, 1975, and the date of the passing of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act which, although effective to impose inheritance tax since the 1st April, 1975, did not become law until the 31st March, 1976.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to suggest that there has been any change in the Revenue Commissioners' practice in these cases or that they automatically reject all affidavits, certificates and other evidence of market value in voluntary transfer cases.

      <P>Does it come as a surprise to the Minister that his fellows in the legal profession are all complaining about the fact that the Revenue Commissioners return certificates, affidavits and other evidence of market value as a matter of course and that there is serious complaint about this within the profession? Would the Minister accept that, in my experience, claims for value which are obviously outrageous have issued from the Revenue Commissioners?

Of course the operation of that is a matter for themselves.  But what the Deputy has said to me does surprise me and it has not previously come to my notice.  I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no change in practice.  It may be that some people have been unlucky.  I experienced cases <Col N="1133" /> which were challenged and ones which were not and sometimes I was surprised as much when they were not challenged as when they were.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount provided for aid to farmers under the EEC disadvantaged areas directive was £10 million in 1975 and £13.5 million for 1976.  Of the latter figure it is estimated that <Col N="1135" /> about £0.5 million will be required for assisting joint investment projects in hill grazing, fodder production and so forth for which a special scheme will be introduced soon.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on headage payments under the EEC scheme during 1975 was approximately £6.5 million.  In addition, claims amounting to about £5.4 million were carried over into the current year.  Most of these have now been disposed of.</P>
    <P>Recoupment from the EEC of expenditure on headage grants will be at the rate of 25 per cent in respect of the 1975 scheme and 35 per cent in respect of the 1976 scheme.  No recoupment has yet been received.  The procedures for submission of claims have not yet been finally settled by the Commission.  It is expected, however, that recoupment will take place on the basis of expenditure in the preceding year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>All the grants were paid by the end of March save those where some difficulties arose, such as the wrong herd number being submitted by the applicant or the Department found the name of the applicant on the official herd list did not coincide.  That happened in a number of cases where changes in holdings had taken place, where the land changed, for instance, from father to son and the relevant changes were not made so far as herd numbers were concerned.  It is only in such cases payment has not yet been made. There are also cases where payment has not been made because people submitted the wrong electoral division and consequently the claims had to be deferred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of milk it is a matter for the creameries and processing plants to settle with their suppliers the amount of the recent increases in the support prices for butter and skim milk powder which should be passed on in the prices payable to the suppliers.  In the case of beef, the percentage of the increase in the support price which is reflected in the producer price for cattle will depend on such factors as the overall market situation, the competitive efficiency of the factory concerned and the proportions disposed of commercially and to intervention. In the case of pigmeat the recent Community increase will not affect the producer prices as these are well above the support level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Department keep under review the present system operated by creameries and meat plants to ensure that the maximum benefits are given to producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, we keep a watchful eye on all such matters, but most of the creameries are co-operatives and we assume the committees of management, elected by the suppliers, ensure that the suppliers get what is fair and reasonable so far as prices are concerned.  We are reasonably satisfied that everything is in order.  Deputy Leonard would surely not expect the Department's inspectors to be prying into the day-to-day affairs of the creameries.  If we get reports that prices are not being paid as we think they should be, we investigate but, by and large, we are quite <Col N="1139" /> satisfied with the efficiency of our creamery system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is deep concern among the farming organisations that the maximum benefits are not coming back to the people?  The Department should try to alleviate those fears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's assertion is groundless.  First, the creameries are managed by committees composed of suppliers to the individual creameries.  Second, we have two very active organisations catering for farmers generally.  I have no doubt that any creamery could not possibly withhold from suppliers money lawfully due to them.  Our creamery system is managed very well.  The people on the management committees are honest.  I would not accept that there are underhand dealings, as Deputy Leonard seems to imply, and that the creameries are withholding moneys lawfully due to suppliers.  In my view, there is no justification for that assertion.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate I was dealing with the effects this Bill and the budget will have on tourism, our second largest industry.  One noteworthy effect is the extraordinary increase imposed on the price of drink, in particular, beer.  I understand that at Question Time there was some disagreement as to exactly how much it was.</P>
      <P>It is worth referring to the Minister's speech this morning to point out what the figures are.  In the budget, the Minister increased the price of beer by 6p.  There was another increase of 4p approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That makes a total of 10p.  The result of this&mdash;apart from the effects it must inevitably have on our very depressed tourist trade&mdash;is that publicans throughout the country have estimated that their turnover has dropped by between 20 and 40 per cent.  This is not a temporary drop as happened on previous occasions when the price of drink was increased, but appears to be levelling out at an unusually high level.  This level is so high that many publicans are now in the unhappy position of having to contemplate letting go staff who have been employed for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another example of what Deputy Colley described as the Minister's irrationality in his failure to see the consequences of what he is <Col N="1145" /> doing.  One of the social consequences of the Minister's action is that the humble pint of stout is considerably dearer than whiskey, although the reverse was always the case up to the last budget.  As a result, many young people who drank beer rather than spirits are reversing the process.  I do not think I need go into detail of what the consequences of that reversal can be.  They can have serious long-term medical and social consequences particularly for young people.  This is a matter of very considerable importance.</P>
    <P>These brutal increases in direct taxation imposed on the various commodities about which I have spoken raise the problem of whether the Minister for Finance will end up with less money than he would have got if he had not increased the prices.  In certain spheres at least there is a decided possibility that this will be so.  The total returns in many areas are now less than if there had been no increase in these taxes.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the increase in VAT and the main 6.75 per cent rate, on which there was a 47 per cent increase.  That contrasts very starkly with what happened in Britain yesterday, where the higher rate of VAT, 25 per cent, much lower than our higher rate, was halved to 12½ per cent.  That was not done by the Socialist Chancellor in Britain without good reason.  He believed it was necessary to do that in order to stimulate the economy.  He believed it was necessary to try to curb inflation and to try to stimulate growth in demand and in the economy generally. He understood that above all other people and institutions, the one which has the greatest duty to try to prevent the further fuelling of inflation is the Government.  The British Government made their contribution to try to keep prices down.  They made a major contribution towards reducing prices.  Again I would ask the House to contrast what was done yesterday by Mr. Healey with the totally opposite approach of our Minister for Finance.  Not alone did he make no effort to maintain prices or reduce them, but across the board he <Col N="1146" /> increased very substantially the price of virtually every commodity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley dealt this morning with the question of a pay pause or a possible national wage agreement.  He pointed out the difficulties that are created for the unions and the workers in approaching any such arrangement.  It is fair to say that, if the Government had gone out of their way to make sure there would be no pay pause or no national wage agreement, they could not have succeeded better than they did by increasing the cost to the average citizen of virtually every commodity, as they did in the budget and as they are doing now in this Finance Bill.  If for some reason the Government decided they did not want a pay pause and wage restraint and they wanted a free for all, the best way of going about achieving that is what they did in the budget and what they are doing in this Bill. While some of them are talking about a pay pause, income restraint and all the rest of it, they are putting this Bill before the House to try to make permanent the various increases they imposed in the budget.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know what exactly the attitude of the Government is in relation to pay and its control because we had the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance telling us in one week that controls were necessary, that there could be no increases in pay in 1976 and the following week we had the Minister for Labour telling us there was no question of any statutory pay pause, that there could not be controls and that there would have to be voluntary agreement. Those statements are totally contradictory but they are made by members of the Government within a week of each other.  They cannot be reconciled.  One can only assume that there are diametrically opposed views held within the Government.</P>
    <P>This morning on the Order of Business Deputy Fitzgerald inquired from the Minister for Labour what it was proposed to do with item No. 17 on today's Order Paper, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill, 1975, which proposes to repeal the necessity for equal pay for women, <Col N="1147" /> which was introduced and passed in this House in 1974.  The Minister for Labour made some sort of sneering remark that he did not believe there was any confusion in relation to the matter.  It is no harm to remind him, as he seems to overlook the fact, that the law of the land at the moment decrees&mdash;it has never been repealed&mdash; that equal pay for men and women for equal work applies throughout our entire economy, both in the private and public sectors.  It is open to any woman who is not being paid equal pay to go to the courts and enforce that Act.  It is beyond me how the Minister for Labour can suggest that there is no confusion in this situation when the policy of the Government apparently is to repeal at least in part this legislation and to substitute for it some new concept they have of married people being paid at a higher rate than single people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be deviating from the Finance Bill proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that I have deviated to some extent but I am sure the Chair will appreciate that the whole question of the economy, which finds its legislative expression in the Finance Bill, is of necessity bound up to a very great extent with the whole question of pay and an increase or otherwise during this year.  It is apparently the view of the trade unions, and the overwhelming view of their members, that because of the increases in taxation, particularly in direct taxation, imposed in the budget and proposed to be legislated in this Bill, they cannot be expected to agree to the wage freeze they were asked for some weeks ago by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, quite honestly, cannot blame them. This party are very conscious of the paramount importance of restraint in income in the whole economy this year. I suggest to the House that even though the necessity and the tremendous importance of income restraint this year are vital the Government have done all they can to destroy any possibility of it being agreed to by loading on huge <Col N="1148" /> increases in the cost of everyday commodities. If proof was needed it is that there is a 7.3 per cent increase in the consumer price index up to the middle of February, which does not take account of the very substantial increases in VAT which came into operation on 1st March, and which will be reflected in the consumer price index next quarter.</P>
    <P>There is one body, and one only, which must take the blame if there is no reasonable national wage agreement and if there is no pay pause, which seems very unlikely.  They are the Government, who went out of their way to increase costs and prices to such an extent that the possibility of the kind of things the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are looking for being agreed to has become very remote indeed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier today the rates of personal taxation in this country and I quoted figures which show that Ireland has the second highest rate of personal taxation&mdash;it is second only to the United Kingdom&mdash;throughout the EEC and, indeed, what one might call the western world.  We are not a great deal behind the United Kingdom and we are miles ahead of the third country in that list.  It is quite clear from the increase of 10 per cent in income tax, which was imposed last year, and which it is proposed, in one of the sections on income tax in this Bill, to reimpose this year, that we will remain very close to the top of the league so far as rates of personal tax are concerned.  I wish the Government would realise that there is a tremendous disincentive not just to industrialists or those who might be engaged in trying to establish industry but to the ordinary worker in any factory or any other business. The more work you do now and the more you earn the less you are getting and the more futile the whole exercise becomes.  The Government, instead of again increasing all rates of income tax, except the bottom one, by 10 per cent, as is proposed in this Bill, should be decreasing those rates by 10 per cent to try to generate in the economy once more a willingness to work, a feeling that it is worth <Col N="1149" /> while working and that there is an incentive to increase productivity.</P>
    <P>The attitude of business generally to this malaise which afflicts the country at present was very well expressed the other day by the chairman of CCT, Mr. Colm Barnes who is not just a private citizen speaking of his own feelings or difficulties but speaking as chairman of a major semi-State body who are doing what they can to try to promote the export of Irish manufactured goods.  I want to quote briefly some of what he said, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of the 30th March last:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Enterpreneurs</i> see the present political climate in Ireland as &ldquo;hostile to business&rdquo; and have turned their attention to investing in other countries &ldquo;where they are more appreciated&rdquo;.  This he said is a &ldquo;sad and serious state&rdquo;.  The industrial sector he stressed, &ldquo;has been subjected to a battering of the most damaging kind&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He goes on at some length to elaborate on those statements in greater detail but I will not detain the House with his elaboration, which bears out the conclusions he came to.  A statement like that from the chairman of an important semi-State body dealing with exports of Irish-manufactured goods is extremely serious.  A man in his position would not say the kind of things I have quoted unless the position was extremely precarious in his view and in the view of his associates. Unfortunately there is no doubt that he is right.  The speech was delivered on 29th March and I have not seen anyone contradicting it or endeavouring to suggest that Mr. Barnes was wrong.  It is evident he was not wrong in what he said and it is a serious matter that the present political climate in Ireland is hostile to business and that our <i>entrepreneurs</i> and industrialists have turned their attention to investing in other countries where they are more appreciated.</P>
    <P>What hope have we of getting out of the situation where there are nearly 120,000 people registered as unemployed and where there are tens of thousands more unemployed whose <Col N="1150" /> names do not appear on the register because they left school in the last year?  What hope have we of getting out of the terrible situation we are in when, in the words of the chairman of an important semi-State body, industrialists are getting out of the country to places where, as he put it, they are more appreciated?  They are getting out of a country where the present political climate is hostile towards those who seek to improve the lot of tens of thousands of unemployed. The chairman of that organisation described the entire business as sad and serious and he was not exaggerating or overstating the position.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that until people are given the incentive to extend businesses and to establish new industries there is little hope for the many thousands who are on the list of unemployed.  It is worth adverting to the views on this matter and to the figures given by the Managing Director of the IDA, Mr. Michael J. Killeen, in a speech he made last Sunday and which was reported in the newspapers on Monday, 5th April.  He stated that last year 14,500 new industrial jobs were created but later in his speech he said that a total of 27,300 industrial jobs were lost last year through factory closures and layoffs. The net loss, therefore, in industrial manufacturing jobs last year was more than 13,000.</P>
    <P>We are facing a problem in this country, as has been stated by Professor Walshe of the ESRI and by other people, including Senator Halligan.  We have to create a net 30,000 new jobs each year between now and 1986 if we are to reduce our unemployment rate to 4 per cent.  The target that is being suggested as desirable is not to do away with unemployment; that is regarded as far too pious a hope and far too impossible an achievement.  All we are being asked now by a number of commentators who are being realistic about the matter is to seek to reduce our unemployment figure from its present level of 9½ per cent or 10 per cent to 4 per cent.  We are told we will have to create 30,000 net new jobs each year between now and 1986 to do that. <Col N="1151" /> That figure does not mean just creation of 30,000 jobs; it means 30,000 created after deducting all job losses.  We have made a very bad start on this because we were minus 13,000 jobs last year. That simply increases the 30,000 figure we must achieve.</P>
    <P>It is not often remembered that at the end of 1971 and the beginning of 1972 emigration ceased from this country and immigration began and for the first time since obtaining independence we have to cater not for a static or a falling population but for one that is growing, and the projections of which are that it will grow very substantially in the next ten years.  I do not want to be pessimistic about it but I have the most grave doubts about our ability to achieve even the limited targets set out.  I am certain that the policies that have resulted in a net loss of more than 20,000 jobs in the last two years rather than the creation of new jobs will never achieve these objectives, limited though they may be.  If one ponders on these figures and on the problems that will face the country because of the growth in population in the next ten years, quite honestly one becomes somewhat pessimistic about our prospects.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that we must create incentives for people at all levels in industry and in business, not alone those who take the risks of establishing and maintaining an industry but of those who work in industry.  The attitude of many people now is that it does not greatly matter whether they have employment.  I am frequently told by some of these people that they are better off to be unemployed because they do not have to pay income tax, they are entitled to a medical card and they do not have to pay social welfare contributions.  It is unfortunate that the kind of climate of opinion created by the Government in the last few years is producing this kind of result and while that climate is fostered, as it is by the Government, we will not get out of our present situation.</P>
    <P>We hear from Government speakers that although we are in serious difficulty so is everyone else.  I should like to endeavour to nail that lie once and for all.  Outside of Britain&mdash;and <Col N="1152" /> thank goodness Britain seems to have done something major yesterday to solve her problems&mdash;the terrible despondency and recession in which this country has laboured for the past two years does not repeat itself in other countries.  Recently I was in Switzerland and they told me about their economic difficulties, particularly with regard to inflation which they regarded as their most serious difficulty. In 1975 it was between 4 and 4½ per cent and this they regarded as unacceptably high.  I smiled politely at their problem and said that if we could get our inflation rate down to 4 or 4½ per cent we would be making very considerable progress.  I said we had an inflation rate that was 20 per cent or more in the last couple of years.  Therefore, to suggest that the rest of the world is in serious difficulty, that we are just simply a part of that and that we are no worse off than anyone else is to suggest something that most patently is not true. As late as this morning we heard the Minister for Finance talk about the difficulties created for this country by the increase in oil prices, and in particular by the increase in petrol prices.</P>
    <P>Of all the huge increases in petrol prices imposed here in the past two-and-a-half years, the great bulk of them were not imposed by OPEC or the Arabs or the producers but by our Minister for Finance.  It is rather disturbing to compare the price of petrol here with the price in the USA where the bulk of their supplies must now be imported and they are subject to much the same difficulties as we are. The retail price of petrol in America is approximately one-third of what it is here and they regard that as being unacceptably high.  Is it any wonder that tourists coming here from America or elsewhere regard the prices of essential commodities as incredibly high, so much so that they are not encouraged to come back?</P>
    <P>Section 32 proposes to impose, in conjunction with the Corporation Tax Act just passed, ordinary company or corporation tax on the co-operatives.  Deputy Colley dealt in <Col N="1153" /> some detail with this matter this morning and I shall not go into the same detail, but I want to make some comments.  A week or so ago I attended a meeting organised by the IFA in Limerick, the first meeting of the IFA that I had the privilege of attending.  It was noteworthy that the only Deputies present were Fianna Fáil Deputies, although every Deputy in the North Munster region was invited. This was much commented on by those present.  The sense of outrage expressed by the farmers present and by those associated with various co-operatives was quite extraordinary. I had never before heard such anger expressed about financial proposals.</P>
    <P>Figures were given to us of the financial position of some of Munster's largest co-operatives.  The Golden Vale Co-operative, which has 10,000 members and which recently because of its serious financial situation had to fire 450 of its workers, most of them in Limerick and Clare, owed the bank, we were informed, a sum in excess of £14 million.  It is heavily over-borrowed and heavily under capitalised from its own shareholders and any reserves it might have.  It is in a serious financial position.  As far as I could see, the main reason why it was able to continue notwithstanding its incredibly heavy borrowing is because there was no taxation on any surplus it might make&mdash;it is not making any surplus now.  The banks' prospects of repayment, obviously, were considered better than would be the case with an ordinary commercial company and for that reason they did not squeeze as hard as they might in the case of a private concern.  There is every reason to believe that the banks' attitude will change as a result of proposals in this Bill.  What then will be the future of that co-operative?</P>
    <P>We are told that Mitchelstown, happily a more successful concern than Golden Vale, has borrowed from the banks to the extent of £9 million.  I did not get the figure for Ballyclough but I understand they have borrowed heavily also.  A major part of the security for that borrowing has been, up to now, the exemption of these co-operatives from taxation.  What their <Col N="1154" /> position, that of their suppliers and members and particularly that of their workers will be after this proposal is put through, I do not know.  As I said 450 workers were fired from Golden Vale in February.  How many more will be fired from this and the other co-operatives when this Bill is passed, I do not know.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley suggested this morning that the Minister for Finance, in view of remarks he made in his opening speech, might have second thoughts about his proposals.  I hope and pray this is so.  Apparently, he says in one breath that the Government are adamant and resolved to go ahead with the proposals and in another later that the Government are looking at certain aspects of proposals that have been put to them.  In regard to any changes the Minister may introduce on the Committee Stage in relation to this proposal arising out of pressure put on him, I should like him to clarify either then, or preferably when replying to this debate, the position of co-operatives in particular and of all producers in general in relation to sales into intervention.</P>
    <P>I had a long debate on this point with the Minister for Finance in the Special Committee on the Corporation Tax Bill.  The Minister had seven advisers with him and it was not possible to get from him or from them a definite answer as to how sales into intervention stood in relation to export tax relief.  The general gist of what I could gather is that sales into intervention, as such, do not qualify for export tax relief; but if the commodity is moved abroad and there is certainty that it will not physically come back to this country, the Revenue Commissioners could, in their goodness, regard that as an export sale.  If this tax is imposed on co-operatives it is absolutely vital that they should qualify for export tax relief on everything they sell into intervention and that is the bulk of their production.</P>
    <P>There are at least three co-operatives engaged in the export of meat in a big way and many more are selling milk products in the form of butter, cheese or powder.  In many cases the only way in which they can sell these <Col N="1155" /> goods abroad is by selling them direct into intervention.  The EEC take over the entire responsibility for them and they are no longer the responsibility of this country.  If this tax is to be imposed&mdash;and this party strongly believe it should not be&mdash;notwithstanding the views of 165,000 farmers in the co-operative movement, it is vital that sales into intervention should qualify for export tax relief, because it is the only chance these co-operatives have of surviving under conditions created for them by the imposition of this taxation.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Minister, and the Revenue Commissioners, seek to make a distinction between sales into intervention where the goods are held in cold storage here and sales into intervention where the goods are held in Britain or on the Continent in cold storage.  I do not think the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to make that distinction.  It is purely arbitrary as far as the producer is concerned as to whether his product happens to go abroad or is kept here after it is sold to the EEC and they have taken over responsibility for it.  A product produced on a certain day will go into intervention in Dublin or Cork or wherever there happens to be an empty cold store but if that store is full and another farmer or co-op produces a similar product he has to send it to Britain. Why should one qualify, as the Minister suggests, for export tax relief and another not?  It is purely arbitrary and if that is the way it will operate it will be extremely unfair.</P>
    <P>The latter part of the Bill deals in great detail with new proposals for motor tax.  Firstly, it establishes the vast increase in tax, as if the motorist was not already sufficiently hard hit with petrol at 88.3p per gallon and having to pay very high insurance. Before this increase motor tax was already higher than in any other country in Europe.  In spite of those things the Minister imposed huge further increases.</P>
    <P>Section 79 provides that none of the additional money which will be <Col N="1156" /> raised by these greatly increased rates of taxation will go into the Road Fund; it will go into the normal Exchequer.  It will not be used for the benefit of motorists or for the improvement of our road system.  One would have thought that that was a hard enough imposition on the motorist but we also have in this Bill&mdash;I do not think it was mentioned in the budget speech&mdash;about 15 sections designed, as the Minister puts it, to prevent evasion of road tax.  Anti-avoidance is the most important function in the Minister's life but the lengths to which the Minister goes in these 15 sections on road tax to prevent evasion or avoidance are ridiculous.</P>
    <P>As yet, the public are not aware what is in these sections but I am sure that when they become aware there will be a public outcry.  I will be disappointed if there is not such an outcry because the provisions in those sections are monstrous.  It is proposed that whether one uses a car or not one is continuously liable for tax on it.  In order to get out of having to pay tax on a car that one is not using one must go to most incredible lengths which most people are not in a position to go to.  One must show that the car was unusable during the period it was not taxed.  That applies even if one keeps it locked up in one's own garage.  The people will be horrified when they realise the full extent of this.</P>
    <P>I am always amused when I see in Bills produced nowadays a side note on a section stating &ldquo;onus of proof on defence&rdquo;.  It is worth noting that as far as the registration authorities are concerned their certificate is evidence and proof of everything unless the defendant can prove the contrary to be so.  The onus is put entirely on the defendant.  It is a question of the ordinary motorist having to prove his innocence.  It is worth noting also that the fines in respect of any offence to do with motor taxation are increased to a maximum £100.  This is apart from the fines for the nonpayment of tax.  One of the offences which is re-enacted here and which now carries the maximum fine of <Col N="1157" /> £100 is that of not displaying a tax disc.  I draw attention to the fact that there is a distinction between the offence of not displaying a tax disc and the one of not paying tax.  If one does not display the tax disc&mdash;many people have paid tax but do not display the disc because their children tore the disc off the windscreen&mdash;one is liable to a fine not exceeding £100 for that totally trivial offence.  Some people may not have any control at all over that matter.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect of it all affects the many people who do not use their cars for part of the year mainly because they cannot afford to. In many cases they prefer to use them during the summer only.  Accordingly, they do not tax them for the winter months.  Unless these people go to tremendous lengths to show that the car was unusable during the winter they have to tax it for the entire year and the tax they are now called upon to pay in many cases is approximately double what it was up to February of this year.  The road tax paid by motorists up to February was substantially more than it was in Britain or any other European country.  In some European countries no road tax is payable at all and motorists pay a fee to get a licence plate each year.</P>
    <P>I have only dealt with some of the matters in the Bill.  On Committee Stage all matters will be dealt with in detail and it is not appropriate that they should be dealt with now.  The overall effect of this Bill seems to be that it will further damage an already seriously damaged economy.  One would have thought that after all the destruction carried out by the Government on our economy over the past three years they would have at last learned their lesson.  However, instead of learning their lesson, instead of doing things which are so patently necessary to be done, they are doing the opposite.  They are fuelling inflation by increasing prices and while they are increasing prices they are, almost in the same breath, asking workers to agree to a wage freeze.  It is an incredible contradiction.  It is not a policy because every line of it contradicts every other line.  What is said <Col N="1158" /> on Monday is contradicted on Tuesday and what is said on Tuesday is contradicted by what is done on Wednesday. This Bill adds further to that confusion and to the gradual and inevitable destruction of our economy. The great majority of our people have come to realise, particularly in the last three months, that every day longer the Government remain in office the repairing of the damage becomes that much more difficult, and the duty of the Government now, to the country and to its future, is to say: &ldquo;All right, we have failed, we will get out and let the job of repair begin&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There are many important discussions taking place on the question of employer-labour agreement, but that cannot possibly be taking up the time of more than two or three members of the Government.  Allowing for the odd member of the Government who may be on his way to or from some other part of the world and the few Deputies who are not well, I work out a tally of 66 Deputies, including Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, who are available to come in to support the Minister for Finance.  So far, I have not seen any except the Parliamentary Secretary now standing in for the Minister since 10.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>The problem they may have is that they find it impossible to come in to support the Minister with their hearts even though they will have to do so with their feet.  It is an indication to me that there is a lesser regard for Parliament as a democratic institution. It is a great pity there have not been any Government Deputies here since 10.30 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is topical to refer to the budget introduced yesterday in Britain but I do not propose to deal with it at any great length.  I have not studied it very deeply and I regard it as being the business of Britain, even though we are closely linked with the British economy. One of the notable changes in it is in regard to VAT.  Last January the rate of VAT on luxury goods in Britain was 25 per cent.  Here it was almost 50 per cent greater, and in the January budget the Minister for Finance increased it by a further 10 per cent.  We now have a situation in which the VAT <Col N="1159" /> rate on luxury goods in Britain is 12½ per cent and here it is three times as great.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, we have a situation in which the highest level of tax on income existing in Europe applies here, and I say that despite the fact that Deputy O'Malley a few minutes ago excluded Britain.  The rate of tax in Britain is higher than ours but the threshold before reaching the top level in Britain is almost double that applicable here.  Inevitably, this all has its effect on the generation of wealth, of prosperity and the creation of work; and yet the Minister for Finance in this House last January had the nerve to say we must rely on the private sector more than the public sector.</P>
    <P>Our rate of inflation for the first quarter of this year is the highest we have reached so far and yet for 1975 we had a net fall in our GNP of 3 per cent.  That brings me to comments made outside this party by concerned individuals.  Deputy O'Malley quoted what was said by the chairman of Coras Tráchtála.  Others representing public bodies have commented along similar lines and one of the most noticeable recently was the Director General of FUE.  Prior to the talks that took place a few weeks ago he was asked what was the main cause of employer-labour problems and he said it was the Government's fiscal policy.  Nobody in the position of a responsible businessman will make a comment of that kind, which would appear to be political but is not, unless he is absolutely satisfied that it is correct.</P>
    <P>I do not know how a responsible Opposition can alert public opinion to the serious consequences of Government policy as we have seen it.  Perhaps one of the best illustrations would be to compare the inflation rate for West Germany for the whole of 1975, 5¼ per cent, with the rise in the cost-of-living index here for the first three months of this year, 7.3 per cent.  An illustration of the difference in approach to the creation of employment lies in the interesting fact that the rate of tax here on enterprise at its top level is 75p in the £. In West Germany it is 45p.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> To return to the increase in the cost-of-living index this year, we have been accustomed to hearing Ministers explaining away the difficulties of the last year or two by saying outside sources are mainly responsible.  Speaking in January last the Leader of this party, referring to the fresh taxes imposed then and now being enacted in this Bill, estimated that they would increase the index figure by 5.8 per cent, and we were not including the recent increase in value-added tax, a follow-up of the budget.  Therefore our current increase in inflation&mdash;a rate that should apply to a full year, not to a quarter&mdash;is not due to the increase in the price of oil or to any external source but to additional taxes imposed by the Minister for Finance to provide a necessary revenue return to justify further borrowing.  This year I hope we will not hear any more from any of the Ministers who customarily sit on the benches opposite, particularly the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, justifying the situation on the grounds that external causes created our problems.</P>
    <P>In regard to our financial situation, our position, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC, which has been discussed here already by some speakers, is of considerable importance. The EEC has come under fire in recent times, not as might have been expected from the Opposition but from some Government speakers.  The most recent attack was by the Minister for Foreign Affairs a few days ago on the grounds that the better-off EEC members were not providing sufficient money in the regional and industrial spheres.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs may be justified in levelling that criticism but it is only right that we should put on record the financial facts of our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.  These facts are that in 1975 we received from the Community a total of £119 million in grants, that is free money, what we used to call in the old days &ldquo;money from America&rdquo;. At the same time we received £19 million in loans through the EEC, from the European Investment Bank, at low rates of interest.  To that must <Col N="1161" /> be added the saving in agricultural export subsidies we would have had to pay were we not members of the EEC&mdash;a figure I find impossible to calculate.  Without that sum of approximately an additional £50 million from the EEC, where would this Government be, who have got themselves into such a financial tangle.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks I doubt if there is any Deputy on this side of the House who has not been stopped in the streets and on public transport as I have been, by people I never met, asking me: &ldquo;When, in the name of God, are you going to get this crowd out?&rdquo;  The usual comment is: &ldquo;I voted for them, but never again.  For goodness sake get them out as soon as you can before they bankrupt the country&rdquo;.  Apparently that has been the prevailing feeling in recent months on the part of those who are prepared to talk.  The only reply I have been able to give is: &ldquo;You are the people who decide who will be the Government and you have got to decide when the next election comes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not mind the Parliamentary Secretary interrupting me.  I am simply pointing out what I believe to be the case now, particularly in this city, compared with what may have been believed last November by the electorate of west Mayo who at that stage may not have been as conscious of the shortcomings of the Government as are the public now.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Finance Bill the real test of financial policy in an enterprise economy is: will it encourage enterprise thereby increasing production and employment?  I believe the overall result of this Bill and its predecessors will be discouragement of enterprise, falling employment and at the same time increased expenditure and some employment in the public sector, another area that produces no real wealth.  The only areas of employment of real value to a community are industry, particularly small industries, business enterprises and farming.  I would make some exception in relation to certain semi-State companies such as NET, Ceimicí Teoranta, Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the question of deferred tax allowances to enable companies to carry forward a balance of increased cost of stock so that they might survive.  There may be some benefit here to some mammoth companies doing quite well anyway, as one can see from published returns in the newspapers.  Perhaps it is because of their very size that some of these large companies do so well. In regard to the Minister's deferred tax proposal, there are many hundreds of small companies which have been virtually brought to their knees already through inflation, by the increasing money cost of stock, and who can entertain little hope of being helped by a deferred tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> Deferment of tax is only of value to a small business if it has made a profit.  That must be contrasted with the situation of small industries and small businesses.  The Minister mentioned the cost of £3,500 per job of new jobs created.  The IDA would be unable to create these new jobs or to encourage industry to come in unless they were able to give the exceptional tax free incentives that are available to foreign companies set up here and also grants.  In contrast with the £3,500 per job a very small part of that would have been necessary to save many of the jobs that have been lost, if the Minister had devised a means whereby the increased cost of stock could be carried either by special loans or some other system. We have an extraordinary situation where the IDA is paying £3,500 per job created and at the same time the State is losing, through social welfare and unemployment, approximately £1,500 per annum per job lost.  It is clear that only a small amount per job of capital against inflation could have saved many thousands of jobs that have been lost in the past 18 months.  Fourteen thousand five hundred jobs were created last year and 27,300 jobs were lost.  It would be much cheaper to have retained many of those jobs in industry.  The Minister has not dealt with this problem.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not offer any hope to the people involved in small industries at present.  The Opposition have been criticised and I expect that at the end of this debate they will again be criticised for criticising the Minister's financial policy but the fact is that the Minister and the Government have created their own problems.  If the Minister looks at the details of the budgets for the past few years he will find that the Opposition's criticisms were valid and that the warnings that were then given have been proved true&mdash;warnings about inflation, the effects of over-borrowing and over-expenditure in non-productive areas. It is true that you cannot put an old head on young shoulders.  The people have to suffer the consequences of the luxury of teaching the Minister for <Col N="1164" /> Finance and his colleagues something about economics.  This country is now paying for the inexperience of the Minister and his colleagues and for the political naïveté of the two Coalition elements.  In the end the bills have to be paid.  No individual can last for more than a few weeks if he spends more than he has earned. Unfortunately a Government can afford to spend for a considerable time more than it has earned but eventually the chickens come home. The Minister said earlier that Ireland is facing a situation not of its own making.  I would submit that the situation is largely of this Government's making because of their fiscal policy and because the Minister and his colleagues had no idea of what was going on.</P>
    <P>They had, however, considerable success in the public relations area. Huge debts and overspending have been presented as efforts to maintain employment and to create buoyancy. The results of these efforts to create buoyancy have been an unemployment total standing at 116,000 and ever mounting debt.  We probably have not seen the end of it.  In January last year when introducing his budget, the Minister spoke of an estimated deficit of £125 million.  At the end of 1975 in the published figures was an overall deficit of £259 million, well over double the estimated deficit.  A bank would not tolerate this from a private individual. The Government have failed to lead and to give good example in this area of finance.  In 1975 they were borrowing virtually to pay for consumption, while the national output was falling and at the same time the State's salaries and wages were rising.</P>
    <P>Whatever country you live in, if you have an understanding of economics, you know you cannot have rising wages unless there is rising production in other words, unless the GNP is rising.  If you do not have that, the only result is inflation and less employment. I submit that Ireland at the moment is probably getting the worst of both worlds.  Living as we do on the edge of enterprise Europe our pseudo-socialists in Labour and, to some extent in Fine Gael are giving us a form of <Col N="1165" /> half-baked socialism, borrowing to please the voter, and this is being done in a semi-free economy where the discipline of true socialism does not exist because under the form of socialism functioning in other parts of the world the State controls salaries, wages and prices, and trade unions have a community function in place of an industrial bargaining role.  In free countries everyone has to compromise and make sacrifices for the common good.  Under socialism carried to its logical conclusion all have to conform because they have no choice.</P>
    <P>One of the outstanding examples of a bad fiscal policy in a country of this size is the increase in the tax on cars, petrol and car hire.  These increases are for the purpose of raising revenue in the easiest way possible.  The Minister for Finance, when he was questioned on this in relation to the budget, admitted this.  The purpose is to pay for Government expenditure without regard for the social and disemployment consequences.  Hardly one penny of these increased taxes can be seen as directed towards growth and development in the economy.  Mark you, I would justify increased taxes of this kind if that were the purpose but not one penny can be seen as going towards the original purpose of a tax on cars, which was the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the increase in the price of petrol are not yet calculable. When the Minister spoke about these taxes he referred to what he described as areas of choice.  I would like to know where the area of choice is for the motorist who has to have a car to travel to his job because public transport is not available.  I would like to know where the area of choice is for doctors, veterinary surgeons, for religious, for teachers or for farmers. In the increased tax on transport, an area in which the Minister was sure of getting his millions, there are two direct consequences, namely, further disemployment or a demand for increased wages to pay for the additional cost of transport.</P>
    <P>I would concede that, when the Minister speaks of areas of choice, he is correct when talking about drink&mdash; some people believe it is a necessity; the Deputy sitting on my left does not <Col N="1166" /> touch it so he would not regard it as a necessity.  Smoking is probably an area of choice.  So far as tourists are concerned they have a choice because they do not have to come in here and spend their money here.</P>
    <P>There is a new feature in this Finance Bill.  The Minister has conceived the idea that, because there are so many car tax dodgers, the right way to deal with the problem is to tax all cars for the entire year irrespective of whether or not they are in use.  This is the lazy man's way of going about the job.  If there are 40,000 tax evaders using cars as the Minister stated, at a cost of £4 million a year it is the Minister and the servants of the State who are responsible for failure in dealing with that position.  The Minister said there were 40,000 prosecutions last year.  I believe this provision is an injustice against the hardworking, thrifty head of a family who is able by some effort to provide a car for, perhaps, three months during the summer, or even six months, to take his family out. Now, in order to catch the tax evader, the Minister will make him pay for that car for the full year irrespective of whether or not he can afford to use it. This is bound to have its social consequence. If he has not got a car and if public transport is not available, there is very little he can do for his family during the holiday period.  He will certainly have a sense of grievance and a good reason for getting shut of the car altogether thereby depriving himself and his family of a very valuable social amenity.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have spoken of the record of borrowing and deficit.  It is frightening to think that in the first 50 years of the life of this State the total amount of national debt up to 31st December, 1972, was £1,259 million and that in the period from 1st April, 1973, to the end of this year the increase in the national debt is estimated to be in excess of £3,000 million and in the current year the estimated net deficit on expenditure, according to the Minister, will be £327 million.</P>
    <P>In the past the Minister spoke of three vital requirements.  The first was to reduce price inflation.  This was a promise the Coalition made <Col N="1167" /> three years ago.  Look where we are now.  One of the means adopted to do this was to over-borrow which, itself, caused inflation.  The authorities I quote for this, apart from ourselves, are the Central Bank and the EEC, who advised us against this policy.  The correct means of handling a borrowing policy is to keep borrowing within a reasonable percentage of overall expenditure.  The second requirement was to give priority to safeguarding employment.  As I said before, I believe the Minister has been justifying a deficit on these grounds and, at the same time, unemployment has increased.  The third requirement was to limit the growth of public expenditure.  The Government are only now beginning to pull back after a great deal of damage has been done.  One of the reasons the Minister was compelled to pull back is because it would not have been possible to borrow the £150 million the EEC sanctioned recently if State expenditure were not curbed.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister said that we must rely on private enterprise even more than on the public sector.  I agree with him but I wonder if he is using the kind of phraseology which finds public approval but is not acting on it.  With the increased taxes in many areas there has not been any dynamic or dramatic proposal to inject into the private area the necessary funds to help develop that area and reduce unemployment.  Additional taxation would be justifiable for this purpose and for this purpose only.  At best, the high level of spending and taxation have caused inflation, reduced living standards, kept some people in jobs but by inflation reduced employment in the private sector, the real productive creator of wealth.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill is a useful means for measuring the level of incentive&mdash;or lack of it&mdash;to create prosperity and provide employment for the increasing number of people coming off the land and young people leaving school who need employment, being provided by the Government in office.  The provision of jobs and means of making a livelihood are the primary responsibilities of Governments, in addition to providing day-to-day Government.  This is not being done under this Bill. Judged in the light of the present needs of our economy and of our people, and the need for a vigorous enterprise in expansion, this Finance Bill, like previous Coalition Finance Bills, fails to encourage what is necessary; indeed, it does the reverse.  In my view, the Minister and the Government are going backwards and bringing the economy with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Coalition's fiscal policy we have now arrived at a new situation.  Continuous failure by the Government to provide incentives and the leadership that will encourage expansion and prosperity&mdash;together with their appalling record of borrowing and non-productive public expenditure, thereby encouraging inflation &mdash;have, I believe, destroyed the confidence of the community in this Administration.  That confidence, <Col N="1169" /> which is essential to progress in our economy, can only be restored by a change to an Administration that in the past proved their ability to give leadership and inspire confidence.  In the fifties and sixties that Administration showed a record of positive progress and growth in the economy. The sooner the electorate get the opportunity to vote for that new Administration the better for this country and its future, and particularly for those leaving school who will need jobs.</P>

      <P>Inevitably in a debate of this kind, the picture of the economy, its prospects and progress as seen from the Opposition benches must be somewhat different from how it is presented from the Government benches.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brugha in the latter end of his speech was, I felt, being selective. The picture he drew is one of unremitting gloom which does not reflect the reality of our situation. There are a number of aspects of our economic situation today and of the way in which it is moving as a result of Government policies that are encouraging, but are not getting as much attention as they should.  Perhaps it is the fault of this side of the House for not bringing out these aspects of the situation.  I am not suggesting for a moment that we do not face great economic difficulties; of course we do.  I do not want to diminish the difficulties we face or the very serious inflationary problems we have had, their impact on Government finances and Government taxation policies.  In all these areas, the world economic situation and its overflow effects on us, have had adverse effects which are undoubted and grave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question we must ask ourselves is this.  Within the context of the world situation, in which we are in the lee, and very closely linked to the British economy, has our performance, in comparison with that of other countries and in the light of our close links with the British economy with all its weaknesses, been as bad as the Opposition say, or has <Col N="1170" /> it perhaps, in a number of respects, been somewhat better?  At this stage we can see some signs of recovery here which reflect, perhaps in part, the beginnings of a recovery in other parts of the world, but which significantly reflect the impact of Government policies.  If we look, for example, at the situation with regard to prices and wages it is by no means as gloomy as the Opposition suggest. The fact is that as a result of the measures taken by the budget in June last year, the increase that took place in prices in the second six months of last year was only 2 per cent.  Of course, we have had in the last prices figure a bigger increase, partly because it reflects the impact of a budget and the indirect tax increases in the budget, to which I shall return, and partly because of other factors which have given a bit of a boost to prices at that point.  Nonetheless, to have achieved in the second half of 1975 a price increase as low as 2 per cent is, I think, without parallel in western Europe.  I cannot, offhand, think of any country in other parts of the world which has a similar achievement to its credit and because this was closely linked to the renegotiation of the national wage round in which we secured the co-operation of the trade unions, which is of vital importance in these matters, the increase in wages over this period has been only 2.8 per cent.  It has to be said that that followed a period when there was very rapid wage inflation and the impact of the previous national wage agreement and its closing stages on wages and costs was very great indeed.</P>
    <P>We suffered in the first half of 1975 from a very high rate of inflation but since then, both in terms of prices and wages in the second half of last year, the performance of this country was by any standards exemplary.  The result has been that taking the last 12 months, taking the good with the bad, taking the bad period in the early part of 1975 and the good period in the second half, our inflation rate has been notably lower than that in the United Kingdom.  The figures for the 12 months to February show a 16 per cent rate of growth in prices here. <Col N="1171" /> That is a drop of more than a third of the figure for the nine months earlier.  It compares with the United Kingdom figure of 23 per cent.  Those figures include the impact of indirect taxes in the different budgets.  If you exclude them, the comparisons in some respects are even more favourable.</P>
    <P>Some economic commentators have recently been talking as if this 16 per cent increase in consumer prices is a measure of our competitiveness in world markets.  This is not the case because this reflects the increase to consumers in the cost of an average package of goods they buy, including the tax increases in the recent budget. That is not a measure of industrial costs.  I have not got a precise measure of industrial costs ready to hand but given the fact that during the second half of last year, when the increase in wages was 2.8 per cent and even allowing for the heavy increase in import prices, the increase in industrial costs must have been something much nearer to 10 per cent than to 16 per cent over the last 12 months.  One might measure it, perhaps, very crudely&mdash;it would be a crude measurement and, perhaps, one that would exaggerate it somewhat&mdash; by taking the consumer price increase over this period, exclusive of taxes. That would work out at approximately 12½ per cent.  That is not an accurate measure of the increase in industrial costs which are influenced by things other than consumer prices but it is probably a figure of a similar order of magnitude, although, perhaps, the true figure for industrial costs increase over the year is somewhat lower.  My guess is that it would be between 10 per cent and 12 per cent but I have not got the precise figures and I have not done the calculations necessary to give the House something which I would regard as authoritative.  Certainly the figure 16 per cent increase in the consumer price index is no measure at all of the increase in industrial costs, which has been very much lower.</P>
    <P>That is in terms of our own currency but for reasons outside our control our currency linked to sterling has been depreciating and has depreciated by about <Col N="1172" /> 7½ per cent over the last couple of weeks alone.  In terms of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain undoubtedly our position has markedly improved.  The consumer price index figure gives one a good measurement of that but it is not a true measurement of industrial costs differences.  Certainly in the past 12 months our industrial costs have risen much less than in Britain and our competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain has certainly improved.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the world the combination of the devaluation effect which, of course, is equal and identical in the case of Ireland and Britain, with the lower domestic industrial costs increase here our competitiveness in terms of selling to countries outside Britain must have moved at a rate which bears favourable comparison with almost any country.  Again, I have not the precise figures but it is very hard to see how, given the combination of the devaluation effect and our significantly better domestic cost increase in the case of the United Kingdom, our competitive position could not have improved very much over this period. It has improved in relation to other countries where costs have arisen more sharply.</P>
    <P>We are now getting the first results of this in the recovery in manufactured exports of which there are already signs in the first couple of months of this year, a harbinger I hope of a significant improvement during the rest of the year.  Figures can be very misleading and one must interpret them carefully but the reality behind the figures is more favourable than would appear at first sight.  Of course, this is only part of the story because it is not just what has happened that matters but what will happen.  The achievements of this period, during which prices have kept down and wages have risen by a very small amount, indeed, in response to the small price increases, are capable of being destroyed if we fail to reach a satisfactory outcome in the negotiations currently in progress.  I hope and believe that we will reach such an outcome. The importance for employment is so great and so evident that the trade unions, with their great sense of responsibility <Col N="1173" /> in relation to matters of employment, are, I am convinced, anxious to find a solution which, on the one hand, will meet the legitimate needs, requirements and desires of their members and, on the other hand, will ensure the safeguarding of employment.</P>
    <P>With the achievements of the second half of last year behind us, in terms of improved competitiveness, reduction in the rate of costs and prices, we are now in a position to take real advantage of this and to come through this year with a significant improvement in the employment situation if we can now negotiate, or if there can now be agreed, by one method or another, increases in wages which will be moderate and appropriate to the needs of our employment situation.  This must be our hope.  I know that the Opposition share the Government's hope in this respect and would wish those negotiations to succeed and would wish them well.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation has been significantly less unfavourable than people have made out.  Of course, it grew very sharply, alarmingly and tragically during much of 1975, from the autumn of 1974 to the autumn of 1975.  The increase was much less in percentage terms than in most other countries.  In fact, it is hard to find any other country where the percentage increase in unemployment during this critical period was as low as here. Nonetheless, because our unemployment started at a high level, and has always been at a high level, even a low percentage increase relative to other countries is a big increase in real terms. It is big in terms of the number of percentage points and it raises unemployment to a disturbingly high level.  We should not attempt to disguise that fact.  That is central to all our policies. It must be the central preoccupation of the Government, the Opposition, trade unions and employers alike.</P>
    <P>During the winter months, while you get the usual seasonal increase in unemployment, followed by a seasonal decrease which we have had in the last month or six weeks, the underlying trend of unemployment in this period has not by any means been unfavourable. <Col N="1174" /> I have not got an accurate figure for the end of March period. When we have that it may show some slight adjustment but basically over the period from September to March seasonally adjusted figures will show virtually no increase in unemployment. I think the increase over six months would be no more than 2 per cent and I am not convinced it is necessarily quite as high as that.  The big push in the growth of unemployment occurred between the autumn of 1974 and 1975.  Since September, 1975, there has been no significant increase in the underlying trend of unemployment measured in seasonally adjusted figures.  That is an achievement that has not been matched in every country. It is true that in some countries unemployment has begun to fall but it is by no means universal.  For a country whose growth in employment in terms of percentage increase was as low as ours, to have reached the point where unemployment virtually ceased to rise as early as September, 1975, well in advance of the general world recovery, is itself an achievement and one that reflects on the success of the Government's management of the economy in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>Since the middle of last year our performance in wages, prices, unemployment and in competitiveness has been remarkably good in extremely difficult circumstances.  We have recovered a good deal of the ground lost in the period before then because of the impact which the previous national wage round made on our costs, because of the impact of the world economic crisis and the vast increase in import prices on our costs. Much of the ground has been recovered and a firm basis has been laid on which we can build, in co-operation with the trade unions, with a view to securing a significant improvement in the employment situation in the 12 months ahead.</P>
    <P>The budget must be seen against this background.  Of course, any budget is open to criticism because necessarily a budget involves making choices, choices of policies and, so far as taxes have to be made, it involves choices <Col N="1175" /> between taxes.  There is no infallible guide to this and any Government may take a different view to that of another Government.  Any commentator may legitimately have a different view from another commentator regarding what is best to do.  I am sure if I were in Opposition I could make criticisms of the balance of this budget and probably I would do so.  It is the job of the Opposition to seek out any chinks there may be.</P>
    <P>Basically, one has to face the fact that choices have to be made.  There are only two arguments of a broad kind that the Opposition can use. They can say they would have handled the budget differently or they can say they would not have got into the position from which we started when we framed the budget.  The latter is always a much safer kind of argument and I think I may have used it myself.  However, I do not think one can let the matter rest at that because one would have to consider what exactly Fianna Fáil would have done or not have done had they been in Government last year.  There are only a limited number of key things they could have done, different from what the Government have done, that would have affected significantly the starting point for the budget.  I will list them and if the Opposition want to add to the list I should be glad to accept any appropriate interruptions to that effect.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the kind of action they might have taken would be, first, to reject last year's national wage agreement.  Arguably that might have been done.  Because of the way prices went and the measure of indexation involved, the agreement turned out to be extremely costly.  They could make a case for having refused to participate in it and allowed a free-for-all. Even with hindsight, I think the balance of advantage lay with accepting the agreement although I must say that aspects of the agreement were formulated in a manner that seemed to take inadequate account of the particular needs of the public sector.  However, that is another day's work.  I wonder if <Col N="1176" /> Fianna Fáil are really saying that we should have rejected the agreement last year?</P>
    <P>They could also say they would have accepted the agreement but that they simply would not have paid the increases under the agreement or under the various arbitration awards to the public service.  If we had not paid those awards and increases our budgetary position would have been enormously better coming into the present year.  A large part of our problems derived from the carry-over effect of national wage rounds and of special negotiations with the public sector and to the ordinary incremental system which is a feature of the public sector that is not widely matched in the private sector.  The cumulative effect of these was to face us with the burden of additional expenditure last year, which, leaving everything else on one side, vastly exceeded the buoyancy of revenue.</P>
    <P>There was also an increase in debt service because of the situation in the previous year which also absorbed the whole of the buoyancy of revenue. Therefore, the buoyancy was absorbed twice over by these two items.  The Opposition could say that they would not have paid the public service pay claims, although I have not heard them say that.  It is arguable that it was unwise to take on these obligations and to have entered into the agreements.  On the whole I think the Government were right to honour the agreements and not to attempt to break them at that time.  I doubt if we would have had public support for a move of that kind and to my knowledge the Opposition have not suggested it.  It does not seem a way they would have taken to avoid starting from where we started.</P>
    <P>Would they have cut back further Government services?  Perhaps they might.  In the current year we cut significantly non-pay services where it could be done without affecting employment. The Opposition may argue they would have done this somewhat earlier.  However, I have not heard them argue that with any specificity, that is, I have not heard them say what they would have cut last year <Col N="1177" /> that we have not cut this year.  If anything they are complaining about the cuts we have made rather than suggesting they should have been made earlier.</P>
    <P>They could argue, perhaps, that they would not have increased social welfare payments.  Much that has been said from the Opposition benches about social welfare carries with it a remarkably right-wing tinge that is somewhat anomalous for a party which historically played a significant role, particularly in the thirties, in radically improving social welfare.  Is it the case that these hints from the Opposition benches regarding excessive social welfare payments mean they would not have increased old age pensions and widows pensions as we did, that they would not have introduced the new services for unmarried mothers, for prisoners' wives, for spinsters aged 58 years and over?  Is this what they are saying?  If it is, in honesty they should say it more bluntly and openly than they have done up to now.</P>
    <P>Unless the Opposition say we should have done, and that they would have done, some or all of these things, or perhaps something else I have not thought of, we must accept that if the Government were right in not doing them&mdash;and that is my contention&mdash;we started in a budget situation where there was a very large gap that had to be bridged.  The Opposition have criticised the level of borrowing and clearly they are not suggesting we should have borrowed more.  Rather they seem to be suggesting we should have borrowed less.  In view of the deficit situation we faced, if we were to borrow no more than we borrowed, that would involve increases in taxation and cuts in non-pay services that do not involve employment elements and this we have undertaken.</P>
    <P>Of course, we could have chosen to cut somewhat different things.  The Opposition may have a point in their criticisms of the cuts we have made because these are matters of choice.  However, a responsible Opposition would require that in suggesting that certain things should not have been cut, or that we should have borrowed less, that the alternative cuts should be sketched <Col N="1178" /> in.  If, on the other hand, it is felt that these cuts are acceptable, the question arises regarding taxation.  Is it the Opposition's contention that we should have cut more and increased taxation to a lesser extent, or that we should have cut less and increased taxation to a greater extent?  There seems to be a certain ambivalence on the Opposition benches between these two alternatives.</P>
    <P>I think that the cuts we made were very significant.  On the whole they were well-judged and they managed to do something that I do not recall any other Government doing for a long time past, namely, to hold down in real terms slightly below the previous year's level the cost of non-pay services in real terms.  That is a real, difficult and painful achievement and to do it without cutting into services that give employment is extremely difficult.  The range of manoeuvre of Governments is small, as was said by one or two of the heads of Government at the recent European Council meeting.  The actual margin any Government can play with is small because most Government expenditure is pre-empted by commitments that cannot be changed.</P>
    <P>On the taxation side we were left with the situation where, having made the cuts and feeling we could not cut further without affecting employment, we had to find £100 million in taxation. Again, the Opposition may have criticism regarding the package of taxation.  I think they should be more specific in their criticisms.  The choice lay broadly between direct and indirect taxation.  A case can be made for more direct taxation, for saying that the right thing to do would have been to increase income tax by increasing the present surcharges or by some other means and not to have increased indirect taxes as much.  If that had been done, we would not have had the same increase in the consumer price index.  It would have looked better and would certainly have left us less open to criticism about the rate of increase in the consumer price index from the Opposition.  But would it have been the right thing to do, given that direct tax, income tax had been increased by the surcharge in the previous <Col N="1179" /> year?  Would it have been wise to increase them further?  It would be interesting to hear the Opposition on that, to hear if they think that is what we should have done, that we should have raised the bulk of the £100 million by increasing income tax.  A very respectable argument could be made for that and I would listen attentively if the Opposition were to make that argument.  We chose indirect taxation and tried to pick those items which would, first, produce the necessary yield and, secondly, be least painful.  We do not claim that they are not painful, that all of them are mere luxuries&mdash;far from it.  It was not possible to raise the kind of money required by taxing what are rightly or wrongly regarded as luxuries, drink and tobacco.</P>
    <P>It was also necessary to increase VAT and the tax on petrol.  The money could not have been raised if his had not been done.  If the Opposition feel that the particular package we chose was not the best, they are entitled to say so and, perhaps, have a duty to tell us what their package would have been.  A debate on those lines would be useful and enlightening. But, perhaps, it is not in the tradition of the House to debate the budget in that way and, perhaps, it is unreasonable to expect that the Opposition would meet all these issues head on.  It may be wiser for them&mdash; perhaps Oppositions always tend to do this&mdash;to dance around the surface hitting here and there but never actually putting forward a consistent counter thesis which, if it were to be consistent and add up to a budget that would bridge the gaps involved, might be a very unpopular alternative.</P>
    <P>Just as the Opposition are entitled to dance across the surface of the water like a dragonfly in this way we are entitled to point out the inadequacy of that sort of criticism and to put forward the thesis that we could not easily, without great pain and damage to the economy, have avoided finding ourselves in the position in which we were in formulating this budget and that in that position the overall balance of the budget is <Col N="1180" /> about right and that we have heard no arguments to suggest that it should have been different, arguments putting forward a cohesive, consistent counter-thesis.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, I believe the budget was broadly appropriate to the needs of the situation which I wish had been otherwise.  Certainly, the condition of the world's economies today and the situation in which Britain and ourselves have been left is one which nobody would wish to face, one we never thought we would face and one which I hope we shall never face again.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the progress we made in the second half of last year and of our hopes that this progress can be maintained by close co-operation between trade unions and employers and that the discussions now going on will lead to some constructive outcome.  That this is very necessary is quite evident and was brought home very much to all of us at the European Council meeting last week.  There has been much criticism of that meeting for not producing any concrete results, and this is broadly valid.  Some of us did not expect it to produce very concrete results and we are correspondingly not so disappointed. Given that we did not expect much from it, I was favourably impressed by the quality of the economic discussion.</P>
    <P>When we met in Rome in December there was some discussion on the economic and social situation which I found thoroughly depressing and in certain respects rather boring.  Nothing was said that seemed to do more than skim the surface of reality.  This time people were talking about real issues and there was serious discussion. I do not suggest that everybody had turned over a new leaf and that all were converts to united Community action to solve our problems&mdash;there is a very long way to go before that point is reached&mdash;but at least there was a real discussion and I think everybody there felt the better of it.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to see how people responded to it, how when some heads of Government put very forcibly the economic realities, the others accepted <Col N="1181" /> them, uncomfortable as they were. There was no attempt by people to avoid their responsibilities.  The British and Italian economies and our own, so clearly linked to Britain, are the three which are, in present circumstances, least well placed and have the highest rates of inflation.  I think the reaction of the leaders of these Governments was constructive and positive. There was acceptance that we have a big task ahead.  We must get our inflation rates down in harmony with those of other member countries if we are not to find ourselves in a perpetual losing race, incomes and employment losing ground and finding ourselves left behind in a way which will threaten the future of the Community eventually, its solidarity and the benefits&mdash; great as they have been&mdash;that we have secured by our membership.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the countries that have high inflation rates to take the necessary action; the onus is on the others to help us&mdash;as, indeed has been done by conceding the Community loan&mdash;and by adopting economic policies that will be more reflationary and less concerned with building of vast reserves for individual countries and more concerned with achieving economic growth in the whole Community. The onus is on us to play our part and although our inflation rate has been reduced now to a level so much below that of Britain, it is still far too high and still well above the rates of countries such as France where they have found themselves unable to keep their currency in the Snake.  It is about three times the inflation rate of Germany.  The German Chancellor was able to tell us that wage increases in Germany in the year ahead would be of the order of 5½ or 6 per cent&mdash;including certain fringe benefits, 6 per cent.  That is what we are up against. Either we compete with that and get our inflation rates down to this sort of level or we find ourselves with Britain in a perpetual state of devaluation, perpetually having our prices pushed up by the price of imported goods rising because of devaluation and never able to catch up.</P>
    <P>We have our chance now.  The basis was laid by what was done in the <Col N="1182" /> second half of last year.  If the negotiations now produce a good result, it may be possible for us to begin to come out of these difficulties and lay the foundation for the kind of economic growth needed in the years ahead if we are ever to get unemployment down to the level that people here would regard as acceptable.  That is not easy.  It is not just a question of getting through the crisis and at the end of it finding ourselves in a better position than before.  If anything, when the crisis is over we and the other European countries will all find ourselves with a higher rate of structural unemployment. We will find that many workers who in that vivid phrase have been shaken out of various industries in this crisis will not find employment. The level of unemployment in a boom condition two years hence may be much higher in every country than it was previously.  There is a technological revolution problem which we have not yet faced which may mean radical changes in policies here and elsewhere.  These things must be faced and can be faced if we can get through our difficulties at this stage.</P>
    <P>If we can agree on a solution to the problem of incomes in the year ahead, then we have the chance to build on that foundation and try to tackle the problem of structural unemployment. It will not be solved in one or two years.  It will not be solved in the lifetime of this Government.  The next Government&mdash;I believe it will be us&mdash; will be lucky if they have it substantially resolved at the end of a further term of office.  It is a long-term problem.  With our relatively high birth rate and the increasing number of people coming on the labour market in the years ahead, the problem will be more difficult than elsewhere and that has to be faced.  We have a much higher dependency ratio and every worker has to support many more dependants than workers in other countries.  That is a major problem.</P>
    <P>We have the problem which Deputy de Valera's father was always conscious of, the problem of a republic faced with demand for imperial standards, because we were part of the United Kingdom at one time.  In the <Col N="1183" /> nineteenth century that cost us money, we subsidised them but, in the early years of this century, the balance was switched a little.  We left at a time when we could do so without any great loss to our economy, without having to give up massive subsidies.  We got out in time but, nevertheless, the demonstration effect, because of the transparency of our economy with that of Britain, remains and our people have come to expect the living standards, the social service standards and the standards of every kind of service and facility they see in neighbouring Britain.  Britain, by European standards, is not a rich country but it is sufficiently richer than us to create pressures on us to achieve standards which at our present levels of output we cannot attain.</P>
    <P>We must face the reality that we cannot have under every heading the same kind of standards as exist in other countries nearby at this stage of our development.  To seek to achieve this would be to wreck our economy and our prospects of ever catching up.  Those prospects exist. This country has a development potential, the ability to grow at a rate as fast as and faster than most of the other member states.  Given half a chance it will do so but it will require a difficult and tough period during which there will be no easy let up in the efforts we have to make and the constraints and disciplines we have to accept if we are going to achieve that objective.  That all lies ahead of us.</P>
    <P>The present problems are the wage negotiations and the sorting out of incomes, coping with structural unemployment and building up to a growth rate that will equal and excel that of our neighbours so that we may catch up with them in material standards. If we do I hope we will put the extra resources to good use and not fritter them away on even higher standards and personal material consumption. That is not what we need the money for.  We need it for our poor, to raise standards of education, for cultural and social purposes and not just to buy more material goods.  In that also a lead must be given.  What I have <Col N="1184" /> said there is also in keeping with some of the things Deputy de Valera's father used say from time to time.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not deal with the criticism of the Council of Ministers by the Commission in regard to the spending of the Community's funds.  Some members of the Commission criticised the Council of Ministers for their handling of Community funds.  Would the Minister care to comment on that criticism?  I only heard of this in the last 24 hours and, perhaps, the Minister is not aware of it.</P>

      <P>I would have expected the Minister, in intervening in this debate, to have dealt with the financial implications of the EEC conditions attaching to their loan which is a very big part of the financial picture at present on which the Minister has challenged us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not deal with that because when I was asked a question about this by another Opposition Deputy last week I gave a detailed <Col N="1185" /> answer.  Naturally, I did not wish to go over the whole ground again today. I made the point last week that these conditions represented the Government's own policy determination as to what is necessary to be done.  The Commission were glad to accept the Government's own policy formulation and policy decisions as adequate disciplines of constraints for our economy. Therefore, the conditions posed no problems for us because the origin of them was on our side rather than on the Commission's side.  That is the burden of the reply I gave last week.</P>

      <P>Indeed, and the loan represents part of the help.  Our efforts to get inflation down and to cut back on the amount of Government borrowing over a period of years are all part of the self discipline we must impose on ourselves and which the Community, naturally, accepts as being the right policy for us to pursue.</P>

      <P>As the years go by, we listen to bigger financial talk; we hear talk of hundreds of millions and thousands of millions but we must recognise that we are a small country of a little more than three million souls. It is confusing for people to read about growth rate and increased employment all over Europe and compare that to the millions we are spending here.  The ordinary person is worried how all these things affect him and how the country is being run.  There is a lack of confidence in the Government and the people think we are going in the wrong direction.  Government policies are not geared in the right direction and in many cases they have no policies at all.  Our people are flabbergasted when they hear about the millions we are borrowing and are worried when they see how much it will cost to service our national debt.  They expected this budget would provide employment and reduce the dole queues.  Emigration has almost come to a standstill and it should be <Col N="1186" /> remembered that it was under a Fianna Fáil Government we had the first population increase here for many years.  We do not know whether the population is going up or down at present because we did not have a census.</P>
      <P>We have been told it would cost too much money to have a census.  Many people say the Government are not willing to have a census because they would find out whether the people are better off or worse off.  They are afraid the answer would be completely against the Government.  We have been told it would cost £1.5 million to have a census. I expected the Minister for Finance to refer to this when introducing the Bill because the Finance Bill should be all about laying plans based on the present position.  If a census had been held we would know what the position is and that is essential because the habits of our people are changing very quickly these days.</P>
      <P>A Finance Bill is an instrument through which we should be able to discuss policy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke at length on many matters and he trotted out figure after figure.  He had a very quickly prepared script as a result of Deputy Brugha commenting on the fact that nobody from the Government side had spoken. He was articulate as usual but like other Government spokesmen he just asked us what we would propose in present circumstances.  We said some years ago the Coalition Government would not work and the correctness of that is evident to all.  They have had a go and it is backward we have been going as a nation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs told us we are close to recovery.  I heard that from Government speakers at the end of 1974 when they told us the depression was ending and that the good days were coming shortly.  In fact things have become worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs sits at the same Cabinet table as the Tánaiste and surely he heard what he had to say at a reception at Cork Airport last weekend.  The Tánaiste said the bubble had burst.  We all know that, but the point is he is second in command in the Government.  He said nobody <Col N="1187" /> could expect a return to the living standards of the sixties.  We have had other Government speakers saying our people are better off and that they should be thankful to them.  The Tánaiste made a similar statement at his annual conference and he got a standing ovation for it.  He would not get it now.  He and the Minister for Finance seem to be at loggerheads as to what the future holds for us.</P>
    <P>Our people had been looking forward to getting good health services, better social welfare benefits, better education for our children and a good agricultural policy.  The budget and this Bill have failed lamentably in all these fields.  All the extra taxation the Government have put on is causing further unemployment and it is hard to understand why the Government do not see this.  They have got at the agricultural community to whom we owe so much as a nation.  Our national debt is running at £3,000 million and it is costing £320 million to service it each year.  When we left office after 50 years of native Government the national debt was only £130 million.  Now we have this massive borrowing with no hope of paying it back.  This year it is intended to borrow £679 million.</P>
    <P>A Government spokesman said recently to friends of mine that the Government would keep going until October, 1977, which I doubt, and that they would by then have discovered gas and oil riches off our coasts to pay for better social welfare benefits and so on.</P>

      <P>There is no talk about providing work for people who are genuinely willing and able to do it. There is no incentive in this Bill for the thrifty, the people who would like to put away a little nest egg for the rainy day.  There is no money left in their pockets after they have paid anything up to 48p in the £ in income tax.  This Bill provides no incentive to save.  A couple of years ago the Minister for Finance got rid of the £70 per person allowed as bank interest or dividends from investment.  The bank <Col N="1188" /> managers at that time said it would cause millions of pounds belonging to small investors to leave the country and the Minister and his colleagues thought better of it and reversed the decision.</P>
      <P>My suggestion is that people should be allowed to enjoy the tax free interest on at least £4,500 saved and put into a bank or otherwise invested. Money is still leaving the country today.  The Minister for Finance should know that.  The Minister for Justice says he is aware of it from his colleagues in the legal profession who have people coming to them asking where they should invest their money in order not to pay tax on the dividends.  If that limit were raised to £4,500 or £6,000, small investors would invest their money here.  Many of them would then obtain loans, build houses, buy extras, thereby creating employment.  There is no incentive in that direction at present.  I refer to the thrifty person who wants to build up a nest-egg for the rainy day.  It would also enable young people to save money for their own homes.  Budgets or Government speakers never seem to refer now to the person who genuinely wants work or to be thrifty.  They are completely nailed from one Finance Bill to another.</P>
      <P>All this raising of money can lead to many strange situations, the most dangerous of which is that the people from whom we borrow could take over control of this country.  For example, the EEC laid down very stringent conditions for our last loan from them and they are now telling us what to do.  If we continue along those lines, we will lose control of our own destiny and management of our own affairs.  That would be the end of this country as a nation&mdash;it would be mortgaged completely whether to the EEC, the Arab nations or any others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no fun nowadays for young married people rearing families with the financial weight already around their necks.  In this country it was always acknowledged that a child was born with original sin.  Now they have this <Col N="1189" /> financial sin.  I do not think a person and a couple of sponsors will get rid of the second one.  Such children know, when they go to school, or get their first job, the State will have to take back so much money from them expended during the years they were still in the cradle.  I have a young family myself and that is how I see it.  In this Finance Bill I notice that there is no increase at all granted in respect of children's allowances.  Does the Minister imply that all fathers and mothers are wealthy enough to provide for their own children?  Certainly, they are not.  It costs a lot of money nowadays to rear a family and nourish them properly.  There should have been an increase in the children's allowances, to be paid to the mother of the family, which is now the law, in order to keep pace with inflation and the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In budget speeches&mdash;and I listened to the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash; newspaper articles and so on there is always the comment made that wage increases are the cause of inflation one way or another.  It is quite obvious that wage increases are not the cause of inflation at present.  The last document we received about the increase in the cost of living showed that it had risen by 7.3 per cent in the last quarter.  If that rate continues over the year as a whole, then our rate of inflation will run at approximately 29 per cent or 30 per cent, a shocking increase.  There have not been great increases in wages as the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated.  Yet there has been a huge increase in the cost of living.  Is it not obvious that, despite what anybody may say about outside influence, the State, the budget and the Finance Bill now under discussion are responsible for the greater part of that 7.3 per cent.  The budget, in the way in which it will operate, will account for at least a 3 per cent or 4 per cent rise in the cost of living. Therefore, there is no point in maintaining that if workers get an increase in wages they are to blame.  Who can blame workers or anybody else seeking an increase when the State itself puts up the cost of living?  Government Ministers come in here with <Col N="1190" /> nicely prepared speeches.  They have ways and means of telling one that they are beating inflation and, with another turn of the hand, the Minister for Finance arrives, putting up the cost of living by 3 per cent or 4 per cent.  Therefore, they are operating in opposite directions.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to refer to many things mentioned in the Minister's brief. Firstly, he said he was changing the style of the brief, which is no harm. The Minister said he hoped we would regard it as both a compliment to our intelligence and literacy and a worth-while saving of parliamentary time. But I have noticed in all such briefs that there is a plug put in, the Government of the day pretending they are doing something great for which the people should be down on their knees thanking them, whereas the opposite is, in fact, taking place.</P>
    <P>Discussing taxation the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The discussion of the annual budget in terms of millions has little impact upon the individual and family considerations of each taxpayer. I would, therefore, like to illustrate the type of benefits which the typical family of parents and three children enjoy in return for payment for taxation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Firstly, he says that that family will benefit to the extent of £750 annually.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concealing a very important factor in that, which is that those three children&mdash;if they are now teenagers having completed their leaving certificate and qualified for a higher education grant; if their father holds only what would be considered now a fair job&mdash;will not qualify for higher education grants at universities.  That is the case in every local authority dealing with such grants because there has been no increase in the qualifying limit, as far as I am aware, since we left office.  Again, as far as I am aware, if one earns over £1,600 and has one child, one does not qualify for such grants at present.  We made several efforts to get the Minister for Education to approach the Minister for Finance to increase those limits.  Again, <Col N="1191" /> in respect of those three children in that category&mdash;if they live any distance from a university and have to stay in digs&mdash;it will cost £1,000 each per annum by the time books, digs, lectures and so on will have been paid.  The Minister might at least raise the qualifying limit in line with inflation.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who is familiar with the operations of local authorities, would not disagree with anybody who made such a claim to the Minister for Finance through the Minister for Education.  It is all right for somebody not affected to read such a brief and say: &ldquo;Gosh, they are coming out well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is the protection of the person and property from wrong-doers which, in the case of that family with three children, will benefit to the extent of £150, annually.  I do not know how that has been calculated.  God knows, there are more bank and train robberies at present than there ever were in the history of the State, at a time when we are supposed to have law and order.  I regret to have to record this but I feel that the problems of the Garda Síochána&mdash;financial and so on&mdash; have got something to do with it, in the way they are deployed.  I know their strength has been increased.  The Minister for Justice is present and I wish him the best of luck in any efforts he makes to rectify the situation.  The point is that it goes on and on.  We were told that there was a Government coming into power that would respect law and order.  No person can be safe travelling from one destination to another. I know it is a big problem but it is still shocking to read the newspapers and learn of all the robberies that are taking place daily.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health services it has been stated that every family benefits to the amount of £400 annually, but there has been an awful drawback and cut-down in those services.  In any country there should be health services so that each citizen can live as long as possible and not die a day earlier for the want of proper medical care.  Money has not been released to the health boards for transport for the handicapped and <Col N="1192" /> mentally retarded which they have enjoyed for many years.  I think these children are entitled to that right. They have no one to talk for them or to defend them.  It is sad for any parent who has a retarded or handicapped child to wonder what is going to happen after he or she dies.  I would like the Government to say they are entitled as a right to the transport and the services that they had heretofore.  I do not care what taxation the Minister will bring in to provide this, we will all support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great problem in regard to employment in the industrial and agriculture sectors. There has been a great exodus of workers from the land.  That has happened all over the world.  It does not cost the State much to provide a job when it comes to agriculture.  The Minister stated that it costs an average of £3,500 to provide an industrial job.  The way we are taxing some of our firms is contributing to the numbers unemployed.  There is no point in blaming the EEC for all this unemployment.  We have a lot to do with it.  Member nations can lay down rules and regulations in relation to value-added tax they put on certain goods.  When the price of petrol was raised in December, 1974 the Minister said that he wanted it to be the same price as it was in Britain.  If he did, he was forgetting at that time that value-added tax on many goods in Britain, especially for goods produced from wool, was 8 per cent.  In this country it is 20 per cent.  That 20 per cent is now a very great burden on the few plants we have which are making woollen products.</P>
      <P>The Minister met a representative of those factories and they impressed on him the burden which the State is adding to their cost when they go to sell on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 250 people employed in that industry at the moment and if it closes those people will become unemployed, the wool will have to be sold abroad and it will probably come <Col N="1193" /> back to us in some processed form or maybe not at all.  It is a native material and I would ask the Minister to reduce the value-added tax on woollen products from 20 per cent to 6 per cent. I know he will make a case that if he reduces that, he will also be reducing the amount which he has to recover from imported goods of similar design. Surely it is better to keep those people at work and to process our own raw material than to keep up the high rate of value-added tax on the product and then pay unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and redundancy to the 250 people involved and add to the long dole queues which we see at present.</P>
    <P>The case has been made not alone by Fianna Fáil but by members of the Government parties that the Minister should make an order giving this concession to that trade.  The point I want to make is that the Government do not really have to go by what is happening in other countries, they should take their own line and put on their own rates of taxation.  That was never more relevant than in the matter of value-added tax.  It has been mentioned that we are not taking proper steps to preserve jobs in many fields.  Last year in the agriculture sector we lost a great opportunity for further subsidising the price of fertilisers.  If that were done it would keep over 700 men in work in the factories.  There would be more fertiliser used.  There would have been more agricultural produce this year if this had been done.  We had a terrible year in agriculture.  While we discuss the EEC we have to bear in mind that fertiliser is subsidised on a very small scale in this country.  I could see no reason why last year that subsidy could not have been greatly increased. When this Government took office they took away the first subsidies without any directive from Brussels or elsewhere. It is often up to the member states to sort out their own affairs and they have the right to put their own levels of tax and subsidies on certain items.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill will be opposed by my party and opposed very much in many fields.  It it unfair and unjust to tax further the agricultural community <Col N="1194" /> at this time.  I am not making a case that no one should pay income tax.  It is accepted by everybody that income tax has to be paid and all sections of the community have to pay a fair and equitable share.  It has to be paid on profits and real income. Farm organisations have accepted that and any reasonable citizen will accept it.</P>
    <P>Referring to the notional taxation in operation on agricultural holdings of over £100 PLV the Minister said he had an agreement with the IFA in February, 1975, that they would go over the whole question and he received the report too late to include it in the budget.  Today he referred to the fragmentation of holdings over £100 PLV.  There may be fragmentation for very genuine reasons.  There may be fragmentation for the purpose of avoiding tax.  The changes here are designed to ensure that people cannot form limited companies or practice other forms of tax evasion.  It is very obvious the Minister intends to lift the £100 PLV and move further down within a short time.  That was in the recommendations he got but he made no reference to it today.  When he comes to reply I would like him to refer to this taxation on a notional basis on valuation and put on record what he intends to do.  Many people expect a statement from him on this matter.</P>
    <P>Speaking of fragmentation, a farmer may decide to divide his farm for the benefit of his sons.  I understand that this kind of division is subject to the consent of the Land Commission. Will it also now be subject to the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance?  Who will have the final say?  Will the Land Commission give the go ahead and, if they do, can the Minister for Finance do anything about it?  Who is the supreme authority?  I believe the Land Commission should have the last word.  The position is not too clear and farmers are anxious that it should be cleared up.  It may be a sale of land or it may be subdivision.  Can the Minister for Finance object?  That is something I want the Minister to clarify.  Is this the thin end of the <Col N="1195" /> wedge and are the Minister and the Department of Finance taking over from the Land Commission?</P>
    <P>With regard to taxing the profits of co-operative societies, it is rather interesting to watch the development of a campaign.  Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education said the intention was to get rid of road co-ops.  This is building up the case so that people will come to believe that there is something wrong going on and what the Minister proposes is right and proper. Road co-ops are not registered. Statements like the Parliamentary Secretary's just a day before the Finance Bill are ill-timed and do no good.  There are people who do not understand what is involved.  The Minister's intention is to catch the profits made by agricultural or fishery co-operatives.</P>
    <P>Urban dwellers may not understand that if a co-operative goes into general goods or acts as a builders' provider it is taxed in the same way as any limited company.  Even the sale of butter is taxed.  Profits on sales at the end of the year are subject to tax.  I take it the Minister is trying to sell the idea that he is doing the right thing and it is time to nail these fellow who had an unfair advantage over the small shopkeeper.  Remember, the profits of co-operatives are limited.</P>
    <P>The co-operative movement has been in operation for quite some time. It evolved out of farmers and fishermen being unable to make a living and, not alone that, but they were exploited by big firms, mostly foreign based firms.  They decided to form co-operatives. Their history is a proud one.  People came together locally to sponsor their own society and keep out the big man who would gobble them up.  They were entitled to profits but, if this Minister for Finance gets his way, there will be no more profits and no advantage one way or the other.  Nobody gets rich in a co-operative society.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle represents a rural constituency and he knows the position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> Agriculture is the backbone of our economy and now the Minister decides to tax it to the hilt.  We have had meetings with co-operative societies over the last few months and they have given us some very interesting facts.  I was at one meeting in my own area.  There were Fine Gael Deputies there but there was no one representing the Labour Party, the party that is supposed to defend the worker and the small farmers.  That party seems to have gone to roost.  We asked that co-operative society what percentage of their business was non-agricultural. They told us only 2½ per cent of the business came under that heading and the other 97½ per cent was confined to agricultural activities.  They had a mart, an AI station and they were dealing in milk and processing milk. It is not a struggling society but they made it quite plain that, if they are not allowed to build up a fund, they will not be able to carry on other projects.  I know the Minister will tell them to pay up and have no profit at all.  There was never a society worth its salt who did not build up a financial reserve.  Many companies have gone to the wall because they were not able to build up a financial reserve.</P>
    <P>If the co-operative societies get grants from the IDA or the EEC I want the Minister to state categorically if they will be incorporated in the year's workings.  If they show a profit, 50 per cent go to the State. This, in effect, means that 50 per cent of the grants received go back to the State.  The Minister may say that they should pay out all their money and go to the bank to raise any other money they need to advance their business, and that the interest on that money will be allowed against their profits, but that is a very bad situation to be in.  Are the Government driving people to thinking that it is wrong to be thrifty: &ldquo;Spend all the money in your pocket and raise more money the next day.  It does not matter how you repay what you borrow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I object strongly to this brutal tax which is being imposed on agricultural and fishery co-operative societies. The fishery co-ops need all the <Col N="1197" /> help they can get.  I am not from a coastal area but even to me it is obvious that we lag far behind other countries.  Our fish catches are very low and it is hard to understand why we have not developed this industry more.  Countries with less coastline than Ireland have catches far in excess of ours, sometimes even 100 times more.</P>
    <P>If those co-operatives are not helped, what will happen?  Foreign companies with large amounts of money behind them will take over and the locals will not be able to organise and fight their cause.  As I said, I and Government Deputies attended a meeting recently.  They promised to go to the Minister and ask him to do what he could.  I have not heard one word from them since.  That is one of the strongest reasons why I will vote against this Bill.  If the Government Deputies vote for it, they will be turning their backs on what they said, although when asked what they would do if it came to a vote they said they would vote for the Government.  Does the Minister not want to listen to the pleading of these people?  They know what they are talking about because they represent the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Ireland is mostly a rural country. As such we have advantages in the EEC and we should be developing them.  We have the best climate to produce agricultural products and we should take advantage of that.  We should be helping these people, not hindering them.</P>
    <P>The Minister did a disservice to the agricultural community when he took away the special VAT, the 1 per cent credit paid to people who produce agricultural goods.  The Irish housewife is faced with an enormous increase in the price of butter.  It is hard to fathom how the Minister's mind works.  When he raised the price of petrol by 15p in December, 1974, he said one of his reasons was to make people fit and to make petrol the same price here as it was in Britain and Northern Ireland.  Why then did he not do the same with the price of butter?  The price of butter here at the moment is very high.</P>
    <P>The price of milk to the producer <Col N="1198" /> this year will not be more than it was 12 months ago, due partly to rising costs which the industry has to bear and partly to the budget.  Previously when a man sold milk, for every £100 he got £1 credit.  The credit came by special value-added tax.  In this budget the Minister gobbled up that 1 per cent.  That meant that the man selling milk is already down 1 per cent.  Costs will catch up with him and take away another 1 or 2 per cent and he will finish up with the same price he got last year, despite the fact that costs have increased, feeding stuffs and fertilisers are very dear and rates are higher than last year.  It is hard to visualise just how much money is involved in this area.</P>
    <P>At the meeting to which I referred earlier we asked leading questions. What would the drop of 1 per cent mean to suppliers?  They said that the suppliers would be receiving £220,000 less than in 1975.  That means that the State has taken this money.  This 1 per cent was paid last year for agricultural goods when the rate was running at 6.75 per cent.  With the introduction of this budget, the rate has risen to 10 per cent.  If the Minister had not changed it, instead of £101 it would now be £101.5.  The Minister has taken £220,000 from one co-operative society.  I wonder how much he has taken from the whole country? In my view, this is a very mean way to collect money.</P>
    <P>We also asked what the 3p on heavy fuel oil would mean to that society.  They use 400 million gallons of that oil, and it will come to £120,000.  The suppliers will also have to meet that extra expense.  What will the increase in social welfare contributions mean to the society?  That will come to a startling £88,000.  Thus the State has collected nearly £500,000 from that society.</P>
    <P>Everybody who buys a pound of butter should realise that although he is paying more for it now, the man who produces it is not getting anything extra in 1976 than he got in 1975.  That is a sad state of affairs. The seller may make a little money when he sells his calves because calf prices are better now than last year, <Col N="1199" /> but they are not being discussed in the budget.  Where do the Labour and Fine Gael Deputies stand on this?  We will know when it comes to a vote. We thought they might have some influence with the Minister but it is obvious that they do not.  The Minister is on the way to destroying the last dominant elements in the economy&mdash;the agricultural community and the co-operative societies.  I will discuss the co-operative societies at length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not know what to say about this Government.  If they see any business going well, they immediately tax it to the hilt and this creates unemployment. There is great speculation at the moment that the price of the pint of beer and stout will be reduced by 3p.  A huge increase went on the price of the pint as a result of the budget.  I suppose it was the first time in our history that we ever saw the price of the pint dearer than the price of a half glass of whiskey.  The Government changed, as far as I remember in 1948, over the price of the pint.  There was an outcry by the Labour Party at that time about the working man's pint.  They said that the rich man could drink brandy, champagne, or whatever he liked, but they would back up the worker and see to it that the pint was available to him at a reasonable price he could afford to pay.  The price of the pint has now become unreasonable.  I did not think I would see the day when three workers could walk into a bar for three pints and they would get no change out of a £1.  They have to add part of another £1 to pay for them.</P>
    <P>There is a decline in the volume of business done in bars but I am directing my remarks to the increase in the cost of the pint.  A pint is nourishment to many people.  Many a worker has a snack and a pint.  It is not a luxury in the true sense of the word.  Whoever advises the Minister did a bad job in counselling him to put such a huge impost on the pint.  This will probably result in less taxation coming into the coffers of the Minister for Finance than if he left the tax at the lower rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> It is traditional in Ireland during Lent for people to give up drinking. I believe they are well off it now because of the increased cost.  I read in the paper that an offer has been made by the Minister to the vintners that he will take the 3p off if the brewers take off a penny and the trade take off a penny.  It is very hard to see the trade taking off the penny because they have much heavier overheads to meet.  The rates on their premises have become very high.  Bars in this city have to pay huge rates. The Minister has raised the taxation much too high and he has done great harm to the workers who enjoyed their pint at the weekend and also those who enjoyed it every day of their lives.</P>
    <P>At this time when we are talking about importing foreign oil, when we are searching for oil off our coast and when the cost of fuel is so dear, we should have some scheme to develop our bogs.  The vast majority of the roads going into the bogs are in a very bad state of repair.  There has been no big scheme to repair them.  The Minister should set aside some sum of money to do this work.  The turf in our bogs would be cut by thousands of people if they could get access to them.  The Minister apparently is not prepared to help in the repair of bog roads.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being discussed at a time when local authorities all over the country do not know how they can carry on.  We have heard a lot of talk about road tax.  People pay their road tax to the local authorities who send the money to the Minister for Local Government.  There has been a huge increase in motor taxation. People want to know what percentage of the road tax collected will go back to the various local authorities for the upkeep, maintenance and improvement of roads generally.  We are being asked in this Bill to make this huge increase in road tax law and we are being asked to discuss the matter. A sum of £3.45 million was collected from the two local authorities in Cork, the city and the county, last year.  We believe that this year between £5½ million and £6 million will <Col N="1201" /> be collected.  What percentage of that sum will go back to those local authorities to help them out?</P>

      <P>The expenditure of the moneys collected is essentially a Local Government matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister for Finance what percentage of that money he will give to the Minister for Local Government to spend on the roads.  The increase in car taxation is a penal imposition. The increase in the cost of petrol is putting up costs for the man who uses his car to get to work.  The cost of taxing his car is putting his costs up further.  We have the Government talking about a pay pause but when one puts the two things together it is impossible to get them to meet in any agreeable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State are responsible for the huge increase in taxation on petrol and also for taxing motor vehicles in general.  A person who uses a car to get to work or just uses it for his family at the weekend has a car of 10 hp, 12 hp or 13 hp.  If he has a 12 hp car it will cost him £72 to tax it.  Now we find, whether or not that person uses his car, he has to pay that tax.  This is something new in the Finance Bill.  The onus is now put on the county council to collect the money.  In the case of an untaxed car before this it was a garda who had to find out who was driving the car, summons that person and bring him to the local court.  Now it is the county council who have to sue.  If a person does not tax his car within 14 days, the county council have the right under civil law to bring him to court.  The onus is on the person to prove that it is taxed.  The onus is not <Col N="1202" /> on the council to prove it is untaxed. We all thought that a man was innocent until he was proved guilty but there is a proviso in this Bill that whether or not a person uses his car he must pay tax on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should include a provision to cover genuine cases of hardship&mdash;the person who may not be able to tax for a quarter of a year, a half year or, perhaps, a full year. Take, for example, a woman whose husband dies, who is unable to drive a car and keeps it for over a year until her son or daughter is old enough to drive it.  Surely the Minister will not say that woman should have to pay tax on the car which is idle.  I have no mercy for people who deliberately fail to tax their cars or insure them. I believe we do not deal hard enough with insurance cases.  I am concerned about the hardship cases.  This is the time for the Minister to introduce provisions to cover such cases.  As far as I can see, it is stated in the Bill that one must nearly take a car asunder, that it must be rendered useless, before the Minister is willing to accept that one does not have to pay tax on the vehicle.</P>
    <P>There is also the situation of the young man who may lose his job but who wishes to hold on to his car because it may be vital for him to have transport if he gets employment in the next few months.  What is contained in the Bill means that such a person should take the car apart and render it unfit for use.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider cases of hardship and to make special allowances.  Nobody has any pity for the person who does not tax his car.  The wording states that the owner of the vehicle will be liable for road tax whether or not he uses the vehicle.  It seems to be regarded in much the same way as a television licence but I do not think there is any comparison.  A 13 hp car will cost £78 per annum for road tax and this cannot be compared with the cost of a television licence.  The Minister said that the county councils and the local authorities would do the summonsing, that they would make the people prove they had paid their tax.  There <Col N="1203" /> is no clause that they are innocent until they are proved guilty.</P>
    <P>I have been disappointed with regard to the road grants but I am told that discussion of that matter is not appropriate on this occasion.  The local authorities are in a bad financial state with regard to house building this year.  The people can find no hope in this Finance Bill that we will get out of our present bad situation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs may talk about the happy outlook for us but he should think of what the Tánaiste said.  The latter told us that the bubble had burst and that we will never go back to the high living standards of the sixties.  Fianna Fáil were in Government at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs asked what would Fianna Fáil do in the present situation.  When Fianna Fáil were in power he criticised us. He has had his fling but it has been a complete failure and the only answer is a change of Government with the people who helped this country to prosperity in the past in power once again.  I wish the Government would stop raising smokescreens. Instead of talking about what is happening abroad or attacking the hierarchy, they should get down to the job of governing the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditionally the budget was an annual statement by the Minister for Finance regarding the economy and the direction in which he was guiding it during the coming year.  However, since the Coalition Government came to power we have had two or three budgets every year.  We had the classic experience in December, 1974, where the Minister increased petrol by 15p per gallon just two weeks before the January budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately the budget for this year and the Finance Bill we are discussing do nothing for the twin problems we face, namely, rising unemployment&mdash;currently at a figure of approximately 116,000&mdash;and massive inflation.  When the budget was introduced spokesmen on this side of the House pointed out that it would <Col N="1204" /> cause a massive rise in inflation and they have been proved right.  The figures produced last week show that we have experienced an inflation rate of 7.3 per cent in the last three months.</P>
    <P>At the same time one section of the Government is asking the workers to agree to a pay pause, another section is saying they will not ask the workers to agree to a pay pause and the Minister for Finance is bringing in measures that cause an inflationary rate of 7.3 per cent in three months. Can the Government seriously expect the people to accept a pay pause while inflation is running at such a high rate?  It is physically impossible and it is too much for any Government to expect people to stomach at this time.  I cannot see the Government having a success with the unions in view of the policies the Government are following.</P>
    <P>Let us examine this Finance Bill and compare it to the budget introduced in Britain yesterday by Mr. Healey.  Then we can see just how sick is the budget and this Finance Bill.  Traditionally our economies have moved together and as one improved so would the other.  Now we have the situation where the projected inflation rate here for the next 12 months is 18 per cent or higher while the projected rate in Britain is around 10 per cent. This will hit our exports, our tourist trade and every section of the economy.</P>
    <P>Not only are the Government bankrupt financially but they are bankrupt of ideas about how we might get out of our present situation.  The one element missing is confidence among the people in the future of the country.  This confidence was always evident when Fianna Fáil were in power, particularly during the sixties and the early seventies.  There was substantial confidence in the ability of the Government to conduct the financial affairs of the country for the betterment of the people.  However, this confidence is completely lacking in the present regime.  It is common knowledge that the banks have substantial sums in their vaults which they cannot give away for investment <Col N="1205" /> purposes.  Where investment is dropping, where the industrial base is tightening and where there is increasing unemployment, it is time for the Government to resign.  It is time to allow a single-party Government, Fianna Fáil, to do the job.  They will revive the confidence that was there when they were in office before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I was referring to Bord Fáilte plans for expansion of the tourist industry over the next five years.  It was said that over this period it is intended to spend approximately £50 million on development proposals.  Of this about £20.3 million is to be provided by Bord Fáilte and the regional organisations, the remainder to come from other public bodies and the private sector. In the very first year of operation of this scheme it is not likely that much money, if any, will be spent on it&mdash; a bad start to such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister said that we appeared to be most competitive or at least as competitive as other countries <Col N="1206" /> in attracting tourists.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have priced ourselves out of the tourist market despite any figures the Minister may quote.  Even though income from tourism is increasing, it is not increasing in real terms.  Numerically, the figures are increasing also but this is happening in other countries where the figures are increasing far more than they are increasing here.  This is because we are not competitive and this is due entirely to the mismanagement of our financial affairs by the Government. There is no real price control. The Government have failed to curb inflation.  From meeting hoteliers throughout the country and particularly in Kerry, I know they are in a very serious position, worse now than ever, due to the fact that last November and December they quoted prices on bookings and these prices are now completely unrealistic as a result of the outrageous increase announced in the budget.  These hoteliers are honourable people and will not write to customers telling them that due to recent budgetary measures charges must be increased.  They will carry the load themselves rather than do that. This is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>It can no longer be said that foreigners come here because they can get beer and cigarettes at the right price and because petrol is at the right price.  We are not now competitive in this respect.</P>
    <P>I believe car hire firms will be forced to increase their charges this season as a result of the colossal increase in the taxation element on petrol alone in the past six months and the unrealistic increase in motor taxation. Hotels that have already committed themselves to bookings at certain charges will, from now on, be forced to increase these charges substantially as a result of VAT increases and other measures of the present Government such as the substantial increase in the cost of the social welfare stamp which came into operation on 1st April.  This increase will mean far higher expenditure for hoteliers and make them less competitive compared with other countries.</P>
    <P>The Government should introduce some form of subsidy into the transport <Col N="1207" /> of tourists to this country.  I have advocated on more than one occasion previously that the Government should seriously consider the possibility of providing an air and sea subsidy for transport to this country because transport costs between Ireland and Britain and between Ireland and the Continent must be the most expensive in the world.</P>
    <P>If the tourist industry in general is in the strong position that the Minister indicated last night, why are so many hotels being downgraded by Bord Fáilte?  The proprietors and the owners of these hotels cannot afford to bring them up to the standard and maintain them at the standard relevant to their grade before they were downgraded.  This important question deserves a reply: if as the Minister states the hotels and guest houses are in such a strong position, why are they being downgraded?  I believe it is because they have no resources to meet the cost of reaching the required standard.</P>
    <P>Special, low interest loans should be introduced for hotels and for the tourist industry as a whole.  I do not know why this cannot be done.  Arrangements could be made by the Government to subsidise financial institutions so that special, low interest rates could be offered to the tourist industry.  We know the importance of this industry to the economy both from the point of view of employment and income and as regards consumption of home grown produce.  The Government by their negative policy or lack of policy, by their mismanagement of our financial affairs which led to the recent disastrous budget, are bringing the tourist industry into a catastrophic situation. It appears that the real reason we are not more competitive is lack of price control and the failure of the Government to curb inflation.  This was made crystal clear yesterday when the British budget was announced.  When one compares that budget with the one introduced by our Minister for Finance in January one can see that Britain is a more attractive place for the western tourist than Ireland.  As a result of the British budget Bord Fáilte <Col N="1208" /> will have a more difficult task trying to attract more business here.  The Government have failed to make this great industry more competitive and, consequently, to attract more tourists here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what motivated the Opposition to put down such a motion.  It is another example of their attitude and their lack of policies.  Every week they seek additional money to spend on various schemes while at the same time they condemn the Government for borrowing and overspending.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  They should tell the people what they would do if they were in power.  The Opposition are being totally dishonest and a motion of this type does them no credit.  They are trying to undermine confidence in the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>In my view the tourist industry is reasonably healthy, particularly when one considers the problems Bord Fáilte must face in trying to attract tourists here.  The biggest problem is the Northern situation.  It is hard for foreigners to understand, when they hear of bombs exploding in Northern Ireland, that they have nothing to do with us.  It is hard to get them to realise that those bombs are exploding in another jurisdiction.  However, those who visit us realise that the Government are in control of the situation.  While in America recently the Taoiseach, in a confident fashion, spelt out the state of the country and I believe that as a result of that visit we will have many more tourists from North America this year.  The Americans have confidence in the Government's attitude to law and order.  We should all bear in mind that Bord Fáilte are engaged in an uphill battle with regard to tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties in relation to tourism are not confined to prices.  The cost of petrol and the fact that this would have the effect of frightening tourists off was mentioned but petrol in European countries is as dear, and, in some cases, dearer, than here.  In Belgium petrol costs 85p a gallon while in Denmark it is 90p.  In France it is 85p; Germany, 75p; Italy, £1.05p; <Col N="1209" /> Holland, 85p and Spain, 93p.  The cost of hiring a car here compares favourably with the hire cost on the Continent. Therefore, it is a weak point to say that the increase in the cost of petrol will affect our tourist industry. I do not believe that the allegedly wicked budget with which the Opposition are preoccupied will affect the tourist industry.  People do not come here to &ldquo;slosh&rdquo; down pints or speed around in a motor car; they come to relax and for a change of scenery.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to offer tourists and it would serve the Opposition better if they spoke about our amenities rather than denigrating the tourist industry. The Opposition should bear in mind that German tourists get good value here because of the sterling exchange rate.  We must be positive in our approach to the tourist industry. I should like to see greater emphasis being placed by Bord Fáilte on attracting visitors from the Continent. Tourism is so highly competitive that it is necessary for an organisation such as Bord Fáilte to work extremely hard in their efforts to attract visitors. There is a lot of hard work to be done in this sphere.  However, as we are a member of the EEC we should be in a position to attract more people from the Continent.  In this regard I believe that our reputation was greatly enhanced during the six months our Minister for Foreign Affairs was President of the EEC Commission.  The work done during that period will help our tourist drive tremendously. Those responsible for organising the summit conference in Dublin deserve great praise.  It was a tremendous success and will benefit us in the future.</P>
    <P>Last year was a good year from the tourism point of view in spite of the cloud that was hanging over us. It was not an economic cloud but a far more serious one.  I believe we will have a successful year in 1976 also.  Our hotels are very competitive and anybody who has stayed in an hotel on the Continent knows that. We have all the attractions necessary to cater for a big influx of tourists. It is possible for people to get away <Col N="1210" /> from the crowded industrial areas and relax in a calm atmosphere here.  Possibly our hygiene standards should be looked at to ensure higher levels, and hoteliers and guesthouse owners should be very careful to achieve higher standards. It is because satisfactory standards have not been maintained that some of them have been downgraded by Bord Fáilte.  I agree that if they do not measure up to the standards laid down they should be downgraded. If they achieve and maintain high standards it will benefit those in the tourist business as well as the national economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to see better levels of public hygiene in our cities, particularly in the matter of litter and in the erection of hoardings. We have a lot to learn from continental cities in that respect.  As a city, Dublin is very attractive.  The older parts of the city have character and their people have much to offer to tourists.  We particularly need to consider the position after buildings have been demolished to see that unattractive hoardings are not put up and that the sites are kept reasonably clean.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I am sorry the Opposition put down this motion. It shows how bereft of ideas they are to waste the time of the House discussing nebulous motions of this kind.  If they were sincere they would look at all the indicators, which show that the tourist business is healthy and that Bord Fáilte are doing a good job.  I should like to see Bord Fáilte further developing the European market.  The American market has dropped slightly because of world wide recession but I am sure we will see an increase in the number of visitors when the position improves.  We have the name of being courteous and welcoming and that is what has made Ireland a good place from the point of view of tourists. Not only does this industry provide employment but it also helps us to improve our balance of payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien wondered why we put down this <Col N="1211" /> motion, why we should be wasting time on it.  We did it as we do on all occasions because not alone are we ourselves worried about the future of tourism but those who are dependent on it are very worried. If Deputy O'Brien does not believe me he should ask the people in the industry, as we did recently.  Some of his colleagues are genuinely worried about it.</P>
      <P>It is of little use to be talking about us being a nice friendly people if we do not get tourists in, which is what the business is all about.  Last night the Minister said that when he took office in March, 1973, there were gloom and depression in the industry and for that reason one of the points in their 14-point plan was to promote a new attitude to the industry.  I cannot see the logic of that because the savage taxation imposed in the last budget on those in all sectors of tourism has caused more depression and gloom than the Minister spoke about in regard to 1973.  I shall go back on the history of the industry.</P>
      <P>In 1950 it was reckoned to be the second largest industry with total annual earnings of £30 million.  <i>Per capita,</i> we had the highest tourist earnings in western Europe.  Successive Governments set out to improve our share of the tourist market by providing better promotional activities and by giving better services to tourists. We succeeded in no small way, but what was the position in the 1970s? Our position in regard to tourists dropped from 1.9 per cent of the world tourist market in 1960 to 1.3 per cent in 1966 and to 0.8 per cent of the same market in 1974.  That means that even in the period from 1960 to 1974 our percentage of the world tourist market halved.  Those are the figures that count when we praise ourselves on making a success of our tourist industry.  Whatever Government may be in power or whatever bodies promote tourism, what matters is the percentage of the world tourist market we hold.  There is no point in people blaming the troubles in the North for this.  We did not have those troubles in the years 1960 to 1969.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> With regard to the promotion, running and servicing of our tourist industry there are quite a number of organisations and Ministries involved, such as the Department of Transport and Power, Bord Fáilte, the regional tourist organisations, the tourist branch of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Aer Lingus, B &amp; I, CIE, the National Tourist Council. We might add also two further Ministrives, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Gaeltacht, which have a function to play in this matter. In fact, we might also add the Department of Local Government.  In addition to all of those there is the private sector working very hard on promotional and servicing activities.  All of the bodies I have mentioned seemed to us to be operating more or less separately.  If that is so&mdash;and we believe it to be so&mdash;we are continuously getting diminishing returns in this world tourist market.</P>
    <P>The body principally responsible for the tourist industry and its promotion here is Bord Fáilte.  Nobody here or anywhere else would disagree with their aims in that regard.  However, we must ask ourselves how successful have they been in the achievement of their aims.  They have had success&mdash; we do not deny that&mdash;but we must ask ourselves have they been as successful as they might over the years.  In 1975 we had 1.688 million tourists from whom the carriers earned £35 million and the internal receipts were rated at £126 million, giving us a total of £161 million.  In effect this meant a drop of 16 per cent in real terms from 1969.</P>
    <P>We should now examine all of the different bodies involved to ascertain whether or not we can improve on the position, eliminate the overlapping which takes place and indeed, in some cases, the conflict of interest between them, sometimes involving duplication of expenditure.  For instance, we should ask ourselves is it necessary to have four State bodies promoting tourism in North America, these being Bord Fáilte, CIE, Aer Lingus and to a lesser degree, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  It would seem that Bord Fáilte carry the principal obligation.  In fairness to Aer <Col N="1213" /> Lingus they have been by far the most successful promoter of tourism in North America over the years.  CIE have had a measure of success.  They are still endeavouring to sell their tours in North America.  Whether or not they have been successful in recent years the sad fact is they were trying to sell their hotels there a few months ago; indeed they had practically closed the deal to get rid of some of those hotels. Therefore, we must assume they were not very successful in their tourist promotional activities on the other side of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>All these bodies attempt to sell the Irish tourist industry in North America.  I have been to America only once&mdash;quite recently for two weeks&mdash; but from my observations they concentrate mainly on the same areas, in the main on the east coast and after that Chicago and its surrounding areas. If what I say is true, and I believe it is in the main correct, in the areas I have mentioned there is a very large number of Irish immigrants: Chicago and the east coast are where most of the Irish-born have emigrated.  We do not appear to have gained any increase in tourist business in those areas.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we are to increase our tourist numbers from the North American Continent surely it is common sense to deduce that there is either something wrong with our selling capacity or that we are not expanding our market there.  A large number of people who come from New York and such places would come anyway.  But there are other parts of the United States, places where there are very few Irishborn people, such as the mid-western States, where there are very many people of second and third relation removed Irish who have never been to Ireland and who are a long distance from the east coast.  From speaking to them one learns they are keen to come here but they ask how do they organise themselves, whom do they contact. One advises them of the different bodies involved but one tries to concentrate on one body.  What is really needed is somebody to go out, get groups together, organise charter flights and so on, and get them moving.</P>
    <P>There is therefore a further market <Col N="1214" /> in other parts of the United States if we but seek it.  Anyone with whom I have discussed this matter&mdash;people who know something about America and have been in parts other than New York and Chicago&mdash;all agree that we have not made a proper attempt to muster this market because these are people proud of having an Irish grandfather or grandmother who would dearly love to come over and trace some relationship with someone in, say, Mayo, Clare or Cork.  But they appear to have no access to anyone who might help them in this regard. I would recommend that Bord Fáilte take a hard look at these areas.  While I was there I met one group capable of filling a charter flight themselves who want to come over for the next St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin. They asked me how they would go about requesting an invitation and so on.  I told them I was sure the Lord Mayor of Dublin next year, whoever he might be, would have no hesitation in sending them an invitation.  They will pay the full bill themselves.  I am glad to see that a Bord Fáilte man has already made contact with him.</P>
    <P>That was a chance contact, but there are many more people out there that can be picked up and got into Ireland and increase our percentage of the North American market.  At present the North American market supplies 15 per cent of our total tourism.  That 15 per cent spends 33 per cent of the total tourist spendings in this country. There is obviously a very fine return from North American tourism, as indeed there is from tourism everywhere else.  We should consider improving our tourist industry.  We could seriously consider changing the school holidays and trying to stagger holidays for industrial workers.  The reason for this would be to have our internal tourists going on holidays at some time other than the peak cost time, which is around July and August.  It would be far easier for them to go at the end of the lower season if this could be made possible and it would be far less expensive.</P>
    <P>There are many other things that we could look at and do something about in order to help avoid the trouble of high costings that now <Col N="1215" /> exist within the industry.  The recent tax changes have had a very serious effect on the tourist industry.  We have been told this by the people involved. We are convinced that the tourist industry is in dire trouble.  Even though we had so many more people in the country last year than the previous year we are still losing our percentage in the total world tourist market.  The tax changes, VAT, petrol taxation and increases in social welfare have had a very serious effect on the percentage.  There is no point in saying that we should add it on to the consumer market or the tourist. That cannot be done because tourists come in by way of package tours with long-term planning up to 12 or 18 months before.  There is no way an increased price can be demanded from the people who have arranged to come.</P>
    <P>In western Europe to increase prices an operator is obliged to give 120 days' notice.  The Minister for Finance has dealt a very severe, savage blow to the tourist industry, as he has to many other industries by his budget.  There are other things that are causing serious extra costs to the industry which it is unable to bear&mdash;the necessity for stamping cards for casuals, the pay liability for seasonal student workers.  These are matters that they are worried about. We should consider erecting a convention centre outside of Dublin. There is a fairly expensive market in this field for the running of world conventions.  The increase in the price of drink is another problem which affects the tourist industry.  The Minister said that Britain should be our best tourist market but we are away ahead of them with regard to the price of drink, and for very many tourists their beer is part and parcel of the holiday.  The extra energy costs to the hoteliers and guesthouse owners are very formidable also.  This is not all because of the Arabs or Saudi Arabians; our own Minister for Finance, by taxation, is one of the main causes.  A very important part of our tourist industry is the car rental service.  Cars are a necessity for our tourist industry.  Our petrol is now <Col N="1216" /> 11p dearer than it is on the other side of the Border.  The Minister cannot expect to improve his balance of payments while this position exists.  In December, 1974, when he put 15p extra taxation on petrol, he justified it by saying that all our petrol was going to go over the Border, and that it was bad for our balance of payments. The petrol station owners along this side of the Border are closing up rapidly because they cannot sell petrol and cannot survive because we are 11p dearer.  It is certainly not going to help our balance of payments in any way.</P>
    <P>The car is an essential part of our tourist industry because of our rural structure and because of the inaccessibility of many parts of the west of Ireland where there is no public transport.  In the Gealtacht and all along the west coast a car has to be part of the tourist industry if people are really to enjoy Ireland.  Many people are promoting all the capital cities for tourism purposes but they do not concentrate on the parts the people really enjoy.  We are not begrudging tourism to Dublin, but we believe that if people only come to Dublin they will miss out on our real value as a tourist nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that when he came to power in 1973 he found the morale of Bord Fáilte and the carriers very low and he found people working in the field promoting tourism to this country unsure of what the future held and half afraid to say they were Irish and selling Ireland.  These were the well paid people of Bord Fáilte and semi-State bodies who were half afraid in North America and other countries to say they were Irish. If the Minister finds any such highly paid promoter of tourism in any of those countries who admitted to being half afraid to go out and sell his country he has the remedy in his hands: sack him on the spot and find people who are not half afraid who will go out and do it. That is a dreadful thing to say.  If it is true then such people should not be there and we should have seen to it that they were back home where they consider themselves safe. <Col N="1217" /> I have no recollection of any tourist ever being injured or killed or maimed in any way as a result of the troubles in Ireland.  It is the duty of people who are paid to do so in other countries to ensure that there are no potential tourists afraid to come here.  They have been there for a few years now and if they have not succeeded in impressing on potential tourists that they are quite safe in coming here, they are doing a mighty bad job.  I am not accusing them.  It was the Minister who said they were half afraid to go out and sell Ireland and say they were Irish.  That is a dreadful thing if it is true.</P>
    <P>On the UK figures and the figures we get from Bord Fáilte, last year the figure was 818,000 tourists from Britain.  I would like to know how Bord Fáilte calculate these figures. Some of us have occasion to go over to Britain during the year and I presume we are counted as tourists when we return home.  Even if we had 818,000 tourists from Britain last year, it is a fact that 96 per cent of that 818,000 did not use hotels, farm guesthouses or town guesthouses so in the main they must have been people like ourselves who have occasion to journey over and back and people who come over here and stay with relatives.  This is the experience of the catering industry. They had a very small return from this number of tourists.</P>
    <P>To revert to the Minister's statement that people are afraid to go out and sell Ireland in other countries.  Bord Fáilte should long since have been able to dispel this idea from the minds of potential tourists.  We look forward to a successful tourist season and we tabled this motion to highlight the difficulties facing the industry&mdash;hotels, guesthouses and those who get the spill off benefits, be they publicans or farmers or anything else.  It is important that we should safeguard the industry.  It requires no imported raw materials.  It is worth while saving it and we believe the taxation imposed in the budget has dealt a drastic blow to the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support <Col N="1218" /> the Minister's amendment.  I listened with some interest to the speeches of Deputy Barrett, Deputy O'Leary and Deputy O'Brien.  Deputy O'Leary suggested that Britain was a more attractive country to visit at the present time than this country is.  Of course, the pint is cheaper in Britain. So is petrol.  It is much too facile, however, to suggest these are the sole reasons why people go on holidays. The attractions this country has for the tourist are in an entirely different area from those of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to the necessity for restoring competitiveness. Having travelled quite a bit in the last year, it is my considered judgment that this country is extremely competitive. There are particular reasons why it is competitive.  The £ is now purchasing more for visitors.  Petroleum is a fuel used by aerlines and bringing people to sunny climes is costly now because of surcharges. That makes this country even more competitive and Irish people thinking of going abroad are having to think again.  Of course, we have inflation and, of course, we have rising costs. Those who stress this fail to recognise that the same factors have been ravaging the economies of other countries in western Europe and these countries are extremely expensive.  When talking about the tourist industry here, it is important to examine the position in other countries.  The price of petrol in Italy is round about £1.10 per gallon. In Denmark it is 90 pence.  In France it is 85 pence.  In Holland it is 85 pence.  In Spain it is 93 pence. In Belgium it is 85 pence.  When talking about motorists coming in here, one must think of the motorist driving across continental Europe to the Riviera and down into Italy and Spain. The motorist who brings his car in here and drives down to the west and back again and does 300 miles holiday motoring does a total of roughly 620 miles.  At 30 miles to the gallon that would cost a family an extra £2 having regard to the rise in petrol.  If you divide that £2 among four people, it works out at about 50 pence each. It is a lot of damn nonsense to pretend that petrol is a critical factor which will make people decide this country <Col N="1219" /> is not a suitable place in which to have a holiday.</P>
    <P>Nobody need tell me that visitors come here to drink our pints.  They come for other reasons and hopefully will enjoy their pints, but this is not in any sense a critical factor.  We should relate the prices of some of these commodities to the prices in other countries.  Britain is not the only country in Europe with which we want to make comparisons.  Some years ago there were ten or 11 German marks to the Irish £; now there are five or six.  That is an extremely expensive country. There were 17 or 18 French francs to the £ a few years ago, now there are 8½.  In Norway a few years ago there were 15 or 16 kroner to the £; and 20 kroner to the £ ten years ago, now there are 11.  The popular drink there is draught lager and in any bar or hotel the pint costs £1.  If we want to talk about competitiveness, let us look around other countries in Europe, at the recent revaluation of the dollar against the £ and the prices in reasonable resorts in the United States.</P>
    <P>There is a much too facile comparison between costs here and costs in other countries, such as Spain, to which people traditionally go for holidays.  In many cases we are not comparing like with like.  There is a tendency to compare the price of a fortnight's holiday in one of our best hotels with a fortnight's holiday in Spain.  Very often sufficient emphasis is not put on the fact that the holiday in Spain is a bargain holiday in a hotel which is not in any sense competitive with our hotels.  People who want to indulge in comparisons should compare like with like and compare their holidays in Spain, France, Germany or Italy with hotels of an equal standard. They will begin to realise the essential competitiveness of this country in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett suggested that we were over-stating the question of whether Ireland was a safe country in which to holiday.  I do not think we are over-stressing it.  The wonder is that today&mdash;when we have an economic depression compounded within this <Col N="1220" /> country by the Northern situation&mdash;we have not only managed to maintain but to increase tourist traffic.  Various agencies outside this country, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus, CIE and the embassies, are doing their best but their promotional funds are limited.  Let us look at North America.</P>
    <P>The Bord Fáilte budget for promotional activities is limited.  When one takes into account the vast amount of material on the media&mdash;television, newspapers and so on&mdash;about the problems that affect this island, and the fact that people at that distance do not fully appreciate as we obviously do the distinctions that exist between the north-east and the south, one realises that they have been doing a very good job in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude in the area of security is important and is under-pinning the stability of the free movement of people between Ireland and other countries.  The Government have been doing a good job in getting this message across.  The Minister has been involved in the promotion of tourism.  In the last two or three years he spent a considerable amount of time abroad engaging in personal promotion of tourism and, particularly in America, this has generated a great deal of satisfactory publicity which has been very helpful.</P>
    <P>While the Government's attitude to tourism is very important, there are other areas at which we should have a look.  In this industry, more than in any other sector, the attitudes that prevail are vital to whether we will generate increases in our tourist industry. Irrespective of the Government of the day, the attitudes prevailing among hoteliers, local authorities and restaurants to service, cleanliness and good food, are all important.  It is essential that we are training the right people, that they are getting the opportunity to develop their businesses, that they are going after business and are running their businesses the way they should be.  These are critical factors which will make or break the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>In the past we were a little indiscriminate in giving hotel grants.  As the Minister said in his speech, there was <Col N="1221" /> a tendency to be a little indiscriminate in giving grants to certain kinds of people in the hotel industry and, in certain instances, about the location of hotels.  It was unfortunate that we did not encourage more the building of hotels by people trained in the hotel industry.  Many of these people trained in the Shannon hotel school or abroad, had the ability and the knowledge of what the market needed, but in some cases did not have the money to do it themselves.  It might have been better policy in earlier years to have taken more risks by funding such people in the form of grants and loans, rather than some cases we have seen where people without any knowledge of that sector have gone into the business and some of whom have done a less than good job.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of scope in the tourist industry, scope that does not require a great deal of investment. There is scope in improving our standards. There seems to be great scope in family operations, guesthouses and smaller hotels where overheads are held at a lower level.  There is scope for improvement in cooking, the area of presentation and in the area of cleanliness.  Bord Fáilte are right to stress how very important standards are if we want to be competitive in an international context.  There are areas we need to look to and standards must be raised if our competitiveness is to be enhanced.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to downgrading by Bord Fáilte.  In my experience if they are finding it necessary to adopt a tough attitude that is in the national interest, regardless of how much it may hurt.  In general, many of the things we need to do will not need much investment, but merely require higher standards.  This is where the scope lies.  When we speak about promotion abroad and the sums spent in the United States, Britain and Europe, we must realise that the best promotion is the good name a guesthouse gets for the style in which it presents breakfast and the standards of cleanliness in the bedrooms.  This is one of the greatest generators of future business.  The industry should look to itself to see what it can do.  Deputy <Col N="1222" /> O'Leary quoted the chairman of Córas Tráchtála, Mr. Colm Barnes, who suggested that the Government would need to look to their political convictions to help business, that there was no future in this country and that the Government were hostile to business. That is a lot of nonsense.  There is scope in this country, especially in the areas of export manufacturing, where there are CTT grants, credit facilities, and tax-free incentives which are greater than those which exist in any other European country today.</P>
    <P>One point I do not understand in relation to Deputy Leonard's speech is the confusion that apparently exists over figures.  Deputy Leonard suggested that Bord Fáilte's promotional budgets had shrunk steadily over the past three years.  This seems to be entirely at variance with the facts.  The statistics which I have had extracted suggest that the total amounts issued&mdash;this covers more than promotion&mdash;to Bord Fáilte in each of the last four years, together with the current year's allocation, are as follows: 1972, £7.45 million; 1973, £7.5 million; 1974, for nine months, £5.3 million and 1975, £9.03 million and in the budget for 1976, £10.45 million.  This is at variance with the suggestions made by Deputy Leonard.  If one wants to get a picture of promotional expenditure in isolation, if we take account only of subhead F11, of the Vote for Transport and Power, from which Bord Fáilte promotional expenditure comes, rather than what the total Bord Fáilte allocations are, we get a clearer picture.  The amounts issued from this source over the same four years, together with the 1976 allocation are as follows: 1972, £4.25 million; 1973, £5.45 million; 1974, for nine months, £4 million; 1975, £7.1 million and 1976, £7.75 million. In other words, the 1976 allocations are over 80 per cent higher than the amounts in 1972.  This has more than kept pace with inflation during that period.</P>
    <P>The tourist earnings in the last four years are as follows: 1972, £91.4 million, a decrease from that of the previous year; 1973, £110 million; 1974, £130 million, and 1975, £161 million.  Against a very depressed <Col N="1223" /> economic background&mdash;there was depression in agriculture because of the problems of the cattle industry the previous winter&mdash;tourism, which people had not expected to be so buoyant, was very alive and was a very substantial factor in the Irish economy last year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new Bill concerning Bord Fáilte which the Minister introduced a few months ago. I am glad to note the emphasis on water sports in their national plan report.  I want to mention one or two local matters concerning the Clew Bay area because there has been tremendous development there in regard to the provision of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, a championship golf course and sea angling activities. The bay which has about 300 islands is probably the most sheltered water on the entire west coast and offers great scope for water sports, particularly sailing in which French interests have recently become involved in the purchase of part of one of the islands.  A sailing club was formed there recently.  I would very much like to see Bord Fáilte take a special interest in this type of promotion because I believe it has tremendous scope especially for those who carry small boats, such as dinghies in trailers behind their cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to the contribution of the Minister and also that of Deputy O'Brien who took exception to this party even suggesting that we discuss a motion on tourism.  He seemed to imply that he would even stifle discussion on a motion such as the one we put forward because we were worried by the actions of the Government in the budget and since which are curbing the competitiveness of the industry. Last night the Minister spoke about the various sections of the tourist industry putting on the poor mouth.  I thought it was strange for a member of a Government, who are always putting on the poor mouth, to say something like that.  They are like a wail of banshees.  They are always complaining. They complain about things being ill-used by others, about the <Col N="1224" /> EEC, about the Northern Ireland troubles.  They complain that they are not getting a fair deal and that the world is deliberately bringing on an economic crisis for them.  They have complaints about vets, the banks and about the Fianna Fáil Party.  They seemingly do not accept that it is my party's job to point out the mistakes made by them.  It is also our job to help to protect the people from those mistakes.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Deputy O'Brien that we make no apology for tabling motions which we believe may bring ideas to the Government.  We are bringing ideas from a party who were never afraid to tackle problems, who did not whine and groan when there was a crisis.  They solved many difficult problems.  The tourist industry does not consist of people making a poor mouth.  They are only asking the Government for fair play.  They have pointed out that if the industry does not remain competitive the whole economy will suffer.  The Minister certainly knows that there is evidence for that case.</P>
      <P>The Minister said last night that the promoters were half afraid of selling Ireland.  I join with my colleague in saying that men who are half afraid to sell Ireland should not be commissioned for that job.  He also referred to my contribution when I said that there was a reduction in the amount available.  I qualified that by saying &ldquo;in real terms&rdquo;.  Those few words are the real crux of the situation.  Deputy Staunton trotted out a lot of figures but if he were to relate those figures to the inflation which has occurred over the period he mentioned he would find there was no increase in real terms.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said: &ldquo;I do not want this country developed into a cheap tourist market.  I do not want to see tourists flocking here because every place is cheaper, the places are crowded and you cannot drive your car on the road.&rdquo;  There is very little chance of this country becoming a cheap tourist country with the high prices and the increased taxes imposed by the budget and the VAT increases since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> The Minister seems to have given little thought to the social and economic roots from which our tourists come.  For example, of the tourists coming to Ireland from Britain, a very high percentage is of ethnic origin.  The vast majority come from the C1 and C2 socio-economic groups. In the booklet &ldquo;Tourist plan 1975 to 1978,&rdquo; Table 32B states in relation to the well-off category that 16.4 per cent of the ethnic traffic coming here were in that grouping.  In the lower two grades, C1 and C2, the figures were 27 per cent and 36.6 per cent. This seems to indicate that our tourists from Britain are not millionaires.  It shows that the majority of them are ordinary wage and salary earners.  If the Minister wants an industry based on the wealthy only he should purchase an island in the West Indies. I challenge the Minister to say if even one group in the tourist industry has made the case that prices should be kept high.  If the Minister thinks that those who are in the industry want the prices to be high he is mistaken. It is essential that we keep our prices competitive.  In one breath the Minister is saying he favours good value for money but in the next breath he tells us he does not want to see tourists coming here because the place is cheaper.  He wants a small number of people who will pay high prices but I should like to see a large number of people paying reasonable prices.  Well-satisfied visitors are the best possible advertisement we could have.</P>
    <P>The high cost of transport has posed a major problem for the tourist industry. Transport costs form the major part of the total cost of a holiday and the competitiveness of our industry will be seriously affected if the costs get out of hand.  Many of our visitors arrive with their own transport and others hire cars.  Anything that affects motoring and makes it more costly has a serious effect on tourism.  There is also the secondary effect where the prices of food, goods, materials and services required for the tourist industry are increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance ensured that motoring costs were blown sky-high <Col N="1226" /> as a result of his budget.  No consideration was given to the bad effects it would have on one of our major industries.  It appears the Minister for Finance wishes to wipe the motorist and the tourist off the map.  During the budget debate the Leader of our party put forward a proposal for a voucher scheme for petrol for tourists.  We had in mind permitting the purchase of a limited amount of petrol at reduced rates and that this would be put into operation at various points of entry. A number of European countries that are well established in the tourist industry have similar schemes.  However, the Minister could not see his way to accept our proposal.  Now that he has had time to reflect on the matter, when he has seen how other budget proposals have misfired, perhaps he will review the situation before the coming tourist season.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien was critical of our mentioning the word &ldquo;subvention&rdquo;. We think the extra tourists who would come here and the revenue that would be obtained would offset the cost of introducing the voucher scheme.  On 4th December, 1974, we discussed the increase of 15p on the price of a gallon of petrol.  At column 977 of the Official Report of that date, the Minister for Finance stated:</P>
    <P>Moreover, as I have told the House previously, we now have the cheapest petrol in western Europe. In Italy petrol costs nearly 88p a gallon, in France over 74p, in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the price ranges from 69p to 74p a gallon. Even in oil-rich Norway it is 76p. In Northern Ireland and Britain the price of premium petrol is 63½p per gallon.  The existence of such a large difference as nearly 13p on a gallon of petrol between the Republic and the North has obvious disadvantages for our economy.  It would stimulate considerable petrol purchases in the Republic by motorists from the North.  This &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; across the Border would result in a worsening of our balance of payments as additional oil was imported to supply the cross-Border demand.</P>
    <P>We must remember that a large <Col N="1227" /> number of our tourists can buy petrol at a rate that is 11p per gallon cheaper than in this country.  It will be interesting to see if the Minister for Finance follows his statement to its logical conclusion. That would mean there would be a reduction in the price of petrol here, not only for the tourists but for the general public.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Transport and Power objected to hotels moaning about prices and he would not accept our statement that the hotel industry was in serious trouble.  In the Irish Hotel Industry Manual for Inter-Hotel Comparisons, in the Cork-Kerry area which the Minister represents, it was stated that the hotels had a loss equal to 2 per cent of their total turnover. Politicians have close contact with hotels because they hold clinics in them and they also attend functions and, consequently, I cannot understand how <Col N="1228" /> the Minister could stand over the statement that there was no criticism from hoteliers with regard to the problems they were facing.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Industrial Workers' Houses.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 3 on today's Order Paper to highlight the position in relation to the lack of housing for industrial workers in north Mayo, particularly those living in the triangle of Ballina, Crossmolina and Killala.  In this area, because of the major industrial development, there is an urgent need for houses for industrial workers who will be employed in the coming nine months in the Hollister enterprise located near Ballina, the Asahi complex near Killala, by the expansion of the Shamrock Forge and Tool Company and the continued wellbeing of Mayco Limited in Ballina. Another reason why I raise this is to discover which Minister is responsible for housing these workers.  For a considerable time nobody appears to take on the responsibility for housing these workers.</P>
      <P>In the course of his reply to a supplementary question from me today the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I am not responsible for the rehousing of people except those who are rehoused under the schemes by local authorities.  I suggest that the Deputy take up the matter elsewhere.  It is not my responsibility.</P>
      <P>At an earlier date when I raised this matter with another Minister I received a similar reply.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated in a reply to a question of mine in which I asked him to provide funds for houses for industrial workers in the north Mayo area:</P>
      <P>As the Deputy no doubt appreciates, the provision of housing generally and of Exchequer capital therefor are not matters which fall directly within my area of responsibility and I have no funds at my disposal for the provision of housing for employees in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, however, from the Industrial Development Authority that in view of the necessity to cater for the immediate urgent housing needs of the executive and key workers in certain new industries in Ballina/Killala area, the authority have, as a special measure, made arrangements for <Col N="1231" /> the provision of a number of houses for these personnel.</P>
    <P>The houses referred to in the course of that reply are being built by private contractors and financed by the IDA.  The idea is that the IDA will sell these houses back to the executives and the staff.  Approximately 50 are being erected.  The question being asked in that area is why the same facilities are not being made available for the ordinary industrial worker.  It is felt that because the executives and the staff will have higher salaries they should be able to provide houses for themselves.  The following examples will give the Minister some idea of the size of the problem.  Asahi are the biggest of the industries concerned; they are probably the largest in Connacht.  The personnel departments of that industry estimate that they will need 650 workers in the coming nine months.</P>
    <P>Of the 650, Asahi feel that because of the special skills needed they will have to take approximately 300 from outside Mayo, and they feel from past experience and the general type of age structure of those workers, that at least 130 of them will be married and because of that, in need of housing. They are convinced that the whole future development and planning of the industry will stand or fall on those men and that they will not be able to attract those men to the area unless there is housing for them, because the vast majority of them will already have jobs and houses and will not feel inclined to leave good accommodation to come to an area where they will have to get, if they can be found, and they are not available at the moment, some sort of digs or lodgings.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that perhaps the company themselves ought to provide the housing since it appears their whole future development would stand or fall on the provision of houses for the majority of their workers.  There are numerous reasons why this is not so, one of them involving the right of the individual to change a job if he or she decides to do so.  If they were living in houses constructed by the company, I suggest that their freedom <Col N="1232" /> of choice would be considerably limited because if they decided to move it would mean they would have to vacate the houses if they were company property.  Another reason is that the company have already made a sizeable contribution, in the region of £1 million, to the provision of a regional water scheme, being constructed now, to give them a supply of water.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining 450 workers, 50 will be housed in NBA schemes which are in progress now.  The balance, 400, will be taken from the immediate area or they will be able to commute.  Quite a number of them will have returned from England or from other parts of the country to work in the construction of the factory which is now in progress.  Many are living with parents and there are instances of two or three families living in each house.  This has been the finding of a survey carried out by the Killala Community Council on behalf of the North Mayo and West Sligo Development Association.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are 50 families living in caravans within a three- or four-mile radius of Killala.  Many of them have come back from England or from other parts of this country where they already had housing accommodation. Many have two or three children and most of the mothers are worrying continuously about the possibility of serious accidents to their children who have been used to ordinary housing conditions and who will now be able to turn on gas taps and light switches.  There are no toilet facilities or running water in these caravans.  They are lacking in most modern amenities.  Twenty other caravans contain two or three men each, many of whom will soon be getting married and will then be in need of rehousing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently paid a visit to Ballina.  He had many glowing comments on the industry and wished everyone well.  He received a deputation from the association who stressed the urgency of the housing needs and told him of their concern.  The deputation represented all political affiliations in the area and in the past 18 months the members have been making a study of the needs in the area.  The Taoiseach <Col N="1233" /> promised them he would discuss this matter with the Government, but so far no decision has been communicated to the association.</P>
    <P>I had a second question on the Order Paper which is related to the one now being discussed.  The Minister in his reply asked me if I expected all the finance to be made available in 1976.  I do not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The plan referred to in the second question had short term objectives and projections and I think the Minister met the deputation from the North Mayo and West Sligo Development Association.  I understand he received them very well. They stressed the urgency of his allocating extra finance to this area.  They urged on him also the necessity of spreading the development and they asked him specifically to ensure, as far as was within his power that the development would not take place in one centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  Throughout the past 18 months there have been regular meetings in which the Department of Local Government, Industry and Commerce, Posts and Telegraphs, the ESB, CIE, the county council, the industrialists, the NBA, the architects, engineers and consultants belonging to the various industries took part.  Those discussions <Col N="1234" /> were wide-ranging.  They related particularly to the provision of housing and the other infra-structure without which industry cannot continue.  Certain suggestions were made.  As proof of that the NBA applied for and obtained, some six to eight months ago, from Ballina UDC planning permission for the erection of over 250 houses in Ballina.  Alas, while there was great urgency in obtaining planning permission, nothing has happened since. Rumour has it that the reason was the excessive cost of the houses.  A sum of £10,000 per unit was mentioned.  I am in no position to confirm or deny that rumour.  The fact is that houses for which planning permission was obtained some six to eight months ago are still at the drawing board stage and nothing has happened on the actual site.</P>
      <P>If those industries are to get off the ground I submit there is an urgent need for at least 150 houses.  In view of the intense competition existing all over the world to attract the very few small industries still expanding, the fact that certain states in America are even now setting up their own development associations and have followed somewhat the pattern set up by this country some years ago, and in view of the fact that the best type of advertising is by word of mouth, the commitments which have been given to Asahi, to Hollister and to Shamrock Forge and Tool Co. Limited in respect of the provision of houses should now be honoured.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the public capital programme allocation of £1.3 million to the NBA for 1976 will finance work in progress at 31st December last on the construction of houses.  Might I ask him is that actual construction in progress, or is it work at the planning stage?  If it is not work at the planning stage, I would ask the Minister to obtain the money from the Government and honour the commitments given to those companies to help alleviate the fears of the industrialists and people in the area and at least to go ahead with a number of the houses for which planning permission has been obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under current arrangements special housing to serve the needs of new or expanding industries is provided by the National Building Agency to the order of the IDA in so far as it is not provided by the normal local authority programme or by private housing.  The NBA carry out the construction work by recognised tendering procedures, recouping their costs from the IDA or from moneys provided within my Department's allocation from the public capital programme for the NBA.  In other words, the NBA are an agency which carry out work on the instructions of the IDA or local authorities in the main.</P>
      <P>The public capital programme allocation made in 1976 to the NBA is £1.3 million which does not include any funds in respect of new work.  It is work actually in progress; it is not work at the planning stage.  Therefore, the agency are not in a position to proceed with any additional houses for industrial workers in north Mayo at present unless the IDA decide to provide them with the necessary funds out of the 1976 capital allocation. The NBA have land for over 200 houses and planning permission for the first phase of 100 houses.  I understand that the IDA have arranged for the purchase of 24 speculatively built houses to meet ascertained industrial housing needs in the area which are required immediately and that they are considering proposals for more houses.  I want to make it clear that it is the IDA's responsibility.  I do not come into it at all except being responsible for the NBA who, as an agency, carry out the work for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in reply to the Deputy's question, there are no funds at my disposal out of which I can make funds available this year for additional industrial houses in north Mayo.  The House will be aware that massive funds are being provided this year for the local authority housing programme. The total authorised expenditure this year is £75.5 million, or over 20 per cent above last year's level.  Despite this, some new schemes have to be held up for a while in <Col N="1236" /> various parts of the country where needs are not so acute in order that a massive attack may be made on the list of more than 5,000 families in Dublin city who have been waiting so long for adequate housing.</P>
    <P>In spite of this, Mayo County Council have already been notified of a total authorised expenditure of £669,000 for their social housing programme so far this year, compared to actual draws on the Local Loans Fund of £493,000 last year, £159,570 in 1972-73 and the magnificent sums of £39,980 in 1971-72, £39,099 in 1970-71 and £25,360 in 1969-70.  Therefore, I am surprised that a Deputy owing allegiance to the party who formed the Government in those miserable years should give me this welcome opportunity of putting the record straight about how much better Mayo is faring under the present Government. In case money does not talk let me give the figures of local authority housing completions&mdash;because somebody may contend that there has been devaluation and all the rest of it.  In 1975 there were 124 local authority houses built, 107 in the nine months of 1974, 108 in 1973-74&mdash;but watch these figures&mdash;70 in 1972-73, 76 in 1971-72, 49 in 1970-71 and none at all in 1969-70.  And Deputy Calleary tells me that there are people in Mayo needing houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting nothing from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had his 20 minutes without interruption and he should allow me now to make my contribution. The picture in Ballina itself is much the same.  The urban district council have so far been notified of total authorised expenditure of £153,000 this year as compared with actual draws on the local loans fund of £83,300 in 1972-73, £52,000 in 1971-72, £1,730 in 1970-71 and nothing at all in 1969-70.  I said also in my reply that housing for industrial workers may be eligible for housing loans, grants and supplementary grants.  Traditionally, Mayo County Council have favoured a policy of assisting home ownership rather than building houses for letting.  Their house purchase loans <Col N="1237" /> scheme has been a great success in this connection.  They had applications for house purchase loans on hands at 31st December last totalling £2,160,000 although they paid out over £1,100,000 last year.  Their capital allocation for their house purchase loans and grants scheme increased from £291,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1973, to £1,117,000 in the year ended 31st December, 1975.  The allocation for the first half of this year is £700,000.</P>
      <P>Apart from the local authority scheme there are ample other funds available for house purchase loans this year.  It is estimated that building societies will have available upwards of £80 million and are at present open to applicants whether or not they are investors.  The banks have available £40 million for housing loans during the two-year period ending June, 1977.</P>
      <P>I will continue to give social housing of all urgent categories in County Mayo a high order of priority.  I will do anything I can with available resources to help in regard to whatever houses may be needed urgently in the county.  Deputy Calleary may have a point.  There are a number of industries and there are workers who need housing but it is not my responsibility to provide those houses unless Mayo County Council so notify me.  They have not done so, and I doubt if they will, because most of those people are people who have only very recently come to the area and, as Deputy Calleary said, there are a number of people waiting for housing there for a long time.  I am quite sure Mayo County Council will put them first on their list.  If the IDA feel that housing is needed they will make the necessary provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land on which the NBA have permission to build 100 houses will be handed over to whatever agency wants to build those houses.  The NBA only got the permission in case they were needed, and so far they have not been asked to provide houses.  What the IDA do is nothing to do with this Department&mdash;we acted as an agency for them.  It is very important that we remember that the county council are responsible for <Col N="1238" /> social housing in their area.  The latest figures available from Ballina Urban District Council is that, of 23 applicants approved on the list, 16 families are of three or less.  We have about 5,000 people here in Dublin who have four in one room.</P>

It is up to the county council, if there are people eligible for rehousing.  I know Deputy Calleary is anxious to do his best and anxious to get a few lines in the local paper.</P>

      <P>The renovation work on the geriatric assessment unit is expected to be completed by the end of April and it is proposed to open it then on a limited basis.  A consultant geriatric physician is employed and certain nursing and other staff are also available. The extension of the service thereafter will necessitate the employment of additional staff.  In present circumstances, it is not possible to make a special financial allocation for this purpose but it is, of course, open to the board to deploy staff from other areas if this can be arranged.</P>

      <P>It was not possible to allocate funds for major new works to the Western Health Board for 1975.  Of the total capital allocation of £377,000 to the board for that year, £50,000 was allocated for minor works, equipment and contingencies.  No specific allocations were made for new capital works commencing in 1976 but, of course, expenditure on all completed schemes and on-going schemes and schemes in planning will be met in full.</P>

      <P>Each year there is consultation with the breed societies concerned and all pedigree breeders are then circularised by my Department as to the detailed conditions for entry.  All calves offered for testing are inspected by my Department and those deemed suitable are accepted for entry to the station subject to compliance with the veterinary requirements.  The fee charged is £100 per bull.  Arrangements for the sale of bulls at the end of the test are made by the breed societies concerned and my Department have no function in regard to the sales.</P>
