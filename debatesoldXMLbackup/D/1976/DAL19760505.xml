      <P>On the adjournment the Minister was replying to the case made by Deputy Fitzpatrick on amendment No. 6.  The amendment is to increase the number of members to the commission to be appointed by the Minister to four plus the chairman, rather than two plus the chairman. Subsection (2) of section 4, which refers <Col N="614" /> to the two other members to be appointed by the Minister, does not refer in any way to their qualifications.  As it stands, a Minister could, in fact, appoint anybody who might, for one reason or another, appeal to a Minister but who might not have any knowledge or experience of broadcasting. Indeed, he could quite easily be somebody who does not like television and does not have a set in his home, as I understand the Minister for Finance does not.  The point I would make is that somebody should be on this commission who has an interest in broadcasting.</P>
      <P>While I am quite sure that the present Minister would always keep this in mind, there is no guarantee that his successor, or any successive Minister, might.  The amendment is a reasonable one, and the Minister can appoint more than two members to the commission if he wishes to do so. Possibly from the Minister's point of view it is preferable to have it that way.  As the section stands the members mentioned here need not know anything about broadcasting.  I would not have any worries as far as the present Minister is concerned, but one could have a situation where unsuitable people could be appointed under this subsection by a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not know whether the Minister has any way of getting around that.  It is not a very likely occurrence but nevertheless it is in the hands of the Minister. The qualities required are special qualities.  They are not necessarily experience in broadcasting, as referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick, but it can be experience about broadcasting.  For example, a former member of the Authority like myself could be suitable, having had the experience of seeing both sides of the problems. I would urge on the Minister, or any future Minister, that the type of person to be appointed to this commission should be a person with experience about the subject.</P>

      <P>It is true that under the section as it stands a Minister could, in theory, appoint anybody. The same applies to the RTE Authority <Col N="615" /> and to State boards generally. We have to assume that any Minister responsible to this House will be concerned with the suitability of his appointees for the task which is to be entrusted to them.  As the actual appointment will be made by the Government in each case, and if any Minister should wish to make eccentric choices such as hypothesised for the sake of argument by Deputy Brugha, somebody without any interest at all in broadcasting, somebody who never watches television or listens to radio, the Government would tend to correct that.  So not merely this Minister but Ministers for the future, whatever side they are on, ought to have a reasonable amount of elbow room.  Any reasonable Government will want to appoint people who would do a reasonable job and who would also command public confidence.  Should any Minister or Government fail to do that, criticism in the Dáil would be quick to correct that.  I respect the intention behind this amendment but I am afraid I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I have listened to the Minister's explanation as to the difficulties he may encounter.  Our reason for putting forward this amendment was to get a broader spectrum of opinion within the commission.  Quite obviously this commission will have a great deal of work to do.  I have the height of admiration for the people doing this job at the moment.  The Minister mentioned last night that they get no remuneration.  This is something that may require consideration at a future date to ensure that people will be in a position to give of their best.  Remember, we are limited somewhat in numbers and the Minister mentioned difficulty in getting experienced people to act on a committee such as this.  The work is of a technical nature.  Considerable time must be spent looking at programmes, such as the programme on the proposed Dublin Bay oil refinery.  That would be of a very technical nature. There is the point that a limited number might find it difficult to hold a sufficient number of meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> The solution to complaints should not be delayed.  There should be a finding as soon as possible.  If one or two members had difficulty in attending meetings there could be long delays.  I believe a broader spread is desirable to ensure the work is done effectively and that the burden is not too heavy. Despite the Minister's argument I believe it is desirable that one or two members should be professional people. Deputy Brugha said the Minister would no doubt consider the qualifications of appointees to ensure they had some knowledge of broadcasting. That would be most desirable.  I would not like the commission to consist of people who were all engaged in broadcasting because possibly that could lead to bad decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister argues that the amendment would tie his hands and he might have difficulty in recruiting personnel. I appreciate that.  The work is voluntary and I wonder how long we can go on expecting people to give up their time and energy without some form of compensation.  The group operating at the moment are doing their best.  The Minister said they had received more complaints than any broadcasting authority probably in western Europe. I hope I am paraphrasing the Minister correctly.  Could the Minister tell us why there has been such a large number of complaints?  He mentioned ten. Of that there was only one which went against the Authority.  What is the procedure in that eventuality?  Do the Authority apologise?  We put down this amendment in the genuine belief that two would not be effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Opposition spokesman has been kind enough to commend the members of the present complaints committee for their work.  That commendation is very well deserved and it will be helpful both to the existing committee and to the commission to come in discharging their duties and feeling they have public support behind them and respect for their impartiality.  If I have not made it sufficiently clear already I should like to emphasise now that I am in agreement with the purpose behind the amendment.  It would be desirable to have a larger commission. <Col N="617" /> Possibly five would be the optimum.  I also agree that where possible, we should have some members with broadcasting experience and when constituting the commission I shall aim at meeting these points.  What I am seeking to avoid is this being made mandatory on the Minister because that would cramp the Minister's choice since at any given time five thoroughly suitable people might not be available. The Minister might possibly have misgivings about one or other of the extra two appointees.  They might not be free to give enough of their time to the committee.  I shall take account of what has been said when I am setting up the commission and try to meet the points made but I would seek to avoid this being made mandatory on the Minister.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 5 and 6 to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) A complaint that the Authority failed to comply with the requirements of section 17 of this Act inserted by section 14 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1975.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I understand that if the Authority fail to comply with the provisions of section 14 a complaint cannot be made to the complaints commission that the Authority have failed to live up to their requirements.  Section 14 provides:</P>
      <P>In performing its functions the Authority shall in its programming&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language, <Col N="618" /> (b) uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression, and</P>
    <P>(c) have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State, including in particular those of such countries which are members of the European Economic Community.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section is also incorporated in the 1960 Act.  It is, of course, of vital importance.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that, if the Authority fail to live up to their requirements, the public will not be in a position to make a complaint to the proposed commission. I believe the public should be in a position to complain.  The provisions of section 14 are vitally important and must be implemented by the Authority and so the public should have the right to complain to the proposed commission that this section was not properly upheld, as it would have as regards any other complaint. This complaints commission are the appropriate body to which the public can refer their complaints generally. That is the reason we have put forward this amendment.  It is my interpretation of reading the section that the public will not be at liberty to complain to the complaints commission regarding this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar proposal to this was also made in the Seanad&mdash;the Seanad Debates for 4th June refer&mdash;and I found it necessary in the Seanad to resist this proposal for reasons which I think are strong. It is important that the Bill should not contain provisions which might result in an encroachment by the complaints commission on the legitimate autonomy of the Authority in regard to general programme.  When the idea of the complaints committee was mooted, later by the commission, one of the points which was made by people who had some doubts about the wisdom of this move was that it might result in the setting up of a <Col N="619" /> sort of super-authority which would overrule the existing Authority and lead to confusion.</P>
      <P>I was anxious in the preparation of this Bill, particularly this section, to avoid anything of this kind.  I so assured the Seanad where misgivings on that point were expressed.  I agree that a conflict of jurisdiction would be most undesirable and give rise to uncertainty about the control of broadcasting, an area on which uncertainty is very undesirable.  The proposed amendment provides that the commission could investigate complaints alleging failure by the Authority to comply with the general statutory duties laid down in section 17 of the Act, as will be amended soon. This, in my view, would involve a significant broadening of the functions of the commission to cover general programming as distinct from complaints about individual programmes and would unduly erode the Authority's autonomy in such matters.  I regret therefore that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I see the usefulness of the committee, particularly in the field of the responsibility of the Authority in relation to impartiality and in relation to individual specific programmes.  If a complaint were made that this or that programme was not balanced, was not impartial, as it ought to be&mdash;the kind of criticism which Deputy Lalor expressed here in relation to various programmes yesterday&mdash;the committee would be empowered to have a look at that but would not be placed in the role of a sort of overall court of appeal in relation to the Authority generally to see that the Authority were or were not carrying out their responsibility.  I think that division would be undesirable.</P>

      <P>I do not quite understand the point the Minister is making.  I can appreciate that complaints from the public about individual matters can be more easily dealt with by the commission and that if you get involved in the broad general side of things it can create problems for the Authority, the Minister and the commission.  Nevertheless I fail <Col N="620" /> to see why the commission should not have some function in relation to the general expression of what one would like from RTE, as set out in section 14.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if a person is offended by something said in a programme which is contrary to, for example, subsection (b)&mdash;to uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution&mdash;if something contrary to that is put out in a programme and a member of the public complains to the commission about that, the commission have no right to take up the matter. If you find on some particular programme that somebody makes a very strong attack either on our traditions or on those of other countries, if I understand the Minister rightly this apparently is no concern of the complaints commission.  If that is the case, could the Minister tell me whose concern this would be?  This is an important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding here.  Essentially, the present committee's task is and has been to decide in relation to individual programmes about which there is complaint, if there has been a breach of the Authority's responsibility in relation to impartiality and balance. In fact, this covers in relation to individual programmes pretty well everything that Deputies could wish to see covered.  For example, in the cultural area, if a programme were to be put on which was regarded as offensive to people active in the Irish language movement, their view would undoubtedly be that this was not merely contrary to the general responsibilities about culture but also wrong in relation to balance.  Complaint would only lie if a programme was felt to be unbalanced, not giving due expression to all significant points of view, so that in any area where any interest could be judged to be unfairly treated, the complaints committee could be seized of that.  I feel that gives them adequate power without requiring them to set themselves up as judges of whether in general the Authority are discharging the policy responsibilities properly enjoined on them.  That is the right way of approaching this matter.  It leaves <Col N="621" /> the committee with very wide scope for their investigations because you cannot envisage any programme that could be regarded as seriously wrong if it complies and is felt to comply with the responsibility for balanced impartiality.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> That is just one case that springs to mind: the question of balance would not arise there.  Deputy Lalor pinpointed certain programmes last night as examples of cases where proper balance was not maintained afterwards.  We are arguing that section 14 contains the whole basis of our society and culture, defends our Constitution, and that is why it is enshrined here and places the obligation on the Authority to respond to these calls.  It will be frustrating for a viewer conscious of what the Constitution and culture is all about if he finds these are not taken into consideration in programmes.  To whom will he be able to complain that section 14 is not being adhered to: to the Minister, or to the Authority? <Col N="622" /> The Authority will be judges of their own actions.  The whole purpose of the complaints commission is to ensure that they are apart from the Authority and the Minister and can act impartially and independently in deciding if the principles enshrined in section 14 are upheld by the Authority and generally by RTE.</P>
      <P>I can see the confusion and frustration certain people will experience if they find that section 14 is not being adhered to.  I am not saying that at the moment these considerations are abused in any way.  We are talking about ensuring that in legislation here we make proper provision so that people will have a vehicle for the complaints they are entitled to make if they find there is a breach of section 14 by the Authority.  These matters are of vital interest to certain members of our community who are always concerned to ensure that valuable tradition enshrined in our history is upheld, prepetuated and strengthened if possible.  They are justified in asking that we ensure that they have some commission to which they can complain if the Minister and the Authority fail to live up to their responsibilities. I know that the Minister is finally responsible, but the Authority are entrusted with the day-to-day running of broadcasting.  If they fail to respond to the requirements in this section it is desirable that people concerned about this can forward complaints to a complaints commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is essential some such provision should exist.  Questions of morality and other matters can come into this section if we look at it in a broad sense and we must ensure that our traditions and way of life are upheld. We want people to be in a position to be able to write to the complaints commission and say if they think it is the case that the whole thrust of broadcasting&mdash;not any particular programme&mdash;is not responsive to section 14.  The public are entitled to know whether the complaints commission could adjudicate or not, whether they could say: &ldquo;We have received this complaint from a member of the public&rdquo; and draw the attention of the Minister or the Broadcasting Authority <Col N="623" /> to it.  It is on that basis that we thought an amendment like this desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for clarifying a distinction which I fear I failed to bring out adequately in my earlier remarks.  It is the distinction between a concern with individual programmes and a concern with total programmes.  I cannot imagine any individual programme which can be faulted if it is not faultable on grounds of breach of impartiality. I think we would all agree on that.  The question then is whether the complaints committee should have power in relation to total programming policy.  Should they be able to say: &ldquo;This station is not giving enough, say, to Irish language programmes and are thereby in default in relation to their responsibilities under section 17 or section 14 (5) or whatever it is.&rdquo; There may be a view that that should be done and that is the view behind this amendment.</P>
      <P>My view is that to give the commission such regulatory powers would render the position of the Authority virtually untenable.  It would be setting up a tribunal which would be above them and would overrule them, not merely tell them as the present committee does in relation to a certain programme: &ldquo;You went off the rails there; try to correct that&rdquo;.  That is a modest power but a significant and useful one.  I do not think it necessary to say that, instead of that, the complaints commission can say the Authority are not discharging their general responsibilities under this or that section.  I shall try to confine myself in relation to this complaints committee to what is necessary and, as I thought, necessitated by the fact that in relation to impartiality the Minister of the day should not be the final judge, as impartiality is something that requires another judge&mdash; not the Authority and not the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, in relation to public policy other than impartiality, I think the Authority have certain duties enjoined on them by law in the present section 17 <Col N="624" /> and the new section 14 (5) and that if they are deemed not to have discharged those responsibilities entrusted to them by this House, then they are, first of all, open to criticism themselves and secondly, if they are felt not to respond to that criticism and to persist in what people would regard as failure to discharge their statutory duties, then the person responsible inescapably is the Minister of the day and Deputies opposite him, whoever they may be from time to time, can take the matter up here and say: &ldquo;You are not doing your duty as Minister because the Authority you have appointed are not carrying out their statutory duties and you are doing nothing about it&rdquo;.  That is where the buck should stop in relation to that matter, which is a matter of public policy and not one of fine individual judgments about partiality or impartiality, which is something I believe should be taken away from the Minister for his benefit and the benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>That is the distinction I have sought to maintain here.  I am afraid I am still convinced that it is the right one.  Any RTE Authority that this House might set up would be likely to agree with that view, that their position would be made untenable by turning the complaints commission into a sort of permanent commission of inquiry into whether they are doing right or wrong.</P>

      <P>Why turn down this amendment for the reason just outlined by the Minister and include 18B (c), the subsection which passes on to the commission the responsibility of ensuring that section 17 is complied with?

      <P>The answer is that this is &ldquo;a complaint that by broadcasting matters so specified, the Authority failed to comply with the requirements of section 31 (1) of this Act....&rdquo; This is intended to be something that envisages a complaint about an individual programme, which <Col N="625" /> is the area in which I see the commission acting: in a judgement in relation to an individual programme, not on overall programming policy. That is the distinction which Deputy Fitzpatrick brought out and for which I thanked him.  That is why this can come in.  But the wider responsibilities which are necessarily involved in this amendment, I imagine Deputies opposite would agree&mdash;because it is a very wide responsibility; general failure to comply with the requirements of section 17 of this Bill&mdash;are not desirable for the commission to be asked to undertake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I take it a little further with the Minister?  I understand what the Minister has in mind, that it should be specific complaints about specific programmes.  I can appreciate the danger of the commission getting involved in controversy on broad policy.  At the same time it seems to me that a commission of this kind sitting fairly regularly throughout the year, without getting into too much controversy about any particular item, would be able to build up a broad picture of how the station was performing its functions under section 14.</P>
      <P>If I might turn for a moment to subsection 18 (c) (1)&mdash;I thought the answer to what I wanted was here but apparently it is not&mdash;where it reads:</P>
      <P>As soon as may be after the end of each year, the Commission shall make to the Minister a report of its activities during that year and, subject to subsection (2) of this section, the report shall contain such statements...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There I thought the commission would be able to report in a general way to the Minister.  I think it is probably that aspect Deputy Fitzpatrick has in mind rather than specific cases.  The objective is that the Minister and RTE should have the value of the general conclusion that might be arrived at by the commission after, say, 12 months experience, which would be useful and does not have to point at one specific infringement, but can be a guide both to the <Col N="626" /> Minister and to RTE.  I am very much opposed to the idea of having a sort of witch's hunt on one particular item.  But I am concerned about the general trend that one feels, according to one's view, may not be good, under the general headings in section 14, say, cultural, democratic and so on.  If the Minister could see his way to allowing the commission to report in a general way to him once every six months, or every year, that could be advantageous and does not have to involve the commission in a collision with RTE at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The points which have just been made are entirely reasonable.  It is true that the commission's findings in individual cases might build a broad picture; also they might not.  It seems to me that if RTE by and large are doing their job&mdash;as I believe, by and large, they are&mdash;then the commission's findings would present a more or less random pattern&mdash;that perhaps here and there they had gone off the rails.  It is not a very valid metaphor but they would not be going off the rails in the same direction all the time.  But where any Minister would have cause for concern, and the House also, would be if the commission's findings in individual cases showed a tendency towards lack of balance always in a given direction and that balance not corrected after a set of findings by the commission.  That would show that there was something wrong either with the commission or with RTE and that situation would need to be looked at very carefully.  Such a picture has not emerged to date, but obviously any Minister would watch for the possibility of its emergence and it would be only reasonable that he should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission are obliged to make to the Minister a report of their activities during the year.  I would not put any limitation on that report.  The commission should be there to report to the Minister on all aspects of their activities they feel relevant to their responsibilities and to him.  One of those would certainly be that, if a significant pattern appeared to be present in a series of individual findings, the commission could very properly <Col N="627" /> draw attention to that.  There their responsibilities, as it were, in relation to general programming should end; that is to say, any of their findings should follow from study of individual complaints and individual programmes. If one has that, then the line will be properly drawn between the Authority and the commission.</P>

      <P>There has been a very reasoned discussion on this amendment. I will have a considerable amount to say on the section itself. I still find it difficult to be with the Minister.  The Minister speaks in terms of an annual report.  He used the metaphor of the Authority, or some of its members, not going off the rails in the one direction all the time.  Then the picture was painted that, arising from decisions of the commission, guidelines would be set up and that it should be on them that there would be a spate of complaints in connection with similar items.  I accept that, but there I am speaking in a general way.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment we are discussing, the Minister called the new section 14 loosely the cultural section, and I accept that.  We must accept the fact that this commission will not report to the Minister or to anybody else on the general overall conduct of the Authority.  They will simply report to the Minister at the end of the year on the outcome of their consideration of complaints.  In the unlikely event of there not being a single complaint over a 12-month period, this commission will have nothing to do.  If this is so, credit must be given to the Authority.  Section 14 amends section 17 of the Principal Act, and section 17 amends section 31 of the Principal Act.  The amendment under discussion deals with section 14.  In section 17 the Minister spells out that the Authority are to prevent any incitement to crime.  I would at this stage loosely describe section 17 as the crime section and section 14 as the cultural section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (c) gives the committee power to investigate complaints that a programme or a series of programmes <Col N="628" /> broadcast by RTE were in contravention of section 17.  I accept that the Minister considers it necessary to give the commission power to investigate such breaches.  He says that the commission should not be given the responsibility of investigating complaints of breaches of section 14.  There is a certain amount of justification in that. He says the Authority's responsibility should be to ensure that there is not a breach of section 14, and then this would not arise.  I will try to counter that argument by saying that the Authority should be more adept at seeing that there is no reason for any complaints about breaches of section 17.  I am not saying that section 17 is not as important as section 14.  Both sections are equally important.</P>
    <P>Section 17 attracts most attention at the moment because of a series of complaints in recent times.  It arises from the possibility of a &ldquo;provo&rdquo; being on a programme and objection being taken to incitement to crime or an opportunity being taken to incite to crime.  Section 14, and ensuring that we do not have breaches of that section, is in the long term more important.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the Authority have the responsibility of ensuring, without reference to the complaints commission, that both section 17 and section 14 are complied with.  From our experience of the operation of RTE over the years we know that, even with the best will in the world, the most responsible Authority will find that their wishes have not been fully carried out.  I have not read the Seanad debate. The Minister said that this proposal was made in that House.  I find it difficult to envisage, as the Minister is doing, how we could have something which is in breach of section 14 but still covered in the impartiality and balance section.</P>
    <P>Culture is mentioned a couple of times in this Bill.  I would hate to have to go to the library to do some research and come into this House, as a famous person did before, with a pile of dictionaries to give a definition of culture.</P>
    <P>I do not know how strongly Deputy <Col N="629" /> Fitzpatrick will press this.  I give credit to the Minister because he has no difficulty in spelling out his reasons. He has a wonderful gift of words and a capacity to explain points.  I hope I am putting my point across.  I find it hard to understand why it is clearly spelled out that breaches of section 17 are covered while breaches of section 14 do not need to be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very interesting point and I will come to it in a moment.  I should like to make one or two preliminary points on the earlier part of Deputy Lalor's remarks. One point in particular I would like to clarify.  He refers to the possibility of a spate of complaints. There is of course such a possibility and such possibilities.  I spoke earlier of the committee's findings possibly building up a broad picture and, if things should go wrong, indicating a picture of imbalance.  This is a hypothesis of something that might occur.</P>
      <P>That would only occur not because of a spate of complaints but because of the significant number of complaints which this quasi-judicial body would find to be well-founded.  A spate of complaints itself may prove nothing. The country is full, as all democratic countries are, quite legitimately, of lobbies of different kinds and tendencies who may complain in a given area, but their complaints may not be well-founded irrespective of what kind of lobby they are.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the report and Deputy Lalor made the point that if there were no complaints there would be no report or a very blank report in a given year, and that is so.  What we have to assume is that if no complaints are received then either nothing is seriously wrong or the bodies and individuals who ought to be maintaining vigilance in given areas are not being as vigilant or active as they should be.  I would think, if experience to date is anything to go by, that certainly if anything were going seriously wrong in terms of general policy, the report would be likely to show that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point that Deputy Lalor makes is a very interesting one, that <Col N="630" /> there is a difference between the committee's responsibilities in relation to what he calls the crime section and what you might call the cultural section, and this is true.  Whereas the committee have no specific function in relation to the cultural section other than their function as regards balance and impartiality, they have a specific function in relation to the crime section.  This is true, and the need for this requires to be established here, and the Deputy is quite right to bring out the point.</P>
    <P>The distinction that has to be made is this, and I come back to a point I made earlier: if a proper separation of functions is to be observed between the commission on the one side and the Authority on the other, then the commission must be limited to the study of individual complaints about programmes, while having also the possibility of building up from the results of those individual complaints, if necessary in their reports, a wider picture.  However, they are initially concentrated on individual programmes and not on the general policy decisions of the station.</P>
    <P>In relation to individual programmes, the crime requirements and the cultural requirements suggest different things, in that the cultural responsibilities of a broadcasting station are essentially something diffuse in which there are different characteristics and aspects.  Deputy Lalor acknowledged it was a very complex and difficult concept.  These have to be balanced, and judgments in cultural matters would be of two kinds: (1) was an-individual programme badly balanced or not?  The commission have the power to come in on that; (2) by and large, is the station discharging its cultural responsibilities? The commission do not have that power and I suggest should not have that power.</P>
    <P>Then the question arises quite rightly if they have not that power why should they have power of intervention in relation to incitement to crime?  There are two reasons which lock together.  One is that if culture is complex and diffuse, incitement to crime is specific and concentrated, that <Col N="631" /> is to say, an individual programme could contain that and furthermore could contain it while being capable of being held balanced but falling short in relation to the specific responsibility. To take a grossly oversimplified case, if on a given programme one person says it is all right to murder people in certain circumstances, and another person says no, that on the whole he thinks murder is wrong, that programme might be considered all right in point of balance but it would not be all right in relation to incitement to crime, because incitement to crime is wrong whether there are other people there to refuse it or not.  That is the point of introducing a specific responsibility here into this, because for once the balance requirement is not enough.  We shall be dealing with the section on incitement to crime and I am using that phrase as shorthand for everything that is covered by that section.</P>
    <P>That is why we have judged it desirable to give the commission specific functions in that area while not giving them specific functions in the more diffuse cultural area.  In that latter case we do not think they can be given functions without setting themselves up in judgment over the whole policy control area of the Authority and becoming indistinguishable from a super Authority, which, as I have tried to indicate, I think undesirable and that any authority would consider undersirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that, the commission having been established, they are gaining experience over the years and are getting a better picture than, say, anybody on either side of this House? Could an annual report not have the same value as, for instance, a report made by the Central Bank?  Deputy Lalor has said section 14 is excluded, and the Minister indicated to me a moment ago that the commission could make general observations when they were reporting once a year.  The value of general observations is that the commission could indicate a trend that was undesirable, without, as I said earlier, having witchhunts, for instance snide <Col N="632" /> remarks such as are made on television or attacks on particular groups we are sensitive about like music, culture, language and so on.  We do not want to have little storms blowing up in RTE every now and then because somebody puts his foot in it or somebody has a particular animus and wants to make a name for himself on television.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the Minister does not ask the commission to give their general view at the end of each year he will be losing valuable, fairly objective information, I would imagine, from a commission of this kind whose viewpoint could be transferred to the RTE Authority, not as an assault on a particular item but as a general picture which may help the Authority and the programming staff on RTE.  If a controversy builds up about a particular item, one cannot make progress because people take up positions.  In RTE they take up positions defending whatever they have done, because it is natural to defend the people you are working with.</P>
      <P>On the outside then, as we have seen in the past, you have people rushing in from all sides who want to attack and create controversey. This sort of thing will probably always be with us.  Apart from doing their day-to-day and week-to-week job of investigating individual complaints, I should like the commission to present the Minister with a general consensus view of what the commission's conclusions are, as to how the Broadcasting Authority are fulfilling their function under sections 14 and 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks of Deputies opposite generally will be helpful to the complaints commission in approaching the question of their annual report.  I agree generally with what has been said, subject to some qualifications I will come to in a moment.  I certainly would not wish the commission to feel cramped in any way as to their report.  That is to say they should feel free to report to the Minister any matter which they think arises out of their deliberations and out of their consideration of the complaints that have come before them and the response which they have <Col N="633" /> received from RTE in the course of those inquiries.  At the same time, it has to be seen that they are a complaints commission and their whole proceedings are joined very closely to complaints they receive within a given period.  It is only on these complaints that they can proceed at all, so whether they can have a very wide view of what is going on depends to a considerable extent on the flow of complaints and the nature of them.  Some complaints, of course, can be very trivial.</P>
      <P>However, we have to bear in mind that if there is anything seriously wrong in the conduct of the station at any given period, whatever is wrong must surface in individual programmes and in lack of balance.  If those two things do not happen, if it does not come out in programmes and if it is not visible in terms of lack of balance, it is hard to see that anything seriously wrong could be occurring. One has to assume also a certain amount of vigilance on behalf of the public in matters of great public concern so that if that is happening the complaints commission will, as it were, have enough grist to their mill to grind out something significant.  However, I would like them to repeat that I would wish the commission in their reporting to take note of what has been said here and not to feel that any area is excluded from their report if in relation to that area the complaints they have received and the reaction of the station to them seem to show the need to report regarding dissatisfaction in a given area which might be the section with which they are concerned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not want to hold up the House much longer.  In putting forward this amendment, I believe that section 14 is a fundamental part of the Bill.  I am not a parliamentary draftsman but I believe that the person drawing up a Bill must have some central point in mind.  It is natural to select the basic traditions of our Constitution and try to construct a Bill around them.  We have sections 14 and 17 and section 3 on impartiality. Fundamentally, this is a very <Col N="634" /> important part of protection of our traditions and culture.  I am not going to go into that now but we believe the public could feel frustrated by not having some vehicle whereby they could give vent to their feelings and voice their protests if they feel that this section is not being upheld.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he did not want to confine the operations of the commission.  I certainly do not want to see the commission being inundated with complaints on trivial matters every day.  I do not want to see the Authority being brought to heel over very minor matters.  That would destroy broadcasting.  But it is in case of something fundamental or some important programme which was not properly balanced that the complaints commission would function.  I thought when this amendment was drafted that the people should at least be in a position to be able to complain to the commission.  Whether they are to adjudicate on it or not I am not sure, but they should be in a position to write to the complaints commission and say: &ldquo;In my opinion certain matters contained in section 14 are not being upheld.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the commission refer these complaints and their recommendations on them to the Minister afterwards. It may help the Minister and the Authority that the public have some body to complain to apart from the Authority.  The Authority are the people responsible but, as the Minister said, they cannot be their own judge on matters such as this; we must get a third person.  It may in the long run contribute to a healthy type of broadcasting situation where we have this third party.  I would not like to see them in a position to direct the whole thrust of broadcasting.  None of us on this side of the House ever envisaged that that should be their role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people who are very concerned regarding the protection of our culture and if they see that this is being overlooked on television or is not being given proper coverage&mdash; they may not be able to pinpoint any programme as regards balance&mdash; they could look at section 14 and say: &ldquo;In our opinion a fair response and <Col N="635" /> fair coverage are not being given to this section.&rdquo;  If they are in a position to make complaints to the complaints commission and if the complaints commission in their report at the end of the year noted it and sent it on to the Minister, it may be of help.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 52 to 54, to delete subsection(12).</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to subsection (12) but not on the same lines I am proceeding on at this stage.  It is a question of allowing costs and expenses. The Minister has already adverted to the fact that this is a voluntary commission and is not entitled to any remuneration.  That is why I am putting forward this amendment. The commission will find it necessary at times to ask certain witnesses to attend and it is possible that such witnesses will have to travel to the city and lose pay as a result.  With this in mind I thought the commission should be in a position to allow some kind of costs.  In this section the Minister has prohibited the commission from making any type of such allowance.</P>
      <P>To do their job effectively and get the co-operation of certain witnesses it would be necessary for the commission to be in a position to defray certain types of expenses.  A provision in this section for compensation to such witnesses would help the commission and contribute to getting the proper people to attend for the hearing of complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to preserve a distinction here.  What we envisage in the complaints commission is that while one would hope that its members should have, as the members of the committee have, a judicial attitude and although in that sense they can be regarded as a quasi-judicial body, they are not a court and we do not intend that they should be a court.  We would like to make that distinction absolutely clear.  I do not <Col N="636" /> therefore consider it either desirable or necessary that the commission should have the power to pay the costs or expenses of parties involved in their proceedings because we envisage these proceedings as they have been up to date, and as they are in cases of similar bodies in other countries&mdash;for example, Sweden.  The proceedings are quite simple and relatively cost-free. We would like them to stay that way.</P>
      <P>The four main parties one would expect to be involved in these proceedings are the complainant, RTE, advertisers and, in some cases, the person against whom a complaint is being lodged who may be, and presumably would be, a member of RTE but whose interests might diverge in certain conditions from those of the station.  The complainant's expenses should be minimal.  There is no question of the complainant having to be legally represented or to present his complaints personally to the commission; a letter is all that is needed. This is the case with equivalent bodies in other countries.</P>
      <P>In the case of RTE there would be no point in the commission bearing their costs because the money would eventually come from the same TV licence fees; there is no distinction.  It would not be a great hardship on any advertiser who wishes to present his case to the commission to pay the costs involved which would be likely to be minimal.  In the fourth category, the case of an RTE employee being given access to the complaints commission to argue his case during his normal hours of employment, I understand that RTE would not withhold pay for the period of absence involved. Accordingly, I see no need for statutory provisions for payment of expenses by the commission.  If we deleted the relevant subsection and created an expectation thereby that costs and expenses might be payable, it would be undesirable.  I regret that, after due consideration, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am speaking a little at large on this but we have to bear in mind that when we are speaking of a complaint regarding something broadcast we are not in the area where one often is in relation to ordinary litigation where people are testifying about things that happened in unknown circumstances privately in the past.  The complainant in this case is complaining about something that has been broadcast to the public and therefore the matter about which he is complaining is known.  Essentially, and presumably in most cases, there would be a record of its being broadcast.  It is hard to see in what circumstances it would be necessary to bring him along personally.  He cannot testify to anything that hundreds or thousands of other people had seen or heard.  All he has to do is to ask the complaints committee to have a look at something and talk to the people at the station about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel as strongly about this amendment as I did about the previous one, but the Minister has conceded that he is to an extent speaking in a vacuum in that we have not the experience.  In another subsection we have the situation whereby the commission after consultation with the Authority would be making <Col N="638" /> rules and procedures regarding complaints. In relation to the function of the commission, I feel that RTE will be protected.  We are setting up a commission to investigate complaints against RTE but there are a lot of subsections in the Bill to protect RTE.  I am afraid that the section is geared more against the complainant than it should be.  It should be an effort to see to it that a legitimate complaint is properly and fully examined.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us of the people who would be likely to be requested to attend at an inquiry if the commission decided to hold an oral inquiry rather than deal with a complaint in writing.  In reply to a question earlier, the Minister said that there is provision that the form of the complaint must be in writing.  The complaint must be made in writing to the Authority within 30 days, and before they can deal with it a person must have complained to RTE and apparently not have got satisfaction. I wonder if it is wise for the Minister to include subsection (12), to which this amendment relates, because I can visualise a situation whereby the commission could decide that it could be a good thing to award expenses and that it might be as well not to build in the straightforward statutory prohibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Costs or expenses have not been mentioned.  Does exclusion of the word &ldquo;damages&rdquo; mean that the commission could award damages?  There have been complaints through the newspapers recently about the broadcasting of current prices at supermarkets. There is a weekly feature, a radio programme compered by Gay Byrne, which provides free advertising on behalf of six prominent supermarkets. It amazed me that, up to recently, independent shopkeepers had not been protesting about this. If a complaint under this heading were to be submitted to the complaints commission, a good lawyer on behalf of the complainants could make a strong case that some of these independent grocers and retailers had been seriously affected by this programme. <Col N="639" /> In my capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce I met a number of those people.  One shop that has been featured prominently on this programme has been Ben Dunne's.  Let me say categorically that I have the highest respect for this man and I admire him as an outstanding businessman.  That is where a legitimate complaint could be made.</P>
    <P>There are two forms of paying for our broadcasting, one is the licence fee and the other is the income derived from advertising.  Most of those advertising spots have to be paid for.  I often wonder how right it is that immediately before 10 o'clock in the morning, before Miss Mahon comes on with her fish prices, we have the advertising voice of Gay Byrne telling us to buy our goods in a certain shop in Capel Street or something like that, or that Cornelscourt is better value than anywhere else in town, and five minutes later we have Gay Byrne, the commentator, in charge of a very interesting and brilliant programme from 10 a.m. until 11 a.m.  He is then giving factual data and the majority of housewives feel satisfied that everything that is said by Gay Byrne during that hour is factual.  I have no doubt that everything is expected to be factual.  It is an outstanding programme and he does a lot of good for a number of deserving causes.  During that hour he spells out that you can buy tinned peas in six or seven shops at different prices and that the shopping basket for this week shows that the prices collectively are cheaper in Dunne's than in Quinsworth or Superquinn and so on.  There is a consistency in the fact that Ben Dunne's prices seem to be cheaper than anybody else's out of the selected basket gone through.  This could be termed advertising in its own way.  Is it coincidental that his wife is the woman who does the sponsored programme for Ben Dunne's later on that day?  I am not suggesting this is a subject for a complaints commission but I was not surprised that some shopkeepers reached the end of their tether in that regard a short time ago.  On the other hand, the information conveyed in the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; is very useful <Col N="640" /> and helps people to be more competitive.</P>
    <P>In regard to the broadcasting complaints commission Deputy Fitzpatrick was pressing for, it would take five very wise heads to sort that out. I suggest that, while at present the Minister does not visualise a situation whereby the complaints commission should have the power to award costs and expenses, someone affected by something said or done on television could be deprived because of the inclusion of this subsection of being paid some expenses or compensation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is legislation whereby affected parties have the right to bring an action of this kind against RTE but only those whom we regard as being in the moneyed set could afford to take such action because of the cost involved. This would be a prohibitive factor in the case of the ordinary individual who would consider RTE to have unlimited moneys to enable them to engage learned counsel and so on. Therefore, the only recourse which the ordinary citizen would be likely to have would be the complaints commission. In these circumstances would the Minister not consider it well to exclude the statutory prohibition which he proposes here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Some part of Deputy Lalor's remarks, which were very interesting, would, perhaps, be more closely relevant to the section generally.  On the amendment he made one very important and specific point when he referred to damages and said that the provision whereby the commission shall not have any power to award costs or expenses to any party might by omission appear to imply that they had power to award damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not wish the wording to be so construed, so between this and Report Stage I shall consult with the parliamentary draftsman to ascertain whether we ought to say &ldquo;cost, expenses or damages to any party&rdquo;.  I am afraid that the Deputy's argument has led me to be more rather than less specific.  I wish to make it absolutely clear that this complaints procedure is very informal and, I <Col N="641" /> hope, consistently inexpensive because that is part of the point of it. It is not intended as a substitute for recourse to the courts.  RTE are no more above the law than any newspaper and should they say something which is damaging to an individual or to a group of persons, the injured should have the ordinary recourse in law.  That procedure can be costly but the commission is intended for a situation where a citizen sees, for example, a lack of balance in a programme and would like that to be corrected.  If a person considers his private or personal interests to be damaged seriously, the commission procedure would not be his form of recourse because they are not intended as any substitute for ordinary legal recourse.  It is desirable to have this explicit provision so that there be no expectations which the commission cannot fulfil.  For example, people must be aware that the commission will not be in a position to pay the expenses involved in an individual coming from Kerry, Donegal or anywhere else to air his grievance.  All the aggrieved person has to do is to write a letter to the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <P>I assume that most Deputies would agree with what the Minister has said.  The attraction of this commission is their informality, in other words, that there would not be the necessity for recourse to solicitors, senior counsel and so on. This machinery will be all the better for being informal.</P>
      <P>There is a question I wish to put to the Minister although it may not be relevant directly.  If, for example, I were to make a complaint, it would be directed first to the Authority and in the event of my not being satisfied with their reply, I would make the complaint to the commission&mdash;a procedure which could involve a period of 60 days.  My recollection is that the Authority must retain material for a certain period after it has been broadcast.</P>

I have no wish to name names but if a person is very popular with listeners or viewers it seems to me that there must be a question mark in regard to he or she filling in the advertising slots.

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I have very little to add to what has been said already.  Deputy Lalor has made the point that it might be better to exclude this section in its entirety.  On the question of expenses which, in terms of travel, for instance, can be substantial.  I should hope that the factor is one which would be taken into account.  I should hope, too, that machinery be provided which would obviate the necessity of going to court. In the case of damages the amount of compensation could be very little so every effort should be made to save both the aggrieved and the Authority the embarrassment and the cost of going to court.  In private enterprise grievances are usually resolved in a simple way.  Many grievances never reach the courts.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am concerned lest this section would render it obligatory on the RTE Authority, irrespective of how small might be the amount of compensation involved, to have recourse to the courts.  We shall be happy to have the Minister have another look at this but we put forward the amendment on the basis that the best way of obtaining balanced evidence is by means of interview rather than letter. They must not be impeded by people saying: &ldquo;I cannot come along that day because of the nature of my job&rdquo; or &ldquo;I could not afford the travelling expenses&rdquo;.  It might be better if the <Col N="643" /> section were not in the Bill.  However, the Minister deems it necessary.  There is certain merit in our amendment. Deputy Lalor and Deputy Brugha put forward our arguments.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 11, after &ldquo;particulars of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;all&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment may not be of any great significance.  If accepted section 18C would read:</P>
      <P>(1) As soon as may be after the end of each year, the commission shall make to the Minister a report of its activities during that year and, subject to subsection (2) of this section, the report shall contain such statements (if any) as the Commission thinks fit giving particulars of all decisions made by it pursuant to this Act, and copies of the report shall, as soon as may be, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure that the commission submit a report of all decisions.  As it is worded, the commission can submit such reports as they think fit.  It would be better for the Minister to receive all the commission's reports.  The Minister might be a better person to adjudicate on the reports.  As the section stands, the commission can choose the reports they submit to the Minister.  It is my contention that the Minister should have the benefit of all the reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the intention of the amendment.  I think the commission will wish to meet that intention. I cannot accept the amendment, not because of any doubt about what is intended, but because there is a specific category of exceptions which ought to be protected.  Section 18C of <Col N="644" /> the Bill as it stands provides that the commission's annual report shall contain such statements, if any, as the commission think fit giving particulars of decisions made by them and subsection (2) contains a mandatory provision that the report shall contain particulars of all decisions which are contested by the Authority. Moreover, under section 4 18B (2) of the Bill the Commission must, where they consider it appropriate, publish particulars of decisions as they are made or require the Authority to do so.</P>
      <P>I would expect that under these provisions the commission would in general publish particulars of all their decisions.  However there might be the rare case where it would be preferable not to do so.  The type of case I have in mind is an encroachment of privacy where RTE accepted that the complaint was valid.  In such a rare case&mdash;and I would expect that it would be rare&mdash;publication of particulars about the complaint could involve, or be felt to involve, further unnecessary encroachment on the privacy of the complainant.  Probably Deputies would want to take that into consideration.  In view of that possible case I consider that the section, as drafted, goes as far as is appropriate. I am sorry therefore that I am not prepared to accept the amendment, although I think the commission will bear in mind the intention behind it.</P>

      <P>I expected the Minister to speak on the section.  I have to meet a deputation and I will be held up after 3.30 p.m.  The Minister will have an opportunity to comment before I get back.  It is not out of lack of respect for the Minister that I am not giving way.  I find a broad fault in the section.  There is provision in the first few sections that the Minister may, with the permission of the Minister for Finance, make finance available to the commission for the performance of their functions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has paid tribute to the existing committee.  Tribute is due to them for the manner in which they have operated up to now.  I may not have agreed with their decisions.  I have had the opportunity of studying the outcome of some of their inquiries into the complaints made.  As the Minister said, there were ten in all. Two are still under consideration. There were seven decisions favourable to RTE and one against them.  I want to talk about the one against them.</P>
      <P>This is a very long and wordy section.  Built into it are the arrangements as to how the complaints commission will operate.  One thing which has been overlooked is the fact that the commission have no teeth.  The only real end product in the whole section is subsection 18B (7) which reads:</P>
      <P>As soon as may be after they decide on a complaint made under this Act, the Commission shall send to the person making the complaint and to the Authority a statement in writing of their decision on the complaint.</P>
      <P>Bob's your uncle! Subsection (9) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Authority receives a statement of a decision from the Commission pursuant to subsection <Col N="646" /> (7) of this section, the Authority shall, not later than fourteen days after its receipt, inform the Commission in writing whether or not the Commission's decision is accepted by the Authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if somebody writes in with a complaint from Kerry there will be no provision in the Bill to pay his expenses for coming up from Kerry to an oral hearing.  When the commission's decision is sent to the Authority the Director General calls a meeting of the Authority. They are brought up from Kerry or Donegal or anywhere else and their expenses are paid, and rightly so. They say: &ldquo;The commission have told us that such and such a programme was not balanced.  An injustice was done to somebody.  What do we do about it?&rdquo;  They have to write back within 14 days saying whether they have accepted the commission's decision.  If they do not accept the decision, where do we go from there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the editorial referred to. <Col N="650" /> A decision to increase the overall strength of the force would be a matter for the Government, and I am not in a position at this stage to say if a further increase will be decided on.  I do not rule out the possibility that a further increase in the strength of the force will be decided on but I would point out that it has already been increased by almost 2,000, or approximately 30 per cent, since March, 1971 and that the Estimate for the Garda Síochána for 1976 stands at £57.8 million.</P>
      <P>One way or the other, it behoves us to ensure that the resources available for policing are utilised to the best possible advantage and I expect that the work of the management consultants who are carrying out an assignment in respect of the Garda Síochána will assist in ensuring the most efficient deployment of those resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this editorial was based on the present strength of the Garda and would he accept that views such as those should get serious consideration?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that, although those views in that journal are not official, they merit consideration and indeed the editorial was sensitive to the Garda image in the context of a crime wave that was occurring at that time.  Subsequent events have more than restored public confidence in the force, if indeed it needed restoration. On the question of numerical strength, as I have indicated, management consultants are engaged in an in-depth survey of the force and we hope to have the report in July or August of this year.  I think it would be wrong to anticipate the findings of that survey in regard to an increase in numbers.  The sensible thing is to wait until the report is to hand in a matter of a couple of months.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Garda themselves say that the basic principles of policing <Col N="651" /> and fighting crime are being largely abandoned in the interests of economy?  Is he aware that the Garda are saying they could do much better in the fight against crime and violence if the resources were made available to them?

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice when he proposes to restore Garda foot patrols in urban areas, particularly in Dublin, after 6 p.m. each day in view of the grave apprehension of the people in the face of increasing lawlessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question suggests that there are no foot patrols in urban areas after 6 p.m.  That is not the case.  Foot patrols operate in urban areas generally and particularly in the Dublin Metropolitan Area to the maximum extent possible in relation <Col N="653" /> to station strength and other Garda commitments.  Every effort is made to ensure beat coverage at night and in particular problem areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that throughout a very large area of the suburbs of Dublin city, in particular-and perhaps the situation is the same in other urban areas throughout the country-because of an absence of any adequate police presence law and order simply does not exist after 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the evening in these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware and to attempt to paint a picture such as the Deputy has painted is, I submit to him with respect, irresponsible because it conjures up a situation of complete lawlessness which is far from the case and must cause a lot of public unrest and disquiet.  It is not the case and there is a police presence throughout the country.  There are police beat patrols carried out at night in Dublin city and in problem areas generally, whether they be in Dublin city or in other parts of the country.  To suggest otherwise is very wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to accept accusations of irresponsibility from the Minister but I assure him they will not deter me from doing my duty in regard to my constituency in this regard.  I want to ask the Minister if he is aware that, for instance, in the Coolock area of Dublin&mdash;a typical suburb&mdash;the vast majority of residents there live in terror of lawlessness and marauding gangs, that public property, in the form of schools and other buildings, is vandalised continuously, practically every evening, and that it is almost impossible for community organisations, sporting organisations and other bodies of that sort to carry on their normal business and activities because of the rampant lawlessness prevailing in those areas?  Is the Minister further aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had representations from responsible people in Dublin concerning incidents of vandalism in particular parts of Dublin city.  I have answered many questions in this House on the problem of vandalism.  I have indicated that vandalism is essentially a social problem and that the Garda, by themselves, cannot solve the problem of vandalism.  I also indicated that vandalism is something which breaks out without any particular reason in different areas at different times; it is essentially a social problem.  I have had discussions with community representatives on the problem and I know that they have also talked to senior Garda officers from time to time.  It is under constant review and any assistance I or the Garda can give people plagued by the problem is willingly given.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, that certain complaints against the firm in question were received by the Garda Síochána and have been inquired into by them in so far as that has been possible.  Their inquiries have been completed only very recently and <Col N="658" /> their report has been submitted to the law officers for consideration.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that the submission of the report to the law officers is routine in any situation of this kind and it carries no implication as to whether the Garda believe that the facts alleged constitute a ground for alleging that a criminal offence was committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Chair.  Is the Minister aware they have collected over £125,000 from over 15 different counties and left the people, having paid £4,800 each for buildings that cost only £800 for the amount of work done, without redress and is the Minister aware that the people who carried out this fraud have skipped the country while the investigations are going on in spite of the promise made that they would not be allowed to leave the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not concede there was any delay on the part of the Garda in carrying out the investigation. Until such time as the Director of Public Prosecutions decides a prosecution should be taken there cannot be any restriction obviously on a person's liberty to leave the country.  To say there was some negligence on the part of the Garda that permitted people to go out of the country is wrong and unfair to the Garda.  The complaint was investigated in the normal way and with all possible speed.  I cannot comment on the figures beyond saying the figures I have are considerably less than the figures quoted by the Deputy though, I concede to the people who <Col N="659" /> have been allegedly defrauded, that is no consolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say when the allegations were first made to the Garda? Is the Minister aware allegations were made at the same time to the Minister for Local Government, and his officers investigated, and also reported to the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the information available to me that statements of complaint were made to the Garda in July, 1975.  It is possible complaints were made at an earlier date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the Deputy ask the Minister for Local Government about that.  I know this particular exercise was carried out in such a way that it appeared to all intents and purposes a perfectly legal and normal building transaction. When it reached a certain stage there was to all intents and purposes merely failure to fulfil a contract.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the boundary line between mere failure to fulfil a contract and the commission of a crime is a very fine one and it is very often difficult to establish when that line is crossed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay and I am inhibited by the ruling of the Chair, which I respect and which was right and proper in the circumstances, but it is not just a question of failure to fill a contract. There was a succession of flagrant breaches of contract by this firm which should have been investigated long since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, this is a very complex problem and, because of certain aspects of it, there is at least a serious doubt about the proposition that BanGhardaí can be of more assistance in curbing it than male gardaí.</P>
      <P>In fact, some extra gardaí&mdash;that is, male gardaí&mdash;were recently assigned to this work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has already done in this matter but I am assured by competent social workers that some of these women have mental problems and to my own knowledge they are being cruelly exploited by gangsters and pimps, both native and foreign, and we want an advisory service.  The Minister might take a new approach by having this advisory service constituted of women rather than the traditional approach of just arresting these unfortunates.  Would the Minister also take steps to deport the foreign gangsters and pimps who are exploiting these women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that if any such people were convicted they would be deported.  In regard to the other matters raised by the Deputy, I suggest these are sociomedico matters which are not within the competence of the Ban-Ghardaí. They would be matters more properly for the Eastern Health Board.</P>

The allocation of the Department of Health, which is pretty substantial, has been exhausted as far as voluntary hospitals and health boards are concerned.  I could not promise the Deputy I would be in a position to advance any money in the year 1976.</P>

      <P>I do not think priority arises here; it is a matter of cabling, a matter of physical capacity to install the telephone.  For a good many years past the procedure has been that priority on grounds of liability to receive emergency calls for medical reasons is limited to doctors and nurses employed by health authorities on district nursing duties, that is, not even to all nurses.  To extend priority to telephones to be installed in the homes of people doing welfare and charitable work would swell the priority list and open the way to representations in a kind of grey area.  I am not at present satisfied that requires to be done.  In the particular case with which this question is concerned it is a matter of physical incapacity to deliver.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the recent appreciable increase in noise disturbance levels for those living in north city and county Dublin, he will introduce regulations to control the noise level of aircraft using Dublin Airport, without endangering the safety of passengers and crew, as has been done at many other airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are procedures for noise abatement already in force at Dublin Airport.  These procedures do not take the form of statutory regulations but they are operated by air traffic control and the airlines in a manner consistent with safety and the orderly flow of traffic and are designed to minimise the effects of aircraft noise in the vicinity of the airport.  I do not accept that there has been a recent appreciable increase in noise levels in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept that there has been a recent increase.  I live quite close to the airport and it is a problem that is getting worse every day, particularly with some of the newer planes used by some of the foreign companies, especially British Airways with their Tristar and Trident.  It may be more of a problem on take off with foreign pilots who are not familiar with Dublin Airport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with that side of it.  This is happening within the last three or four weeks.  I would ask the Minister to have examined the type of regulations that are in force, for example, at Liverpool Airport where at take-off a certain reduction in engine thrust is enforced which, while not endangering passengers or crew allows sufficient power to get the aircraft off the ground.</P>

      <P>The task of the IDA is to maximise the effect of the amount of money it has to spend.  In pursuit of that aim, a certain amount of flexibility is desirable.  In view of the availability of premises and the continuing cost benefit analysis that they have to carry on, they believe that there will be no significant increase in the desirability of the location to compensate for the extra cost of adding this particular incentive to the already maximum grant available.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that if the IDA are empowered to make those special offers they should have been made in other places which had not got the same <Col N="679" /> opportunities as Carndonagh?

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22, and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to state again my intention, already announced, to introduce legislation to provide for the control and regulation of the construction of oil and gas off-shore production platforms in order to ensure that the limited number of suitable sites for such works is used to the best advantage.  My legislative proposals <Col N="680" /> would require that platform construction could not be undertaken except under a licence granted by me.</P>
    <P>In addition, in order to avoid a position where a suitable site, although not in use, would not be available to builders who would otherwise be in a position to obtain orders, I have authorised the IDA to purchase a site at Castletownbere which is considered to be most suitable.  This site will be leased to builders who have obtained orders.  At present I do not consider it necessary that the authority should purchase a second site.</P>
    <P>As regards Killary Harbour, I understand that full planning permission was granted on a temporary basis by Galway County Council for the construction of a floating concrete caisson at the site there and that this permission will expire in July, 1976.</P>
    <P>According to the advice available to me, the water depths at the entrance to Killary Harbour are inadequate to cater for all but the smallest structures, and the harbour is, therefore, limited as to the type of structures which can be built there.</P>
    <P>It is not the policy to give grant aid for platform construction projects.</P>

      <P>I cannot give a firm answer.  There is a very slack demand situation at this moment.  If there is a need for a second location, then that is a course of action the IDA can take. They are not committed to taking it, neither do they rule it out.  The purchase of a site ties up a good deal of money and there is no point purchasing a site which is never used. There is a shortage of people ordering such platforms at this time.  I should like to see the one site they own utilised before considering the purchase of a second.</P>

      <P>My information would suggest the contrary.  It seems that cement is available within Northern Ireland at a lower price than it is here. This is one of the reasons which can be identified.

That formal notification of the Commission's decision has been received by us and our limited derogation from the provision of the equal pay directive have been rejected by the Commission.</P>

      <P>I do not have a written statement.  What I am saying is on the basis of information.  That was the core of the 1975 amending Bill.  No employer could have availed of its provisions without the agreement of the workers concerned.  The provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill, 1975, together with the scrutinising power of the Labour Court, would have ensured full implementation of the equal pay Act, 1974, in all cases save those where the workers had genuine grounds for concern about the future of their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the view of the Government that the decision of the Commission to refuse us procedures which would give us the right to agree on the speed of implementation of the equal pay provisions of the 1974 Act compels us to seek special financial aid to deal with the employment consequences which could follow immediate implementation of equal pay in the case of certain <Col N="689" /> firms.  The question of such aid has been discussed with the Commission officials, and following the Commission's rejection of our proposals, a formal submission will be made within the coming week.</P>

      <P>First of all, could I ask the Minister when this communication was received from Brussels, in view of the fact that I was told in this House only yesterday morning that the communication had not yet been received?  I presume the information given was not incorrect in view of the Minister's rather haphazard and confusing statement here this afternoon.  I presume we are to take it now that the 1974 Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, in spirit and principle, as passed and accepted by both Houses of the Oireachtas is now law and that sex and marriage discriminations will disappear in all our services.  I take it that is what the Minister is telling us in this rather ambiguous statement that was prepared in a very hurried manner.</P>
      <P>We fully understand the difficulties that exist and may be created in the private sector.  When the amending Bill was introduced in the earlier part of this year we suggested that the solution to it was the soliciting of financial aid from Europe for the private industries which would possibly be affected by the implementation of equal pay.  The lack of preparedness of the Minister in introducing this statement and the confusion as to when the communication was received from Brussels is a further indictment of this Minister and this Government in their handling of the equal pay situation from the beginning.</P>

It is clear, and the Deputy knows from his knowledge of the community, that none of the existing instruments of the community would appear to assist us in the question of people losing their jobs as a result, in certain cases perhaps, of the full implementation of equal pay without the possibility of the employees deciding on the speed of implementation which was the kernel of our own procedure.  That has been rejected by the Commission.  Following their rejection we would be looking for financial aid to assist in maintaining the jobs of those who might be without them because our procedures were turned down.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with section 4, I found a number of faults in its presentation even though there are a great number of words in it.  Specifically, no qualifications whatsoever are prescribed for membership of the commission as such except that Members of the Oireachtas or the RTE Authority or their officers or servants are ineligible. The Oireachtas have no control whatsoever over these appointments nor any power to investigate the suitability or qualifications of the proposed appointees.  Nevertheless, these persons are to be in a position where they are to be removed only by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, as if they were Supreme or High Court judges protected by Article 35 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respectfully submit that this is an exercise in nonsense which should be rejected out of hand.  As I have said already, this section covers four pages of the 13½ pages that go into the Bill, covering details of the type of case which the commission may investigate and so on.  When this Bill was first presented the media were thrilled with it. Here was the Minister implementing a promise he had given of setting up a watch-dog and taking the power away from himself, something like the Minister for Local Government setting up <Col N="694" /> the statutory bodies who consider appeals, thus taking the matter out of political hands.  He was taking away the right which former Ministers had to give specific directives in various areas.  No doubt the intention of these four pages was to create the impression that the commission would be a powerful controlling influence on RTE, that we could all go home fully satisfied that everything was specifically laid on the line for the Authority, that strict control and impartiality would be operated and things would be kept that way, and that we were going to have no more maverick imbalance within the machinations of RTE because of the judicial eyes of this commission.</P>
    <P>But things are not as was suggested at that time.  I have asked the House already basically to plod with me through pages 3, 4 and 5 to the middle of page 6 of this Bill, and they will find this little subsection (7) concerning what happens when all of the ritual circumnavigations that have been prescribed in pages 3, 4 and 5 have been complied with and performed and the report on the complaint reaches the RTE Authority.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister are the Authority to take speedy steps to redress the offence if an offence is judged to have been committed?  That is not what subsection (7) says.  What subsection (7) says is that when the Authority receive a statement of a decision of a complaint from the commission then&mdash;carrying on to subsection (9)&mdash;the Authority shall within 14 days specifically inform the commission as to whether the decision is accepted by the Authority.  This means that the commission, provided for at such length, by this subsection, have no real power whatsoever to control RTE and are no more than a piece of toothless verbosity.  The small print in subsection (7) shows that the insurance policy, which is what section 4 is supposed to be, is worthless.  So far as the Bill goes RTE might light its pipe with the commission's report.  This might sound ridiculous, but as an end product this is what section 4 of this Bill means.</P>
    <P>Some people may think that the existence of a commission and the <Col N="695" /> possibility of adverse reports would suffice to keep RTE on the straight and narrow and ensure that they would deal with all matters objectively and impartially.  The hope of the Minister in this regard is that by setting up this complaints commission the Authority will be able to keep their operatives on the straight and narrow.</P>
    <P>One of the Sunday newspapers reproduced a photograph recently of two scarecrows standing in a field in my constituency and that newspaper made reference to the fact that they were still continuing with the old-fashioned way of trying to keep away the crows.  I compare section 4 with the scarecrows and the presentation and dressing of those scarecrows.  It spreads over four pages and is an effort to frighten the mavericks within RTE who might be tempted to continue with an unbalanced presentation of programmes.  The Minister is giving statutory authority to what is already in existence.  Yesterday the Minister made reference to reports which had appeared in the <i>RTE Guide</i> and today he spoke of guidelines and various decisions of the commission being used to keep the Authority on the straight and narrow.  I intend to quote from a report of the Broadcasting Complaints Advisory Committee which appeared in the <i>RTE Guide</i> on November 29th in relation to a complaint made by the Language Freedom Movement.  That report is the most suitable one to choose from rather than some of the reports referred to last night.  In the case of the latter the complaints had been rejected by the complaints advisory committee.</P>
    <P>Having made the criticism last night of operators or comperes within RTE riding their own hobby-horses I do not want it to appear that I am continuing on that track.  The Minister made a justifiable point in relation to the commission when he said that we can expect that, just as a Supreme Court decision is taken as a guideline for similar cases in the future, so also would a decision of the Broadcasting Complaints Advisory Committee be taken as a guideline.  We seldom have <Col N="696" /> an appeal to the Supreme Court against a decision made by a lesser court based on a previous decision of the Supreme Court.  I am satisfied that if the commission made a decision it would be unlikely that people with a similar complaint later would appeal to the commission.  We have guidelines in regard to the conduct of business in this House.  Those guidelines are often quoted to us and we are often told that precedents have been created in similar situations.  This is the pattern and society demands that that sort of pattern be created.</P>
    <P>I presume the commission will be set up, in spite of the opposition here. I do not know whether the Minister will be tempted to appoint the same personnel on this established commission. That is a matter for himself and the Cabinet and we only enter into it if the Minister decides he wants to remove them at some stage.  In that event he returns to this House just as the Government must do if they wish to remove a High Court or Supreme Court judge.  They are placed on that sort of pedestal.  The case I have referred to, the complaint by the Language Freedom Movement, concerned the failure, as they saw it, of RTE to give publicity to a private meeting between the Language Freedom Movement representatives and the Minister for Education.  They felt that RTE was being used against them. That group, I should add, did not go out of their way to any great extent to praise Fianna Fáil when we were in power.  I should now like to quote an extract from the report on that complaint, as published in the <i>RTE Guide:</i></P>
    <P>RTE is not a debating society. The Committee does not accept the suggestion (made to it on several occasions) that if it can be anticipated that the participants in any programme will probably unite in putting forward a particular viewpoint it is automatically necessary or even desirable to include in the programme a speaker or speakers of opposing views.  Any such obligation might be calculated to produce a series of inconclusive dull and often acrimonious debates.  Such a <Col N="697" /> framework may sometimes be advisable and sometimes not.  A wide discretion must be allowed to programme producers whose business it is to present such news and features as in their judgement are of the greatest public significance and the widest public interest and to do so with due regard to accuracy, truth and informed comment.</P>
    <P>That was the observation of the committee in relation to an aspect of that complaint.  That was working on the basis of a code, on the acceptance of the directive of the Director General of RTE of May, 1970, which, I submitted last night, was in contrast to section 18 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with this question of balance last night.  The relevant code, which I presume was set out by the director general, following discussions with the Authority, must recognise that it may not always be practicable to represent all significant views in a single programme, with another programme presented within a reasonable time to balance it.  We still have that in the new Bill. I use this specific example from the complaints advisory committee report in order to make a point, because in its own way it reveals the outlook of the complaints advisory committee and of RTE.  This report says that the committee do not look upon RTE as a debating society.  The alternative to the debating society concept and to debate itself, is a propaganda machine and the suppression of freedom of speech, or suppression of freedom of speech for certain people.  No discretion was given by the Oireachtas to producers or anyone else to suppress legitimate views publicly expressed. In so far as any non-statutory code purports to give RTE such a power it is in breach of the statutory obligations imposed on RTE in the former Bill and I hope in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The vagueness about a reasonable time still exists and it in fact gives <i>carte blanche</i> to RTE to play fast and loose with propaganda and to pretend to discharge their obligations of balance and impartiality by giving a few minutes now and then to speakers <Col N="698" /> for views which have been decried over several programmes.  The looseness which was made use of in the last Bill, such as the reasonable period part, is something which should not have been built into this Bill.  I respectfully suggest that what is really needed is something that was mentioned from this side of the House when the Minister and his party were represented here, that was that there should be an Oireachtas Committee set up with powers to call on RTE to account for failure to comply with the statutory conditions and the limitations prescribed for RTE by the Oireachtas, if that arises. That should be set up instead of this type of selected complaints commission in view of the fact that the Authority are now going to be created by the Government and can only be sacked by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that we can have a free and frank discussion in the House on this Bill.  The difficulty is that once the Bill is passed into law, if Deputies make any effort to raise a question here, referring to what they might see as mishandling of programmes on RTE they will be told politely by the Minister that there is an appropriate channel through which they can address their complaints, that the Minister felt that it would be improper to interfere or to convey the problem through his office to the Authority, and that the proper procedure would be to convey complaints through the complaints commission. I apologise for holding the Minister in this instance.  I have spelt out a number of points that I would like him to comment on.  The major fault of this section apart from the other faults is that no matter how serious a complaint is or how justified a complaint may turn out to be, the complaints commission have no teeth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Lalor cannot be here to hear my reply to the points he made.  We have dealt with the amendments and I would now like to convey the Government's thinking in relation to the section.  Deputy Lalor was critical of the section generally and indeed at <Col N="699" /> times was scornful in relation to the whole concept.  That is a pity, because I think the complaints commission is a useful concept, widely regarded as useful elsewhere, and its presence is welcomed both by the public and the broadcasters.  I hope it will have, as appeared at earlier stages of the debate, widespread support here.  Deputy Lalor suggested that a great deal had been made on this side of this complaints commission idea, and it had been extravagantly welcomed in the media and so on.  That is not the case; there is no reason to make a great song and dance about this.  We are not claiming that this is an extraordinary revolutionary proceeding because it is not.  It is a body which we hope will function informally, expeditiously and not very obtrusively, and that it will be useful.  A point was made in the Seanad that in proportion to what the commission will do, the length and detail of the section appears to be excessive. That was my first reaction when it came back from the draftsman's office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor suggested&mdash;he probably did not mean it very seriously&mdash; that the length of the section was designed to make some sort of propaganda on behalf of the work that it would be doing.  There was no such intention.  If it could have been shorter and still cover the ground that needed to be covered I would have been very happy but it transpired from discussions with the parliamentary draftsman that it was necessary to spell out in a fair amount of detail what had to be done.  If that caused an undue impression of the momentousness of the new rule I am sorry and I am taking this opportunity of dispelling that.  The thrust of Deputy Lalor's remarks concerned the idea that the committee and commission have no teeth or no real power to control RTE and that RTE might light its pipe with the commission's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section as drafted the Broadcasting Complaints Commission will have no power to enforce their decisions.  However, any broadcasting authority that ignored the findings of <Col N="700" /> the commission would be very unwise. In the final analysis if there were repeated complaints which the commission accepted as well-founded, that the Authority were in breach of certain statutory provisions, for example, those in regard to objectivity and impartiality, I have no doubt that the Government of the day would take appropriate action, that is to say, make appropriate recommendations to the Oireachtas.  While we should not have a superabundance of teeth in relation to broadcasting, ultimately the teeth are with the Oireachtas. This Bill is designed to make that more precisely clear.  I do not think we should abandon that function to a complaints commission.  It is for the complaints commission to point a finger at spots where things are going wrong and it is for the Minister and the Government, and, ultimately, if matters worsen, for the Oireachtas to take action.</P>
    <P>I would assume first that any authority which any government are likely to appoint would be likely to take their duties seriously, that they would not be disposed to light their pipe with the report of a complaints commission if the findings indicated that something was wrong.  Any authority would wish to look into what was going wrong as would any body of prudent people with these responsibilities.  We ought to assume that there will be prudence but even in the event of some failure in that regard any authority would be bound to take cognisance of the fact that if there were repeated findings of this kind by a commission&mdash;findings that biased or unsatisfactory programmes in respect of balance or in respect of incitement to crime, for example, had been going out on RTE&mdash;the Government and the Parliament would be likely to take action in the event of the situation continuing.  Therefore, there can be no question of any authority simply lighting their pipe with reports of the commission.</P>
    <P>I consider arrangements of this kind to be the most appropriate and to be the most consistent with the general principle I have tried to have reflected in the Bill&mdash;that the <Col N="701" /> Authority should have maximum freedom and authority and have it within the statutory obligations and restraints specified clearly.  A decision to give teeth to the commission or to make binding their decisions would conflict with this general principle and, consequently, I am not in favour of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor made some comments on particular findings of the present committee.  I do not propose to follow him in this area so far as my responsibilities are concerned because if a government set up a committee of this kind specifically to discharge duties, particularly in connection with impartiality, the Government should not then jog the committee's elbow, as it were, and say: &ldquo;We do not think you are being as impartial as we would be.&rdquo;  The whole object of the exercise is to remove from the Minister's direct area of concern specific judgments on specific complaints and to leave that task to the commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor suggested, too, as possibly meeting the case, an Oireachtas committee and suggested that this might be desirable now that the Government were maintaining the power to appoint the RTE Authority and are giving the Oireachtas the power to remove the Authority.  It does not seem to me that this follows in the sense that the present Bill gives more scope to the Oireachtas as distinct from the government of the day in this matter. I do not see why, in itself, it creates the need for an Oireachtas committee. Obviously, neither Deputy Lalor nor the Opposition considered it to be a need during all their years in office.</P>
    <P>There would be dangers in having an Oireachtas committee with a sort of permanent oversight in regard to RTE because there would be a danger of RTE and broadcasting generally becoming a political football. I think that both the Authority and the broadcasters are aware of this danger.  Members of an Oireachtas committee might not desire that situation but in the pressures of democratic politics and at times with some heat regarding the presentation <Col N="702" /> of political controversy, there is a very great danger that an Oireachtas committee would be drawn into polemical confrontation in which RTE would be involved.  Other democratic countries whose systems are like enough to ours to make us take note of them, have not followed that path.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the BBC programmes complaints commission which was set up in October, 1971, to consider complaints from the public of unfair treatment.  There the commissioners are Sir Edmond Compton, chairman, former Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, Lord Mowbray King, former Speaker of the House of Commons, and Sir Henry Fisher, former High Court judge.  The composition in one way is like the former High Court judge aspect and is in other ways unlike the composition of our present complaints committee but it provides&mdash;this is an aspect we bear in mind in setting up our complaints commission&mdash;for a kind of non-polemical link with the Parliament in including a former Speaker of the House.  That is a possibility that I should like to bear in mind in appointing the commission which we all seem to think should be an expansion on the present machinery.</P>
    <P>However, I should not like to say definitely that certain things shall be done because the number of people that can be approached is obviously extremely limited.  We cannot know how far any one of them might be prepared to undertake this.  That kind of, if you like, somewhat indirect link with the Oireachtas is what I would regard as possibly appropriate in a body of this kind rather than direct involvement in what might be regarded as the hurly-burly of democratic politics.</P>
    <P>I should now like to consider the main divisions of section 4, beginning with section 18A.  This is part of a general review of the section which we might have perhaps had earlier. Section 18A is one of three new sections inserted by section 4 of the Bill after section 18 of the 1960 Act, which deals with the requirement as regards objectivity and impartiality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> It provides for the setting up of an independent statutory commission to be known as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission not later than the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The commission will consist of at least three members, including the chairman appointed by the Government and will be financed by yearly grants made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance out of funds voted by the Oireachtas. The terms of office of a member of the commission, which will not exceed five years, will be fixed by the Government and the remuneration and allowances, if any, of members will be determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  A member may resign at any time and will be eligible for reappointment on expiry of his term of office.</P>
    <P>A member of the commission may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons only and only if both Houses of the Oireachtas pass a resolution calling for his removal. The purpose of this provision is to demonstrate the independence of the commission.  In his reference to that provision Deputy Lalor obviously found it a bit highfalutin', as tending to put the complaints commission on the same footing as the Judiciary.  The complaints commission are obviously not on the same footing as our higher courts in the sense that their functions are very much more limited and informal.  Because of their function in relation to impartiality of broadcasting they need an equivalent protection.  The protection is functional. It is not intended to indicate some judgment as regards status or as conveying some attempt at glorification of the commission.  It is purely functional.</P>
    <P>Subsections (9) and (10) deal with eligibility for membership of the commission. Members of the Dáil or the Seanad, of the RTE Authority or of the staff of RTE, are ineligible to be members of the commission for reasons which will be clear.  The commission will settle their own rules and procedures, apart from the <Col N="704" /> quorum, which shall be at least two. Finally, the commission will be staffed by the Department of the Public Service to demonstrate their independence of both the Minister and RTE.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 18B provides that the commission may investigate complaints alleging breaches of the requirements in regard to objectivity and impartiality in news broadcasts, breaches of the requirements regarding objectivity and impartiality in broadcasts relating to current affairs or to matters which are of public controversy and the prohibition on broadcasts of anything which may reasonably be regarded as likely to promote or incite to crime or else tending to undermine the authority of the State.  At an earlier stage on an amendment we discussed the propriety of including that provision.</P>
    <P>They may also investigate complaints alleging breaches of a statutory direction issued to the Authority to refrain from broadcasting any matter or matter of a particular class which, in the opinion of the Minister, would be likely to promote or incite to crime, or would tend to undermine the authority of the State&mdash;that was also discussed&mdash;breaches of the prohibition on unreasonable encroachment on any person's privacy, breaches of RTE's advertising code, breaches of the requirement that the Authority shall be objective and impartial in any matter they publish or distribute and shall not publish anything which might be regarded as likely to promote or incite to crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that, except in regard to complaints about publications, any complaint must first be made to RTE within 30 days of the date of the broadcast complained of. If the complainant is not satisfied with the explanation given by RTE, or RTE do not provide an explanation within 30 days of receipt of the complaint, the complainant may then forward his or her complaint to the commission within a further 30 days.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) enpowers the commission <Col N="705" /> to make rules concerning the procedure for dealing with complaints about RTE publications and the commission can publicly announce the making of these rules in a manner approved by the Minister.  Under subsection (4) the commission must afford RTE an opportunity to comment upon a complaint.  Under subsection (5), if the commission consider that the interests of an employee of RTE, because of the complaint may be adversely affected, the commission must afford that person an opportunity to comment on the complaint.  Under subsection (6) if the complaint relates to an advertisement, the relevant advertiser must also be given the opportunity of making submissions.</P>
    <P>When the commission have decided on a complaint they must notify the decision to the Authority, the complainant and, in the case of a complaint about an advertisement, the advertiser or the advertising agency. The Authority must inform the commission within 14 days whether or not the commission's decision is accepted by the Authority.  Subsection (10) provides that the activities of the commission will be carried out in private. Subsection (11) provides that the commission must publish or require RTE to publish the decision on each complaint without delay unless the commission consider it inappropriate to do so.  This aspect was also discussed earlier in our debate.  For example, the publication of a decision might involve a further encroachment on the privacy of an individual if the original complaint related to an encroachment on privacy.  I think there was acceptance from the opposite benches that that was something which had to be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Subsection (12) provides that the commission will not have power to award any party costs or expenses. That also was discussed and decided on here on an amendment.  Subsection (13) provides that a member of the commission must not act as a member of the commission in relation to any matter in which he has a material, financial or other beneficial interest. Subsection (14) provides that the commission will have no function in relation <Col N="706" /> to programmes rebroadcast by RTE by the direction of the Minister. However, as we know, this subsection is being deleted by amendment No. 9 consequential on the proposed deletion of section 6, which deals with rebroadcasting. Subsection (15) provides that the commission will not investigate complaints which are frivolous or vexatious, or complaints which are withdrawn unless the commission consider there are special reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>In section 18C, subsection (1) provides that the commission shall make to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs an annual report of their activities and that copies of the report shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Subsection (2) provides that this report must include particulars of any decisions not accepted by RTE.  I am sorry my review of the section should take so long but, as I have indicated, it was necessary to provide in some detail for how the commission will work, this being a somewhat new concept.</P>

As regards chargeability, this is a service which is intended for the benefit and protection of viewers and it seems fair that any expenditure should be borne ultimately by the licence fee.  I would not expect it to be of a magnitude which would involve the scaling of the licence fee.  The sums would be quite small in proportion to overall RTE expenditure and I believe it would be appropriate, as a service integrally connected with broadcasting, that it should be borne by the licence fee.</P>

One would need to know more about the likely volume of the work.  So far, it has turned out to be <Col N="708" /> more than I had expected in the initial period.  If, as has been the case in Britain and Sweden, the annual number of complaints is very small it would then be not unreasonable to ask the members to provide a voluntary unremunerated service, but if it should be the case that the work would prove time consuming, then obviously the need to compensate members would arise.  For that reason we are leaving it open.  I am not sure whether the present sizable volume of complaints is an initial novelty or whether it can be regarded as something that will continue, and I want to leave room for myself and my successors to do what is appropriate.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Subsection (8) states that a member of the commission may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons if resolutions are passed by each House of the Oireachtas calling for his removal. This is the same type of provision as has been made in relation to the removal of the Authority.  My reason for putting down an amendment in that regard is that the Authority occupy an entirely different position. They have control of the day-to-day direction of a broadcasting station.  In regard to the commission, they could be permitted to operate during the duration of prolonged debate in both Houses.  Members of the commission do not hold the same power as the Authority: they will be there to investigate complaints.  However, if the Minister says he believes it is right to have the matter of their removal provided <Col N="709" /> for in this open way, perhaps he is right.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to apply the same principle to the commission as to the Authority&mdash;that we must have a resolution before both Houses. Seeing that the Minister has already proposed the same type of section with regard to the removal of the Authority, I am quite convinced he will not change his mind here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is quite right when he says that this provides a cumbersome way of removing the commission.  That is true, but it is also in a sense intended to be cumbersome.  The commission's role is a limited one.  But it is also a big one in that they are, in particular, the custodians of impartiality for the Authority and, to a metaphorical extent, a sort of court of appeal.  Therefore, in our view, they should enjoy a degree of irremovability, if one can speak of that, not less than that of the Authority themselves.</P>
      <P>Specifically, if the Minister is required, as he is under this legislation, to give over to a commission what to a considerable extent he had before&mdash; the role of the judge of impartiality, of what impartiality is and when it is contravened&mdash;as he is rightly required to do under this legislation, then it should not be too easy for him to take that back as it were by having the power of removing the commission at the snap of his fingers, saying: &ldquo;Oh, I do not agree with their finding on impartiality in that case.  I am going to get rid of them&rdquo;. The commission appointed thereafter will know what they are expected to do about impartiality: to see eye to eye with the Minister of the day.  If the commission were under those constraints I do not think they would be doing their job.  Therefore we thought it proper to make it difficult to remove the commission, just as it now becomes more difficult than before to remove the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These decisions are taken quite deliberately and, I think, are for the benefit of broadcasting, and particularly <Col N="710" /> for the protection of impartiality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I would not consider it a question of difficulty or otherwise; there is either a right or a wrong.  We are laying down guidelines in this Bill as to what exactly is expected of the Authority.  If there is a set of rules laid down by the Minister in this Bill &mdash;just as the managing director of any business company would lay down a set of rules&mdash;he should say exactly what he expects, spell it out. There should not be any confusion in regard to this matter.  I would not accept the contention that it should be made difficult for the Minister to carry out his duty.  The Minister is appointed by the Government to carry out a duty on behalf of the House and people.  It may be very important sometimes to carry out a duty, but that does not take away from the fact that one has to carry it out.</P>
      <P>On the majority of occasions, unpopular decisions are taken for the common good.  People have to do it every day in the week.  I would not for one moment think we should take that responsibility off the shoulders of any Minister, or anybody prepared to take up a public appointment.  For that reason I make no excuse about the Minister transferring that responsibility to the House.  In effect that is what we are doing here.  Ministers have to take unpopular decisions every day of the week.  Everybody occupying a high post must take unpopular decisions at some time, but they do so in the belief that it is for the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contention that in our drafting of Bills we must not make it difficult for a Minister to carry out his duties is not a valid one.  We are making provisions in the Bill for the removal of the Authority and of the commission. The question at issue is the mechanics of how that will be done. I do not believe we should proceed along the lines of saying: &ldquo;The Minister is setting up these rules for the removal of the Authority; in another section we will make it practically impossible for him to carry out <Col N="711" /> that obligation.&rdquo; I do not accept that we must make it difficult for the Minister.  Certainly, we tie the Minister to certain guidelines, ensuring that he does not take a decision like that lightheartedly.</P>

It is not really a question of making it harder for the Minister to carry out his duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not exactly in that way.  The new legislation defines the Minister's duties in terms which are not intended to make them harder or easier for him.  That is not the point.  The point is that the Minister's powers will be less sweeping to the extent that in future he will have to justify certain courses of action before the Oireachtas.  The case will have to be appropriately made.  That is meant to clarify the relationship between Parliament and broadcasting and make it, if you like, more open and above board.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, Ministers have to take unpopular decisions.  Indeed, they have.  The Minister, having taken the decision to recommend to the Oireachtas the removal of members of the Authority or of the commission, that decision is quite likely to be unpopular, and he will have to defend that possibly unpopular decision.  It may not always be unpopular; there might be a widespread consensus in regard to the failure that had taken place and that ought to be rectified.  But, whether it is popular or unpopular, he has to justify it before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it justifiable to say, as has been suggested, that the Minister <Col N="712" /> is thereby running away from his responsibilities.  On the contrary what he is doing is accepting his responsibilities, clarifying them, before the Oireachtas: he has to defend the decisions he takes before the House and the public.  It has been suggested opposite that there is something cowardly about this, some kind of abdication of responsibility and so on. I see nothing cowardly about obliging a Minister to be responsible to this House.  That is what this measure does and I think it is quite appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not being here when the Minister was replying to what I said earlier on this section. I did hear the Minister say that he felt he should accept responsibility for the conduct of the commissioners or members of the Authority he would appoint and that is his justification for giving judicial recognition to both the members of the Authority and the members of the commission.  Having set up the commission and given them the right to investigate and come to a decision, he said he felt that was as far as he should go.  But in subsection (9) of 18B it is provided:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> When the Authority receives a statement of a decision from the Commission pursuant to subsection (7) of this section, the Authority shall, not later than fourteen days after its receipt, inform the Commission in writing whether or not the Commission's decision is accepted by the Authority.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from there?  The Authority reply to the commission, the commission having found a programme to be at fault, and what happens then?  The Authority can write back saying they accept the decision of the commission or they do not accept the decision of the commission. According to my files the invariable reply to correspondents in regard to complaints is that the programme complained of was not unbalanced and that RTE do not take the same view of the programme as the complainant does.  In that context, the complainant then goes to the commission and the commission investigate and find that RTE are wrong.  I presume they write to the chairman of the Authority and say they have investigated the case and found RTE at fault.  Under this section the reply from the chairman of the RTE Authority will naturally be that the Authority do not agree with the commission and do not accept the decision of the commission.  Where do we go from there?  This is what I meant when I talked about teeth.  The commission can go no further.  Will that be the end of it?  The Minister said last night there were ten complaints, eight had been heard; in seven RTE were exonerated and in the eighth&mdash; probably the homosexual programme &mdash;they were found guilty.  What was the end result?  The programme was advertised in the <i>RTE Guide</i>.  Did RTE do anything to redress the balance or to make amends?  What will the end result be?  I understand the Minister believes he should not give the commission more teeth but, if there is to be no attempt at a proper balance being kept or no attempt to make amends, then the Minister cannot possibly be as happy as he pretends to be about this complaints commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lalor <Col N="714" /> said he was unable to be present for my reply to what he said earlier.  I do not want to go over the same ground &mdash;I am sure the Deputy will understand that&mdash;but I should like to cover a little of it.  My point about the teeth was that I did not want to set up another body with teeth in relation to RTE.  My concern is to ensure a general democratic authority over broadcasting&mdash;I mean authority with a lower case &ldquo;a&rdquo;&mdash;and that authority is here in the Parliament of this country.  That is where the teeth are and should be.  The function of the complaints commission does not envisage finding the Authority guilty and punishing them and that is not the way such a commission works in other comparable countries, such as Sweden and, to some extent, Britain. Their function is to flash a warning light, as it were, which the Authority are free to disregard.  If there were to be a series of warning lights in a given area it is obvious no wise or prudent Authority would disregard them for the two reasons I gave the House earlier.</P>
      <P>The first reason would be the Authority's sense of their own responsibilities and the concern they would feel at having an impartial body find that they had not discharged their responsibilities.  I am sure if any of us were on such an Authority and such a body found that we would be concerned.  We would not be concerned in the first case about its consequences but about its implications and we would look very seriously at that.  I believe any Authority that are likely to be appointed would react in that way. They would also, on a lower plain, necessarily feel that if warnings of this kind were going on the situation could be approaching where a Government would be concerned and might have to bring the matter before the Oireachtas under other provisions of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Broadcasting Authority who ignored the findings of the commission in a general sense&mdash;I do not say that a specific case might not occur where they would decide it was the lesser evil to ignore it&mdash;and made a habit of <Col N="715" /> that would be very unwise indeed.  In the final analysis, if there were repeated complaints which the Broadcasting Complaints Commission accepted as well founded, that the Authority were in breach of certain statutory provisions especially those in regard to objectivity and impartiality the Government of the day would no doubt take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>An arrangement of this kind seems to me the most appropriate.  It is consistent with the general principle I have tried to have reflected in the Bill that the Authority should have maximum freedom and autonomy within clearly specified statutory obligations and restraints. A decision to give the complaints commission teeth or to make their decisions binding on the Authority would conflict with this general principle and I am not, therefore, in favour of it.  As I say, in other countries where they have equivalent bodies that is the principle applied.  The commission, committee or whatever it may be, give a signal if they feel a line has been gone over, not that anybody is expected to be punished or, indeed, that the Authority are expected to eat humble pie.  It is just to take note of that and if they are convinced that there is substance in it, as they would be in most cases, take such steps as they judge appropriate to prevent a repetition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor asked if they were expected to do anything to redress what they had done.  In matters that concern the balance of broadcasting the appropriate form of redress is the provision to ensure as far as possible that the balance will be maintained.  There are so many ways of falling away from balance that the formation of a sort of code of case law, using again the legal analogy in the very wide sense, is perhaps the best way of ensuring the development of that and that the complaints commission would contribute to that but not be an enforcing body or punitive body.  That is the whole idea behind this.</P>

      <P>It is the verbiage in section 9 that prompted me to ask the <Col N="716" /> question.  If that was the Minister's intention it would be more appropriate for him to have worded the section by saying: &ldquo;When the Authority receive a statement of a decision from the commission pursuant to subsection (7) of this section the Authority shall not later than 14 days after its receipt acknowledge its receipt&rdquo;.  That is what the Minister has just said.  He talks about the warning lights but I cannot visualise a situation where the Authority reply by saying: &ldquo;We have got your decision and we do not accept it&rdquo;.  That is a straightforward rebellion. If that occurred, even on a subject that might be described as trivial, the Minister of the day would have the problem of coming into the Oireachtas and either recommending that the members of of the commission or the members of the Authority be replaced.  The Authority and the commission are Government appointed and if the commission tell the Authority that they have acted wrongly and the Authority write back and say that they do not agree there is a clear difference of opinion between two Government appointed agencies and the Minister will have to act.</P>
      <P>There is a guideline built into subsection (13) that a person shall not act as a member of the commission in relation to any matter with respect to which he has a material, financial or other beneficial interest.  When dealing with section 3 last night, I said that the Minister might not be as critical as I was of the various radio and television programmes.  Here we have a commission being set up by the Government at the request of the Minister to hear complaints.</P>
      <P>I know that Members of the Oireachtas cannot be members of the commission.  Let us assume that the Dáil dissolves at some stage between the passage of this Bill and the appointment of the commission, that the new Government come in and that neither the present Taoiseach, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government nor I are re-elected to the House.</P>

      <P>I wonder what would be the reaction of the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the incoming Minister for Posts and Telegraphs appointing the present Taoiseach, the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and me as the minimum three people who should form this Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Does the Minister visualise that there might be a resurrection of some of the complaints we already had placed before the present broadcasting committee? If he does, he is pretty right in his assumption.</P>
      <P>Everybody has his own point of view and on the issue that I spent some time discussing last night the Minister will accept that material, financial or other beneficial interests do not quite cover three or four of the complaints presented to the present investigating committee that he appointed.  Is there no way in which the Minister could build into this section the type of provision whereby the commission that is to be appointed could be balanced from that point of view?  Suppose the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mary Kenny were appointed as the commission I think I would be reasonably justified in objecting on the basis that it was likely that commission would be biased in a particular direction.</P>

      <P>They are unanimous at the moment.  This is pretty much in line with Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment this morning which the Minister accepted practically in principle in spelling out not less than three members with the hope of five.  I think the Minister accepts that I am saying this sincerely; I am worried about the commission of three or five to be set up under the Bill.  I am mindful that the commission are to be set up by the Government on the request of the Minister but I have a notion there are one or two in the Government who might try to be a guard against what I have in mind.  Against that, a Bill was brought into the House and one <Col N="718" /> or two members of the Government did not agree with it and we did not know this until very late in the day. Is there anything to provide for the sort of declaration of interest I have in mind which the Minister could put into section 13?  This is an extremely important commission who are to be set up to investigate complaints. Many people, including myself are not happy about the outcome of the seven complaints on which decisions have been taken.</P>
      <P>I am not taking from the qualifications of the three people on the committee; I am fully satisfied that they ruled properly as they saw it but three other people might rule differently, even though they might not rule correctly.  I am merely saying that personally I disagree with some of those decisions.  I am worried about the handing over of that function to a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whose views on this issue which is the subject of so much complaint and controversy are so well known.  I cannot see how the provision can be built into that section; I am merely using that section to outline my worries on that score.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lalor has made a very interesting and highly imaginative speech, very fertile in hypotheses.  I hope he will forgive me if I do not pursue all the hares he started some of which seem to me to be decidedly political.  He seems to suggest&mdash;possibly under the strain of making his remarks relevant to the section&mdash;that members of the commission should be required to make some kind of declaration of non-material interest, perhaps ideological or spiritual interest.  I do not think that has been required of members of other State bodies and I do not think it should be provided here. In part his remarks are a little inconsistent. Obviously, he is worried about the Minister's attitudes and therefore worried about bodies that might be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister.  Yet, whatever the Minister's personal attitudes are, the scope of the present legislation and its thrust is to remove certain matters, in particular this function of judging <Col N="719" /> impartiality, from the Minister.  That is a function that is being removed by this Bill from a Minister.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy objects to the tendencies of the present Minister he should, at least for the period of the tenure of the present Minister, rejoice in a moderate way that the function of judging impartiality is taken out of the hands of that Minister and given to a commission which will not be appointed by the Minister or be removable by the Minister but will be appointed by the Government of the day and only removable&mdash;on the recommendation of the Minister&mdash;by the Government.  Certain drawbacks are incurable so long as the Minister to whom the Deputy objects is there. There is no way out of that except by getting rid of the Minister and I know that the Deputy is addressing himself to that problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as fast as he can.  Obviously, this transcends a particular Minister and is intended to be of longer duration.  I do not think it will be seriously contended that we should seek some kind of declarations from people to be appointed on the commission which would not be sought in relation to members of the Authority and have never been sought in the past from members of other State bodies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the position when an Authority do not accept a given decision.  He suggested that if in any case an Authority did not do this the Minister or the Government of the day should dismiss either the Authority or the commission. I certainly would not go that far: there could be borderline cases where there could be a legitimate division of opinion where the Authority, after very carefully considering the report of the commission, as they must, came reluctantly to a contrary conclusion, and one such instance, or rare such instances, over a long period of time would not lead to the necessity for such a drastic conclusion as Deputy Lalor suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> I would agree with him if he were to say that a consistent run of adverse reports by a commission which were then rejected by the Authority would create the situation he describes, where the Government of the day would have to say &ldquo;Well, either there is something wrong with the commission or with the Authority, and we will have to make up our mind which it is and make appropriate recommendations to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  I would hope that such a situation would not arise and I see it as unlikely to arise.</P>
    <P>The position where the Authority may reject a decision is not unusual. For example, it remains a power of the board of governors of the BBC in relation to reports of their complaints commission.  But there is a remedy here in the event of such an unfortunate divergence, and that is contained in the provision in 18C (i) for the annual report of the commission. We may take it as certain that the commission's annual report would give particular prominence to any case where the commission found in a given sense and the authority did not accept their decision.  The report would be laid before the House and then the Oireachtas would be able to debate that.  That is not a situation which any Authority would lightly wish to encounter.  I think the provisions in the section are adequate.</P>

If the Minister is considering a former Ceann Comhairle of the House as a member of the commission, my view is that the appointment should be balanced.</P>
      <P>The complaints commission will, of course, be empowered to call witnesses. Will the commission have statutory power to compel witnesses to attend a hearing, even if they have participated in a broadcast?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that I note the Deputy's reservations on the question of former Speakers and would bear those reservations in mind.  One point that any Minister would bear in mind &mdash;I certainly would&mdash;would be the extreme desirability of ensuring that as far as possible any complaints commission had the widest possible acceptance as an impartial body. Therefore a reservation of the kind that has been formulated would be a serious matter.  I certainly would not like the nomination by any Government of a complaints commission to be greeted with cheers on one side and objections from the other.  None of us wants that.  That is also relevant to other points made earlier in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no statutory obligation on witnesses to attend.  They can stay away if they want to.  Granted, all the time your subject matter is something in the public domain and is something of which there is a record. Therefore the question of witnesses in the ordinary way as to what was broadcast does not arise if the commission themselves know what was broadcast or what is complained of. In the normal way the people whose evidence they would be looking for would be people, who, we would <Col N="722" /> assume, would be eager to come forward, that is to say, people in RTE itself concerned with the making of the programme, with the intentions that they had when making it and with any material constraints that might have been on them, such as the dropping out of any participants.  We may take it that in virtually all foreseeable cases the relevant members of the RTE staff would be eager to give evidence.  If a member were reluctant to give evidence, that would be an unusual matter regarding which the complaints commission would have to reach their own conclusions. I do not think the obligation is necessary. As I said earlier, and would like to re-emphasise, this is not a court but an informal body of inquiry into such matters as impartiality and the less formal and costly its proceedings are the better.</P>

      <P>It is not envisaged that the commission should have powers in relation to community television at present, going on as to a limited extent and to an experimental extent.  If community television developed, as some of us might hope it would&mdash;but there may be inherent limitations on its growth&mdash;to a very considerable extent the question of its further regulation by legislation might arise.  But we do not at present feel that it is necessary to involve the commission with community television. As at present constituted they are a voluntary body and we do not want to put too much on it at the present time.  However control of community television and advertising on it will be considered when statutory regulations are made under the Bill if it is enacted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not want to develop that aspect of community television at this stage; we can do it later.  Section 4 is one of the most detailed in the Bill.  It will play a very important role as regards the standards which will obtain in broadcasting.  It is a safeguard for the public.  It is a watchdog which was set up to ensure that if the public have any complaints about impartiality or imbalance, they will be able to make a proper approach to the commission.  This section places many obligations on the commission.  If, as the Minister indicated, more complaints are submitted to the complaints commission in this country than anywhere else, this is a very large undertaking for such a small committee.  There is every likelihood that this trend will continue.  There is a growing awareness among the people today but whether this is good or bad I do not know.  The most trivial matter nowadays can be magnified out of all proportion.</P>
      <P>If a person has a complaint he must first get in touch with the Authority. They may be able to give good reasons why they took certain action or why they showed a certain programme. I would not be surprised if the number of complaints mentioned by the Minister were doubled.  I am not sure how long it takes to investigate complaints.  The commission must be supplied with the relevant facts; the Authority must give them the necessary tapes and material to help them reach a balanced judgment. In another section the Authority are obliged to keep certain material for six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I believe records and tapes should be kept longer.  Cases might come to light two or three years later and I cannot see how keeping records for that length of time would place a strain on the Authority.  The same regulations should apply to the Authority as apply to the ordinary <Col N="724" /> business of the Revenue Commissioners. The Income Tax Act makes it compulsory for companies to keep their records for six or seven years.  We all know the problem involved, from a space point of view, trying to keep these records.  I would be inclined to oblige the Authority to keep their records for two or three years at least.</P>
      <P>If a manufacturing company felt aggrieved and complained to the complaints commission it could take the commission a few months to reach their findings.  Even if they found in favour of the company, that company could have suffered a loss of business. The next step would be for the company to take action for compensation against the Authority.  To get this action listed could take up to 12 months.  In such a case it would be necessary to keep the tapes and documents for that time.  That is only a minor case; other cases can drag on for years.  The Authority should be in a position to supply tapes and documents two or three years later and say: &ldquo;That is what took place on a certain night two or three years ago.&rdquo; That is not too much to ask.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have another look at the section which deals with the keeping of tapes and records.  It could happen in a High Court case that the relevant evidence was destroyed, because it was allowed under this Bill.  The Authority are not obliged to keep these tapes.  If I were on the Authority I would go with the Bill because it would make things easier.  Later I could plead that the Authority upheld their obligation to the Oireachtas and that, at that stage, they could not supply the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this very detailed section.  It is necessary that we have the complaints commission to ensure that the people's views are heard by a group independent of the Minister and the Authority.  I hope that whoever the Minister selects as members will be impartial because any commission or committee to be successful must be seen to be impartial. We can all play a political part but it is the common good that <Col N="725" /> matters.  What the Minister and I think about a person because he leans this way or that way is irrelevant.  If he does his job well, that is what matters.  We have been bedevilled down through the years by playing politics with these things and not having the job done properly.</P>
    <P>We have already mentioned that this body should contain one or two people with a professional knowledge of broadcasting.  The Minister has conceded that.  I can see his point that it could cause problems if we put that into the Bill, because this type of person might not be available.  However, any Minister in the future should take that into consideration.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 43, to insert new subsections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Authority shall with the consent of the Minister appoint a programme Council which shall as far as possible be representative of those parts of Ireland in which it is not possible to receive television broadcasts at reasonable strength emanating from outside the State.</P>
      <P>(5)  The programme Council shall control the selection of material and production of programmes to be transmitted on any service of television programmes that may be introduced after the coming into operation of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 6, which has been deleted.  I do not intend to go over the old ground of the Minister's proposal to rebroadcast BBC 1 for the second RTE channel.  On that occasion we put forward the proposal that the second channel should be under the control of the RTE Authority and following that up we put forward amendments earlier on in the Bill to enlarge the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put forward this amendment to ensure that a proper balance and representation will be given to the people in that part of the country who do not receive multi-channel television <Col N="726" /> as we do on the east coast.  We want to give such people a choice of programmes which will be as good if not better than BBC 1 programmes.  Therefore we would like the Minister, with the co-operation of the Authority, to establish a programme council to select programmes which would be desirable and acceptable especially to the single-channel areas.  It is important to ensure that there is proper representation in respect of the second RTE channel when it comes into operation probably in 1977.  The members of this council, coming from, say, Cork, Limerick, Galway and so on should be able to feed back to the Authority or to the people who prepare the programmes in Montrose what they think is acceptable in those areas.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious that there is criticism of the present RTE programmes especially by people living in the single-channel areas.  If there is a proper selection of programmes, both imported and home produced, and the second channel, the complaints we have heard over the past three or four years will be eliminated.  It is not possible with one channel to cater for the various interests.  I have travelled in many parts of the country, especially in the south and the west, and I have heard these complaints, that they are not getting the choice of programmes. I can see their point, but I can also see the point of view of RTE having only the one channel.  In such circumstances it is very difficult to cater for minority viewers.  If a programme council is established, the members will be conscious of the needs and the desires of people in the single-channel areas whom they represent.</P>
    <P>That is why we put forward the amendment to increase the membership of the Authority and asked that the additional members appointed to the Authority should if at all possible reside in and be representative of those parts of the country that have only single-channel reception at the moment.  The amendment would enhance and strengthen the new RTE programme when it is established.  I am convinced that if RTE set about properly programming for this second <Col N="727" /> channel the selection which the people are looking for will be given.</P>
    <P>People were afraid, that this would be completely dominated again by Montrose and that we would have the same biased type of programmes reflecting the views of the east coast and so on.  I have heard it mentioned on several occasions that the news generally reflects only incidents that take place along the east coast.  I see the difficulties which Montrose and the station encounter.  If an incident should happen in the west or south it just is not possible to have it filmed and back for the six o'clock news.  It is more simple to do that if it happens here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>These are the difficulties which the Authority are encountering.  We want to ensure that there is no question about this programme being Dublin-biased at Montrose or taken over completely by a certain group of people.  We must get away from that concept.  I am quite sure that the Minister is as conscious of this as I am.  We are trying to get a balanced representation and to ensure that the views of this programme council will be heard by whoever is in charge of the selection of programmes in Montrose.  We do not want to make his job difficult.  I understand he has a certain job to do as controller of programmes.  This type of programme council would be able to monitor and assimilate generally the feelings of the people of a district, especially in the single channel areas.  They would be more alive to complaints, and I believe it would help the Authority and the controller of programmes to a certain extent if he had those views.  It is for this purpose we tabled this amendment. We believe it is desirable.  It certainly would give this broad spread which is so necessary.  It is important that we get as many views as possible if we are to get this new channel accepted.  The Minister should consider seriously accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I might as well come in before the Minister speaks.  The <Col N="728" /> selection of programmes that are to be provided in RTE 2 for the single channel areas is a very important matter to people living in those areas. The question of making that selection from what programme materials are available should be in the hands of at least some people living in mainly the southern and south-western part of the country.  It should not be dependent upon what people living in this area think we should allow people living in Cork, Kerry, Clare and so on to see.</P>
      <P>There is no need to go into the controversy of the past couple of years on this issue.  Now that a second channel is in process of being erected and an executive of RTE in Dublin has been made responsible for looking after it, it is important that some means be found of ensuring that the sort of programmes provided will be not alone good programmes but, if necessary through research, some of the kind of programmes that people living in the single-channel areas want. I should like to hear from the Minister what thinking has been done so far on this and if any information is available to him.  We all know the feeling of genuine resentment of the people living in those areas who have not got the accidental benefit of additional channels.</P>
      <P>I have not heard anything about what methods are to be employed by RTE in arriving at a selection.  That is what makes the amendment being put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick a useful one&mdash;at least a good talking point&mdash;that some sort of council or committee might be selected representative of those areas and of course including somebody from the station itself, with the object of arriving at a result which will be satisfactory, rather than create another element of protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the single-channel area I support the amendment.  I would appeal to the Minister that if he wants to get RTE 2 accepted&mdash;as we all hope it will be and we look forward to that&mdash;he should have some kind of programme council representative of single-channel areas.  As I said on the Second Stage, people in my area accept and <Col N="729" /> would, I think, vote for RTE 2 in preference to rebroadcasting of the BBC. There should be an independent programme council because it is felt, with all due respect, that there are some very good programmes in RTE 1, but there are some very bad and hopeless ones.  There should be an element of competition between the two stations if there is to be good broadcasting.  There could be an excellent RTE 1 and 2 if there was this competition&mdash;of course under the supervision of the director of broadcasting. They could not make any programmes they liked, but there would be a better variation of programmes and there would be programmes with a regional voice, which is very important for RTE 2</P>
      <P>I do not want to rehash what we had in the Second Reading because I do not believe in repeats, but it is worth asking the Minister a second time to consider seriously this amendment because I come from this area and I am listening to this every other day: &ldquo;We have no reception at the moment except from RTE 1.&rdquo;  I listened to people the other day saying &ldquo;Ah sure listen, it is the same crowd doing the programmes.  We thought we would get a bit of variety when we get RTE 2, but it is the same old three and four pence&rdquo;.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment and do away with that feeling in the single-channel areas that we are going back to square one as far as programming is concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that I am not condemning all the programmes transmitted by RTE.  The Authority have a difficult job to do and transmit some very good programmes. The task for the existing Authority is difficult enough without putting the burden of a second channel on them.  In my view there should be a separate programme council for the proposed second channel.  There should be an element of competition between the two channels in an effort to make them strive for better things.  I support the amendment for that reason and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I dealt with the question of an advisory committee for RTE 2 in the course of my opening speech on Second Stage on 28th October, 1975, as reported at columns 410 and 411 of the Official Report, Volume 288.  At that time I said that this Bill provides for the transfer of power to appoint advisory committees from the Minister to the Authority. It is all part of the general concept in this legislation of strengthening the autonomy, the self-determination, of the Authority.  Accordingly, it is for the Authority to act on this question and I would not wish to prejudice their decision or make creation of a given advisory council or committee mandatory on them under the legislation. I believe that in reaching their own decision as to whether an advisory committee or council would be useful in this area, and if so just what it should be and how it should function, the Authority will take into consideration the points made here by Deputies Fitzpatrick, Brugha, and Callanan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out some possible objections to such an arrangement.  The second channel is a second national channel, not the extension to the single-channel area of a service already available in the multi-channel area.  Furthermore, it is to be run as a complement to the existing channel so that there is to be a single balanced national service on two channels.  As this concept has won popular acceptance, I thought it should be allowed to work itself out.  That being so, it may not be advisable to create a statutory system of committees which would naturally tend to pull in different directions, in order to run a two-channel concept which is intended to be a balanced whole.  Therefore, I do not think I should make the creation of such a committee mandatory on the Authority.  The Authority themselves will undoubtedly want RTE 2 and RTE 1 to be as acceptable as possible in the single- and multi-channel areas.  I believe they will have to devise such methods of consultation as they think may best work for this purpose.  I do not think they should be simply required to set up such a committee by law but they <Col N="731" /> retain the power to set up such a committee which, after consideration of the whole problem, they may decide to use.  This is a matter for the decision of the Authority and, accordingly, I regret I cannot accept the amendment although the arguments which have been put forward for it here, and which afterwards may be put forward, will be brought to the attention of the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister if he is saying that the Authority can appoint any sort of advisory committee they may wish to appoint.  That comes up under the next section.  I would not like to see a collision developing and the Authority being so unwise as to say it does not need any advisory committee to give them an idea of what should be provided in the single-channel area.  The Minister is saying that if the Authority wish to appoint a committee well and good, it is the responsibility of the Authority, and at the same time I agree with the Minister when he says that RTE 2 is part of a national network.  The consideration behind this amendment is one which bears in mind the vacuum created by the accidental reception of three, and sometimes four, other channels in a part of the country.  We all know about this.  We are also aware of the feeling of irritation, of virtual protest, which has arisen in some parts of the single-channel area, notably Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a situation which should not be ignored and I am sure the Authority will not ignore it.  I am not sure that the Minister is correct in passing all of that on to the Authority without so much as a recommendation.  In controversial areas of this kind it is a good thing to concede this much to public opinion so that they will know that what is being done is fair and open and that they will not be subject to any sort of whispering campaign that Dublin is deciding everything. I know it is impossible to satisfy all the people in the area of television, generally, and I know that we will never please everybody with regard to <Col N="732" /> our national television station.  In my view RTE do well in many areas and, perhaps, what is being said here will help in the situation we are discussing. It is of vital importance that people who have not the accidental benefit of outside channels will, through the second channel, get the best selection possible.  What concerns me is that they might be exposed to the idea that they are not getting that, that Dublin, as we are described, is deciding the matter.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's argument that it is a national channel and, therefore, it must be balanced; what RTE 1 and RTE 2 are doing must have a national balance.  I see that the Minister does not wish to make something of this kind mandatory on the Authority.  I am sure that the present Authority would not be so foolish as to decide arbitrarily on this without consultation with those in the single-channel area.  In his amendment Deputy Fitzpatrick seeks to make sure that people in that area will get the best selection possible.  Other than prevailing on the Minister to accept the amendment, I cannot put the case any stronger.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister that it should be left optional to RTE, because human nature being what it is, if I am in authority and if I agree to set up an advisory committee I will want it run my way.  If an authority over RTE 1 are asked to establish an advisory committee to help organise programmes for RTE 2 they will not put someone on the committee who will want to change programmes.  I think it should be in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is a pity the Minister cannot see our point of view.  The reason for this amendment is to ensure that when the second channel is established it will get full acceptance.  The public view is of vital importance to the success of an operation.  The complaints commission is there to give the public a vehicle to express dissatisfaction if they feel that certain aspects in relation to broadcasting were unbalanced or impartial.  I agree <Col N="733" /> with the Minister that this is a national broadcasting station.  It is for all the people of the country.  I sincerely hope that I will be able to discontinue looking at foreign stations.  I hope to get programmes that are acceptable to all members of the family on RTE 1 and RTE 2.  I believe this will be done.</P>
      <P>It is important that the people are consulted.  No matter how qualified a controller of programmes is he would not be capable of saying: &ldquo;This is the type of programme that the people in Cork, Galway or Sligo would like.&rdquo;  The present controller of programmes is of outstanding integrity and quality and even he could not do that.  People in commercial life carry out researches in various parts of the country to see what commodity will sell.  When that is done the product is manufactured.  If any sort of enterprise is to be started in this country researchers are sent out first to assess the possibilities before a decision is made.  We do not want to go into that professional type of stuff. We are dealing with a very sensitive area to ensure that the quality and type of programme that people want will be forthcoming from RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people have the right to have their views expressed on television and there is no better way of doing so than setting up a programme council such as we are proposing here, consisting of people representative of that part of the country that has only single-channel reception.  The whole selection board should not be confined to people from that part of the country. There could be members from Dublin or Wexford there or any part of the country which is receiving the multi-channel stations at the moment. If something like this were established, we would not have the same complaints we are receiving today from people all over the country that certain programmes are completely unsatisfactory and that certain views are not being considered.  I think we should have some type of a board or a programme council that would be processing machinery whereby the director of programmes in RTE would be in a position to say that certain programmes reflected the views of the <Col N="734" /> programme council.  I do not say that the director of programmes should at all times accept the recommendations of the council but at least it will be a guideline; it would show him exactly what people are thinking.</P>
    <P>This is a controversial issue. Throughout the country when this second channel was being debated, people came out in favour of RTE 2 and wanted to be assured that it would not be a complete duplication of RTE 1.  If RTE 2 is to be a success, we must set up a proper council to ensure that these people's views are heard. When the second station comes into operation, it will have to be paid for by everyone irrespective of where they reside.  We should ensure that the people living on the east coast will tune into RTE 2.  If we are to generate the revenue so necessary for RTE to finance its various programmes and undertakings, we will have to get more people, especially people on the east coast, to look at Irish programmes. This relates to commercial value.</P>
    <P>People place their advertisements on the basis of the TAM ratings of programmes. Both RTE channels in the future will be depending to a considerable extent on commercials for their revenue.  Therefore we must endeavour to have programmes which will be of the widest appeal possible.  I should not be surprised to learn that the TAM rating on the east coast is very low so far as RTE are concerned.  In these circumstances every effort must be made to win back those lost viewers. RTE must concentrate their efforts in this area if they are to sustain themselves in regard to revenue.  If the present decline in revenue continues the deficit will have to be made up by increasing the licence fee.  I see no other way by which RTE could operate the second channel to the highest standard possible, a standard that will attract the desired number of viewers and which will attract advertising. Despite the number of complaints that may be made with regard to advertising on the proposed second channel, we must be realistic and accept that, while commercials may detract from the enjoyment of a programme, they <Col N="735" /> are necessary to enable the station to sustain itself.</P>
    <P>However, the most important consideration is the question of ensuring the channel's acceptability and its provision of the broadest scope possible. Undoubtedly, the new channel will give us a selection of imported programmes in addition to home-produced ones.  There are many excellent programmes on cross-channel circuits which many people in this country cannot receive now.  These include such educational programmes as &ldquo;Open University&rdquo; and educational programmes for younger viewers.  Programmes of this type would be acceptable on the new channel.  At the same time, we can utilise this channel for the development of home talent.  We must not at any time overlook our writers, producers and broadcasters. RTE 2 can be a means of providing work for some of these people and, hopefully, the channel can be expanded ultimately, to absorb some of those artists who have emigrated because of lack of scope for them here.</P>
    <P>It is desirable too that studios outside Dublin be expanded and diversified.  In this way a balance of programmes can be achieved.  These smaller studios could produce home programmes reflecting the views of the various elements in our society. We are drifting increasingly towards the international type of programme. While this may be desirable we must not overlook the element of home interest.  Most people will prefer programmes of home news, for instance.  Although there is a choice of cross-channel and even international newspapers available, most people will seek first the local paper in order to ascertain the home news. The same goes for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>We can rest assured that the home-produced programmes will play an important part on any Irish television channel.  With this in mind we have put forward this amendment.  We are endeavouring in this way to consult the public, to tell them that by means of a programme council we are asking for their views in relation to <Col N="736" /> television programmes.  Perhaps the amendment is not word perfect and could be improved by the parliamentary draftsman.  Perhaps the controller of programmes on RTE could work in conjunction with the council for which we are asking.  Would it not be possible to change the amendment so as to make it, not mandatory on the controller to accept the council's recommendations, but at least to take their views into consideration in overall programme planning on the second channel?</P>
    <P>Therefore I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  He has told us that as the section stands the Authority can establish an advisory council but I doubt if what I have in mind is what the section envisages. I doubt if the Authority would establish such a council and for that reason I do not accept the Minister's proposal in this regard.  RTE have stated that they can provide the selection of programmes necessary to satisfy the public generally.  They have much to live up to.</P>
    <P>I believe they will live up to the expectations I have of them.  I have always said we are capable of using our second broadcasting station.  We have the potential and the talent to service this station and to deliver the goods.  To ensure that it is acceptable we must get the co-operation of all the people.  We must show that we are concerned to see that their views are expressed within the Authority. For that reason we put forward this amendment.  If accepted it would enhance the whole operation of RTE 2.</P>

      <P>Naturally I listened with interest and attention to the statements made on this matter.  I am struck with a certain gap between the speeches made in support of the amendment and the amendment itself. What Deputies opposite, including Deputy Fitzpatrick in whose name the amendment stands, have done is to make a good case for an advisory committee on the second channel, a committee on which the residents of the present single-channel areas would be represented as well as others a broadly based advisory committee.  The amendment <Col N="737" /> is far more drastic.  From the remarks Deputy Fitzpatrick has just made I do not think he is really convinced of the need for his own amendment in the form in which we have it here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is much more than an advisory committee.  This is a programme council which shall control&mdash;that is very strong&mdash;the selection of material and production of programmes to be transmitted on any service of television programmes that may be introduced after the coming into operation of this Act.  That is the second channel and any other channels the future may bring.  If carried, that would take away a very important area of decision-making from the Authority. In fact, it goes very far in the direction of setting up a second or alternative Authority.  That is very drastic and goes far beyond the idea of an advisory committee.</P>
      <P>I could not at all accept that.  It would be a retrograde step.  The idea of a single Authority for our national broadcasting station, on however many channels it functions, is absolutely vital if we are to get the necessary complementary system of programmes on more than one channel.  I would not envisage for a moment going to those lengths.  Therefore, I could not at all accept this amendment.  That does not mean I do not think there is a considerable weight of argument which deserves consideration for the kind of advisory committee envisaged by Deputies opposite and of which they have spoken persuasively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we accept the idea that there is good case for an advisory committee, though not for the kind of alternative Authority which is envisaged here in my view, to whom is the decision to be left?  Is the Oireachtas to decide that there shall be such a committee or council and, in effect, impose that on the Authority?  Or do we leave it to the Authority to consider the arguments put forward here and those which will certainly reach them from the public especially in the single <Col N="738" /> channel areas?  Do we leave that to them or do we say: &ldquo;No, you will have this whether you like it or not&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>There would be an inherent tension between the Authority and any mandatory committee or council of this sort even if we were to tone down the actual wording &ldquo;the programme council shall control...&rdquo; which would be unacceptable to any Authority. That tension would be there. Sometimes there is a case for building in tension but I do not think it would be useful here.  It would tend to create suspicion, division and confusion. When the Authority are left to determine how they will bring in the views of the public in the single channel areas and elsewhere, that will tend to produce a better method of consultation because it will be one the Authority will want and not a potential adversary set up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan said bluntly that the Authority, being human, would be likely to appoint to an advisory committee people who agreed with them.  Obviously this is a tendency of all appointing bodies anywhere. Clearly there are limitations to it. If the Authority want a single channel region to be represented they will also want it to be seen to be represented and, whatever committee is set up, that its membership will be acceptable in that area.  If they are nonentities or chosen because they might be likely to agree with the Authority the whole exercise would be counter-productive.  I think we need not fear that.</P>
    <P>The analogy, if it is an analogy, with the complaints committee was introduced.  I accept this to the extent that I think it is right for us to be vigilant and cautious about setting up additional bodies in this area. It is only too easy to multiply bodies. I hesitated for some time before even setting up the complaints committee, but I set it up for what seemed to be a cogent reason that there should be a body other than the Minister or the Authority which would decide on disputed cases, particularly where there was a charge of violation of impartiality. I felt the final decision on that should be left to such a body and <Col N="739" /> therefore there was a need for such a body functionally.  I do not accept there is the same need to set up a mandatory body.  I should like that to be left to the Authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick indicated&mdash;perhaps this is a little bit away from the literal construction of this section but it does arise generally&mdash;that he deprecated what he called drifting towards international type programmes. We should be aware that when RTE set out to convince the public in the single channel areas and elsewhere of the desirability of their concept of a second RTE channel, they did so on the basis of 80 per cent international type programmes, that is, foreign programmes.</P>

It seems to me that it might be better, perhaps, not <Col N="740" /> in the mandatory form set out here, to spell out some method or provision for arriving at a selection of programmes for RTE 2 either way by way of another Bill or the Minister asking RTE to appoint an advisory committee or by asking RTE to do it by way of research.

Section 5 transfers to the RTE Authority the powers in the 1960 Act in such a way that the Authority may <Col N="741" /> exercise these powers with the consent of the Minister.  Otherwise the section is identical to the relevant section in the 1960 Act.  Subsection (2) provides that no committee shall have more than three members and that a member of a committee shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain his membership for the period determined by the Authority when appointing him, and no longer, but shall be eligible for reappointment.  It provides that a committee must meet when requested by the Authority.</P>

      <P>Last night I was speaking of the problem confronting young people leaving school who cannot find employment.  While I do not want to digress from that subject, I would point out that a weakness of the Coalition Government is that one does not get a unified voice on many problems.  They speak in divers tongues.  An excellent example of that <Col N="743" /> was the statement last week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on such matters as divorce and contraception. This afternoon we heard the Taoiseach say that they were purely the Minister's own views.  Yet they were voiced last week with an air of authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>What has this got to do with the motion before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which, perhaps, belied the whole intent.  I will tell the Parliamentary Secretary what I mean by that.  Not alone on such social matters do we get this divergence of views from the Government but they are incapable of speaking with one voice as a Government.  Therefore, we have now reached the stage when the Ministers for Education, Labour, Industry and Commerce and Social Welfare are all involved in this problem of the thousands of young people who have been educated in various institutions, schools and universities but who cannot find employment.  The time has come to call for a radical solution. Having lost faith in the ability of those Ministers to do anything constructive, I suggest that the Taoiseach take a look at the Cabinet and appoint somebody on that side of the House to act as a co-ordinator and spokesman for the Government in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no responsible person left to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the cynicism of my colleagues in this respect. Since as Deputy Fitzgerald said, there is nobody responsible left to undertake that task, perhaps the Government might decide to go outside their ranks and appoint a person of proven ability who may have some original thinking on this problem, who will have as his first task the co-ordination of any efforts made by the Ministers I mentioned in seeking a solution. Such a person would have a very wide field to probe and he might well come up with something worthwhile.  For instance, the Government have failed so far in the employment premium scheme.  That is not my view alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> The Minister for Labour has admitted that his target for this scheme was 10,000 jobs; he achieved 4,500.</P>
    <P>AnCO, which does an excellent job in training with the resources at their disposal, must be enlarged.  The trade unions and employers also have a vested interest.  Then there are the educational authorities.  It has been said in other places, perhaps with some justification, that our universities are famous.  But, despite expansion in education and the excellence of university courses, we must ask ourselves whether we have got emerging from them high thinking on the problems facing us which would suggest we are making progress and that we might hope to have full employment in a short time.  Even if one accepts a 3 per cent unemployment rate as representing full employment &mdash;accepted in modern thinking&mdash; among our youth today, we have at least a 12 per cent unemployment rate.  That is the unacceptable face of Coalition Government.  We do not intend accepting without the gravest protest.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest that the Taoiseach appoint a Minister for the co-ordination of efforts in the solution of the unemployment problem confronting our youth.  If he cannot find a competent person within the parties forming the Government, perhaps he would take his courage in both hands, and appoint somebody outside the House as watchdog of Ministers whose task it is to do something about this problem.  I envisage such a person calling the trade unions and employers together, letting them examine how they can offer jobs in existing industries and create new ones.</P>
    <P>Our mercantile fleet needs to be expanded.  We have two State companies, Irish Shipping Ltd. and the B &amp; I.  We should say to them we must expand our fleet.  The greatness of Britain during the many centuries she was very powerful, until recently, was achieved by the fact that she always maintained a very fine mercantile fleet.  While we do not join the imperialistic thinking of Britain, while we simply want to improve commerce, in the sphere of <Col N="745" /> shipping we could employ many young men whether as ABs, engineers, officers or deckhands thereby attracting many young men into a seafaring occupation with Irish Shipping Ltd., B &amp; I or An Bord Iascaigh Mhara who operate a very fine scheme.  Indeed, they could enlarge their scheme to attract more and more men into the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I commend the action being taken by CERT to attract young people into the catering trade.  They mention 500 jobs in their advertisements.  If given sufficient help, they could recruit many more.  Those are merely a few suggestions of places where young people could be gainfully employed.</P>
    <P>With regard to other schemes, existing industry might well be helped to provide more employment if the Minister would examine the failure of the employment premium scheme and ascertain what is wrong or ask the trade unions what they feel about this matter. First of all, we must convince the Government that there is a solution to this problem.  One gets the impression from Government Ministers, their spokesmen and the apologetic attitude of the Minister for Labour that they have lost faith, that they no longer believe they can solve the problem. Our youth, and indeed their parents, feel that way also.  We must not let that thinking destroy any likely initiative on the part of the Government. I am sure the suggestions put forward by this party will bear fruit if they are examined by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is not our intention to make any political ploy out of the plight of young people.  That would be unworthy. Worthwhile suggestions have been made by speakers on these benches and I have tried to add to those suggestions. In conclusion, let me again ask that, as a first step, the Taoiseach will appoint a co-ordinator of ministerial effort either inside or outside the House so that we can make some progress towards finding a solution to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly clear that the problem of youth unemployment is just one facet of the general problem which, <Col N="746" /> in common with other European countries, confronts us at the moment. It is important that in any measures we take to alleviate unemployment in any particular age group or any particular sector of our economy they should not be so designed as to damage other sectors. We must not adopt an attitude of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  The Government have tried to approach the problem in a global sense with a view to helping all concerned, but as Members of this House we must recognise that there are particular problems facing young people at the moment.  In my own constituency there is a very large number of young people seeking employment.  They have the greatest difficulty in finding employment.  To a large extent that is due to the general economic recession, but it is also due to other underlying factors in our economy which have been brought to the surface by the current difficulties.</P>
      <P>I remember reading a manpower survey done in Drogheda in 1967 or 1968.  At that time there was a fairly good level of employment here and in Europe, but even at that time young people with leaving certificates interested in clerical or office employment were having much greater difficulty in finding jobs than were those with skills and people going into apprenticeship or anxious to get some further qualification over and above the leaving certificate.  Even at that time there was a problem for the young person seeking what is called white collar work.  This anxiety for this kind of work derived not just from the educational system but also from the aspirations of parents who were anxious that their children should get clerical employment.  This was creating problems even at that stage.  It is now creating greater problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things we must try to do&mdash;and this is not just a matter for the Government but for the community at large&mdash;is to make people realise the value of skilled manual employment.  That is the employment in which job opportunities are arising to a very substantial extent.  The most <Col N="747" /> critical problem in my experience&mdash; I do not know if it is the experience of other Members&mdash;arises in the case of young people anxious to find clerical employment.  If they would turn their minds towards other jobs they might find greater opportunities and less difficulties.</P>
    <P>Now this is not to be interpreted as an attempt by me to pass the problem back to the young people themselves. The Government must retain a very substantial responsibility in the matter, but the matter is one the young people should consider very carefully.  They should examine all the possibilities.  Those involved in helping young people to find jobs should consult to an ever-increasing extent with the placement services of the manpower service of the Department of Labour because there they have available to them an analysis of the employment situation and of the jobs available.  They can tell career guidance personnel, parents and the young people themselves that there are certain sectors in which there are still a number of vacancies and they should encourage the young people to reorient themselves in the direction in which jobs are available.  In that way our educational system and career guidance will be tailormade to the needs of our economy and to the available employment opportunities. We can all play a part in this.</P>
    <P>If Members will forgive me a little bit of local chauvinism, I should like to draw attention to a policy adopted in the vocational school in Navan. Young people who have done their group certificate and who would like to continue their education, without necessarily proceeding to the leaving certificate, can avail of a work training programme whereby they spend part of the week in a number of factories in the town, and part of the week at school discussing their experiences in these factories, while acquiring certain additional skills related to the particular job for which they are likely to opt.  With a mix of education and work these young people will be in a position to make a much more realistic appraisal of <Col N="748" /> their own talents and skills and a more mature choice of employment. If this sort of programme were initiated in other vocational schools it would help young people towards making a more rational choice.  This programme provides a link between the school and the work situation.  I would commend this experiment and I suggest that Members should encourage vocational schools in their constituencies to adopt a similar programme.</P>
    <P>The Government's role in relation to the employment situation has been three-pronged.  They have very substantially increased the public capital programme, which is spent on projects like schools, houses and so on, all of which directly or indirectly provide employment.  This year there is an increase of over £100 million to £396.3 million in this capital programme. All this money will go towards providing jobs for the young and the not so young.  The Government have also been concerned to assist the IDA in creating jobs with an independent long-term viability in the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>The amount of money made available this year to the IDA is a record figure.  It is £53½ million as against about £27 million in 1972-73.  The increase in money made available to the IDA in this and previous years has had a substantial effect in creating new jobs.  We must bear in mind that 1975 was one of the worst years we have had on the employment front, both for the maintenance and the creation of new jobs.  In 1975 the IDA achieved the third highest ever number of new jobs created, when 833 projects were approved for grant assistance during that year involving a capital investment of £274 million. These projects approved in 1975 by the IDA, created with money made available by the Government, will provide employment for 16,500 people at full production.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that these jobs are going to a very substantial extent to young people.  A survey was done on jobs created with aid from the IDA during the period April, 1971, to April, 1974, in seven of the <Col N="749" /> planning regions.  It was found that of the jobs created at that time by the IDA school leavers represented a major proportion of the new employees. A total of 28.3 per cent of IDA jobs created in the area covered by that survey went to school leavers. Therefore we can infer from that that a similar proportion of school leavers will have benefited from the third highest ever number of new jobs created by the IDA in 1975 and that, equally, a similar proportion of young people will benefit from the jobs created as a result of the record allocation of £53 million made to the IDA for the creation of jobs in 1976.</P>
    <P>The third prong of the Government's effort to assist in the creation of employment for young people has been their training programme.  Quite clearly young people who leave school and who go straight into the employment market are more vulnerable to an economic recession than people who take some additional job-related training prior to taking up employment. That is the reason the Government have devoted very considerable resources to AnCO as a means of combating the problem of young people.  In 1975 over 7,000 were trained on AnCO courses and the majority of these were in the 18 to 25 age group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the figures are kept on that basis.  In 1976 it is hoped to train 11,000 people as against the 7,000 in 1975.  It is planned to provide training places in the training centres for 1,000 apprentices and 4,000 adults by 1978 compared with the present capacity of 718 apprentices and 2,140 adult places.  In addition technician courses for approximately 800 students are being provided by the Department of Education at regional technical colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA have also involved themselves in the training process.  With the aid of the European Social Fund they have temporarily undertaken to assist in a training scheme which will <Col N="750" /> help both to alleviate youth unemployment and help to meet predicted skill shortages in several sectors.  The IDA propose to assist with the financing and training by approved employers of apprentices over and above the employers' normal training requirements. On completion of their training those apprentices taken from the unemployed young will not be retained by the employers concerned but will be made available for employment as craftsmen for IDA assisted projects.  An initial scheme has been agreed with the ESB and is being carried out in close co-operation with AnCO and the Department of Education. Other similar schemes are being negotiated with other bodies.  The EEC Commission have approved assistance of £4,626 for AnCO operations carried out in 1975.</P>

      <P>Assistance for operations in 1976 and 1977 will be £58,561.  I do not think that figure is very reliable.  It is not written out in a way that I can stand over it so I prefer not to rely on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would never embarrass me.  This is a new departure by the IDA.  They will assist in training in firms young people who will, as distinct from the present situation, not be retained in those firms but will be available to be taken up in other industrial projects assisted by the IDA.  Therefore, the IDA, knowing the type of project that is likely to be coming up for grant aid by them, will be able to directly identify the type of skills and the type of employers who can provide in their workplaces those skills for young people so that young people will be coming on the stream available to take up the jobs as and when they go into production as a result of IDA approved grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education are also involved in the training of young people.  A special scheme has been approved for aid by the European <Col N="751" /> Social Fund in this respect.  This scheme will operate in the regional technical colleges and other technical institutes in the vocational education system.  It will operate in the following four ways: (a) in pre-employment or preparation for work courses (b) in secretarial courses (c) in technician level skills and (d) in one year foundation courses for young persons wishing to pursue careers as accountants, administrators etc.  About 450 persons will be involved.  The total cost in the current academic year will be £250,000 half of which it is hoped will come from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>One of the problems on which I think all of us face criticism has been the feeling that married women are in some cases depriving some people of jobs.  This is obviously a difficult question for any politician to deal with.  But I shall make a few points which probably will not offer sufficient consolation to young people but it is important that the facts be put before them so that they can make their own judgment. First, it is correct to say that traditionally in European terms Ireland has had the lowest proportion of married women in her work force.  The figures which I have available are for 1971 and they indicate that at that time 3.5 per cent of our total work force was married women and that was then the lowest in Europe.  There are reasonable grounds to assume that continues to be the case.  There is the additional consideration that from the point of view of the employer for any employee, whether he has formal training or not, expense is incurred in training whether in providing simple work experience or more formal training.  If married women in the community have the training already, the expense by the employer or by another employer has already been incurred in relation to their training for a particular job and the employer is faced with the choice of taking on such a person in relation to whom he will not have to incur any training expense, explicit or implicit, or taking on instead a young person in relation to whom he will have to incur training expense.  Obviously, there is a great tendency for him in his own <Col N="752" /> economic interest to opt for the married woman because training expense will not have to be incurred in her case.  It is precisely for that reason that the Government in their response to this problem have laid a special financial emphasis on training, through AnCO, the regional vocational colleges and the vocational educational committees, rather than on make-work projects.</P>
    <P>We have deliberately chosen to move in the direction of training rather than make-work projects because in the long run it is only if young people have had training, which must be subsidised by the public purse, that they will be able to compete with other candidates available to employers, such as married women.  For that reason, it is very important that school leavers should give careful thought to the different training opportunities that are available to them rather than simply leave school and look for a job without exploring fully the training opportunities that exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have also initiated community youth training programmes to supplement AnCO's on-going training programme so that in this period of unusually high unemployment a number of young people with no previous work experience can usefully employ their time in acquiring basic skills and learning about work.  Under the programme, boys and girls up to 25 years of age recruited from the National Manpower Service register are engaged after an induction period in an AnCO training centre in projects such as renovating houses for old people, painting and decorating hostels and similar activities. To date, the programme has been confined to four pilot projects in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Dundalk and <Col N="753" /> Drogheda.  It is intended to extend it throughout the country and about 50 projects have already been proposed to AnCO from different places.  The important feature of this programme, apart from the fact that it is being aided by the European Social Fund, is that it will be assisting young people in doing work which itself has considerable social value.  In doing that work they will not be just engaged in make-work activities but in projects supervised by AnCO and a deliberate training orientation will be built into all these amenity projects in which young people will be engaged.</P>
      <P>The third and, perhaps, most interesting feature of the scheme is that the supervision of the young people on this work will be carried out by skilled tradesmen who were themselves previously unemployed and who will be engaged in working at their own trade but also in something new to them in some respects, passing on that trade to the young people involved in socially desirable projects.  There is a package of elements each of which individually is meritorious but the fact that they have been brought together in one project and that the EEC is prepared to aid it&mdash;I understand on the original proposition of the Minister for Labour&mdash;is a valuable initiative in European and in Irish terms.  I hope it will spread throughout the country. A very substantial number of applications have been submitted by my own county council in Meath and I am sure other county councils will do likewise.  Anybody who has any amenity project which involves a skill content and which is being considered by any local authority or other agency should bring it to the attention of AnCO so that this scheme can be invoked.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that we are facing a difficult economic situation.  It is clear that the Government policy of substantial investment in the economy, rather than the drastic cut-backs which some Opposition Deputies have tended to urge, is the right policy to bring us through this situation and ensure that our young people are ultimately placed in jobs with long-term independent viability and that our economy will benefit in the long run.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that the Government could not be expected to rob Peter to pay Paul.  I want to say that the Government are robbing both Peter and Paul.  Having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure the young people will be very happy indeed and will have some indication of what faces them in the future.  One solution mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary is a very interesting one, that is, if a young person could not get the job he desired, he should be told that there were opportunities in other sectors.  But where are the jobs?</P>
      <P>The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's failure to take positive steps towards providing employment for school leavers.</P>
      <P>The Government have not taken steps and are not aware of how many young persons are available for employment. The Minister for Labour told us today that he was not aware of the number of young people in the Ballyfermot area.  The Government are only now having surveys carried out to ascertain the extent of the problem.  This is a very serious problem and one that has been developing over the years. Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach told us that there were 83 school leavers on the register for employment.  That shows how far out of touch the Government is with the situation.  Each year there are 52,500 school leavers coming onto the labour market.  Quite a number of these school leavers cannot get employment and have no prospects for the future.  The Minister for Labour has given them no hope whatsoever.</P>
      <P>I want to quote from a statement made last February by the Leader of our party:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take our young people leaving school and college.  Why should they bear the brunt of the economic crisis and be demoralised by the lack of job opportunities?  We suggested setting aside a sum of £5 to £10 million to set young people to work on projects for community <Col N="755" /> improvements in their own areas. We had in mind a minimum of red tape, with young people using their skills and knowledge in association with voluntary bodies and community leaders to plan and provide these badly needed projects.  In this way thousands of young people could be employed and would be given the chance to do something valuable and worthwhile, while we of the older generation would be showing them in a practical way that we do care for them and do want to see their energies and enthusiasms put to work in the service of the people.</P>
    <P>This positive step was proposed by the Leader of our party in February last. We are now told that the Government are about to set up projects on which 28 people are employed.</P>
    <P>Something should be done in the short and long term to meet the very acute crisis which is upon us.  The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed the finger at married women.  The reason married women have to work is that their husbands and children cannot get employment.  He tends to blame married women for the present serious situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary and other Government speakers should indicate what they are prepared to do to relieve the situation.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I asked how many young persons were unemployed in the Ballyfermot area, which is a very important area of 37,000 people.  In that area, ranging from the ages of 15 to 20, there are 6,397 young people seeking employment from time to time. If we take the age limit of 25 which was given to us by the Parliamentary Secretary, we can add another 5,000 to that list.  Therefore each year between the ages of 15 and 25 there are over 11,000 young persons seeking employment.  I make a special plea on behalf of this depressed area in which there are thousands of young people who are unable to find employment. It is not good enough for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that they should seek opportunities in other sectors.  I have here an immense document <Col N="756" /> that goes out to school leavers each year, <i>Civil Service Careers for School Leavers</i>.  This booklet is one of the jokes of 1976.  One particular paragraph in this booklet states:</P>
    <P>If the information you require is not given in the brochure, do not hesitate to write to us.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that every person who receives this brochure will be writing to the Department of Labour for additional information.  We have been told that there are no jobs available, but the Department continue to send out elaborate brochures to schools.  This type of deception cannot be allowed to go unheeded.  This type of tactic has been used by the Government over a considerable period.  People want to know where the jobs are.  The Minister for Labour has not indicated where the jobs are. There are many other laughable paragraphs in this brochure.  Indeed, in the last paragraph we are told that the system of recruitment is under review. The rates of pay which are included with this brochure are not in accordance with an Act passed in this House, the Equal Pay Act.  The Minister has no right to circulate a document that is not in accordance with an Act passed in this House.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out some differentials in this leaflet.  For instance, the pay for a male post office clerk is £61.81 and for a female post office clerk it is £52.49.  For an appointment as assistant forester a man is paid £3,527 and a woman is paid £3,086. If you go right through this leaflet you will see how the Minister has broken the law.  As soon as the Equal Pay Act was passed the Minister was under an obligation to enforce it.  He has now found out from a higher authority that this document is wrong and he has broken the law on this, as he tried to do on other occasions.</P>
    <P>The social dangers for young people who are well educated and have no opportunity of employment are immense.  A crash programme should be implemented even at this late stage when the Government are about to go to the country.  It will not be too long before they go to the country having <Col N="757" /> robbed Peter and Paul as the Parliamentary Secretary said.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke about Ministers speaking in divers tongues.  This is true.  As I pointed out last Sunday, Government Buildings are now known as the Tower of Babel.  There everyone speaks in a different tongue and nobody understands anybody else.  That was the situation last night when we were listening to the Minister for Labour and it was the same situation tonight when we listened to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He gave us solutions about which, I am sure, the school leavers will not be too happy when they read his speech tomorrow.</P>
    <P>If people have been educated and promised jobs, but then find there are no jobs available, this could give rise to social tension.  This is a very serious problem which the Government will have to counter at the earliest possible moment.  Parents who have spent money educating their children in anticipation of future careers now find that these careers are not available.  All the brochures in the world will not make jobs available.  What we want now is employment for school leavers.  There is no point carrying out surveys now; they should have been carried out a long time ago.  Then the Government would have been in possession of vital information when dealing with school leavers.  Must it be the duty of the Opposition to keep harping on this problem so that the Government will be stirred into action?</P>
    <P>Time and time again Deputy Fitzgerald, Fianna Fáil spokesman for Labour, asked the Government to take action, and warned them of the social tensions that would, and are, arising because there are no opportunities of employment for our school leavers. They are being left high and dry.  They are left with a feeling of hopelessness. They feel cheated and frustrated because the Government have failed to respond to the call of the Leader and members of my party.  This situation is building into a social time bomb.  It it time the Government gave the young people some hope for the future and an opportunity of employment.</P>
    <P>We are told that there are 147,000 people unemployed.  The number of <Col N="758" /> school leavers registered for unemployment is only 83.  This shows how completely out of touch with the facts of life this irresponsible Government are. The Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister for Labour and other Ministers, all the intellectuals in Government, will have to be educated about the problems that confront the nation.  They admitted that they have no plan for the future. The Minister for Finance indicated that there is no social and economic plan for the future because the Government do not know the real extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see our young people used as pawns.  Some young people had hoped to get employment this year at home or abroad.  They are being frustrated by the situation which has developed in the schools.  Their future is at stake.  Their future is held to ransom by a dispute between the Minister and teachers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore mentioned the money the Minister made available sometime ago.  He said the job target was 10,000 but that that figure had not been reached.  The money made available in that employment scheme could not be applied to school leavers.  The Minister is deliberately misleading this House and school leavers if he indicates that one penny of the money made available for the premium employment scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Labour was a stranger to the truth when he made his statement last night.  I do not know what phraseology one can use to get this point across but they are the facts of life. In my opinion, the Minister has misled me and the House.  He is <Col N="759" /> not here now but I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and others would agree that not one halfpenny of this money could have been made available to put young people to work because it only applies to people who are out of work for a specific period and drawing social welfare benefits, and then go back into employment. Some school leavers cannot get social welfare because they have no stamps.  They are told if they have stamps to come back and they will get social welfare benefits.  There are no jobs available for them to get stamps.</P>
      <P>The Government's case, as presented to this House, reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the Ministers, the intellectuals, who appear to be so far removed from the realities of life that a re-education programme will have to be set up by Fianna Fáil to show them the real problems that confront the nation.</P>
      <P>As I said, I do not want to detain the House from the other speakers on this side of the House, seeing that there are no other Members of the Government side to make a contribution. Last night we had the spectacle that there was not a single Member on the Government benches available to make a contribution to this debate, which shows clearly the interest of the Government, both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, in this great problem that confronts our young people and the nation.  They had to be dragged into the House last night to get this debate going.  They have shown clearly during the course of this debate and through the recent statements of a variety of Ministers that they are utterly irresponsible.  The Parliamentary Secretary does not know what was in the Minister's mind or in the Minister for Labour's mind; neither does the Minister for Labour know what was in the Minister for Education's mind.  There is no question of collective responsibility. It is a hit-and-miss situation.  They are heading for the road and you can see them running fairly fast.</P>

      <P>The problem before us is a considerable one.  The terms of the motion cover a wide field, and I do not propose, in the 12 or 13 minutes available to me, to offer solutions to the whole problem.  I am hoping however that, in referring to one aspect of the problem and in making one or two positive recommendations to the Minister, he will accept the sincerity and the urgency of the case I make and its relevance to the problem, having regard to the duties which fall upon him towards our young people.</P>
      <P>I said here last month that when the history of the present Coalition is written they will be described by all who examine the many failures for which they have been responsible as the Government that shattered the dream of the young people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year many school leavers could not obtain employment, and as a result there was a return to school of many thousands who normally would have entered upon employment. Those youths and young students who were moving along in the stream find themselves now undergoing the annual and normal frustrations and anxieties that attach to Department examinations.  Those anxieties are burdensome enough but the students attending our colleges of technology and regional colleges have the attendant and very serious anxiety <Col N="761" /> that as of now there will be no examinations for them to take.</P>
    <P>I am making firm and practical proposals which I hope the Minister will accept.  The difficulties existing arise from what we can euphemistically call misunderstandings between the Minister for Education and the members of the TUI.  The custom has been&mdash;if you will bear with me for one moment, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle I will relate this to the problem of the school leavers&mdash;that in areas of such misunderstanding the Minister for Labour is the appointed Minister to bring the opposing sides together. We heard yesterday the Minister's statement of his case, and today I have the statement by the TUI indicating in a paragraph of a press release, which I want to put on the record of the House, that, &ldquo;if the Minister for Education agrees to the proposal&rdquo;, that is, to put the matter before the Labour Court, &ldquo;the officers of the union undertake to recommend to the executive committee that, pending the investigation of the matter by the Labour Court, the examinations will be set and marked this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to students who are leaving school this year and in an effort towards easing the anxiety and the frustration attaching to leaving school which have been so admirably presented by other speakers, I suggest to the Minister for Labour that this is one area where he can make a useful contribution.  It is not an area where he can claim that, because of prevailing climatic conditions, blizzards or storms, or because of the position abroad, he is unable to act.  This is one area where there is no difficulty whatsoever in his making a worthwhile contribution.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister is not here but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance are present, and I am conceding that they share my concern and the concern of the House in respect of the injustice which is being done by senior members of the community to the young people of this nation.  There was a time when the <Col N="762" /> nature of things was that the elders worried about the actions of their juniors.  It is an extraordinary turn of the wheel that the reverse now happens and in respect of this matter the erstwhile prodigal son is now the prodigal father, and the people who are guilty here in squandering that which ordinarily and rightfully belongs to the youth are the elders of this nation, and in a matter to which I specifically refer here, the Minister for Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision of employment for school leavers, and ordinarily inside the next two months there will be thousands of school leavers coming on the market.  Because of the botheration that exists between the Minister for Education and the TUI there is this uncertainty as to whether or not they can, as is their duty, leave school at all.  That I suggest is very relevant to the matter of young people leaving school and their prospects of employment.  If they cannot leave with that which is the normal qualification in respect of their attendance, surely it will be conceded that that in itself is injurious to their prospects of obtaining gainful employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relevant and related to that is another matter, and here I am speaking with relevance to the position of the Minister for Labour.  A kindred botheration in respect of this is the question of technicians employed.  In this area the botheration arises from the fact that the VEC, who nominally are the employers of these technicians in our colleges, accepted that these technicians should have parity with technicians in other areas.  When that recommendation went to the Minister <Col N="763" /> he refused to accept it.  An application has been made to the Employer/ Labour Conference to have that subject resolved.  I am appealing to the Minister for Labour to use his good offices towards having that request which has been made granted.</P>

      <P>Years ago I was attached to a club the slogan of which was <i>nil desperandum</i>.  I never lose faith or hope.  Perhaps that hope and faith are misplaced.  I am hoping that on this occasion they will not be.  Apart from everything else there is little difficulty for the Minister in granting that which I request, that he would indicate his concern for school leavers by notifying the officers of the Employer/Labour Conference that there is a matter before them relative to technicians employed in colleges awaiting decision, and unless it is resolved it can have, like the botheration existing between the Minister and the TUI, serious effects on examinations proposed for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Opposition are often accused by members on the other benches of an irresponsibility which was theirs when they were over here. Perhaps if the Fianna Fáil Opposition have a fault it is that they do not obstruct enough, that they misinterpret their role as being one of complementing the Government rather than opposing them.  I do not share the view that calls upon an Opposition irresponsibly to attack the Government. I do not see that as being the role of a true Opposition.  I see the role of the Opposition as indicating to the Government how they can resolve certain problems, irrespective of whether it was they or anybody else who created them.  In respect of the matters to which I have referred these botherations are the creation of the Government.  I have not dwelt on that.  I am indicating how they can be resolved and I am giving the Minister for Labour the opportunity in this area, which he controls exclusively, <Col N="764" /> to indicate to us the sincerity of his interpretation of his office, giving him an opportunity of leaving aside all the other alleged pseudo-problems which he has, indicating precisely how, in respect of the school leavers of this year and of their prospects of employment, he is the person who can resolve the <i>impasse</i> which exists.  Unless he does it, I will hold him responsible for the ensuing botherations which have been exemplified by previous speakers which inevitably must ensue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I spelled out in some detail the reasons why we submitted this motion to this House and the timing of such a motion.  I am sorry that even our Press today did not carry the reasons behind such a motion.  I regard that as lack of appreciation, by a very important group of people, of this most serious problem facing our established democratic State today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many points have been made on it. The contributions of Deputy Moore, Deputy Dowling and Deputy Tunney from this side of the House were indicative of their appreciation and concern for the situation that exists.  I am sorry I cannot say the same for the benches opposite.  I want to pay this tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary who spoke this evening.  His was a concerned contribution, one that obviously showed an appreciation of the problem.  I have no doubt the task imposed on him this evening was not a welcome one, because obviously he realised the failure of the Government to take the requisite steps, and that he would dearly love to walk into the division lobbies in a few minutes from now with this side of the House. It is a further indication that no backbencher in those two parties offered <Col N="765" /> any contribution.  May I say that the contribution from the Minister for Labour yesterday evening shied away from the subject, the problem.  He gave us a lecture on economics as he knows them, but could I ask the Minister for Labour or the people would they have any regard any longer for his opinion of an economic situation in which he has contributed to its ruination?</P>
    <P>I will again spell out a few points that I made last night and before doing so say that our young persons' unemployment problem is a very serious one.  It is not enough for any Minister to say that we always had a problem of school leavers.  Of course we had, but our problem now is that we have no opportunities for huge numbers of 1975 school leavers and indeed of school leavers of two months' time.  I spelled out some months ago the overall unemployment situation and suggested that the Minister and the Government would set up a body, an action committee, not a commission&mdash;I do not want commissions or reports.  I want positive action&mdash;consisting of Ministers, various agencies such as IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the banking and financial institutions, trade unions, of course, and the employers' organisations and representatives of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to them to consider that suggestion and to include people concerned about and connected with young persons.  A very eminent career guidance counsellor here has spoken on this problem on many occasions in the last two years.  I do not always agree with his utterances &mdash;particularly with his most recent one&mdash;but that is beside the point.  The important thing is that he has an appreciation and awareness of the situation.  In my opinion he would have something to contribute.</P>
    <P>This is a national emergency and there should be no mistake about that. The highest memorial in the graveyard to the failure of the National Coalition when they leave office would be their failure to realise the harm they are doing and the disillusionment they are causing among our young people.  We have more people in the 15 to 25 age group than any other EEC country.  A <Col N="766" /> tired, worn and defeated Minister for Labour last night tried to twist what happened in the sixties but I quoted for him, during my contribution on the Finance Bill, the views of an independent person regarding the sixties.  The people in the 15 to 25 age group were reared in homes that had become accustomed to a decent standard of living, thanks to good government that allowed our economy to prosper in the sixties.  Those young people became accustomed to an affluent society, something which was missing in the early years of this State.  What are they facing now?  They have a number of alternatives.  A small number of them can join the dole queues&mdash;no girls, of course.  Others can emigrate but to where?  There are no opportunities for them near home.</P>
    <P>There is a serious danger that those young people will be driven to do things we do not want to see them doing, engaging in vandalism and crime, taking drink and drugs.  If they are driven to that it will be because of the frustration they experienced in their efforts to obtain employment. They are also frustrated because they cannot see the Establishment giving them leadership in a positive direction.  There are areas where they can be employed.  Last night I mentioned a scheme in Navan, the constituency of the Parliamentary Secretary.  In Navan vocational school steps are being taken which tie up with the suggestion I made last night about a transitional year.  That transitional year for young persons could be used to train them to compete for employment against the huge numbers of well-qualified people who are now forming our dole queues.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about robbing Peter to pay Paul but the Government, to their eternal damnation, have only introduced one scheme to help the unemployed, unemployment benefit or assistance.  That is welcome in the case of those who are genuinely unemployed but we are a work force society, our people prefer to work.  Our young persons have tremendous goodwill and only need leadership.  They need to be shown a way to occupy themselves.</P>
    <P>I left school during a period of <Col N="767" /> Coalition Government and at a time when jobs were very scarce.  I spent a long time seeking employment.  Later, like other young people of my generation, I succeeded in getting employment at home, in spite of what the Minister for Labour said last night.  Many of my generation set up their own small businesses and prospered because there was a climate for them to do it.  In expanding they gave employment to others, but this Government look upon such people as speculators.  They look upon them as people who should be knocked and feel they should not be allowed to make any profit.  Our school leaving situation, and the problem of unemployment, is not caused by world recession or by increased oil prices.  It is caused because the Government deliberately set out to attack the person with initiative, the person with enterprise and the person who was making a success of business and giving employment.</P>
    <P>Another example of the wrong the Government are doing is the fact that they have decided to tax the co-operative movement.  There was no greater area of social employment because of its scattered nature throughout rural villages and towns than the co-operative movement.  Many young people were given temporary employment by these co-operatives.  It is necessary that young people be given temporary employment so that they do not dis-improve. For a young person to be left without employment for three months can be very damaging.  If those young people see nothing facing <Col N="768" /> them but further unemployment and lack of opportunity, they become frustrated.  I know of young people who went for 27 interviews to different organisations and failed at the end. In the traditional areas for employment&mdash;nursing, banks, the civil service and local authorities&mdash;there are fewer opportunities and a greater number of applicants.</P>
    <P>We need Ministers with courage to face this problem.  Unless they are prepared to take positive steps to tackle it these young people will become disillusioned with the Establishment, and God knows what the future will hold for them.  I appreciate the concern shown by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is different to what we experienced last night when there was not even one Member on the Government benches for the commencement of the debate on this motion.  In fact, we had to wait four minutes for a Government representative to arrive. Statistics should have been produced but, as Deputy Dowling said, it is too late for statistics now.  We must have action.  Nobody can deny the truth of our motion in which we are calling on the House to deplore the failure of the Government to take positive steps to provide employment opportunities for our young people. Whether or not the motion is carried makes no difference.  Posterity will prove us right that such was the case. It will be the highest memorial to this Coalition in the graveyard when that graveyard is entered in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of this debate is to establish the situation in regard to law and order.  The people are entitled to be told what the real position is.  It is hardly necessary for me to say that nothing but confusion exists at present.  Crime is rampant.  Each newspaper reports three or four robberies as well as incidents of violence and vandalism, all of which seem to be on the increase. People are genuinely terrified even in their own homes.  There are many areas, particularly in the cities such as Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where elderly people live in dread in their homes.  Much of the fear results from a Government decision of August last whereby financial restrictions were imposed by the Government on the Minister for Justice. The implementation of these restrictions has prevented the Garda Síochána from doing the work they should do.  The Minister says there have been no cutbacks in overtime but this is not true.  This afternoon <Col N="771" /> we had a question to the Minister asking him whether he had noticed the editorial in the current issue of the <i>Garda Review,</i> the official organ of the Garda Representative Body.  In this issue the editorial reads and I quote:</P>
      <P>Perhaps for the first time, since the beginning of the present political disturbances in the country, there is now real public concern about crime and disorder. Much of the public discussion in parliament and in the media has centred on the question of Garda overtime cutbacks; the Minister for Justice has said that essential services are not affected, the Opposition spokesman, Mr. Collins, has disagreed, the media keep on recording the daily total of robberies, pillage and violence.</P>
      <P>The public are entitled to some kind of explanation.  The victims of the armed criminal are entitled to some reassurance.  The working Garda himself is entitled to some basic guidelines; is serious crime any longer that serious?  If it is, surely the force is entitled to the wherewithal to fight it.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cooney is both right and wrong when he says that essential services have not been cut back. The working strength of the Garda Síochána is sufficient to hold the line against subversion and anarchy. The gunman cannot yet act with complete impunity.  In that sense, the Minister for Justice is right. But he is wrong if he believes that the Garda Síochána cannot do better in the fight against crime than the events of recent weeks would suggest.  We could and should do better.</P>
      <P>We could and should do better if we get the manpower and the resources to get on with the job. Policing is a service, which, to be accomplished successfully must be all-pervasive in society....</P>

      <P>The Garda Representative Body believe that if they had more gardai back on the beat, talking with people, finding out what was going on, they would be in a much better position to deal with criminals.  They say in their editorial that they need detectives back on the ground who would be keeping track of criminals' movements, anticipating their moves instead of, as is the case now, acting after the event.  This is what they believe to be the basics of efficient policing.  This is how they believe they should fight crime. Without them they say the criminal will always have the initiative.  They believe these basics have been largely abandoned in the interests of economy, not only in reducing overtime but also the simple numerical inadequacy of the Garda authorised strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Representative Body say the cutbacks exist.  In the course of an interview on 10th March last, the Minister stated that there had not been a cut back in Garda overtime but that its rate of growth had merely been restricted.  The Minister knows&mdash; indeed, we read in the public Press&mdash; that the Garda Representative Body failed to understand how the Minister <Col N="773" /> could make that statement denying a cutback in Garda overtime when he, as Minister, should know better from the facts which should be at his disposal. The Garda themselves are adamant that the cutback exists.  They say it is serious and sustained.  They further say it already has had a serious effect on the level and quality of the service given by the Garda to the public.</P>
    <P>The Garda themselves say the cutback is responsible for a grave diminution of Garda presence on the streets.  They say it is responsible for the widespread grounding of Garda patrol cars, leaving the public unprotected in sensitive times.  They further say the cutback exposes members of the Force to unnecessary danger and leaves the public unprotected in sensitive areas at sensitive times. It exposes members of the Force to unnecessary danger because of the lack of back-up services.  I understand that when the Minister met representatives of the Garda in September last he agreed there was a cutback.  On that occasion I understand the Minister told members of the Garda Representative Body that the scale of overtime was such as to make it impossible for him to argue with his colleagues in Government that there could not be a cutback in the light of the serious state of the economy.</P>
    <P>If that is true&mdash;and I have no reason to doubt it&mdash;it is an open admission on the part of the Minister that he failed at Government level to convince his colleagues that the protection of people and their property was of prime importance.  Other Ministers and other Departments have been able to get large sums of money, in the case of the Office of Public Works for the preservation of ancient monuments and old castles, and in the case of the Department of Defence to purchase a half a dozen or a dozen new small aircraft from Italy.  If these demands were given priority by the Government over the demands of the Minister for Justice for money to protect people and their property, one can only conclude that the Minister for Justice was not able to make the <Col N="774" /> case at Government level for more money for such important work.</P>
    <P>It is now acknowledged by the Garda that the cutback has been felt by virtually every section of the force. I understand the Garda have protested to the Commissioner and to the Minister about the serious effect it is having on the Garda service to the public.  We know that, prior to the introduction of the cutback, Garda Patrol cars were kept on the road even when it was necessary to employ men on overtime to crew them.  We know a system of beat tolerance in Dublin and certain other areas ensured a minimum level of street patrolling and emergency duties were available.  It is a fact&mdash;and I do not think the Minister can deny this&mdash; that, immediately after the introduction of the cutback, Garda cars were grounded, beat tolerance was discontinued, back-up services were cut back and directions were issued changing previous policy towards the employment of Garda on overtime in the investigation of crime.</P>
    <P>These are the views of the Garda Representative Body.  If these views are held by such a responsible body of people, something is radically wrong.  The effect of the Minister's cutback was that a strict system of financial control was introduced which made certain that the cutback was deep and effective.  The Garda Representative Body hold the view that the cutback has been implemented for its own sake without due regard to its effect either on the crime rate or on the morale of the Garda who see duties which were previously regarded as essential now disregarded.  This is extremely important.</P>
    <P>During Question Time I mentioned to the Minister that the morale of the Garda was affected as a result of the cutbacks.  The Minister replied that I was wrong.  If he wants to, he can tell the Garda Representative Body tonight that they are wrong.  The Minister knows this is the view held by this responsible body.  They are worried about the effect the cutback might have on the safety of members of the force particularly those on duty in Border areas.  I understand the Garda are now carrying out duties at <Col N="775" /> night close to the Border in circumstances in which prior to the cutback they would not have been asked to carry them out on their own.  If this is so, the situation is very bad indeed. Recently in this House, on an occasion similar to this, the Minister could not deny that, when we had the bomb explosion in Castleblaney, there was no member of the Garda on patrol in that town on that day between the hours of 12 or 1 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the evening.  That is in a town four or five miles from the Border.  The Minister can say, as he did today, that the Estimate for his Department is approaching £60 million.  I know he will say the force has been increased by about 30 per cent since 1971.</P>

      <P>The demands on the Garda are far greater now than ever before.  Ordinary people going about their ordinary business, shopkeepers, garage men, and so on, are entitled to police protection.  They are entitled to the comforting feeling that the local garda is on the beat.  The Minister, who has most generous resources at his disposal, must ensure that normal policing is something which can be seen.  The question is being asked: are the resources which are most generous being dissipated and wasted on spectacular propaganda show pieces like the Stagg funeral which we heard yesterday cost well over £100,000?</P>

      <P>The views I am expressing are not just my views but the views of the Garda Representative Body.  If Deputy Esmonde wants to get involved in a discussion like this, he knows how he can do it.  The Garda hold the view that they could do a much better job and could be far more effective if they were allowed to do their work.  Recently in the city of Limerick we had a petition signed by 5,000 people asking for more policing in the city, and I heard <Col N="776" /> that 10 extra gardaí had been allocated.</P>

      <P>The Minister was asked a simple question, if he would make a statement on the demand for <Col N="777" /> more men on the beat.  It was prompted by a report from the Garda Representative Body, but the Minister refused to answer that simple question. In the House, in by-elections and during the last general election, the Coalition laid great claims to being a law and order Government.  I heard them promising that all the necessary steps would be taken to give the people the protection they are entitled to. The fact is that we have been experiencing a wave of lawlessness the like of which the country has never experienced.  We have a situation at present when the movement of money or valuable goods in the normal course has become difficult and hazardous.  It has become so difficult that it must be having a serious effect on the business life of the country.</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that the Garda are making genuine efforts to handle this problem, but we must say that most of the problem is due to the handling of the Garda overtime issue.  The Government chopped at overtime without proper consideration of the ill effects involved.  The Minister has stated frequently that cutting overtime would have no effect on security but we cannot accept this because events since the curtailment of overtime have shown how wrong it is.  The hours of duty cannot be reduced without reducing the level of cover.</P>
      <P>I come from an area that has suffered greatly.  The people there are very disturbed at the level of security provided.  After the recent outrage in Castleblaney it was found there had been no foot patrol in the town when it occurred.  The Minister accepted then that it should not have happened. I now ask him to explain what he has done since to ensure that it will not happen again and that those areas will get proper cover from foot patrols.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that a debate on a subject as important as this has to be taken in this fashion which provides only a limited amount of time.  The subject of law and order is entitled to a comprehensive debate.  It is six years practically to the day since we last had an <Col N="778" /> opportunity in the House of having a comprehensive debate on the subject of law and order, giving full consideration to all the implications of that subject. I appreciate that Deputy Collins sought to raise it by way of Private Members' Motion but it was ruled out of order because it transgressed the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  It surprises me that with his well known ingenuity Deputy Collins was not able to draft a motion that would have enabled the debate to take place without transgressing the <i>sub judice</i> rule, and I begin to wonder does it suit Deputy Collins better that such a debate should take place in such a confined time as is permitted on the Adjournment lest the debate would widen to the scope which this subject deserves.</P>
      <P>I want to set the record straight on a couple of matters involving what was said in the debate so far and at Question Time today which might bring with them undue public alarm and uneasiness or might give the impression in this country or further afield that law and order have broken down and that this is a nation where lawlessness is the order of the day.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There was an unfortunate rash of robberies some weeks ago but I am precluded, happily, from commenting on them because the vast majority are <i>sub judice</i>.  They are <i>sub judice</i> because we have an active, intelligent, dedicated, loyal police force whose morale is of the highest.  If the position were as Deputy Collins wants to present it to the House, of a dispirited force with no morale, the position which prevents us debating these matters could not have arisen. That fact speaks for itself, and in my journeys throughout the country that fact has been noted by the people with whom I have come in contact to their satisfaction and their peace of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is erroneous and fallacious to try to relate the crime rate to the amount of money being spent.  There is no mathematical relationship between the number of police and the number of crimes committed and it is fallacious to say that is so.  Therefore, it is erroneous to say that a restriction in the growth of overtime&mdash;words are important here: there was not a cut back <Col N="779" /> but a restriction in the growth of over-time&mdash;was the cause of the spate of armed robberies which we have experienced.</P>
    <P>Who can say on the other hand that if there had been unlimited overtime those robberies would not have occurred?  There are explanations other than the amount of overtime being made available to the Garda and I will come to that subject in a moment.  I would remind the House that when the decision was taken by me last August with regard to overtime, it was then running at a rate which if it had continued unchecked would have exceeded £10 million for the calendar year 1975.  In a force of over 8,000 men this would have meant average overtime payments of £1,100 to £1,200 per member.  Bearing in mind that a great number of gardaí are on duties which do not attract any overtime, this would clearly mean very large payments to some members.  This was a cause of worry not only to me but to the Garda authorities themselves. It was also a source of worry for many members in the other ranks of the Garda and their representative body.  This type of payment was not to be desired in the sense that it would be preferable to have such a payment made by way of ordinary pay rather than putting it in the overtime bracket, because the latter can bring an expectation of a continuation when, of its nature, it is only temporary.</P>
    <P>That was the rate at which overtime pay was running and it was because it was running at what I considered to be an excessive rate that I decided, not by reason of any financial constraint, to impose a check.  I want to make it clear to the House, and the budgetary figure confirms this, that where money is required for the maintenance of law and order, it will be and has been made available. There is no question of budgetary constraint or of my not being able to get the money I want.  It was a deliberate policy decision taken by me that the continued growth had to be checked but, as I said at the time, <Col N="780" /> this was a decision that was not taken in isolation.  It had to be taken in perspective and the perspective and the part of the perspective was a planned management survey of the Garda to ensure the most efficient and economic deployment of the men.</P>
    <P>That survey is under way and I hope to have the consultants' report towards the end of the summer. When the report is to hand and the result of the scientific assessment is available, further decisions can be made with regard to the future size and deployment of the force.  Should the arguments and conclusions be in favour of an increase in the Garda that increase will be provided. Should the conclusions be in favour of redeployment that will be done. Deputies opposite and the country can be assured that, whatever financial implications will arise out of implementing the findings of that report, these financial implications will be met and gladly met.</P>
    <P>I might now mention some global figures.  The figure for the Garda Síochána Vote this year is £57,837,000; including two Supplementary Estimates and covering the overtime last year the figure was £52,500,000.  As I made clear, the restriction on the growth of overtime does not apply to expenditure in the security area.  I must say I was quite shocked and horrified when Deputy Collins criticised the action of the Government in what it did to prevent a propaganda exercise being carried out by the Provisional IRA on the occasion of the burial of the late Francis Stagg. Deputy Collins's words were that this was a spectacular propaganda showpiece. It was nothing of the sort.  It was an important exercise in maintaining law and order, a subject upon which he expresses concern.  It was an important exercise in asserting the will of this Parliament and showing that this nation was not going to be used by any subversive organisation for a propaganda exercise and the action of the Government had the complete support not merely of the gardaí themselves but of the entire community. I have no doubt about that. I was very heartened by the response I got from individual members of <Col N="781" /> the Garda Síochána who expressed complete satisfaction with what had been done.  To say in the context of this debate that that was a waste of money shows a gross misunderstanding of the realities of law and order. I reject Deputy Collins' suggestion that there had been a breakdown or a loss.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>There was, as I said, a rash of particularly worrying robberies some weeks ago but it is fallacious to say those robberies can be attributed to the strength of the Garda Síochána or to any loss of overtime.  If the Garda were trebled in number who is to say such incidents would not have taken place?  The important thing is&mdash;again I must emphasise this &mdash;that we cannot debate these in detail now because they are now <i>sub judice</i>.  That is the important thing and it is because of that that Garda morale is high and that the people are reassured their security is in good hands.</P>
    <P>We are here suffering from a spill over of troubles in another part of the island.  The gun was introduced into this island by the formation of the Provisionals, and I have to recall regretfully, but we might as well call a spade a spade, that a Member of this House has claimed some responsibility in the formation of that evil organisation and he has implicated people who were then colleagues of his, some of whom are still in this House and are <Col N="782" /> on the front benches opposite me&mdash;I exclude the present occupants&mdash;but the cult of the gun, which that vile organisation has brought to this island, has been largely responsible for the troubles from which we are suffering, largely responsible for the incidents which have caused worry to Deputies opposite, to me and to the population in general.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the population in general and Deputies opposite that, as far as this Government are concerned, the cult of the gun will be kept in control and will be finally eliminated and people need have no worry about their personal safety and the members of the Garda Síochána need have no worry about the well-being of their force.  I am concerned about the well-being of the force because I am conscious of the tradition my party has in relation to the setting up of that force and to the initial policy decision taken that it be an unarmed civil power.  I am anxious to preserve it in its high place in our society and to ensure that it will always be an efficient force of high morale and, whatever money will be needed to maintain that and whatever extra men may be needed, when we have the report of this scientific assessment that is being made of the Garda Síochána, that money will be provided and provided willingly.</P>
