      <P>If ever the present income tax structure and its injudicious nature was highlighted by anyone, it was by the Minister for Finance who emphasised how inequitable it is.  This made me believe that there is an urgent need for us to review our taxation system and consider whether it is still possible to lavish subsidies on our industrial sector while, at the same time, imposing a crippling burden of taxation on workers.  Can anyone justify the present discriminatory tax structure, when 700,000 workers covered by PAYE contribute 82 per cent of the total income tax revenue, companies contribute a miserly 5 per cent, farmers a negligible 1 per cent, and export orientated foreign capitalists contribute absolutely nothing?  These are very illuminating statistics.  In the light of them, I wonder who is contributing most to the economy.  Is it the workers who are making demands to enable them to bear this crushing burden of taxation?  Is it the companies who enjoy the multiplicity of taxation concessions? <Col N="832" /> Is it the foreign companies who function completely free of taxation while benefiting from the <i>largesse</i> of IDA grants paid for out of the taxes of the workers?</P>
      <P>As if this direct taxation which cripples the working section of our community so much is not enough, the worker gets a second going over with the high rate of indirect taxation, VAT, and so on.  As the Minister noted in his budget speech, indirect taxation is notorious for its regressive effects, and for the fact that inevitably it bears most heavily on those least able to afford it. The Minister was quite right to advert to this matter.  Despite what the Minister said, the budget laid most emphasis on indirect taxation.  At present Ireland enjoys the dubious distinction of having the highest incidence of indirect taxation in the EEC.  As I worked on these figures I found that indirect taxation accounted for 55 per cent of all tax revenue collected in 1975, while direct income taxation accounted for 45 per cent.  I believe the recent budget merely added fuel to the flames by introducing exasperating increases in indirect taxation, increases which are barely offset by the paltry increases in the tax free allowances.</P>
      <P>The fact that tax revenue is composed of direct income taxation, with the worker paying 82 per cent, and indirect taxation with the worker again bearing the brunt, would seem to belie the notion that one of the functions of taxation is to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth. The Labour Party have always champoined the Robin Hood approach of taxing the rich in order to support the poor.  I may be accused of being over-critical, but it seems to me that the recent budget was more in favour of the opposite, of taxing the poor in order to support the rich.  I believe we have reached a crisis point with regard to this crushing burden of taxation on the working classes.  The patience of the workers has been exhausted. Unless there is a restructuring of the whole taxation system, an easing of the PAYE burden, and a spreading of the tax load, we will soon be faced with the prospect of a taxpayers' revolt. That is not exaggerating the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> The Minister for Finance displayed a commendable grasp of the gross inequities of our tax system in his budget speech.  I should like to give a few quotes from his speech.  He mentioned that 72 per cent of total taxation came from indirect taxation, the old reliables, the cost of which bears most heavily on the working classes. He said in Ireland 50 per cent of total earnings is taken by taxation at an earnings level of just over £13,000. The next lowest corresponding thresholds in the EEC are Britain at £16,000, the Netherlands at £25,000, and Italy £100,000.  In France the State never takes 50 per cent of earnings. The Minister has shown we have a system of taxation which is grossly inequitable.  What he said is a very praiseworthy analysis.  However, an analysis is not enough.</P>
    <P>The steps the Minister took to alter the taxation system by way of anti-evasion measures, extending the net to include the lumpers and, to a small degree, the farmers, as well as the proposals for contemporary assessment, all fall far short of the type of measure necessary to reconstruct the tax system along justifiable lines.  The Minister, regrettably, did not go beyond recognising the disproportionate distribution of the tax burden.  He proposed nothing which would accomplish a fundamental change in the present tax system.  If the Minister is sincerely determined to equalise the tax burden I propose that he establish immediately a taxation review committee which would provide him with recommendations for reforming the present system.  I do not envisage this as some long drawn out committee which would make recommendations to him in a few years.  This committee, as a matter of urgency, should tackle this crippling taxation burden on the PAYE sector in general and the lower income groups in particular.</P>
    <P>We should aim at completely removing the tax burden from the lower paid sector by spreading the burden evenly across the economic spectrum. Such a spreading of the load would entail a closer look at the multitude of tax concessions enjoyed by companies <Col N="834" /> as well as the low level of farmers' contributions.  This committee could report to the Minister within ten weeks.  He could then accept their recommendations and implement them in a budget on 1st July.</P>
    <P>The Minister, to show his sincerity in what he has said, should act with all haste to ensure that what he has said can be implemented.  This could be implemented by applying higher company taxation, perhaps eliminating some of the tax free concessions, which foreign industrialists enjoy in this country. We are obsessed with the question of exports.  This export obsession is not only evidenced by the myriad of tax concessions offered to industry with export sales relief, accelerated depreciation, stock relief and so forth, but also by the millions of pounds which the IDA offer in capital grants to foreign industrialists who agree to set up industries in Ireland.  Over £45 million was paid to those people in 1974.</P>
    <P>This export obsession also underlines the pay pause demands of industrial employers, the argument being that our competitiveness is being seriously undermined by wage costs. Since exports are the mainstay of employment, the argument goes, a pay pause is required, if further unemployment is to be avoided.  This is not correct as I will explain later.  The continuation of our economic crisis into our third year, the 118,000 people who remain unemployed and the system of taxation which fleeces the poor to support the rich, all demand that we give up looking for solutions in piecemeal economic tinkering and start questioning some basic assumptions.</P>
    <P>We must have a cost/benefit analysis of these taxpayer subsidised bonanzas for export industries.  What have they achieved in terms of immediate employment? Is the preoccupation with export growth costing us too much? This is the only way out of the labyrinth of economic depression.  The argument regarding competitiveness is a conventionalism for most but the recent Economic and Social Research Institute commentary maintains that industrial exports did not lose competitiveness in 1975 when compared with other <Col N="835" /> OECD countries.  There may be many valid reasons for a pay pause but the scare tactics of relating pay increases to a disastrous fall in export competitiveness simply does not wash.</P>
    <P>The soaring unemployment figures indicate that job creation is forever falling far behind job loss and export industries do not have the capacity to provide the necessary level of employment. Of course, the world is in recession but an economy which depends so heavily on exports and, therefore, on the continued economic growth of other countries, leaves itself in a most vulnerable position because when the balloon bursts it is inevitably left defenceless.</P>
    <P>The policy is even less justifiable when workers are taxed into oblivion and the Government give massive handouts to foreign export industries which contribute nothing by way of taxation and an insufficient amount by way of employment.  Foreign capitalists are always the first to withdraw in difficult times since their commitment to the economy of this country does not extend beyond the tax free profits already obtained.  It is amazing that we lack so much confidence in the economic benefits of fostering a home demand, a demand which so many foreign importers are eager to exploit.</P>
    <P>The failure of export industries to protect and to maximise employment is very evident.  We no longer have the right to link the fortunes of our people to every slump and recession in the world economy.  It is time to devote some sort of effort to fostering the home market and jobs in home-orientated industry, instead of giving it to developing jobs in the export industries in the last decade.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing an embargo on export efforts and I am no economic isolationist or economic Sinn Féiner, far from it; I am only interested in achieving a realistic balance which will encourage productive Government spending and offer people opportunities for employment.  The present imbalance is the result of supporting capital intensive industry rather than labour intensive industry.  Nearly two-thirds <Col N="836" /> of the jobs in Irish manufacture are still dependent on the home market for survival.  It makes more sense to protect jobs through labour subsidies than to subsidise foreign capital to provide jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to protect our citizens' most basic right, the right to work.  The recent budget demonstrated a total lack of commitment to job creation.  Direct and indirect taxation continues to undermine the living standards of our workers while money continues to pour into the coffers of manifestly incapable and foreign dominated export industries.  It is apparent to me, and it should be to many who are studying the economy, that the working people of Ireland are paying everybody's way in the present crisis and that any new sacrifices which the Government deem necessary will fall on their shoulders alone.</P>
    <P>If Ireland is to continue to be a place worth living in it is essential that we examine our basic economic assumptions, that we spread the burden of the crisis fairly, that we do not tax our workers out of existence in an attempt to prop-up foreign capital with this misguided faith in the capacity of export industries eventually to solve all our problems.  We should make a new commitment to social injustice and unemployment.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Minister's dilemma in choosing those areas which provide the most money and impose the least hardship on the taxpaying public but, without being over-critical, I got the feeling that the budget was a most unimaginative one.  It seemed to me that it was done in haste and sufficient effort was not made by the Minister's Department to examine other areas where tax could be applied without hurting those most vulnerable.  One wonders why the Minister taxed motorists so severely and allowed the punter to escape unscathed.  This is particularly mystifying in the light of the staggering fact that £1½ million was speculated in the first four weeks of this year, which represents 62 per cent increase over the same period last year. We are left to wonder why those massive sums escaped the taxman's net. <Col N="837" /> The punter could have been taxed to alleviate the burden of the car owner.</P>
    <P>I believe, if we are to save existing jobs&mdash;the figures each week suggest that something of an emergency nature may have to be applied&mdash;especially those vulnerable to free trade, we must give serious consideration to some form of import controls as an emergency measure.  We have the highest rate of unemployment in the EEC.  The official unemployment rate is 13 per cent.  In my area alone I have estimated from a survey that it is over 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>A 13 per cent rate is more than twice the average for the EEC countries. In Ireland unemployment was endemic for a long time but now it has reached epidemic proportions and with a virulence that saps the life of our nation.  In a situation like this we should be obsessed with the question of solving the problem.  I wounder why we have not applied import controls. The director of the business bureau in Brussels expressing surprise that we have not applied some form of import control, says this is all the more surprising in light of the fact that Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession entitled us, up to the end of 1977, to take safeguard measures. That Article refers also to Denmark and the UK but the director of the business bureau emphasises that Ireland is the only country which can take such safeguard measures in the case of extreme urgency, notifying the Commission after the event.  That is an important point.  I believe the other member countries would sympathise with us in our problem and would realise that because we have the highest unemployment rate, we have no option but to safeguard existing employment. Therefore, we should avail of this special provision in the agreement. Undoubtedly, this safeguard was in the minds of our negotiators when the Treaty was agreed and signed.  Apart from this provision, France and Italy provided ample precedent recently for the imposition of emergency import controls.</P>
    <P>The capital programme is worth examining in the light of the unemployment problem.  This programme, ten years ago, accounted for 33.5 per <Col N="838" /> cent of government spending while in 1975 it accounted only for 24 per cent or a loss of £176 million in 1975 terms.  This is a foreboding development since the capital programme offers the best opportunity for productive government spending.  Investment in the programme creates jobs, produces tangible benefits in increased housing, road works, public buildings and so on.  For the past year-and-a-half I have been emphasising the need for the expansion of the capital programme and for the implementation of a public works programme.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem is more than a burden on the State in terms of social welfare payments.  It has a very depressing effect on those who are out of work.  These people are anxious to find employment.  They find it embarrassing and demoralising to have to queue up for benefit.  There is the factor also of hardship resulting from the drop they suffer in their standards of living.  The CII have estimated this drop to be 50 per cent. These factors should be borne in mind when we talk of these people living on handouts.  It is a sad reflection on us that we have so many of our people in this predicament.  The recent capital programme should have taken account of the unemployment situation and should have committed a greater proportion of funds to job-intensive sectors.</P>
    <P>Taking inflation into consideration and realising that the rate is still galloping, I wonder if a 17.3 per cent increase in respect of building or a 4.4 per cent increase in respect of housing was adequate.  Were such increases an indication of a determination to expand the capital programme so as to lessen the unemployment problem?  I do not think so.  I recognise the needs of the industrial sector.  I appreciate the need for increasing enormously the amount of money that must be put into this sector but I am aware also of the needs of the 22,000 people who were laid off in the construction industry.  Many of those people could be returned to work immediately if funds were allocated to the job-intensive sectors.  This would not involve any drain on our external reserves.  It would not involve massive imports because we would be concentrating <Col N="839" /> on the home-generated products such as cement and all the other ancillary products associated with the construction industry.  I am disappointed that no determined effort was made in this field.</P>
    <P>Regarding the IDA, the industrial grants scheme should be reviewed with the object of replacing these handouts with long-term interest-free loans.  Such a scheme would mean that investment in Ireland would continue to be attractive and would provide a fund which would replenish itself to some degree. A stricter criterion of job intensity should be applied to developers seeking assistance.</P>
    <P>So far as the banks are concerned, these institutions have failed to play a socially useful role in directing the financial resources of the country towards more productive development such as job creation.  Instead, they have fanned the flames of home-created inflation by expanding the money supply and by making available a large amount of credit for non-productive purposes.  They have amassed assets of almost £3,000 million and they have profit margins in excess of 55 per cent. They hold in their hands the fortunes of many enterprises, industrial and agricultural.  The criterion they apply is in terms of profits attainable when the enterprises concerned, in order to help them protect the livelihoods of those they employ, should be receiving every assistance.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why we should not impose an exceptional levy on bank assets, say 1 per cent?  Such action was taken in France in 1969 as an exceptional measure and has been continued since.  A similar measure here would generate revenue in excess of £25 million, an amount which could be used to finance the extension of the capital programme or the employment premium scheme and which could assist the construction industry.  Such an extension has been mentioned as one means of rescuing six major construction projects planned for Dublin alone.  Both areas offer immediate advantages in increased home demand. Is there any reason why the banks should not be compelled to offer low <Col N="840" /> interest loans to labour-intensive enterprises? Why should the Government not take steps to ensure the productive use of credit or why should the profits made by banks from their foreign investment not be taxed severly?  Is there any reason why the banks should not declare an emergency delay on the repayment of loans by firms faced with the prospect of redundancies or closures?</P>
    <P>An analysis of bank profits would suggest that the percentage paid by way of tax revenue is very small.  I wonder if there is any reason why the tax on banks' profits should not increase at the same time as the tax on workers increases.  It is the function of government to ensure that society's wealth is used to the best advantage of the community.  No one sector should be asked to bear the weight while others profit from subsidies and concessions.</P>
    <P>The export industry is of crucial importance.  It can only benefit from the level of Government assistance given to it.  Assistance cannot be provided at the cost of an inequitable tax structure with the workers alone pulling their weight.  Banks, farmers and companies must contribute also.</P>
    <P>We are at a critical point.  I believe that suggestions along the lines I have made could help to reduce unemployment and get the country moving again. We must be prepared to take control of our problems if they are not to take control of us.  The wider interests of the many must outweigh the narrow interests of the few.</P>
    <P>We have almost forsaken our young school leavers.  As an emergency measure, is there any reason why we cannot call for the early retirement of people in their sixties with full compensation granted to them in order to make way for the school leavers to enter industry?  In this way we could absorb many of the young people and help the economic situation.  They would be paying taxes, they would be contributing to the economy and the Government would not suffer any loss of revenue.  Is there any reason why we cannot have a plan for phased retirement, where a person could go on a three-day week or a two-day week and <Col N="841" /> where the school leavers could be brought in on a graduated basis?  This would not upset the work force or the economy and it would be of help to people who are about to retire.</P>
    <P>There can be no progress in a country where people have no faith in the future.  I was interested to hear the call by the Tánaiste for an economic and social plan.  I hope there will be early action on this matter.  An economic plan must be prepared that will open the opportunity for steady and productive employment.  We must be told about the way the economy is going.  I should hate to think that we were frittering away each day in a Micawber-like fashion hoping that something will turn up.  If we float along rudderless we will be in serious trouble and the public and national morale will suffer.  If people saw evidence of Government leadership, of a plan and of the goals to be attained, it would boost their morale and they would be prepared to contribute.  We must take the burden from the lower section of the community who are paying tax.  That burden should be spread more widely and I call now for implementation of the recent recommendation that the farming community should contribute a lot more in the payment of tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to many of the speeches in this debate and I have been puzzled on hearing them.  In the course of his budget speech, the Minister indicated that clarification of the future management of the economy and the measures to be taken would be announced.  We wonder what is still to come because so far we have had a budget a day from the Government. We are in a serious situation because the budget is only a part of the overall system we will be debating in the course of 1976.  It is obvious that the budget is responsible for many increases in the price of commodities. We heard the Minister in this House predict that as a result of the increase in VAT charges the price of the pint would rise by 1p but it is indicated in the Press this morning that the increase will be 3p.  This gives some idea <Col N="842" /> of the inaccuracies in the statements of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The Minister could properly be called the political pickpocket of the seventies.  He has dug deep into every pocket in the country and, as Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, the housewives and the workers are those who are most seriously affected.  However, we have heard no suggestions for an immediate remedy for the tragic situation that faces the country.  We have had many utterances from the Minister.  Recently, according to a supplied script, the Minister was found talking to himself outside a licensed premises with nobody to listen to him.  This is because nobody believes him any more.  We must examine the situation and see what steps can be taken in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>There have been rumblings from the Tánaiste about an economic and social plan.  What will this be based on?  This is the first time we have heard the suggestion.  Is it because they are about to collect their conscience money that they talk about an economic and social plan, because their pensions are safe?  This is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider the unfortunate people who are unemployed.  We are told the number will rise to 130,000 in the very near future.  I suggest that an immediate examination be carried out in each local authority area regarding labour intensive schemes. Local authorities should be instructed to establish working groups to develop such projects and I will outline some of them during the debate.  These schemes would not interfere in any way with the permanent staffs or with projects that are on hands.  Co-operation with the Office of Public Works and with the Department of Lands would be worthwhile because the Office of Public Works have machinery that is depreciating in value because of lack of use.  There are many schemes that require nothing but a labour content.  The pooling of resources in a national emergency of this kind is necessary and desirable <Col N="843" /> and it should be undertaken immediately.</P>
    <P>During this debate I will give the Minister a few suggestions he might consider.  Let us consider the census of population which was shelved by the Government because it would cost £1.3 million.  It was a completely irresponsible action on their part.  I suggest that this project would have a high labour content.  People who are unemployed at the moment are receiving 85 per cent of their wage packet and if the census were carried out it would cost only an additional 15 per cent.  I do not think the Government are serious about an economic and social plan.  I think the rumblings from the Tánaiste have come because of the pressure of members of the Labour Party, if they are still members of that party.  Immediate action should be taken on the compilation of a census of population.  That is both necessary and desirable in order to provide a base or platform from which to work in regard to future programmes and projects.  It is imperative that we should have projections for the future and, from that point of view, a census of population is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare has again spoken without apparently the authority of the Government.  The cloak of collective responsibility seems to have slipped and we now have from time to time rumblings and statements made in peculiar ways and in peculiar places.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to reconsider their attitude on this question of compiling a census of population.  Such work would be labour intensive.  I have already dealt with the cost and shown how the cost could be kept at the lowest possible figure while, at the same time, providing a certain amount of employment.</P>
    <P>Local authorities in conjunction with the Office of Public Works could put in hand certain capital projects, such as the cleaning of water courses, the reclamation of land and, in cooperation with the Department of <Col N="844" /> Lands, the planting of trees.  There would be ample scope in such projects for the employment of many men.  No heavy machinery would be required.  Building sites could be prepared. In the 1940s building sites were prepared in the Crumlin area but, because of the shortage of cement, houses could not be built at that time. These houses were subsequently erected.  I have travelled all over the country on numerous occasions and I know there is a great deal of work that could be done on schemes that would be labour intensive but would not require any great capital expenditure. I know the Government are bankrupt, so bankrupt they have not even enough with which to pay a compliment.</P>
    <P>Problems must be solved.  All over the country in every parish there is scope for the development of playgrounds. The unemployed could be taken off the dole queues and put to work on such schemes.  I fully agree with John O'Connell&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy John O'Connell.  I fully agree with Deputy O'Connell that the situation needs critical examination.  There is a constant demand throughout the country for sportsfields.  Preparing such grounds would not interfere in any way with the permanent employees of local authorities.  A great deal of work needs to be done in Army barracks and camps.  That work could be done by manual labour without machinery or any very expensive materials.  The work will have to be done at some stage, a stage at which it will probably cost a great deal more than it would cost now.  The men on the dole queues could be put into productive employment at no great cost, as I have pointed out and this employment would help the morale of the people.  We must get people back to work and restore their confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work could be done on land reclamation. This would not require machinery.  It could be done by <Col N="845" /> manual labour.  Land that has become overgrown could be cleaned up and put into production.  Very often the owner is unable to get local labour to do this kind of work.  If this land were cleaned up, it might be possible for the Government to lease it to people who would use it thereby increasing agricultural production. There are numerous schemes that could be carried out without machinery or with limited machinery.  If machinery were required, such as trucks and bulldozers, these could be obtained from the local authorities and the Board of Works.  Some kind of working cadre should be set up to carry out productive programmes at small cost, taking the unemployed off the dole and restoring their confidence, the confidence they have lost over the last few years.</P>
    <P>The difference between the social welfare benefits paid, in many cases, 85 per cent, and the 100 per cent. which it was based, is 15 per cent. We should have productive schemes and not merely be digging holes and filling them in again.  So far we have been given no hope.  We must have more jobs immediately.  The Government have a responsibility to do this. They have neglected to do this over the years with the result that we now have a crisis.  We hear strange sounds from Ministers indicating that we now need economic and social plans. Some time ago the Minister for Finance told us it was impossible to formulate a future plan because we did not know where we were going.  If that is true, it will not be possible to do what the Tánaiste suggested. Bluff no longer works.  Whatever shred of confidence the people had in this Government, it has been lost and the people are waiting for an opportunity to demonstrate this.</P>
    <P>The compilation of the census of population is very important.  This point cannot be stressed too much. Future plans must be based on statistical information.  In two, three, five or even seven years' time, it may be impossible to produce future plans because of the failure of this Government to provide statistical information. Or, is it their intention to cover <Col N="846" /> up their mistake by not keeping statistics up to date?</P>
    <P>In the documents circulated, it is interesting to note that information of the public relations service in the Department of the Taoiseach shows a decrease.  This means that the Taoiseach no longer wants to give information. The collection of statistics in the Central Statistics Office shows a reduction from £680,000 to £392,000. In his reply the Minister, I hope, will give some indication of the positive and immediate steps this bankrupt Government will take to alleviate the situation until such time as they are put out of office.</P>
    <P>Social welfare benefits and the dole have been mentioned in newspapers and in this House from time to time. I am sure the majority of people signing on the labour exchanges and on the dole want to work.  Of course, there are some who do not and some who will never work again.  If unemployment and social benefits are to be used as a means to this end, we must ensure that the necessary measures are taken to see that the people who make their contributions to the nation are adequately rewarded.  There must be a productive end to everything if we are to be successful.  In some countries retired benefits are based on declared income.  That means the income one earns during the year decides the size of one's pension.  In many cases this means a man may get a retirement pension far in excess of ours.  People who make their contributions to the nation over the years are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of talk about the abuses of social welfare and the dole.  In a declared income situation, the man who pays his taxes and meets his contributions over the years will get a greater reward.  The man who does not want to work and evades his responsibility will not get the same retirement benefits and rightly so.  Many people in receipt of social welfare benefits are not getting enough.  The Minister gave them a 10 per cent increase at a time when inflation was at 20 per cent.  These weaker sections of the community must be protected.  All Governments could <Col N="847" /> have done more.  If there are abuses of the social welfare system, they should be terminated to ensure that those who are working and paying their way do not have to carry others.  We should have a retirement system which would depend on the amount a person paid in taxes.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have lost their identity.  They are no longer the Labour Party.  Listening to their contributions, one realises that this is basically a one-party Government.  Of course, from time to time there are rumblings from the backbenchers but they mean little.  The Labour Party are now part of the Fine Gael Party and have accepted the dictates of the Minister for Finance.  One wonders how these people will feel in the future.  There is no doubt that the Taoiseach when forming the Government cleverly placed the Labour Party members.  He put Deputy M. O'Leary in the Department of Labour, a sensitive area.  He has the equal pay problem around his neck and has been unable to deliver the goods, notwithstanding all the hullabaloo and Press releases through the Government Information Services, and outside it, in Bangkok and Australia.  He is now in a sorry situation.  He is faced with strikes everyday.  Now that the rot has set in it is important that we would point these things out.</P>
    <P>There are 23,050 persons unemployed in the building trade.  The Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, tells us that a record number of houses is being built.  Let us look at the facts of the situation and let us again call the bluff.  However the Minister may twist the figures, the facts are that there are 23,050 building workers unemployed. This is the highest number of building workers unemployed since figures were first compiled.  Cement sales were down in 1974 by 4 per cent, in 1975 by 10 per cent and this year so far by 2½ per cent.  The manufacture of bricks is falling off.  Builders' suppliers in some cases have reduced staffs and in other cases have gone out of business because of lack of demand for timber and other components for building. <Col N="848" /> Many furniture manufacturers have gone out of business and others are on short time because of lack of demand on the part of home seekers.  By mid-November last, in the year of the so-called record, the figure for local authority dwellings completed was 7,600, whereas the target was 8,500 dwellings.  In the Dublin Corporation area, in 1975, 1,529 dwellings were completed but in 1967-68 Dublin Corporation were able to complete 1,964&mdash;500 more than in that so-called record year.  We were told that most of the houses would be in Dublin city. In 1968-69 1,996 houses were completed. In 1969-70 1,858 dwellings were completed by Dublin Corporation&mdash;almost 400 more than in the &ldquo;record&rdquo; year.  These were not record years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can tell the House how he can build houses in record numbers without sand, cement, timber and men?  He has been building castles in the air.  We were told in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that the building industry has the highest jobless rate&mdash;23,050&mdash;an increase of 7,487 over the corresponding date in 1974.  There are a few questions to be answered by the Minister for Local Government who has bluffed his way through, who is responsible to a large degree for the deterioration in the situation.</P>
    <P>Farmers have been using more cement in the last couple of years. This means that the building industry is affected to a much greater degree than would appear to be the case. Would the Minister tell us how he can build these houses?  For far too long this bluff has been fed to the people. It is worth mentioning, while I am dealing with the Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A very serious situation is that taxpayers in Galway, Wicklow, Kildare are asked to pay money to Dublin Corporation to offset losses.  At present there is £8 million worth of housing tied up in Dublin by squatters and there is the staggering total of £1½ million rent arrears.  This is largely due to the irresponsibility of the Minister for Local Government both as a Minister and as a Deputy.  I have said this outside the House and I now state it inside the House.</P>

It is important that the House should know this.</P>
      <P>We see how this man has been cleverly tied up by the Taoiseach in this situation.  When the Minister for Finance puts on the squeeze he puts that Minister out of business.  In order to call his bluff I ask him to answer questions in relation to the building industry and the present figure of 23,000 unemployed which is the highest jobless rate in the industry and I ask him to tell the House how he can build houses without materials. Many people would like to know the answers to these questions.  We would all build houses if we could find a way to do so without men and material and we would have a thriving industry.  That man has great imagination.</P>

The Minister for Finance controls the purse strings and, perhaps, we should not attack the Minister for Local Government too heavily.  Perhaps we should direct the attack on the Minister for Finance. Of course, he would take cover under the umbrella of collective responsibility and, perhaps, would suggest that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government to build houses whether he has the money or not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole thing is a fraud.  We have a budget a day.  The Minister for Finance uses one device or another to pressure Ministers to bring in their own private budgets, as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did, and the Government disregarded the Prices Commission in connection with the television licence charge. This type of fraud cannot be tolerated from any Minister for Finance.  From now on, I am directing all my attention to the Minister for Finance because his bluff is well known.  There has been so much covering up in the past by other Ministers, some of them probably carrying the can for the Minister for Finance.  I take it that they are Cabinet decisions, but it is hard to know now whether they are Cabinet decisions or whether it is just a tape recording that is available for conferences and meetings throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose I can talk about prices. The budget has certainly pushed up prices.  Again we have a Minister who told us before he came to power&mdash; cleverly placed again by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that he had a solution to stop the prices spiral.  Again, an absolute failure.  So all these men in <Col N="852" /> the Labour Party who are properly and cleverly placed, are now part and parcel of one great group who are bluffing their way to the end, but the end is near.  As I said before, it is difficult to assess how serious they are in relation to their statements.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister came in, I mentioned that the whole question of confidence in the people and in their statements is necessary and desirable at this stage.  As I mentioned, according to a supplied script, the Minister for Finance was found talking to himself outside a licensed premises a short time ago.  A person who talks to himself needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I want to move on to a variety of other matters, such as the question of the sabotaging of the building trade and the removal of the grants which has meant great difficulty for young people who are trying to buy homes. It is said at this stage that newlyweds should be attacked by a Minister for Finance, because the necessity of a new home will have increased by approximately £450 as a result of the increase in VAT.  I do not want to go into detail, but I have all the figures here in relation to the various items and how they affect newlyweds.  A very vulnerable section of the community, people who are making an effort to buy their own homes, are now attacked by this Government by the curtailment of grants.  We are told from time to time that this Government want to assist.  The people who have been attacked are the people who are making an effort. I ask the Minister to be realistic about this, irrespective of the pressures that are being placed upon him, to do something courageous and restore the grants so that young married couples can have a reasonable start in life.  Attacking the purse of a newlywed person is a very serious matter.  A newlywed housewife is doubly assaulted by VAT on household goods and by the ever-soaring costs that are allowed to develop.  If she has a television, she must pay in excess of what is regarded as reasonable. This highwayman approach that we get from Ministers must be stopped.  If the Prices Commission is <Col N="853" /> to have any meaning at all, the Government must have some respect for it.  The Government must be subject to the same rules as the individual firms who make the applications. If the Government can side-step these rules then the people may be tempted to use offsetting factors which would not be beneficial to the Government or to the community. This type of bandit approach cannot be condoned.</P>
    <P>On this issue I hope the Minister for Finance will say at this stage that he is going to ensure that young married couples who wish to buy their own homes will have an opportunity to do so and that the grants will be restored.  The termination of the grants system means that a number of young people who have saved over the years are in difficulty, people who made an effort, an effort which every party in this House called on them to make. This betrayal of trust and ruthless sabotage cannot be condoned now or in the future.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Sunday World</i> of 22nd February, 1976 reads:</P>
    <P>Hundreds of Irish teenagers are arriving in London with little money and no place to stay, indicates a disturbing report issued last week by the Irish Centre in Camden town.</P>
    <P>And Father Patrick O'Herlihy, Director of the Irish Emigrant Chaplaincy Team, warned yesterday that some of them could finish up in the vice world of Soho.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation.  This time it is the kids.  The question of the employment of young people is one of the most serious problems confronting us.  Yesterday, Deputy Wyse asked the Minister if he was aware that this year, 33,207 students will be sitting for the leaving certificate and that 48,538 students will be sitting for the intermediate certificate.  It would appear that there are quite a lot more for the boat because there are no prospects here.  There is no future for them here, or no indication of a future for them here from any person who has spoken from the Government benches.</P>
    <P>The signs are that things will get <Col N="854" /> worse before they get better.  We were told 18 months ago that we were on the upswing.  Now we are told it has not bottomed out.  These estimates convey an erroneous impression to the people.  Over the years people have accepted the factual situation.  They have accepted the hard facts of life of a downward swing in the trade cycle, knowing that responsible Governments made every effort to halt that swing.  When they were told there were difficult years ahead they understood the problems.  They were never misled by Fianna Fáil Governments. Recently we heard the conflicting reports to which I have referred. We were told 1975 would be a better year.  I wonder what the position will be at the end of 1976.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on quoting from newspapers or from Ministers' speeches.  There is plenty of material in the documentation issued to the House to show how irresponsibly the Government have acted.  We hear a lot of talk about the public service.  I see the Minister for Local Government will be spending about £54,000 more on postage this year than he did last year and that grants for amenity works, derelict sites and dangerous places will be reduced from £50,000 in 1975 to £5,000 in 1976.  This is an important area.  There is no need for me to impress upon the Minister that continuity of development means that basic work must be done on sewerage services, sanitary services, and so on, but water supply schemes and sewerage services have been cut in the Minister's estimate.  The long term planning, the social and economic plan, we heard about from the Tánaiste proves to be a joke.</P>
    <P>Basically we have a one-party Government now.  The Labour Party have lost their identity.  They have been swallowed up.  The dictates of Fine Gael are clearly seen to be fully accepted.  Now they have their conscience money, now that their ministerial pensions are reasonably safe, we may hear an odd squeak from a Minister.  The Tánaiste has been the first.  I wonder what motivated him.  A panic situation faces the unfortunate school leavers.  They are without hope <Col N="855" /> and without a future.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what he intends to do about them.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with another matter which was in the news this morning, that is, the national wage agreement. Basically what we require is honesty, honesty of purpose, an honest assessment of the situation, and honest forecasts of the problems as the Government know them.  To my mind, the most reasonable people in this country are the trade union officials.  When in possession of factual information they can assess the situation properly.  Before the last national pay agreement was negotiated they were fed with information on which certain decisions were reached.  Weeks afterwards they were told the situation was different.</P>
    <P>The reckless way in which the Government have been supplying information does not fool the workers or the trade union officials.  If there is a serious situation to be faced up to, let us face up to it collectively.  Let us put our cards on the table, instead of being told we are building more houses with fewer men and no materials.  If they knew the factual situation, there would be a reasonable response from reasonable men.  The Government should not endeavour to deceive the trade union organisations.  Trade union officials have spoken out loud and clear on this matter.</P>
    <P>We must get back on the rails, get rid of the Government, and get the country back to work.  Information may have to be forced out of the Government. If it is not available here, it may be available elsewhere.  The Government have information which has not been disclosed to the public accurately, or at all in some cases, and to organisations like the trade union organisations who are seeking vital information so that their members can fully assess the grave problems.  They are concerned about their future, about their children's future and about the nation's future.  It appears to me that politicians on the other side of the House are concerned only about their own future, and that will be a short one.  As soon as the people get an <Col N="856" /> opportunity, the Government will be gone by the board.</P>
    <P>We heard a member of the Labour Party condemning foreign industrialists who have been attracted here and given good employment to large sections of the community.  One member of what used to be called the Labour Party is now abroad trying to attract foreign industrialists to come here.  I heard on the radio this morning that there is a possibility that some of them may come here. Another member of the same party says they are not welcome.  It is about time the Government had a common policy and we knew exactly what their policy is.  The 14-point plan is gone.  Perhaps in the dying days of this doomed Government we might be told what that policy is.</P>
    <P>I have here a publication dealing with industry in society published by the EEC.  The Commission forecasts the changes in the main aggregates for 1976 as against 1975.  Consumer prices are given as follows: Denmark, plus 8 per cent, Germany, plus 5.5 per cent, France, plus 9 per cent, Ireland, plus 16 per cent, Italy, plus 12 per cent, Netherlands, plus 10 per cent, Belgium, plus 10 per cent, Luxembourg, plus 8.5 per cent and Britain plus 15.5 per cent.  Ireland is the highest in the league.  We are then given the unemployment figures as a percentage of the civilian labour force. The figures for 1975 were Ireland, 8.4 per cent, Denmark, 4.5 per cent, Germany, 4.5 per cent, France 3.9 per cent, Italy, 3.7 per cent, Netherlands, 4.4 per cent, Belgium, 4.8 per cent, Luxembourg, .7 per cent and the United Kingdom, 3.6 per cent. There is something wrong if we are at the head of the league on all occasions.  They then tell us the unemployment rate as a percentage of the civilian labour force in 1976. This is even worse.  The forecast given is Denmark, 3.7 per cent, Germany, 4.6 per cent, France, 4 per cent, Ireland, 10.1 per cent, Italy, 3.9 per cent, Netherlands, 5.2 per cent, Belgium, 5.6 per cent, Luxembourg, .7 per cent and the United Kingdom, 5.3 per cent.  The average is 4.6 per cent and we have 10.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> We have got many geography lessons from Ministers about what is happening in Japan, Belgium and Germany but they all seem to be much better off than we are.  It appears that the other countries in the EEC have all made a more positive approach to unemployment and prices.  We have forecast a 10.1 per cent unemployment rate as a percentage of the civilian labour force in 1976.  In 1975 the average was 4.1 per cent and we had 8.4 per cent.  The Community average in relation to consumer prices was 9.6 per cent and we have 16 per cent.  When we compare other countries with ours we see how we lag behind at all times.  The Government have allowed a deterioration of the situation until it has reached the chronic state which is indicated in the EEC report.</P>
    <P>There is another booklet by the EEC called &ldquo;Europe Day by Day,&rdquo; issued in Brussels on 3rd February. This gives the unemployment figure as 107,079, a variation from 1975 to 1974 of 28 per cent.  The Central Statistics Office give us a figure of 118,000 for the same period.  Why is there such a difference in the unemployment figures?  Is there any special reason why Europe should be informed that we have 107,079 unemployed while the Central Statistics Office tell us we have 118,000 unemployed? I hope that in future factual information will be supplied.</P>
    <P>We had savage increases imposed on various commodities such as schoolbooks, newspapers, furnishings for newly-weds and so on.  The newly-weds had their grants removed and they also had savage increases imposed on the necessaries of life.  The increases to those people at the moment are up to £700.  The Government have no conscience so it is hard to expect that any individual member of that Government would have a conscience.  However, I hope some of the matters mentioned during the course of the debate will have penetrated through to some of the Minister's advisers who may be able to give him advice to alleviate some of the problems created by the budgets introduced by the Government since they came into office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of making a few remarks in this debate on the 1976 budget.  I listened with some amusement to Deputy Dowling's comments about Coalition and particularly the fact that in his judgment the Labour Party were being swallowed by Fine Gael.  It seems to me that the Opposition are playing this in two ways.  In the urban situation it is political to say that Labour are being swallowed by Fine Gael but in many parts of rural Ireland it is political to say the reverse, that Fine Gael are being dominated by the Labour Party.  They are suggesting part of the time that Fine Gael are being dominated by the Labour Party and the rest of the time they are being swallowed by Fine Gael.  Therefore, we are, perhaps, on an even keel in this area.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Dowling's point about the problems we have in the country and the problems we have <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitiveness in world markets.  I do not know where the Deputy got the EEC statistics he quoted a few moments ago.  I accept that we had very substantial increases in consumer prices but when I look at some statistics I have I find it is important to say that Ireland is not isolated in relation to inflation and consumer price increases.  It is an international phenomenon.  There are certain factors operating where Ireland is concerned.  Our problem is greater, perhaps, than it is in other countries.  It is important to stress that, while consumer price increases are rising in Ireland and while wage unit costs have been increasing at a higher rate than other European countries, we started from a much lower base and we are a country which a few years ago was at an infinitely lesser stage of development than many countries we are partners with.  Countries like Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and Denmark had a much more developed economy than we had five or six years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not many years since unskilled workers were earning only £8 a week in this country.  When one has regard to our level of underdevelopment we <Col N="859" /> had much more to catch up on than those other countries.  This is one of the reasons why rates <i>per capita</i> have been increasing here at a higher rate.  It is also important to say that we faced particular problems when we entered the EEC.  We have, of all of the countries in Europe, by far the highest proportion of our population engaged in farming and agricultural activities. One of the greatest advantages of our entering the EEC is the lessening of our dependence on Britain as almost the sole market so far as our beef and agricultural produce are concerned, the involvement of this country in the common agricultural policy and a support system under which massive subsidies are funded by industrial nations essentially to the farming areas of the Community.  This was immensely beneficial to us as a nation because it helped increase our balance of payments. It helped to increase very substantially farm incomes especially the incomes of farmers engaged in intensive production of any type, in particular, milk production.  When we consider the statistics relating to the milk production areas we realise the prosperity that exists in that field.  But one of the problems that accompanied that prosperity was that of substantial increases in prices of agricultural products. This meant, also, that consumer prices in certain areas increased dramatically.  It was consequent on our entry to the EEC that we had this problem but I should hope that we are now at a levelling out period, that our economy is settled to some extent. There are factors in relation to our economy which did not exist prior to our accession to the Community.  For example, we now have the commitment to social welfare because subsequent to the increased prices of which I spoke, the Government were committed to increasing social welfare to levels which would allow the less well off among us to get their share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>We can put statistics into perspective to show that we are not the only country with these problems of inflation and rising prices.  For example, we find from an OECD survey regarding <Col N="860" /> wage rates and annual increases during the years 1967-72 that our country had a substantial increase of 13.5 per cent.  However, the survey shows that other countries have these problems, too, but we should not be dominated psychologically by such problems.  The figures for some other countries were: Germany, 9.3 per cent; France, 11.3 per cent; Finland, 11.8 per cent; Denmark, 12.4 per cent; Belgium, 10.2 per cent; Japan, 15.6 per cent; the Netherlands, more than 10 per cent and Spain, more than 12 per cent.  However, we must not convince ourselves that these problems are so immense that the country cannot overcome them.  Statements such as we have had from Deputy Dowling can do a certain amount of damage.  If we are to have criticism, it should be constructive and should attempt to put into perspective our situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other countries but what we had from the Opposition was a mere meaningless litany which views our problems in total isolation from these other factors.</P>
    <P>Very little of the criticism we had from the Opposition is in any way constructive.  They have been saying that we need more jobs, that we need to have a change of Government.  We know that the provision of jobs is of vital importance but if one examines the avenues through which jobs can be provided, one finds there are limitations in so far as, for example, tourism and farming are concerned. In the latter case this difficulty arises because of the high proportion of our population already engaged in the industry. Generally, it is conceded that the area in which there is the greatest scope for development and for the provision of jobs is the industrial sector.  Successive governments have been committed to this policy.  Sometimes the Opposition tend to suggest that this Government are not sufficiently expansionist or entrepreneurial in their approach.  It is worth pointing out that the incentives being given by the Government are unequalled anywhere in Europe.  There are the tax-free concessions in respect of export sales.  There are capital grants available for investment and there is a wide <Col N="861" /> range of assistance through institutes such as the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the ICC and the Irish Export Board and there is the employment premium programme which was introduced by the Minister for Labour.  It will be seen, therefore, that the Government have not been negligent.  The policy is there but in the context of the recession which has existed the Government have been experiencing a very difficult period.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the attitude of the Opposition and find out what they are proposing.  On December 16th last, in respect of the allocation of funds to the IDA, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Industry and Commerce tried to move an amendment the net effect of which would have been to give the impression that the IDA are not giving a fair deal to Irish industry or to Irish people seeking grants, that there should be a higher level of development for the Irish sector.  We would all like to see more development so far as the Irish sector is concerned but I deny any charge that the authorities are not giving a fair deal to Irish people.  From my experience both in public life and in a personal capacity I am in a position to refute that suggestion entirely.  The grants and the facilities are available but the reason for the higher level of financial investment by foreign interests is that we have not had an industrial tradition. We have not had a base on which to develop at the rate desirable in terms of the provision of employment. Here is the farce of the Opposition attitude: not only did their spokesman make these suggestions but he moved an amendment which sought to provide that not less than 50 per cent of the aggregate amount of grants paid by the IDA be paid to Irish citizens or to companies that were Irish controlled.  In other words, their attitude to this critical area of industry was to endeavour to force a policy in a direction whereby there would be legislation directing the IDA to give to Irish companies not less than 50 per cent of the grants available.  If we take it that no grants have been refused to Irish companies because of any shortage of funds, there is no reason to believe <Col N="862" /> that the Irish proportion of investment in industry would increase if that amendment were accepted.  The acceptance of the amendment would not improve in any way the level of investment by Irish people.  The net effect of demanding that there be a 50 per cent maximum level of foreign investment would not be increased Irish investment but massive cutting back by foreign companies in Irish industrial development.</P>
    <P>In 1974 domestic industry provided about 12,500 jobs while foreign industry provided about 40,000 jobs.  If half this domestic industry is foreign controlled, it follows that of the total of 26,000 job approvals in 1974, approximately 20,000 would, by the definition of the Deputy who moved the amendment, be termed &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;.  Therefore, the effect of the amendment would have been a cutting back in jobs provided by foreign controlled companies from a level of 20,000 to about 6,000 or a reduction of 14,000 jobs.  This is the attitude of the Opposition to Government policy and plans for expansion.  We should stress these matters so that the people will realise that we are a credible Government who happen to be in office at a very difficult time.  To follow the policy of the Opposition would lead us to disaster.  The expressing to the gallery of national sentiments is not the answer to the problems of our economy.  I apologise if I have strayed slightly from the budget and shall attempt now to get back on a more even keel.</P>
    <P>In broad terms I accept the Government's and the Minister's strategy where this budget is concerned.  It has been a difficult budget to compile.  To an extent, there has been consensus that borrowing is necessary but there is a limit to which it is prudent for the Government to borrow outside the country.  We had reached the limit and it was necessary for the Minister to contain in the budget proposals that would bring in taxation of approximately £100 million.</P>
    <P>When one is considering taxation, regardless of what the Government do, there will be criticism from the sectors affected and from trade and <Col N="863" /> industry.  There will be criticism from people about increases in the cost of living but, having regard to the Minister's problems and to the options available, it appears to me that the strategy adopted was the correct one.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister did not attempt to tackle personal income tax; in fact, he went in the other direction and gave some increased reliefs. The policy of getting revenue through indirect taxation is sensible and is in line with thinking in most other European countries.  We know that in some of the areas that are facing increased taxation there is no discretion but in broad terms in the areas that have been hit there is an element of discretion that does not operate elsewhere.  Where this discretion exists and where we are talking to an extent of semi-luxuries in certain sectors, if the choice is between seeking revenue from such sources or from areas that would hit the housewives and families much more directly, I do not think the Minister had an option.  In broad terms his strategy was right.</P>
    <P>We have been living in a fool's paradise for the last two or three years.  We have been hit in a national sense with this economic crisis; it has been a crisis and let us not make any mistake about it.  To an extent it has been above the heads of our people in the sense that the Government were able to absorb the crisis by borrowing to a substantial degree and this was justified in the circumstances. If the country is adversely affected then, by definition, the individual eventually will be affected.  Until now the Government sheltered the individual from the effects of the ravages of the world economy but when the chips were down it had to catch up with the individual.  One of the salutary effects of the budget is that the price we must pay for the difficulties we have experienced has to be borne.</P>
    <P>There is no getting away from the fact that Ireland, with other countries in Europe, has suffered a loss in living standards.  I believe most people understand this but there are those who try to tell us that we will have a bonanza for life and that the good <Col N="864" /> times are there for us as of right.  Of course, they are not; people who look back to other ages in this country, to the economic war in the 1930s and to the lack of employment during other eras, know there is no such right.  Those who travel outside the country know how difficult it is to get a job in Britain, in the United States or even in Germany.  We are living in difficult times and it is necessary to be aware of it.  In such times a measure of sacrifice is necessary. There is no point in fooling ourselves; it does hurt but there is no option. The only reservation I have is that some of the tougher measures adopted recently might have been taken even earlier.</P>
    <P>The Government have had to face massive increases in expenditure. After entry into the EEC there was a consequent increase in consumer prices and, in addition, the Government were committed to increase social welfare payments to a substantial degree.  In the area of defence a most appalling situation has arisen. Apart from the political effects, the financial effects of the ravages on the north of the country are appalling. In 1976 the budget for security, involving the Department of Justice and the Department of Defence, is £156 million, whereas in 1972-73 we were talking about £61 million.  That is only three years ago but in that short period the commitment by the Government of £156 million in comparison with £61 million is massive and beyond all of the levels of inflation that have operated here.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is that this country has had to look to its security and to issues such as defence in an entirely different manner to the way it was regarded since the State was founded.  We had lulled ourselves into taking for granted matters such as defence and security.  Proportionately we expended a small amount of money in that area where other countries had to get on to a war footing from time to time, where they had major commitments to groups such as NATO, where there was major British involvement overseas and where there were major commitments <Col N="865" /> for defence by America and Russia. As a nation we did not experience anything like this.  In addition to the normal economic problems, the Government have had to find funds to pay for this staggering increase of practically £100 million per year in the commitment to the Army and the Garda Síochána.  Alas, the end of the road may not be reached yet.  About a year ago I had experience in one or two Middle-East countries that were ravaged by war and where the proportion of the national budget going to defence was about 70 per cent.  This shows the kind of escalation that can arise in this area.  It is important to mention it to show the extent of the problems the Government had in compiling the budget and in arranging adequate revenue to meet the colossal expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Government for the efforts they are making to seek wage restraint for 1976.  The Government are the sum total of the people and they cannot autocratically impose solutions because that is not the way to govern.  In so far as it is possible to seek this restraint by influencing events they have been right to do so.  It is a necessary part of the budgetary strategy and of Government policy that there should be this restraint. People have got to recognise that the lessening of demand and ambition and the lowering of sights are not too much to ask if the ultimate price is a dramatic improvement in our competitive position on world markets.  The competitive position of our exports is the single key to the future prosperity of our country.  The other course is a recipe for disaster.  If costs escalate to too high a degree we will have a country with declining wealth, with a very inadequate tax base and with increasing financial commitments to those who are not in a position to work because the work will not be there.  There will be no future for our country.  Alternatively, if we get the pay pause that is sought and restraint by all sections we can move into such brighter times in 1977 and 1978 because, as I said, other countries have been affected too and the devaluation of the £ in some countries <Col N="866" /> and the revaluation of the £ in others has put us into a very competitive position, a much more competitive position than many people realise.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to read a few days ago a report published by a British group of consultants.  Their finding was that this country was one of the best in Europe for industrial investment at the moment and there was strong advice to British industrialists to take a hard look at this country as a very sensible country in which to invest and in which to expand.  We all know, travelling through Europe, rocketting costs and prices still leave this country in a competitive position.  However, it would be very sad if restraint did not continue in the short term in the national interest.  I suppose politicians are suspect when they talk of the national interest but restraint is vital and I hope common sense will prevail in the different sectors so that as a community we can get over the present difficulties and go on from that to attack world markets again.  There are signs that the crisis is passing.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister and the Government to look at some aspects of decentralisation.  I welcome the building of the offices for the Department of Lands in Castlebar.  When this partial decentralisation was first mooted there were suggestions that civil servants would not work in the country and would, therefore, not go to Mayo to work in Castlebar.  I understand there was almost double the number of applicants required for the jobs in Castlebar.  In other words, one out of every two applicants had to be refused.  That is a dramatic indication that people are more than happy to work in the provinces. There are two factors involved.  Living in cities is proving more and more difficult because of congestion, traffic, smoke and so on.  On the other hand, conditions in the provinces have been improving fairly rapidly and there are many sensible reasons now why people would decide to live and work in Castlebar instead of in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There could be more decentralisation. A great deal of work presently being done in Dublin could be done <Col N="867" /> in the country.  I am thinking now of more fundamental decentralisation rather than the hiving off of sections of a Department.  Take the matter of grants and loans for housing, reconstruction and so on.  The administration system is ludicrous.  For a simple reconstruction grant two application forms must be filled in.  One is sent to the Department of Local Government and the other to the local authority.  The Department then notify the inspector in the area to inspect.  He has to report back to Dublin and at a later stage carry out a further inspection, after which the grant is paid by the Department in Dublin.  The Department then advise the county council that the grant has been paid and the county council pay their portion of the grant.  That is at the halfway stage.  At the final stage the same procedure is gone through all over again.  I believe a higher proportion of administrative work could be done within the ambit of the local authority independent of the Department to which they are responsible in Dublin.</P>
    <P>An examination could usefully be carried out in this area to see if we can increase the volume of work that could be done by local authorities thereby reducing the necessity for a constant expansion in the workload and in the number of workers in Dublin city.  I do not say this in any town versus country sense.  I know many people are horrified at the level of development and would welcome any policy leading to decentralisation. I have given an example but I am not suggesting the possibilities end there. Some study should be made of the activities in other Departments, such as Social Welfare and Agriculture and Fisheries.  There is an immense amount of administration involved in social welfare.  Decentralisation on the lines I suggest would not inconvenience anybody.  On the contrary, it would create employment in parts of the country where employment is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in tackling the issue of taxation on co-operatives.  In some of the more developed parts of <Col N="868" /> the country they are a major sector. There are anomalies and some co-operatives engage in trading activities in competition with private enterprise. The Minister ought to have a look at this.  I have, however, a reservation about my own part of the country. West of the Shannon the experience of the co-operative movement was an unhappy one until recently and the result is we are very much behind the south, the south-east and the east in co-operative development.  We are a generation behind.  There were not a sufficient number of co-operatives working on a sufficient scale to provide the benefits that can be provided particularly for the small farmer. Recent developments have been much more successful.  A substantial development has taken place in Balla where the co-operative has a very substantial volume of business and provides a very useful service to farmers living within a 25 mile radius.</P>
    <P>Work has been done by the North Connacht farmers in arranging a series of amalgamations thereby providing a very enlightened service to the farming community.  The position in which these co-operatives find themselves is different from that of those in the south and east.  They have not built up their resources and they have not been able to retain profits in the same way as those of the south and east.  When thinking of agricultural development, in the interests of the small farmer in the west, it is essential that the co-operatives there should be helped and buttressed.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise the fact that there are these specific problems in the west. It is a part of the country which needs to be treated differently by the Government than other parts.  I would welcome an investigation of these facts. Analysis will show I speak the truth.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister his problem in seeking wage restraints.  The root of all his problems is that, as a Government, we inherited a system under which wage claims were decided, namely, the consumer price index.  The notion that wage increases must automatically follow price increases is economically unsound, while socially very desirable.  The hard economic <Col N="869" /> facts of life show that there are times when this simply cannot be done and can do enormous damage.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister in his budget speech referred to certain anomalies that have arisen from the acceptance in principle of this system.  Under the national wage agreement we had successive wage agreements.  In the private sector certain companies were in a position to plead an inability to pay these increases. This fact was accepted.  The anomaly in this acceptance is that while the private sector could keep their costs in check to a certain extent where reason could prevail on both sides, automatically the increases were paid in the public sector.  I do not take away from the fact that it is necessary that there should be increases for work done in the public sector as much as the private sector, but what was happening was disproportionate in the sense that a far higher proportion of increases were going to the public sector rather than to the private sector because the private sector could plead inability to pay.</P>
    <P>Equally, in times of difficulty in the economy, the Government, using the same economic yardstick and the same type of financial prudence, could plead inability to pay but the problem with Government is that Government is Big Daddy and is supposed to have a bottomless well of funds with which to do the decent thing.  The Government must take a very serious look at the means of basing salary and wage increases to get more rationalisation.  I would be extremely wary of getting involved in agreements at a higher level than is desirable having regard to the needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we tend to underestimate the public.  They have a fundamental common sense, and an appreciation of our problems.  In my judgment the Government will get into far greater difficulties when they face the Irish public if they take the easy way out.  My view from talking to a cross-section of the public is that there is a demand for tough Government <Col N="870" /> action in these areas.  If the long term interests of the country demand tough action, the public will respond. It will be disastrous for the country if the Government take the soft way out.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about this budget and the propriety or otherwise of the deficits in recent budgets.  We had advice from economists of different hues.  I think it was Mr. Menzies of Australia who said some years ago that he had much respect for economists because they represented such diverse opinions.  The buck stops with the Minister.  The deficits were entirely justified in the circumstances in which we found ourselves.  There is a hidden factor in the background to which the Minister for Finance could hardly prudently address himself in his speech because it might seem to be a gamble.  There can be immense buoyancy in the background to the financial affairs of this country if we have regard to our natural resources, particularly if we take a serious look at the implications of the possibility of oil being discovered off our shores. We should talk a little about this because it can give a feeling of confidence about what can happen.</P>
    <P>We have seen in Norway the most extraordinary developments because they discovered oil off their shores. At present that country is probably the single wealthiest country in Europe.  There is full employment there.  They have had to bring in workers from the United States, Britain, France and this country to help them get the oil ashore.  The phenomenon of oil in Norway is that it is providing between 20 and 25 per cent of their entire resources.</P>
    <P>We have a smaller budget than that country.  It is estimated that we need only discover about one-fifth of the volume of the resources in Norway for an equal input into our economy. It would require a relatively small amount of oil to provide us with anything up to £600 million a year.  We should put this into perspective.  This is a small country.  Our entire budget is equalled by the manufacturing company ranked 354th in the United <Col N="871" /> States.  Our budget is small but the potential off our shores is vast.  It is in the background so far as our budget deficits are concerned.  Oil has been discovered to a certain extent already and if we are fortunate when major exploration starts and they come up trumps during 1976, that will probably be followed in 1977 by further successful exploration, and the benefits that could accrue for the country can be immense.  I am glad the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when negotiating with the oil companies, was able to protect the national interests and achieve a satisfactory balance between the national interests and the need to encourage developers to look to this country.  If we are lucky to discover oil, we will be able to provide the entire amount of oil necessary for this country and become self-sufficient. This will improve the balance of payments dramatically.  I mention this as a backbench Deputy.  I support the Minister in this because he has been accused of many things.  If he spoke as I have just done, he would be accused of gambling.  As I said, this is all in the background and we do not know what is there until we start digging. The geological surveys are encouraging and the fact that international companies are looking at this country in such detail is, in itself, fairly significant.</P>
    <P>Speaking about marine sources, a point about which there has been considerable dissatisfaction among the general public for a number of years can be made about the organisation of Government.  This is the fact that marine affairs are not treated sufficiently separately by the Government in terms of organisation.  For example there is a logical <i>rapport</i> between marine activities such as oil exploration, gas exploration, fisheries, and the development of our coastline that would tend to put these activities under the same roof.  Indeed, there is a necessity for consultation between fishing interests and oil exploration interests in so far as the placing of rigs is concerned. There is an unsatisfactory administrative position, especially in linking fishery developments with the <Col N="872" /> same Department as agriculture, because agriculture is of overwhelming importance to the country and necessitates the Minister spending a vast proportion of his time looking after agricultural affairs.  Additionally, there is not a close affinity between the land and the sea.  I feel very strongly that some consideration should be given to the containing of matters such as fisheries and other marine activities in a separate Department.  It need not necessarily be an entirely new Department, because there would be limitations under the Constitution, but it would be more rational and sensible to contain some of these areas within the responsibility of a Government Minister with a lesser workload and one of somewhat lesser significance than agriculture.  This is something that should be looked at.  I am concluding by complimenting the Minister on doing a good job in very difficult circumstances.  I wish him well and hope that the books will balance out.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Staunton over the last 15 minutes or so, one would imagine that this was the only country with major recession problems over the last couple of years. I should like to mention that most economies in the world have suffered a recession not alone over the past couple of years but indeed from time to time.  The one thing that Deputy Staunton did not point out is that most economies, particularly European economies, are now pulling out very strongly from this world-wide recession and yet our Government and our country are not making any progress.  One would ask is this the fault of a world-wide recession or is it the fault of Government inactivity and mismanagement?  I would be inclined to accept the latter.  This is something which Deputy Staunton, as a Government back-bencher, should consider bringing up at his party meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;about the Government's plan for expansion. This is something I have yet to see. Indeed, listening to the Minister for Health quite recently one heard that he is looking for this plan as well.  I wonder what is this mysterious plan <Col N="873" /> Deputy Staunton referred to.  I was further surprised to hear Deputy Staunton supporting the Government's approach to withdrawing the tax exemption from fishery and agricultural co-operatives.  Indeed, coming from an area such as Deputy Staunton does, one would think he would oppose that measure.</P>
    <P>At long last we are beginning to see the result of the past few years of panic borrowing and gross mismanagement of our economy by this Government.  We have listened time and time again to the Government denying any responsibility for our financial situation.  The Government have mentioned time and again that our problems are due to the world-wide recession and to the oil crisis. They have said these problems are caused by outside factors but, when forced, they have to admit that the outside factors are perhaps only responsible for 50 per cent of the difficulties which we are now facing as an economy.</P>
    <P>Let us accept this figure from the Government and examine the question of the 50 per cent of our problems for which the Government are responsible.  If 50 per cent alone were to be accepted as that part of our problem which can be remedied by the Government, then we are entitled to such a remedy, to some result from their efforts over the past years. We have no such result, no such plan for any progress in the future.</P>
    <P>What we have seen is endless panic borrowing to try to close the gap every time we run into financial difficulties. Endless borrowing will incur the severe penalty of the need to repay loans and unfortunately this has been a feature of this Government's policy.  In turn it has resulted in panic measures to provide the revenue with which to repay these loans.  It is not enough to anticipate a difficult budget by saying it would be the most difficult in peacetime because even now our people are prepared to face deprivation in order to overcome our problems.</P>
    <P>On the other hand our people must be assured that the money gathered in taxes by the budget will be put to a realistic programme of economic repair <Col N="874" /> and renewal.  We see no such programme, no plan for future development, although there has been crippling taxation by the Minister for Finance in the new system he has evolved.  He had to look to all possible sources of revenue and in his panic he has so damaged the spending power of our people that he has left no incentive to people in managerial positions to enable them to plan for the years ahead.  Unfortunately it will not be he and his Government who will have to repair the damage.  It is part of history that the damage done by successive Coalition Governments has had to be repaired by Fianna Fáil and it is on them the people will have to rely again after the next general election&mdash;the results of Coalition mismanagement will again have to be reversed by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It has become obvious that the Minister for Finance has been dictated to by the smaller group in the Coalition. This can be clearly seen in the attack on the middle and higher income groups by way of the Minister's stunted idea of taxation.  The result will be relatively small amounts of extra revenue and the taking away of any incentive at management level for development. The new taxation measures introduced by the Minister for Finance, although they will yield comparatively little extra revenue, will deprive management of the incentive to invest and expand.  These measures are depriving the nation of the managerial talents which it needs now more than ever to take the economy out of its present crisis position.  This is a frightening situation and in drawing attention to it I should not be taken as advocating the bolstering of any particular class.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's policy always has been that any man or woman from any section of society who applies himself or herself to the job can rise to the highest position and having done so, by effort and hard work, should be entitled to be paid for it.  Therefore, it should not be the policy of any Minister for Finance to attack such a sector of society.  I should point out that managerial skills come from all levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> Later I shall deal with the agricultural industry.  A farmer is a businessman in his own right in a very basic sense.  Therefore, if a farmer invests in his business and reaps rewards from his labours, the whole economy prospers. We must remember that basically we are an agricultural economy, notwithstanding the industrial development that has taken place.  I accept that industrial development is important as far as employment is concerned, but we must never lose sight of the fact that agriculture will continue to be our greatest source of revenue.  Agriculture must be given the incentive to expand and to be competitive.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Agricultural and fishery co-operatives have enjoyed for many years exemption from company tax.  This exemption was originally designed to stimulate greater efficiency and output in those sectors.  In the last decade, however, the co-operatives' activities have expanded enormously. They now include some of the largest business in the country and the scale of operations is now such that the continuance of the exemption is both difficult to justify and inequitable to the general body of taxpayers as well as to the ordinary traders who are subject to the normal tax regime.</P>
    <P>That is interesting.  The idea seems to be that if anything is succeeding tax it.  That is a most extraordinary statement by a Minister who tells us he wants to see the agricultural economy expand.  At a moment's notice he is prepared to deprive the farmers of incentives if they endeavour to expand. That is certainly double thinking and typical of Government muddling.  Nobody contends that any sector of the economy should not pay its way but we have just got by the infancy stage in the co-operative movement compared with other countries.  In particular, this applies to the fishery co-operatives.  There is a need for reinvestment of the profits of the co-operatives so that they can expand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as the co-operatives get out of the infancy stage the Minister for Finance tries to stifle them.  That is a ridiculous situation and ridiculous thinking. That sector of our economy is in dire need.  We are all aware that 50 per cent of our inflation is caused at home and because of that there is a great need to give incentives to tackle the markets of the world.  The farmer can no longer look to £100 valuation as a safety level.  He will be taxed in the future.  I should like to say many things about the taxation of farming profits but I will refrain from doing so until the Minister gives us a clear indication of his intentions in this regard.</P>
      <P>Farmers got little out of this budget. In fact, they are attacked in such a way that they will not be able to invest in order to expand.  I was never in favour of giving money for nothing but I am in favour of giving constructive financial help to the farming sector.  If every other sector can get help from such bodies as the IDA to expand their industrial operations a system should be forthcoming from the Government to develop farming.  Farmers should not have to face destructive taxation which the Minister is thinking of imposing on them.</P>
      <P>The incentive for expansion is being taken away by the Government's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my constituency contains a very large number of farmers I wish to deal with some aspects of the budget that affect agriculture.  In his brief <Col N="877" /> reference to agriculture in his budget statement the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The 1976 Estimate for Agriculture provides for non-capital expenditure of £79 million compared with £65 million in 1975, an increase of 20 per cent.  In addition, £36.5 million is being provided for relief of rates on agricultural land &mdash;an increase of over £6 million on 1975.  The increased expenditure on agriculture is a reflection of the Government's anxiety that the growth potential of Irish farming should be used to the full.</P>
    <P>Growth potential is not something that falls from the air.  It is something that you work on and invest in.  As regards the statement that the Minister increased non-capital expenditure by 20 per cent, costs to the farmer have risen in excess of 20 per cent. Therefore, far from investing in the growth potential, he does not even keep up with the level of expenditure last year.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Minister's thinking has an urban bias, and I suppose that is understandable from his background.  However, he is Minister for the entire country and to talk in terms of growth potential and development by standing still is ridiculous, even applied to industry, let alone agriculture which constitutes the largest part of our economy.  This is backward thinking and panic thinking. In his wild rush to get from the people the money to meet the inexcusable level of borrowing, he does not take care to tell the people the entire truth and becomes confused in trying to explain this financial grab.</P>
    <P>In this budget every aspect of our economy was hit, drink, petrol, tobacco, cigarettes and so on.  As drink and tobacco are luxuries to some degree, it would be expected that they should rise.  In passing, I would draw attention to the Government's hypocritical attitude to tobacco and cigarettes.  Although every packet of cigarettes bears a notice that they endanger health, the Government, lest the revenue suffer by the introduction of too large an increase, went a little easy on cigarettes.  It is a small thing, <Col N="878" /> but it is a fair indication of the Government's attitude.</P>
    <P>The tax on petrol and oil has created problems for the agricultural community. If a farmer is to stay viable, he usually cannot afford to have a pick-up truck for his farm operations. Therefore, he uses his car with a trailer for the business of his farm, for carrying the milk to the creamery, collecting supplies, making deliveries, going to the market and, as so often happens in rural areas where there is no telephone service, for calling in the veterinary surgeon in an emergency. The car is an important part of his everyday life.  Because the farmer uses a trailer, he needs a car of reasonable horse power.  Usually it is a second-hand, cheap car of fairly high horse power but obviously the Minister for Finance has given no thought to this in his approach to car taxation which must in future constitute a heavy part of a farmer's expenditure.  Petrol and oil costs have risen and continue to rise not due to outside influences but due to the harsh taxation imposed by this Government since they took office in 1973.  We had the increase of 15p in December, 1974, several increases since, the recent increase in the budget of 10p with a further increase coming on March 1st in the form of increased VAT.  There seems to be no end to the taxation the Minister will put on petrol. That is bad enough but the increase in car taxation is ridiculous when in most cases car tax has practically doubled. The Minister in his statement said:</P>
    <P>Road tax on private motor vehicles will be calculated at £4 per horse power for those not exceeding 8 horse power, at £5 per horse power for those exceeding 8 horse power but not exceeding 12 horse power, and at £6 per horse power for those exceeding 12 horse power.</P>
    <P>A farmer may have a 14 horse power car which is probably second-hand, bought for its ability to do hard work &mdash;sometimes on bad roads&mdash;and pull a trailer and this car, at £6 per horse power, will cost £84 to tax.  Before the tax increases, the tax on this car was £52 which was bad enough.</P>
    <P>The farmer's general expenses must rise also because of the Government's <Col N="879" /> vast increase in the cost of living and in the cost of business with resulting increases in other costs.  Insurance and other costs must rise in the future as they have done in the past and this is a further crippling of the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have singled out one section because in this limited debate it is not possible to refer to all sections and this is the section with which I am most familiar.  I know that all sections are equally affected by this budget.  In the agricultural sector the direct and indirect effects of this panic grab for money will be crippling.  The industry can ill afford to meet such a situation and it will be many years before the farmers can recover from the effects of this taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government might say that Fianna Fáil require vast expansion without increased taxation.  We realise that in the mess resulting from Government mismanagement increased taxation is inevitable but we want to point out that the use to which the taxation is put is vitally important in view of our present loans position.  Constructive use of taxation to promote the economy so that in years ahead we will be able to pay off this vast amount of borrowing is essential.  It is also vitally important that taxation should be collected from the proper sectors in direct proportion to their ability to pay.  Blanket increases should be the very minimum and the money should be applied to growth areas of the economy and not, as at present, to the day-to-day expenditure of the Government.</P>
    <P>As a country, we shall have a great deal of careful thinking to do in the future.  I am, of course, referring to the time after the next general election when Fianna Fáil are returned to power because the present Government are incapable of any constructive thinking.  We have already faced that prospect before the Minister introduced his budget and the prospects now are much worse as a result of the after effects of this ridiculous, inflationary budget which offers no help or incentive to get the country back on the road to prosperity and <Col N="880" /> progress.  I would compare this budget to a doctor treating a circulation problem by rubbing the hands to increase circulation of the extremities without treating the basic cause of the circulation problem.  There are defects that need to be treated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people will tell us at the next general election and my comments will certainly be endorsed then.  These are the defects that need to be treated.  The remedies which were introduced may to some extent help to bring down our inflation rate and the soaring costs which this Government are experiencing at present.  Nevertheless, these remedies depend on positive action by the Government.  We are brought back again and again to the necessity for strong action.  If this had been taken twelve months ago, as was pointed out by this party, we would not now be experiencing the problems with which we are faced.  We would not be facing the prospect of close on 120,000 people unemployed in the near future.  The remedies pointed out were put into action far too late.  In the June budget, which was one of the many budgets the Minister introduced last year, one wonders whether he was simply afraid to move with these actions, or was it possible that he and his Government were so indecisive and blind that they could not see the need for these measures last year?  He made the move in the June budget, however late and however weak.  Again he treats the symptoms without treating the cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is need for the people to get together to pull the country out of its problems, the Government have never given the lead by a show of leadership.  As well as positive thinking, we must have leadership which is lacking in our Government today.  This Government over the past couple of years have persistently spoken of national partnership, of getting together, but they ignore the fact that this national partnership needs a leader.  It needs a head of Government, a Taoiseach who would be seen by the people as leading that effort, who is and must be in the <Col N="881" /> public eye, vocally and otherwise encouraging the people to join together under him in a national effort to avoid the problems which we are now facing.  But as one who reads the daily papers and was accustomed under the Fianna Fáil Government to see our leader, so to speak, show himself to the public, I am flabbergasted by the lack of leadership from this Government.  The people have no leader to look to.  They see no leader and they hear very little from him. Any economic resurrection in this country must have a leader who is seen to be a leader.  This is one of the root causes of our apparent inability to move.  While we cannot, as responsible representatives, fail to applaud and encourage in the budget of last June the costs in commodity prices, the easing of value-added tax, and the increased house loans, we must, as was pointed out from these benches in January, 1975, point to the lack of attention to the root cause. We must point to a leaderless people and to failure and lack of courage in Government, the failure to tackle these difficulties much earlier than last June when such action could have been far more effective and, perhaps, when all of us together could have come out of the difficult and hard times in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister for Finance and other Ministers of this Government to cry out in the wilderness as they are doing at present.  There must be positive thinking and courageous action.  For all the good points in it and in the previous one&mdash;they cannot be given praise because there is no positive leadership, no positive thinking, no plan for the future, no road ahead. In other words, the Government are moving from one crisis to another without taking the necessary corrective action when the time comes. Therefore, in so far as the Government are concerned the longer they remain in office the deeper and deeper this country will sink.  As I have previously pointed out, two other Administrations were comprised mainly of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  We must highlight the <Col N="882" /> pitiable state into which they have allowed the country to fall.  The Government, and they alone, are responsible for that.  They talk about the approaching bankruptcy of our economy.  Perhaps we should look back over the scandalous activities which have been the hallmark of this Government.</P>

      <P>We want to hear something positive from the Parliamentary Secretary about the removal of the tax exemption from the fishery co-operatives.  So far as policy and action are concerned, the people are frustrated.  The two parties in the Government realised that alone neither of them could appeal to the electorate in sufficient numbers to achieve the goal of forming a Government.  They have two divisive views in their approach to governing the country.  They overcame their difficulties in their hunger for power.  Any sacrifice of conviction <Col N="883" /> was justified to get power.  This is the key to the problem.  The one thing which will hold this Government together is their common desire to remain in office.  The economy will sink, but the Government will go on their merry way.</P>

      <P>The Government embarked on a spending spree in their first year or two in office to try to live up to the promises incorporated in the 14-point plan with which they conned the electorate.  Now we have to pay dearly for that folly with the recent taxation imposed by the Minister who dipped into the pockets of our citizens as deeply as he could.  This year he is seeking further loans to meet the financial commitments of this spendthrift Government.</P>
      <P>There is no alternative in this country to a single party Government. The Fianna Fáil Party are capable of taking definite action.  Our experience proves this.  Like previous Coalitions this Government will run away when no more money is left to be squandered on their impossible dreams.  The time is nearly ripe for such an exit.  Judging by past experience only one Government can save this country, a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>A very significant thing happened the other evening.  I went to a debate at the famous L and H Society in UCD.  The L and H Society were well known in the past for their great support for the Fine Gael Party in particular.  For many years Fianna Fáil Ministers had a difficult time in getting a hearing. The motion before the House was, &ldquo;That this house has no confidence in the present Government.&rdquo; What was significant was not only that the motion was carried by a two-thirds majority, in what I would call a hot bed of Fine Gael conservatism, but also the fact that not one Minister or <Col N="884" /> Parliamentary Secretary appeared. One backbencher was sent along to defend the Government's policies.</P>
      <P>In debating the motion, &ldquo;That this house has no confidence in the present Government&rdquo;, not one speaker could defend the Government.  All they could do&mdash;and it is so similar in this House&mdash;was to attack Fianna Fáil. Not one of them would put up a defence for their inefficiency and complete mishandling of the economy. Time and again we have been accused by critics of Fianna Fáil who work for the media of never putting forward constructive policies.  We put forward constructive suggestions in this House time and again.  At first these suggestions were ignored.  By the time they were acted upon, it was too late.  The proverbial horse had left the stable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is easy to illustrate.  We advocated the introduction of the green £ six months before the Government finally came around to it and, by that time, the country had lost millions of pounds.  We advocated the removal of the food subsidies to bring down the rate of inflation.  That was acted on six months later.  They are always just that bit too late.  The art of good Government is to be able to handle a recession or a difficult situation.  An English politician once said that if you pull the string too tight you cannot push it back and it falls down in the middle.  The Government have completely over-reacted in some directions and under-reacted in others. They have let the people down.  We are talking about the budget introduced in January but a number of budgets were introduced before and since that one.  We had a Posts and Telegraphs budget just before Christmas when postal and telephone charges went up.  We had the increase in the price of electricity and also in the price of oil.  We have now been told that electricity charges will not go up next Monday but they went up about a month ago.  In my constituency I have been in houses where people were wrapped in blankets because they were afraid to turn on their electric or gas fires.  I wish the <Col N="885" /> Minister whose constituency it is would take time off to go to see the plight of some of the constituents he is supposed to represent.</P>
    <P>I have met nobody who feels it was fair to increase motor taxation because it did not take into consideration the age of the car.  There are many people in my constituency who drive what might be called vintage models&mdash;1964, 1965, 1966 or 1967 Mercedes and Jaguar cars.  They sometimes find them cheaper to buy than new smaller cars because they are able to maintain them themselves. Those people are not very pleased with the new car tax.  I am not very pleased either.  A year ago I decided that it would be more economical to buy a 28 horse power Rover out of which I reckoned I would get a good ten years than to buy a new mini at a lower price out of which I reckoned I would get four or five years.  This proved to be faulty economics because nobody could have foreseen the haphazard manner in which this Government would slap on the increase in motor taxation.</P>
    <P>It intrigues me that only one section of the community have totally escaped the impact of the January budget.  I refer, perhaps, to three members of the Cabinet who do not drink or smoke.  They will not have to pay any increase in tobacco or drink and they will not have to pay any increase in car tax or petrol.  They are the only people who have got away scot free from the impact of the recent increases.</P>
    <P>We know that in parts of the country where transport is not available people must use their cars to get to work.  This has been stated by many contributors to the budget debate.  The Minister must look at the way in which he applied the motor tax.  Most people I spoke to about this said they would prefer if motor tax was abolished and the tax put on petrol.  Members of the Labour Party in a discussion said they noted that the public were more or less attuned to the £1 a gallon for petrol and, therefore, when it arrived it would be more acceptable.  The Minister did not increase the price of a gallon of petrol to £1.  Instead, he raised it to 85½p which will go up <Col N="886" /> again next Monday to 88½p a gallon. Therefore, we are getting nearer to the £1 a gallon.</P>
    <P>The increases in motor taxation and the price of petrol do not take into consideration the amount of driving a person does, the week-end driver or the person who travels for his firm. This will contribute a lot to the increase in the cost of living this year when it works its way through the economy.  I intend to put down a question very shortly to the Taoiseach or, perhaps, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, asking how many applications are at present before the Prices Commission for increases since the budget was introduced as a result of the increase in the price of petrol which has necessitated an increase in the running costs of firms which deliver their goods by petrol-driven vehicles.  We know that the price of diesel did not go up so much but many firms use petrol-driven vehicles.  Television rental firms use petrol-driven vehicles so they will possibly be looking for an increase in their rental charges.</P>
    <P>Since we came over to this side of the House I have often stated that the biggest mistake the Government made was to remove VAT from food.  VAT was levied on food at the rate of 5.26 per cent but soon after this Government came into office they removed it. Everybody must eat.  The wealthier one is the more one spends on food and the more expensive food one buys.  The wealthier people were relieved of this tax on food.  What did the Government do to bring in sufficient money to compensate for the loss of revenue on food?  They put increased taxation on motor cars, motor cycles, radios, television sets and many goods which are popularly termed luxury items. When VAT was removed from food we predicted that those luxury industries would experience unemployment because there would be a drop in the demand for those items.  We have been proved right in our prediction.  Following Monday's increase in VAT on those items there will be a further increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been levelled at Fianna Fáil but they can never be accused of borrowing money for <Col N="887" /> social welfare.  Fianna Fáil always paid social welfare out of current revenue.  This Government are borrowing money to pay social welfare. This is money which goes down the drain.  It is like renting a flat.  You never see the money you pay out. Any money Fianna Fáil borrowed was put into capital ventures, ventures which would create employment.</P>
    <P>The only thing which will save the country from its helter-skelter slide into complete ruin is an election as quickly as possible which will give a chance to the people to put Fianna Fáil back into office.  If the Government are so confident they are doing such a wonderful job or that Fianna Fáil could not do anything better, let them go to the country and test opinion.  I am in touch with people in my constituency.  People who never spoke to me before are now talking to me about the performance of the Government.  The Government count on the fact that the public memory is short and they will forget those inconveniences.</P>
    <P>We hope there is a pay pause but we do not envisage it, not the way the cost of living is going up.  The Government have predicted a growth rate this year of 2 per cent.  I predict not only stagnation but also a fall again in exports.  Technically we are bankrupt.  Now we have to go abroad with cap in hand for loans and have the people abroad dictate to the Government exactly how they will spend this money because they are not too happy about the performance of the Government as shown in the latest OECD report.  They laid the blame even on the Leader of the Government, whom, I call the PMV Taoiseach, the petty, mean, vindictive Taoiseach, who said it was home produced because of lack of leadership.</P>
    <P>It is said that the oil companies are making huge profits but I expect that the turnover on the various petroleum products has decreased to such an extent that it will cause unemployment in that industry.  It is an industry which must suffer unemployment as <Col N="888" /> a result of the last budget.  These companies have huge overhead expenses. I remember Deputy Colley, as Minister for Finance, being asked by the present Minister for Finance to reduce the duty on petrol at a time when the oil companies had increased their prices.  We remember Deputy Tully shedding tears for the working man who needed his car to get to work.  All of this does not bear thinking about now in the context of what has occurred since this Government came to power.</P>
    <P>The budget document is a grandiose presentation.  Obviously there was no cutting back in regard to its printing. I do not recall this party while in Government ever producing such a flashy document.  I notice that the greatest increases in the budget are being allocated to those Departments which spent less than the amount allocated to them in the previous year. For example in respect of agriculture, the budget estimate for 1975 was £32.58 million while the actual expenditure amounted to £27 million.  There is a grand estimate for 1976 of £37.9 million but the Government know very well that this amount will not be spent.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the budget that so far as the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme is concerned the entire State was declared attested, almost free of the disease, in 1965 but that testing must continue so as to guard against fresh outbreaks.  We are told that expenditure consists mainly of compensation to farmers who were found to have reactors among their herds and of fees to veterinary surgeons.  The net expenditure for 1976 is estimated at £9.1 million compared with £3.8 million in 1975.  For that part of this year which has already passed this means a saving of £2 million as a result of the vets dispute.  In regard to the brucellosis eradication scheme the net expenditure in 1976 is estimated at £8.7 million compared with £5.9 million in 1975.  Again, since almost a quarter of the year has elapsed, one can calculate a saving already of £2 million in that regard.</P>
    <P>If one studies this trick-of-the-loopery budget one finds that in many <Col N="889" /> instances the biggest increases are granted to those areas in respect of which the allocations for last year were not utilised fully so that the Minister considered it safe to grant these increases this year knowing that they will not be used up.  The budget estimate in respect of loans to industry was £32 million for 1975 with the outturn being £24.41 million.  The estimate for this year is increased bravely to £34 million.  One notes that in respect of those Departments or semi-State bodies which utilised their allocations in full, the increases are much less than in respect of those areas in which allocations for last year were not utilised fully.  An example of this is the allocation to RTE.  They used up their £3.17 million in 1975&mdash;their full allocation&mdash; and they are to receive a magnificent increase this year to £3.80 million. This is not to take account of the increase in the television licence fee. This is the sort of hypocrisy and artificiality that we are faced with.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell, whom I shall refer to as the toothless lion, is obviously getting a feedback from his constituents regarding their dissatisfaction with the Government.  I am applying this term to him because of his abstention from the vote on a motion moved by him, but in that regard he was threatened with expulsion and succumbed to the pressure of that threat.  While speaking this morning Deputy O'Connell reminded us that our unemployment figure of 13 per cent is twice that of any other European country.  But he informed us that from a survey he had carried out he calculated that the unemployment figure for his constituency is 20 per cent.  He was bringing this situation to the attention of the Minister, who as usual was not present.  He was reminding the Minister that article 135 of our accession treaty to the EEC gives us certain privileges in relation to imports where it can be shown that the home industry concerned was being hurt.  The Deputy reminded us that we are the only member country to which this provision applies&mdash;a provision which was achieved by Dr. Hillery during his negotiations with the Community regarding our membership.  Despite <Col N="890" /> this privilege we find it necessary to have a question today to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs asking what was the country of origin of 400 pairs of special type sports boots supplied through an agent for, I think, the Navy.  We look forward to the Minister's answer in this regard.  This is the sort of thing that sickens the people.</P>
    <P>The budget will result in much damage to the tourist industry.  I have had reports of people going back from here to England and telling their friends how lucky they are not to be living in Ireland because of the high price of petrol and also the VAT rate that is being applied to the hire of cars.  We depend for the greatest proportion of our tourism on our nearest neighbour but because of these price increases we will suffer badly.  This party have been urging the Government to introduce some sort of voucher system in respect of petrol for tourists so as to encourage people to come here.</P>
    <P>I heard yesterday of a man who owns a petrol station near the Border and whose total turnover in petrol sales since the budget has been £2.50.  People may come here from the North but they will ensure that they fill their petrol tanks on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the average citizen has grasped yet the extent to which we are borrowing.  People do not think of such matters so long as there is money available, but it would be well to reflect on the fact that this Government have borrowed more during their almost three years in office than has been borrowed since the foundation of the State.  All this money must be repaid and a quarter of the revenue collected in taxation is being used to pay the interest on these borrowings.  The Government must go abroad and borrow money in order to be able to pay the interest on loans outstanding.  This is a very bad situation.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago when we saw the way the Government were handling the economy I compared the situation to the silencer of a car which is well worn, which gradually acquires further tiny holes that join together so that eventually the whole thing <Col N="891" /> blows out.  That is what will happen to our economy.  The Parliamentary Secretary may smile cynically but he has a lot to answer for in regard to his Department concerning the non-allocation of funds and the practice that has arisen whereby letters from people seeking information are not being replied to.  I will deal with that on another occasion when it will get more attention.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have allocated more for the provision of recreational facilities than the Government allocates for the entire country.  They tell us about an increase in grants for physical recreation and sporting facilities but they take back the money from the local authorities in the amenity grants.  The Department of Education have reneged on their agreement to pay a part grant towards swimming pools and they have removed the allocation of £36,000 to Dublin Corporation for the primary school library service although we wanted to extend the service to the secondary schools.  We are told they have agreed to restore the allocation for this year but it is not yet in writing. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will talk to his Minister about it, if he is not too confused about which Minister he is serving.  So many things are happening that the people cannot keep up with them.  For instance, how many people know that primary education is no longer free?</P>

The cutbacks in medical services are absolutely horrendous.

      <P>I should like to know when we last had a debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach?  We are not getting many estimates in the House these days. Finally the Government announced they were bringing out a national economic plan although they said at first they did not need it.  How will they do this without having a census? That is a straight question and they should be able to answer it.  We know why they will not take the census. They know Fianna Fáil will come back into office and that we will <Col N="893" /> restore the country to the state it was in before they took over.  It may involve a lot of hardship and we may have to take unpopular decisions but we have always faced up to them.</P>
      <P>Money for social welfare has been thrown here and there.  The Government are depending on the oil gushing out of the ground without even taking into account the length of time it takes to exploit resources once it is known they are there.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with that &mdash;14th March will be a very notable day.  The Minister for Finance gave a pathetic performance and he made a laughing-stock of this country in Europe when he attacked our Commissioner. He did not realise that the French Commissioner had to take his Government to court and that the Italian Commissioner had to chastise his Government.  In our case the matter was made a political football and the behaviour of the Minister has not brought any credit to his Government. Before the last election the great expert on finance, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, was able to tell us what to do but it has turned out he could do nothing.  Perhaps he could be described as a political eunuch&mdash;he could tell us what to do but could not do it himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tourism the estimate for 1975 was £2.05 million and the outturn was £1.35 million.  They increased that estimate to £2.4 million this year.  In 1975 the estimate for ports, harbours and airports was £4.34 million and they spent £3.5 million.  They were very brave and this year they raised the estimate to £7.79 million.  It <Col N="894" /> would be interesting to see the outturn in the budget next January.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to people in the building trade and they are really puzzled.  They do not know where the Minister for Local Government is getting his figures allowing for the fact that there are 22,000 more people unemployed in that industry than in 1973. Fianna Fáil are also puzzled about this matter.  There are plenty of houses in the country but people have not the money to buy them.  An empty house may be a statistic but in my view it is of no value.</P>

      <P>I have received two protests against the increases in cross-channel calls.  Our revised cross-channel charges are in general substantially lower than for calls in the reverse direction.  The waiting period for cross-channel calls is normally not more than a few minutes.  During busy periods it may be longer owing to conditions in our internal network.</P>

      <P>I have no information about a falling off in cross-channel calls here.  As I have pointed out, the increase on this side, which was not a matter of the budget but before that, has been less than that on the other side.

      <P>I am informed there are very little delays on any calls at present either within the State, with Northern Ireland or cross-channel. Of course, the telephone service within the State was affected during a period by industrial action taken by some of the staff and for a while after that repair work was in progress.  The western coaxial cable was without a service and this very seriously affected the service to and from the north-west, including cross-channel calls to and from these areas. The question the Deputy put may be prompted by delays experienced before that period.</P>

My objective would be to get to the full complement of 120 placement officers at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Deputy is aware of the general position in relation to borrowing and taxation and the constraints on the Minister for the Public Service.</P>

      <P>In connection with the building industry I should like to know where the Minister is getting his figures from when he tells the House the number of houses that have been built.  With 23,000 workers in the building industry unemployed, and cement sales down by 10 per cent the Minister must have a peculiar way of making up the figures.  It is not that we want to see fewer houses built, we want to see more houses built; but it is difficult to know how the Minister arrives at his figures.  The amount estimated in the Public Capital Programme in 1975 for building and construction of houses was £113.54 million while the actual outturn was £114.48 million.  The figure for the 1976 Estimate is £119.47 million.  In connection with the latter we are told that the services included under that heading were local authority housing, house purchase loans and private housing grants.  Since the Minister ceased paying housing grants I am curious to know why grants have been included in the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the amount allocated for the eradication of brucellosis and bovine TB for 1976.  The first quarter of the year has gone and the veterinary <Col N="910" /> strike is still on.  If one was to assume that the veterinary surgeons worked at the same pace throughout the year the amount saved by the Exchequer so far this year in the case of brucellosis would be £2.2 million and in respect of BTB would be £2.3 million. Does the Minister for Finance have plans to devote that money to finance some other scheme.  Obviously, that money will not be spent and we do not know for how long the strike will go on.  We do not know how much money will be required to make up for the ground lost during the strike.</P>
    <P>At the time the Minister for Labour was questioned about the mobile unit on careers it occurred to me that the unfortunate officers in charge of that must get a horse laugh wherever they go.  They are talking about careers in the public service and in industry which do not exist. The tragedy is that when there is vast unemployment those with managerial expertise and the skilled labourers leave.  It takes years to encourage such people back because they must be satisfied that they will not be forced to emigrate again.  Those with skills will always find jobs somewhere in the world and considering that other countries are recovering quicker than us it will be a long time before such people return.  We are still at the bottom of the table.</P>
    <P>The Government made great play of the fact that they had for the first time since 1969 increased the educational grants.  Of course, we have never had such a rate of inflation as that which we have experienced since 1973.  The grants have not kept pace with inflation.  Figures cannot lie but liars can figure and I am always suspicious of figures when they are issued. At the outset of my contribution to a debate at UCD on Friday I stated that as I entered the magnificent complex at Belfield I was proud that it was a monument to Fianna Fáil.  I wondered if the Government would be able to maintain that institution let alone contemplate building institutions like it. I wonder what the future of Belfield will be under this Government because of the fiscal difficulties they have got themselves into.</P>
    <P>What careers are available for our <Col N="911" /> young people leaving school?  This is of great concern to all parents.  There is little use in young people studying for degrees if there is nothing available at the end for them.  We have made a huge investment in education and it would be tragic if we were to educate our people once again for export only.  We will have to examine closely this question of careers.  One of the suggestions we have put forward is that the Government should contemplate introducing special community type schemes for young people, something with an idealistic content. Our suggestion was to have the energies of young people directed into good community works for which they would receive some form of payment. We should remember that our school-leavers are not on the unemployment list.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken great credit for reducing the retirement age from 70 to 67 but had they not done so the unemployment figure would be in the region of 130,000.  In introducing his budget the Minister did not have the courtesy to say to those who had expected to retire at the age of 67 this year that it was not his intention to reduce the retiring age further. I accept that many people do not wish to retire at 67 years of age but others had made arrangements.  We heard no apologies from the Government that they could not afford to put them on pension.</P>
    <P>I have to touch on the importance of the 1976 census.  I should like to know&mdash;maybe the Minister will be able to give it in his reply, because a number of people in this debate have commented on the non-taking of the 1976 census&mdash;how many people were taken on by the relevant local authorities to take the 1966 census?  How much employment did it give and what kind of employment would be given if the Government went ahead, even at this late stage, with a census for 1976?  To how many people would it give employment, thus reducing the £1.3 million which the Government say it would cost to conduct this most important census?  As I stated, how can a Government produce an economic <Col N="912" /> plan without having figures available for the next number of years?  They cannot.  It is only a pretence at getting one ready.</P>
    <P>The Government have boasted about being a law and order Government. It has been said by the Leader of our party that any Government worthy of the name of a Government has to maintain law and order.  The Government have complained about the great cost of it.  We know all about that because we had that in our day too.  When Fianna Fáil went out of office they were already in the process of recruiting the present force and on the way to bringing it up to its present strength.  One of the accusations constantly levelled at us is that we were pretty rotten as an Opposition in the first two years.  I used to answer this by saying that, first of all, I consider that the Government are a pretty rotten Government and were far better in Opposition than they are in Government, and that we were much better in Government than we are in Opposition.  Of course, the Ceann Comhairle very well knows that most of the legislation which was introduced initially was Fianna Fáil legislation, and it would be very hypocritical to oppose your own legislation for the sake of opposing it.  But one thing which we have claimed credit for, and which we are justified in claiming credit for, is the building of houses in 1973 to the figure of 25,000, and the houses that were built in 1974, because, as the Ceann Comhairle knows, as a former member of a local authority himself, it takes three to four years before people move into a house from the time the planning application is first submitted to a local authority, certainly here in Dublin, although I am not quite sure about other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I have heard speeches about the tremendous acquisition of land by the local authorities under this Government, but the land for the building of houses in the Dublin area was purchased under the Fianna Fáil Government for the future and for the schemes that are going ahead today.  The point is this: how many houses will be built this year, next year and the year after?  These are <Col N="913" /> the big questions which will have to be asked.  Of course, when we are in office within a couple of years the Coalition will be very quick to point out how suddenly the housing rate has fallen under this new Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>It is not so long, a Cheann Comhairle, with all respect to you, since you made a big case for the boot and shoe industry.  I wonder what you would have to say about it today, particularly in view of the kind of information this House has been given, and which would never have been accepted by the present Government were they in Opposition.  At least the period in Government will make them a more responsible Opposition because they will know more about the realities. The complete failure of their policies in regard to the national resources programme is something again which will be noteworthy. The lack of production of this famous youth policy is something which the Parliamentary Secretary must be very embarrassed about now, and I can understand his difficulty. There are so many aspects to the failure of the Government in facing up to their responsibility that I feel it leaves one absolutely speechless, because it is just one failure after another.  The progress under Fianna Fáil was steady.  It may have been a bit too slow for some people, but we made progress and people had confidence in us.  Very shortly the people will have an opportunity of deciding who they want back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the political correspondents are reporting what goes on in the House they report it as they see it. When we are speaking in this House we very often report things as we see them from the constituencies, from <Col N="914" /> mixing with the people, from being involved with people, and we know the feedback.  As I said at the outset, when you have Deputy John O'Connell of the Labour Party stating publicly that there is 13 per cent unemployment in the country and 20 per cent in his own constituency, then we know that he is getting the feedback.  He is recognised as being a person in close touch with his constituents.</P>
    <P>This Government have taken very little interest in getting to know what the people think.  I would never have believed that a Government who had been in office for such a short period could get out of touch so quickly with what people really think about them. The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton, or his Minister, or the Taoiseach may go to various functions where everyone wants to come up and shake their hands and clap them on the back.  Very few people will come up and tell them straight to their faces what they think of them.  This is why I believe they tend to get out of touch with reality.  Figures seem to be the only things that matter to them.  They see only figures.  They do not see the human degradation or the hopeless feeling of a person who has put something aside for his retirement, a man or a woman who does not want to become a burden on the State.  Talking about people becoming a burden on the State, I should like to point out &mdash;maybe the Minister's Department would like to take a look at it&mdash;that there is an insurance policy which a professional man can take out to insure himself against sickness.  In other words, the insurance company pay up if he becomes sick, whether it is £50 or £60 a week, or whatever he has insured himself for, but he gets no tax relief on that insurance policy.  But if he collects under that insurance policy, tax is collected.  I think that is wrong and people should be encouraged not to become a burden on the State.  Why should anyone who is prepared to contribute to that extent not get some benefit from that?  There are plenty of people in that category who insure themselves against sickness and they would probably insure themselves for more if they got tax relief, but <Col N="915" /> there is no encouragement, no incentive. This is something which should be looked into and is something which the Minister could do constructively.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary <i>au fait</i> with what I am talking about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude on that note.  As I say, we have not had the last budget this year.  There will be another one next Monday, and no doubt there will be a further one in six months' time.</P>
      <P>I hope the pay pause will be agreed upon, because we realise the mess this country is in, and we must put the country before any personal or sectional interest.  We, as a responsible Opposition would be very much in favour of a pay pause.  We know the difficulties involved, and the huge inflation which will take place this year. I would predict that by the end of this year the figure for the unemployed will be between 125,000 and 140,000 people, that the rate of inflation will be as high as last year that it will be twice the inflation of our nearest neighbour, Britain, because the policies at present being pursued by this Government are not engendering confidence in any one to invest.</P>
      <P>There are promises of industries. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has stated that there are industries coming here.  Before a Minister goes to another country he is already acquainted with certain developments that are taking place. However, until the Government succeed in giving the leadership that is required, and until inflation is brought under control, industrialists from other countries will not invest in this country. They will watch our rate of inflation. As regards the Labour suggestion of floating our £ or freeing ourselves from sterling and trying to blame the sterling link, we would be in a far worse position if we were not tied to sterling.  In fact, if we are not very careful, the British might decide not to accept our £.  Instead of the Government blaming others all the time, they must put their own house in order and give leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> As I was saying across the floor of the House at Question Time to the Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary, it is not so long since I had to apologise&mdash;in 1965 or 1966 when I first came in here&mdash;as a member of the Government party for the manner in which Deputy O'Leary had lashed into the Taoiseach, then Deputy Cosgrave. I remember in 1969 when the then Deputy O'Leary said, whatever chance there was of coalition with Fianna Fáil, there was none whatsoever with Fine Gael.  He soon changed his tune. However, the people will again have a chance to decide.  The sooner the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to give some indication as to why, in my opinion, the budget, which undoubtedly was a severe one, was necessary and to why the basic strategy in the budget was correct; and also to give, in my personal capacity as a Deputy rather than as a member of the Government, my own views about public spending in general, and the extent to which I think a great deal of our public spending is, through no fault of any particular Government, not directly related to the needs of the people and could be reviewed more strenuously, perhaps, than it has been in most countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying causes of the present budgetary situation are numerous. Obviously, the cost of Government goes up in the same way as the cost of living goes up for every other person or service, but the recession we are suffering at the moment has had the effect of aggravating this problem.  It was estimated by two economists recently that, if we did not have the level of unemployment we have at the moment, which is due in large measure to a depression in world demand for our exports and a depression in world trade generally, the Government would save about £30 million a year on direct payments to people who are unemployed and on other services to such people, and that the additional taxation which would be paid by such people if they were back at work would be somewhere in the <Col N="917" /> region of £140 million.  Thus when people are suggesting that public expenditure is out of control, they must realise that this £170 million could be saved if we could get more people back to work, and if we could get out of the economic difficulties which we, in common with other European countries, are facing.  The sum of £170 million which would be saved in that manner would be equivalent to half the current deficit.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in relation to public expenditure, that the cost of public service pay has increased very substantially.  In 1969-70 public service pay, as a percentage of total Government expenditure, was 26 per cent.  In 1975 it had risen to 33 per cent.  In fairness, it should be said it has been over 30 per cent before, but there has been a fairly dramatic rise in the first part of this decade. This is in part due to the fact that the full national wage agreement increases have been paid to those who are in the public service, whereas they have not been able to be paid in other sectors of the economy.  It has been estimated by the Government that a very substantial saving of about £70 million could be made in the money which would be spent next year, and consequently in the level of taxation that may have to be raised, if we got a pay pause.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other fundamental reasons for the increases in expenditure. There has been a change in the demographic structure of Irish population in the past five years, so that there is a higher dependency ratio in the community than previously. There is a much larger number of children going to school now than was the case even four or five years ago and, in accordance with the pupil-teacher ratio under our educational programme, extra teachers must be provided.  Of course, extra money must be provided for the teachers. The increasing number of children in the community has led concomitantly to a greater increase in the payment of children's allowances, to lesser levels of income tax being levied because of the impact of children's allowances on taxation levels, and also <Col N="918" /> to higher levels of social welfare benefits in relation to the heads of families, given that we have a larger number of children.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale there is a larger number of older people, even in the last five years.  Older people are living longer and are, therefore, living longer into the period of their lives when they are receiving various benefits, and rightly so; it is something which everybody will obviously welcome.  However, it is an underlying demographic reason for a higher level of Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government have faced this issue squarely.  The public pay rises were paid.  Services for our children, for our old people and for our unemployed must be provided, and the electorate are faced with the necessity for providing the money to finance these services.  I believe that the Government have taken the basically correct choices in seeking to raise the money. Rather than increase the level of income tax they have chosen instead to levy the money in the form of expenditure taxes.  The basic reason for this, as I interpret it myself, is that people have some choice in relation to expenditure taxes.  If on the other hand the money is taken at source before they receive their income, they have no choice.  Furthermore, if one were to increase the level of income tax instead of increasing the expenditure taxes as the Government have done, it would decrease the incentive to work.  The overall effect of the Government's budget and the other measures they have adopted has been to increase the incentive to work.</P>
    <P>Our approach to income tax since we became a Government has been one of seeking to improve personal allowances so that people will have an incentive to go out to work.  I could illustrate that point very graphically by saying that in each of the past three years under the present Government there has been an increase in the basic personal allowances for income tax, whereas in the previous 16 years of our opponents' period in office, personal allowances were increased only four times in the whole 16 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> We are concerned about increasing the incentive to work through adjustments in the income tax code.  We have also expressed our concern to improve the incentive to work through the employment premium scheme introduced last June.  Approximately 4,000 people who would otherwise be unemployed are now employed under that scheme. The Government have introduced a community youth training programme which was extended to the whole country last January by the Minister for Labour.  This programme will provide employment for young people on amenity and other schemes which are socially beneficial, their salaries being paid by AnCO through a training grant, half of which will be paid in turn by the European Social Fund.  The work they do will have a skill and training content and they will be supervised by craftsmen who were themselves previously unemployed and who will have received special training in supervision and training of young people. So, not only will young people be given a start at work in a positive amenity type job but adults previously unemployed will be taken on in a supervisory capacity.</P>
    <P>The Government have also sought to improve the incentive to work by taking strong action&mdash;long overdue, to my mind&mdash;against those who have been evading income tax.  The fact that a special staff unit has been set up in the office of the Revenue Commissioners to oversee the anti-evasion drive and devise new procedures to pursue tax defaulters is very welcome.  There are already signs that the announcement is having a very salutary effect.  Also, in regard to the incentive to work, the Government are in the course of taking measures in relation to pay-related benefit and other benefits such as differential rents to ensure at all stages that people will not gain by becoming unemployed and that they will at all stages gain by taking a reasonable offer of a job even if they are on benefit on a pay-related basis.  To ensure that no persons are getting social welfare benefit fraudulently action is also being taken by way of the statutory penalties to be imposed on employers who do not comply with their obligations <Col N="920" /> regarding payment of social welfare contributions being substantially increased. These penalties will make it far more difficult for employers to take on people who are still drawing unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>In my constituency people quite often complain about the extent to which income tax is being evaded and about the extent to which some people are alleged to be abusing the social welfare code and getting money to which they are not entitled either because they have employment which they are not declaring or for some other reason.  I do not know if everybody would agree but I think anybody who either defrauds the Revenue, does not pay the taxes others are paying in a similar situation, or anybody who draws benefit which he is not entitled to draw under the rules and does so knowingly is committing social theft just as if he took the money from an individual.  The fact that he takes it from all of us does not make it to any less extent theft. As every member of the public has a duty to inform on anybody who is committing theft against an individual, I think we have a duty also to inform the Garda about any person we know is committing theft against the general community whether by tax evasion or abuse of the social welfare code.  I know that people who inform have a bad name in Ireland but if we are to get to the root of abuse of the tax code and the social welfare code we must have people prepared to give information about any forms of what I have described as social theft.  The Government's anti-tax evasion drive and the new system of penalties in regard to non-insurance of workers are designed to assist in this process and ensure that the money is saved for those who really need it rather than have it going to tax evaders and welfare abusers.</P>
    <P>In time of recession when there is under-utilised capacity in the economy there is justification for high level public spending and for the concomitant high level of public borrowing to finance that spending, or in the traditional Keynesian sense to take counter-cyclical measures, but it is <Col N="921" /> equally important to ensure that when the recession ends, as undoubtedly it will, those counter-cyclical measures are phased down so that the resources are allowed to flow back into the private sector once the private sector can take up the slack and use the excess capacity in the economy.  The Minister for Finance clearly recognised this in his budget speech when he said:</P>
    <P>When economic recovery returns, however, we will have to be extremely vigilant to ensure that Government expenditure does not preempt resources the private sector needs.</P>
    <P>As a statement of long term policy for the period following the end of our present recession this is a very sound one which deserves support. In my contribution I propose to make a few suggestions of a purely personal nature, more as a Deputy rather than as a junior member of the Government about how I think we could, in the long run through improvements in parliamentary procedure and so on seek to mitigate any unnecessary growth&mdash;I stress the word unnecessary&mdash;in public expenditure.  It is important to keep public spending within bounds because ultimately it will have to be paid for by taxation.  It is all right to borrow in the short term but these borrowings must be repaid out of current taxation ultimately and the larger the proportion of our income and our expenditure that goes in tax, the less the proportion left to individual choice.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in our community such as leisure time, an area for which I have some responsibility in the Government, where a major philosophical question must be posed: who can make the best choice for us in relation to expenditure on leisure activities&mdash;ourselves as individuals or a bureaucracy however benign?  That question needs to be posed right across the board in relation to any proposals there may be for increased expenditure on this or that.  We must also realise that every decision to spend money by the State has not only a tax cost but <Col N="922" /> also an opportunity cost.  That money could have been spent on something else and the very fact that it is decided to spend it in a particular way deprives us of the opportunity of spending it in whatever other way it could have been spent.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of reasons, some good, some bad, for the large increases in public spending in all the countries in Europe over the past 20 years in our technological society.  People are more interdependent than they were before. There is greater need than there was even 20 years ago for the State to step in to regulate affairs and to protect the weak than there was in a society that had not that same degree of interdependence, technologically and otherwise, generated between people.  There is also the need to make sure that in a community which is getting more prosperous the weak and poor get an increasingly larger share of those resources.  There is evidence indeed only today from Britain that even still very substantial inequalities exist, not just in money, but in such things as infant mortality, life expectancy, even apparently trivial things such as the physical height of children, ownership of a telephone or motor car, between those in the lower and higher income groups. There are problems of a serious nature, of a redistributive character to be tackled in our community. Ultimately it falls to the Exchequer to affect that redistribution.  In doing so it does lead to increases in the level of public spending.</P>
    <P>I contend that there are other reasons less valid for the increases in public spending which we have seen in most European countries over the past years, reasons which are quite unrelated to need.  I will give two examples.</P>
    <P>It is much easier for politicians to gain votes by calling for increases in spending than by specifying how spending can be reduced.  It is much easier, particularly, to present yourself in your own constituency by calling for increased spending, because the taxes to pay for increased spending <Col N="923" /> are levied on a general basis across the whole community.  If you call for saving in relation to a matter in your own constituency, the saving will not accrue to your own constituency but to the people of all Ireland, whereas calling for increased spending is calling for something which can be identified within one's own constituency.  One can call for the provision of a school, a dispensary or any other thing public provided for by public expenditure in that way. Therefore, because of this local consideration, we do not as politicians have a balanced view of the benefits as against the real cost, because the benefits tend to be presentable more easily locally than the costs which are going to be levied on a non-local basis.</P>
    <P>It is evident in Estimate debates in the House that Deputies find it very easy to call for increases in spending, because the discussion on the Estimate in which the calls for increased spending are made are at one end of the year, and of course there is no talk at that time, when one calls for an extra provision for two or three more hospitals in particular areas, about the tax cost of that.  The very same Deputies who have been calling for increased expenditure&mdash;as I am sure I did myself when in Opposition &mdash;on a particular item in an Estimate debate can decry with equal eloquence the tax which has to be levied to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy here is a public servant. When we talk of public servants there is a tendency to think very narrowly of civil servants, not even of the teachers and employees of State bodies who are public servants just as much.  All of us who are public servants very often have an interest of which we are quite unaware in the expansion of the public sector, because the bigger the public sector the greater are our prospects for promotion.  In the case of politicians the bigger the public sector, the greater is our influence. The more money that is passing out in schemes, the more opportunity we have of offering to get some of these for our constituents and so forth.  The larger the public sector the <Col N="924" /> more influence those of us who are in Government have over the total situation in the economy.  There can be thus an unhealthy degree of unconscious self-interest both among politicians and public servants, in increasing the size of the sector in which they are employed.  Also those of us in the public sector are in a uniquely strong position to argue for increases in public spending.  We Deputies are the experts on the need for improved facilities.  We Deputies are also the people who decide here in the Dáil whether there should be increases for facilities.</P>
    <P>In the same way, who are the experts on the appropriate level of educational spending?  Educationists who are employed in the public sector and who are benefiting from any increases there may be.  Who are the experts on increases in medical expenditure?  Medical people, who are in many cases drawing direct benefits from any expansion there might in medical expenditure.</P>
    <P>Of course, people do not always, and in fact most of the time do not act as public servants whether they be politicians or otherwise, in the interests of their own personal promotion or of the promotion of their own profession. Most of the time that thought would not enter their heads.  At the same time, this real benefit does exist for them in an expansion and we cannot afford to ignore it as a long-term factor underlying increases which there may have been in public spending.</P>
    <P>Another reason why public spending very often exceeds the real need for it is that it is practically impossible to get rid of a scheme which no longer serves the purpose for which it was set up, partly because of inertia, partly because somebody is benefiting from it, and that somebody is usually in a position to exercise pressure and the easy way out is taken very often.  We must recognise that if our economy is to be sucessful, above all it must be a mobile economy which can respond quickly to consumer demand on the other side of the world by producing what is needed, that can provide new services as and when they are demanded in an increasingly technological <Col N="925" /> market that is increasingly changing. I submit that the larger the public sector the more are resources immobilised.</P>
    <P>It is the private sector mobilised which can respond quickly because of the profits motive, because of the flexibility which exists in the private sector with various individual agents operating as against the monolithic public sector.  In the interest of mobility in our economy it is desirable that there should be some careful check on any expansion which might be made in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Of course, the public sector is not the only influence operating to create immobility of resources in our economy. Quite clearly, large personal holdings of wealth are often not distributed in the best way or used in the best way by individuals.  In my view, the Government's decision to introduce a wealth tax was economically justifiable because it will impose some levy on the holding of wealth and will encourage people who are holding wealth in unproductive forms&mdash;they may have difficulty with the income they are deriving from it in paying the wealth tax&mdash;to reallocate their wealth into other forms of production or use which will yield a return which will enable them comfortably to pay the wealth tax.  I would not wish therefore to be presented as saying that the only cause for immobility in our economy which is a problem, is the size of the public sector.  There are great holdings of wealth and also various restrictive practices in practically every profession which prevent the freedom of change in forms of production which we should have if we are to have a truly mobile economy.</P>
    <P>Very often, public schemes which are introduced allegedly to encourage activities have the effect of discouraging those activities.  Let us take the example of a grant for a sports club. If there was no grant for doing a particular job, the sports club might just go ahead and do it with its own resources and get it over with.  However, if they think there is a scheme under which they could get even 20 per cent of the cost they scratch their heads and write in.  A letter is sent back to them and they have to fill up <Col N="926" /> a form in great detail.  An inspector comes down&mdash;all this is at somebody's expense&mdash;and inspects the work and says: &ldquo;Maybe you should make this alteration or that.&rdquo; They make the alteration and, by the time the job is completed and the grant is paid, two or three years have elapsed from the time the job would have been finished if they had gone ahead and done it. The same goes for farmers applying for grants.  Very often they would do the job themselves much more quickly if they did not have to get involved in all this form filling which goes with schemes in the public sector designed to encourage particular activities.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few purely personal suggestions as to how I think these increases in public spending which are unrelated to real need, could be curbed in the long run.  As I said in the short term I believe there is a strong justification for large public spending to get us out of a situation where there is a slack in our economy.  But in the long run we need a better system for the control of public spending for the reasons I have outlined.  We are now in the process of drawing up an economic plan for the country.  It is very important that such an economic plan should be concerned with planning the level of public spending as well as planning other matters.  It is very important that levels of public spending should be expressed or projected both in cash terms and in kind.  Very often if they are expressed in terms of kind, the anticipated expenditure on a particular item can go well ahead of what is projected because of unanticipated cost increases in the item.  It is very important that we should have a projection both in cash and in kind so that, if we find that the cost of a particular form of spending has gone up faster than the general increase in the cost of services, reallocations can be made and questions can be asked.</P>
    <P>For instance, we need to express our planning in education sense both in terms of the number of new places in schools and the amount of money we are prepared to spend to achieve that.  We may find after a few years that the cost of providing those school <Col N="927" /> places has far exceeded what we anticipated it would be.  We will need then to be in a position with this information and make whatever changes are necessary.  In the context of such a plan, there is a need for some sort of an independent review body to examine all public spending on a continuing basis, and to report publicly to the Government on items which are no longer relevant.  We have many schemes which are redundant, or which no longer represent the optimum distribution of our resources. If we had some sort of independent body which could review them and make recommendations to the Government, these schemes would be brought to light.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to expect Departments who are administering schemes to say: &ldquo;We are doing this but we think we should get rid of it, and cease spending money on it.&rdquo; They fear that if they do that, the Minister for Finance will take the money back and say: &ldquo;Thank you very much.  I will keep the money now.&rdquo; The result is that Departments will not come forward with suggestions as readily as they might in relation to savings which could be made.  We need an independent body to assist the Minister for Finance in the work which he alone in the Government has to do in curbing the level of public spending.  He is the man who is concerned with keeping down spending.  Nearly all the other Ministers in one way or another are concerned, so far as their own Departments are concerned, with increasing the level of spending.  He is one man at the Cabinet table and they are 14 against one.  This is a problem for whoever may be Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In considering the area of parliamentary reform we need to have closer cohesion between decisions taken in the House to impose taxation and decisions to increase spending. Estimates are discussed at one end of the year and taxation at the other, totally unrelated to one another. One way this could be helped would be if, instead of discussing the estimates here in the House towards the end of the year to which they relate, <Col N="928" /> no money could be spent in the year in question until the Estimates had been submitted to the Dáil, and approved. That would mean, of course, that the Estimates would have to be submitted to the Dáil and approved in the year prior to the year in question.</P>
    <P>It would be useful if we could set up some sort of taxation index expressed in terms of pence in the £ on income tax.  To take my own Department, Education.  If we voted £X for it and the Opposition had been suggesting we were not spending enough and should add £Y million to that, we would be able to say on the basis of figures we had in terms of the taxation index: &ldquo;If you pass the Estimate as it stands, there will be an increase as a result of this next year of 4p in the £ income tax, whereas if you make the addition proposed by the Opposition, which will cost so much, that will mean 5p in the £ added to your income tax next year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Obviously, that type of detailed work could be best done by a committee on the House, perhaps a budget committee such as they have in certain European Parliaments, rather than in the set piece debate we have here now. There is a need to get down in detail to the impact on taxation of each individual Estimate and to enable the House to take a conscious decision that when it votes money for any service that by that very act it is increasing the level of taxation which it will ultimately have to find in the form of the budget for that year.</P>
    <P>There is a case in respect of new schemes of public spending being introduced, to insist on a more specific authority being granted by the Dáil for each new item of spending. I know we have to have Supplementary Estimates and so forth, and that a group of new subheads can be submitted in a Supplementary Estimate and they have to be approved by the Dáil.  The present procedures would not allow it in the absence of a budget committee, but, perhaps, we could have a requirement for each new scheme to get the specific separate authority of the Dáil which would contain in that <Col N="929" /> authority a terminal date for the scheme so that unless the scheme was positively renewed by the Dáil it would lapse.  Things tend to be continued <i>ad infinitum</i> without the need for them to be reassessed. Perhaps we could have written into that resolution some semi-statutory criterion for the operation of that scheme, for measuring its success in terms of output and results rather than in terms of pounds spent.  This could be used on a continuing basis to measure whether the anticipated results of the introduction of this extra public spending are in fact occurring on the ground.  If it could be clearly demonstrated that such was not the case then the scheme would fall to be queried.  I know there would be immense procedural problems in the absence of parliamentary reform in doing anything along those lines but this is something we need to think about.</P>
    <P>We need, generally speaking, to look at the whole area of devolved authority by Governments in the country to bodies like the health boards, vocational education committees, county councils and so forth. There has been for many years, not only in this country but in Britain as well, an increased tendency for the central Government to delegate things to the local authorities but to remove any real discretion from the local authorities.  I would like to quote an item from a British magazine called the <i>Banker</i>, which is in relation to Britain but describes something which occurs here too.  It states:</P>
    <P>... but there must remain a strong presumption that if local councils had had to find a much larger proportion of their revenue from local taxpayers their attitude to spending would have been very different.  As the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government put it in 1969, commenting on the rising trend of grants, which has since proceeded so much further, &ldquo;The tendency is not a healthy one.  It limits not only the freedom of local authorities in <Col N="930" /> making decisions that should properly belong to them, but also their sense of responsibility, to the extent that they are spending money they do not raise and do not have to account for to their electors&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that very often local authorities are in the opposite position, that they have to raise money for things which they have no control over and over which they have no discretion.</P>
    <P>There is probably a case for looking generally at all these various authorities to see if we could delegate to them responsibility for particular things which they must pay for entirely out of locally raised taxes, with, of course, some block subsidies for poorer areas.  Members of local authorities would then have more incentive to keep costs down because they would have to pay in the end by taxes raised locally.  It would be an immensely difficult task and I do not think it is something which could be done very quickly.  However, it is something which we should consider very carefully. Generally speaking, from the point of view of cost control, we need to set our targets not just in real terms but also in cash terms.  We need to have something in the nature of cash limits on spending.  <i>The Financial Times</i> stated:</P>
    <P>Since public expenditure has always been planned in real terms &mdash;miles of roads, numbers of school places, and more recently the real value of pensions and welfare payments&mdash;this can produce large unbudgeted increases in expenditure on programmes which are themselves unchanged.</P>
    <P>We need to take a look at that very carefully.</P>
    <P>We might also introduce to the public sector some element of the concept of consumer sovereignty, that the consumer of the social services will have a greater choice and in the exercise of his consumer choice could exert greater pressure on the providers of the services to provide them in the best form possible.</P>
    <P>There is a debate in England in relation to the introduction, possibly, <Col N="931" /> of the system of vouchers in the area of education where the money for education would be paid to the parents rather than to the schools in relation to their needs, the number of their families, the extent of their income and so on and that the parents with that amount of money would be able to shop around between the different schools and see what schools could offer them the best bargain.  This would have certain problems in relation to whether or not the parents would know what is best for their children.  It would mean, on the other hand, that schools would be under pressure from parents all the time to provide the most attractive programme and to provide a programme at the minimum cost so that an undue extent of the vouchers held by the parents would not be exhausted.</P>
    <P>The same sort of notion could possibly be introduced in relation to the provision of public housing and the distribution of agricultural land to farmers.  You could have a situation where instead of the Land Commission taking over estates and distributing them the small farmers who need land could be given title to long term loans at subsidised interest rates.  They could then go into the market place themselves, bid for the land and get it against competition with this extra help. This might lead to a more efficient distribution of resources than the present system where everything is centralised, divided up and files sent up to Dublin and so forth.  Obviously there would be very great administrative problems in doing anything of that nature but it is something which needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>In areas where we decide we need to increase public expenditure on a particular item we can ask ourselves if it is necessary to achieve this objective by the creation of a new, pensionable position in the public service for a person who will have to remain in the public service long after the particular scheme in question is no longer necessary.  The fact that it has been deemed necessary, traditionally, always to create new permanent posts to do new work, although the work may be only of a relatively temporary character, has perhaps contributed to <Col N="932" /> the growth in the public sector.  We could, perhaps, get over that by providing increased services by the use of independent contractors and by employing people on a contract of employment rather than in a permanent post.</P>
    <P>We need to look generally at our social security schemes and our income tax schemes to see if they can be integrated more and have less administrative costs arising from administering them separately.  I have been given obviously a few personal ideas as to how, in my view, we could in the long run introduce procedures which would give us greater control over the growth in public spending in the House and have more public information about the impact of decisions to spend.  In the long run this would lead to a more balanced economy and a more balanced relationship within the economy between the public sector and the private sector.  I believe the size of the private sector need not necessarily be a divisive issue between the left and the right.  One can very often, if one is a little more efficient about it and if one applies business-like principles, achieve many of the social objectives in which the left are interested without diminishing the freedom of the private sector in which the right are interested.  This can be achieved in the area of public spending and by the review of public spending in the long run.  There is room to achieve those twin objectives without conflict.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the budget speech that this overall review of public spending is taking place.  In the firm line he has taken regarding the creation of new posts in the public service the Minister has shown that he is prepared to face up to some of the underlying reasons for the growth in public spending. From the detailed review taking place now there are reasons to be hopeful that in the long term we will overcome this recession and the problems it has created for us, and that one beneficial legacy of the recession may be a more realistic attitude to the role of the public sector.  That is something which I and, presumably, Deputies on all sides would welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget will prove to be a disaster for our people. <Col N="933" /> During the past three years we have witnessed the reckless spending of the Government.  This has led to the situation in which budget deficits have increased from £5 million in 1972-73 &mdash;the last year in which Fianna Fáil were in office&mdash;to £92 million in 1974, to £259 million in 1975 and to £327 million in 1976.  We have now reached a level of deficit that is formidable. The Government and many of their spokesmen try to blame the oil crisis for this situation but I would remind the House that long before there was an oil crisis the Government had embarked on this policy of huge deficit budgets.  Even in their first budget in 1973 there was an enormous level of borrowing.  This borrowing has reached a proportion that is unprecedented in the history of the State and which cannot be justified on any financial or economic grounds.</P>
      <P>Ours is not the only country to suffer from the effects of increased oil prices and economic recession but we are the only country in the EEC and, indeed, in the western world, which has resorted to borrowing on this colossal scale in order to finance our day-to-day expenses.  We know now that the proposed borrowing for this year is more than £900 million or more than 23 per cent of the GNP. Other European countries have a range of borrowing which is equivalent to/from 4 to 6 per cent of their GNP.  Even the heaviest borrowers, such as Britain and Italy, did not have a figure which exceeded 10 per cent of the GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have become reckless and have no regard for the taxpayer, the ratepayer or for our young people who will have to pay for all this in the years to come.  They are pursuing a disastrous spendthrift course.  If it were not so serious, it would be laughable to reflect on the fact that they are now borrowing to service money borrowed already.  It is worth recalling that on 31st March, 1973, the national debt was £1,298 million, that on 31st March, 1974, it was £1,464 million, that on 31st December, 1974, it was £1,766 million and that at the end of 1975 it was £2,367 million while the estimate for <Col N="934" /> 1976 is in the region of £3,200 million. This is a frightening debt for a country the size of ours and one which has such a small population.</P>
    <P>It is frightening, too, to realise that the Government have created a national debt which is more than one-and-a-half times greater than was the figure at which it stood after 50 years of the coming into existence of this State.  These figures will have a big impact in so far as our future development is concerned.</P>
    <P>Despite the £100 million extra taxation which was imposed in the budget the Government's current deficit has risen from last year's level of £259 million to £327 million or about 26 per cent more than any inflation increase.  Yet the Government have not succeeded in halting inflation or even in reversing the inflationary trend, the major cause of which is lack of price control.  By their colossal borrowing abroad the Government have added fuel to the fires of inflation. The Minister told us that it was his intention to remove the deficit during a period of three years.  He did not say how he would do it or where he would get the money.  He did not even say if he was serious about doing it.  If he is sincere about this it will mean he must raise tax receipts by that amount, which will mean 8 per cent of the gross national product on the existing level of 34 per cent, or else he must cut down on spending.  It is difficult to see either of these things happening in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is at an all-time record and inflation is still very high and the budget will aggravate both of those problems.  The tax increases the Minister introduced will have the effect of raising prices by 5 per cent at least.  Therefore, his pre-budget estimate of a much lower inflation rate this year requires drastic revisions.  It seems to me that in 1976 prices will rise by at least 15 per cent.  This will not inspire confidence in our business people, in the work force or in foreign investors who normally would be interested in establishing industries here and who would give badly needed employment.</P>
    <P>If the financial proposals announced <Col N="935" /> by the Minister are implemented in the forthcoming Finance Bill it will raise serious questions about the Government's capacity and ability to secure a pay pause.  With rapidly rising prices the real spending power of workers and consumers will be definitely reduced and this is bound to increase pressure for further pay rises.</P>
    <P>There is a great duty on the Government to help ease the unemployment situation.  Even a modest amount of public money if used selectively could have the effect of guaranteeing work for thousands of young people.  I was very impressed by many of the suggestions made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I hope he will be able to use his influence with the Government to put some of the suggestions into operation.  Some of them would mean more employment in the country.</P>
    <P>There are other ways whereby jobs could be created.  For example, with regard to housing, there is a good case to be made for giving grants to first-time buyers of houses.  Generally these are young married people who have the greatest problem in raising the large cash deposit necessary to purchase a house.  If these grants were accompanied by some scheme of inflation-linked mortgages which would have the effect of keeping down the size of the cash repayments in the early years the overall result would be that many thousands could afford to purchase their own homes.  This would mean a substanial boost to the construction industry where so many workers are now out of work.  An additional 8,000 people in the construction industry are now unemployed as compared with last year and in all there are approximately 22,000 or 23,000 unemployed in the industry.</P>
    <P>I was surprised the Minister did not take the opportunity of the budget to make some responsible proposals to deal with the grave problem of unemployed school leavers.  There are many forms of community service and many projects on which young people could be usefully engaged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A capital injection in some programme, perhaps no more than £5 million or £6 million, would be sufficient to put thousands of young people to work.  By the nature of the work they would carry out, they could make a useful contribution to society.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that there was no proposal in the budget to increase the level of university grants to help students from the lower income families to attend at university, particularly when they cannot get employment.  It is alarming that the Government made no effort to correct the disparity or lack of co-ordination between the incomes of those on salaries and wages and the incomes of those working on the land in so far as qualifying for university grants are concerned.  If the Parliamentary Secretary examines the guide scale sent out by the Department of Education to local authorities, he will see there is a big difference between the possible income from land carrying various valuations as compared with the guide scale in respect of those on salaries or wages in order to qualify for university grants.  This is something which should be examined very seriously.  I have heard parents and others comment on this disparity.  It is one that should be corrected as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of our most important industries, the tourist industry, will be badly hit as a result of the budget proposals.  There can be no doubt about that when we take into consideration the increase in the price of petrol and, therefore, of motoring, the increase in the price of tobacco and alcohol.  These proposals will make the task of Bord Fáilte Éireann and others concerned in promoting tourism very difficult indeed.  If the Government are really serious about schemes to boost exports, they should <Col N="937" /> take steps immediately to deal with the grave threat to tourism.  I do not think it would cost the Exchequer very much to introduce a subsidy towards the cost of air and sea fares into the country.  If a rebate through the medium of coupons were given on the first 50 or 70 gallons of petrol the gain would be significant while the amount the scheme would cost the Exchequer would be very little.  If some attractions are not offered there may be a serious decline in tourism.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that, despite the budget proposals for increased current and capital expenditure, the Government have found it necessary to instruct health boards and local authorities to curtail a great many services.  Simultaneously they have cut back the capital allocations to local authorities for numerous schemes.</P>
    <P>It is despicable that non-contributory old age pensioners will no longer qualify automatically for medical cards. This is a sorry state of affairs and it shows quite clearly the serious financial position the Government find themselves in.  Again, medical card holders must in future provide their own transport for themselves and their families to hospitals and clinics.  There are many hardship cases.  Many parents on medical advice have to take their children to regional hospitals which are sometimes 50 or 70 miles away. They will no longer qualify for free transport.  This again shows the serious financial position the Government are in when they come down on the weakest section in the community and make life more miserable and harder than it already is.  The Government should protect this section of the community and give them top priority.  I never thought I would see the day when a Government would tell the health boards to cancel medical cards held by non-contributory old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Social Welfare at present applicants for unemployment assistance and benefit sometimes have to wait for four to ten weeks before a decision is made on their applications.  This delay may be due <Col N="938" /> to a shortage of staff or the daily rise in the numbers unemployed, but it is very hard for a man rearing a family to have to wait that length of time before a decision is made on his application. This proves that when this Government lets the hammer fall, it falls on the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious situation developing in local government services, particularly in county councils and county boroughs corporations, because of a shortage of money to meet existing commitments.  The managers and secretaries of some councils are in the very embarrassing position of trying to keep creditors away from their doors and offices.  This will lead to more unemployment and will mean that the public will lose confidence in the Government and local authorities.  Road grants have been substantially reduced for many counties.  This too will lead to more unemployment.  There is not enough money to meet existing commitments in relation to water and sewerage schemes either.</P>
    <P>The majority of housing authorities do not know how they stand in relation to capital allocations for housing this year.  This is a terrible state of affairs.  This year Kerry County Council have been given authority to start building only 34 houses for the whole of the county.  That was the position last Monday night.</P>
    <P>It is becoming very obvious that there is a lack of Government policy. In many instances a period of at least six months will elapse between the time a school tender is recommended and accepted.  Many people are bitterly disappointed the way the school transport scheme is being handled.  It was envisaged that this scheme would be improved and expanded as years went by, but the reverse is now the case.  A slowing down in the primary school building programme will mean more unemployment in the building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>The budget made no contribution to the improvement of agriculture, our main industry.  The proposal to tax farming and fishery co-operative societies will be <Col N="939" /> a major setback to the improvement and expansion to the agricultural and fishing industries.  We should bear in mind that for many years the promotion and setting up of co-operatives was encouraged.  Now that they are beginning to become established their profits are being taxed.  It is well known that the majority of these co-operatives plough back their profits into the business in the interest of farmers and fishermen.  This proposed new tax is nothing more than a tax on, and a curtailment of expansion.</P>
    <P>In certain parts of rural Ireland the Dairy Disposal Company successfully operated creameries but never made a profit.  The co-operative movement was encouraged by the former and the present Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries to take over these creameries. We took them over and many of them are still operating at a loss.  The few that have shown a profit over the past year and who intend to use that profit for further expansion and improvement of facilities and services in the interests of the farmers, are now going to be taxed.  In other words, they will be taxed on their expansion proposals. I think this is wrong.  I would urge the Minister to seriously reconsider his budget suggestions in this regard before he introduces the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>We must remember that there is fantastic potential in farming and in agriculture generally, and that farming and agriculture are still less than 50 per cent developed.  If we are going to tax expansionary proposals, or tax profits which could lead to expansion in this industry at the present time, then the future of the agricultural industry will be in serious jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to fisheries and to the proposals to tax the fisheries co-operatives.  The fishermen were urged to become involved in co-operatives, to organise themselves, and these co-operatives are used mainly as a vehicle for marketing.  If we are going to tax fishery co-operative profits, it will mean that they cannot expand, that they will be slow to expand, and it means particularly that the marketing of fish, which is so vital to the economy and which has such a good future, will <Col N="940" /> be seriously inhibited as a result of the proposed tax.</P>
    <P>I believe that proposals have been made in the capital budget for the spending of money on various schemes and services under the aegis of different Departments which will never be spent this year.  From the lack of flow of money already to local authorities, to school managers and to various agents, it seems that it is not the intention of the Minister or the Government to spend anywhere near what has been provided for in the capital budget this year.  This will mean more and more unemployment and it is a bitter disappointment for the public.  Again, I cannot understand why the Minister, in relation to his proposal to set up a Joint Committee of Members of the Oireachtas to examine the reports and accounts on the overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or in commercial activities did not include Bord Fáilte Éireann and Gaeltarra Éireann.  I should like the Minister to clarify in his reply to this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Certainly, Gaeltarra Éireann could be compared in many respects with the ACC and with the Dairy Disposal Company.  Bord Fáilte should certainly be included.</P>

      <P>I was amazed that the Minister did not spell out the Government's intention in relation to the Gaeltacht areas in his budget.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht appears to be a very popular Minister, but the Government seems to have achieved nothing whatsoever in relation to the development of the Gaeltacht.  More and more people are beginning to <Col N="942" /> realise and believe that the Minister for the Gaeltacht is no more than a public relations officer for the Government in respect of the western seaboard counties.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2nd March, 1976.</P>
