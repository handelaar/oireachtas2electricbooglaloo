      <P>and <b>Mr. G.

      <P>I am satisfied that, on the part of the Local Appointments Commission, there is no question of prejudice against the appointment of women to posts as Deputy Chief Agricultural Officer (Education).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not regard it as strange that, seeing that so many services under the committees of agriculture are provided by women at non-promotional level, none of them has succeeded in getting promotion to the post of Deputy CAO?</P>

      <P>That is a slightly separate question.  I understand that, over the past two years, out of 27 vacancies only 6 per cent of the total candidates have been women and, in three out of the six competitions involved, the interview boards have been chaired by a woman.</P>

      <P>I said I could not justify initiating such an action.  The Deputy must appreciate that to engage in such action with all the health boards, voluntary hospitals and the other agencies, would be time-consuming. The Deputy is also aware that as far as purchases by the health boards and voluntary hospitals are concerned they are confined to a large extent to the combined purchasing list, 98 per cent of the goods on which are made in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not widespread. As far as the question is concerned, have any of the Deputies any evidence to the effect that British or foreign made goods were purchased over the last 12 months?  If there is any such evidence I will have it investigated, but I am not going to carry out a survey over the health services because they are bound by statute to buy from the combined purchasing list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain homes in the categories referred to by the Deputy are funded by health boards by means of approved capitation rates payable in respect of eligible persons.  Other similar homes are funded by grants payable by the boards under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
      <P>I propose to increase capitation rates very shortly, generally by about 10 per cent.  As far as section 65 grants in respect of homes and other services are concerned, health boards have been advised to provide, in their detailed budgets for 1976, at least the same level of grant as obtained in 1975, together with reasonable provision to provide against additional costs in 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he intends to reduce the rate of interest charged on local authority house loans, in line with recent changes in interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer lending rate, on which the rate for local authority house loans is based, is a long-term fixed interest rate.  Unlike building society and bank lending rates, it is not subject to variation during the life of the loan.  The cost to the Government of borrowing long-term funds is over 14 per cent.  Therefore, the present rate of interest charged on local authority house loans already involves a signficant subsidy which has to be met from taxation.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to reduce the rate at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that a 12½ per cent interest rate on an SDA loan is exorbitant in the case of an individual whose income must be below £45 per week?  Will he not agree that it is essential for the benefit of the building industry that the rate be reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured of the Government's anxiety to see interest rates lowered.  He must also be aware that the Government's policy in the past, as at present, has provided very generous subsidies on interest rates.  For instance, within the last couple of years long-term borrowings were made by the State at a rate of interest of 17 per cent.  That was the world market rate but notwithstanding it the Exchequer provided immense subsidies so that loans were still being issued at a figure as low as 11½ per cent.  Any subsidies given to reduce the rate of interest chargeable on SDA loans will have to be met by the taxpayer because this is the only source from which the money can be obtained.  I am sure the Deputy is of the view, as all sensible people are, that it would be inappropriate to impose any additional taxation, no matter how meritorious might be the case for lowering interest rates in respect of housing loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that in circumstances where the SDA loan is only about half of the present price of a house and where the applicant must get another loan elsewhere at a high interest rate, if we are to ensure that housing development continues the interest rate should be reduced now, particularly in view of the large number of unemployed building workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that high interest rates are a factor in housing output or housing demand; in fact, it is quite the reverse.  The largest number of houses were built and bought at a time when interest rates were high.  I would not feel justified in imposing the additional taxation which would be necessary if the Deputy's idea were implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that at a time when there are more than 20,000 building workers unemployed, when in the past year more than 8,000 building workers lost their employment, that this is a time when all possible incentives should be given to the building and the construction industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Production of wool in 1976 is likely to be lower because of the recent decline in sheep numbers. As regards price, it is not possible at this stage to forecast with any degree of accuracy trends in the immediate future as the price of Irish wool depends on the world market.  The improved price, however, which prevailed since December is likely to be maintained for 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information but I can say there has been a very big price increase in wool since the early part of the year. Prices early on ranged from 20p to 23p per lb. for lowland wool and 14p to 16p for mountain blackfaced types. Later there is a steady increase in price and the present figures are 34p to 37p for lowland wool and 20p to 23p for mountain blackfaced wool. All of these are indications of the steady increase.  People may be holding on to wool to get still higher prices.  It is not that there are not available markets.</P>

      <P>This question will not arise at the Law of the Sea Conference.  The Law of the Sea Conference will not be dealing directly with the question of getting our fishing limits extended to 50 miles.  Our first obligation will be to discuss that matter with our EEC partners.  We are in the EEC now, as Deputy Fahey is, I am sure, aware and we will discuss the matter with our partners there first and see what will happen.  The Government, as I indicated in my reply, are permitted to extend our exclusive limits and the Deputy must be aware of the recent announcement made by the appropriate EEC Commissioner. This question is being actively determined by the Department of Foreign Affairs, who are the appropriate Department to deal with the matter, and both my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are in close contact on questions arising so far as fisheries are concerned and the Law of the Sea Conference at that conference and also on the exclusive fishery limit.</P>

      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the anxiety of fishermen with regard to over-fishing stocks.  The herring fishing stock is down considerably this year.  In one of the richest grounds in the world, Dunmore East, the catch was down by 70 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That question has been answered on a number of occasions on behalf of the Government, particularly by Deputy John Kelly, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I myself referred to it on a number of occasions.  I think everyone is well aware of the Government's view so far as our exclusive fishery limits are concerned.  We have made our position quite clear.  We are endeavouring through negotiation to get our limits extended.  We have made it quite clear that we will not take unilateral action. I do not know whether Deputy Lynch's and Deputy Fahey's party would, if they were in power, adopt a go-it-alone approach but that is not the proposal of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons, Mr. Molloy, Mr. MacSharry, Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Kenneally</b> asked the Minister for Labour the total number of persons registered as unemployed at the latest available date; and the steps the Government propose to take to reduce that number substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons on the live register at local employment offices on 13th February, 1976, was 118,427 of whom 3,770 were on systematic short-time.  I should add that the seasonally corrected unemployment figure for the end of January &mdash;this is the latest date for which we have such a figure&mdash;was below the seasonally corrected figure for October, 1975.</P>
      <P>As regards steps to reduce unemployment, budgetary policy has consistently aimed at maintaining a high level of employment.  The 1976 public capital programme has been settled at £596 million and this will promote economic growth and sustainable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main agency dealing with job creation is, of course, the IDA.  Deputies will be aware of the incentives <Col N="555" /> provided by the authority to aid industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>Despite the present economic difficulties, additional funds have been made available to the Industrial Training Authority.  In 1976 it is hoped to train 9,000 people.  The premium employment programme has helped to return more than 4,000 people to full-time employment.  Efforts are continuing to encourage a greater utilisation of the scheme by employers.</P>
    <P>Because of the open nature of our economy, the speed at which we can increase employment is, of course, dependent to a very large extent on what happens in the economies of our major trading partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the steps taken by the Government to reduce the number of unemployed were totally inadequate and to date have had no impact whatsoever on the unemployment situation and would he further agree that the budgetary policy to which he referred is much more likely to increase unemployment rather than reduce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Faulkner's crystal ball is as usual, a little bit clouded.  There is no question whatever of unemployment being increased as a result of budgetary policy and Deputy Faulkner must be aware of that.  Secondly, the steps that are being taken are bound to reduce unemployment and the Deputy, I have no doubt, will be prepared to admit that in a reasonably short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a similar forecast which did not turn out to be correct from the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the budget debate. Further, will the Minister not agree that providing a substantial increase in finance in real terms for the building and construction industry would go a long way towards reducing the number of unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Faulkner has a phobia about the financing of the building industry. The position is that there has been a <Col N="556" /> tremendous increase in real terms in the amount of money available for housing and I thought I made that clear the other night at the end of the Adjournment Debate.  The money is there, more money than Fianna Fáil ever thought could be provided, and that money is providing employment and Deputy Faulkner's repetition of the number of people unemployed in the building industry is obviously an effort to create the impression that there was nobody unemployed in that industry when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Of course, anybody who knows the facts knows that is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear Deputy Faulkner would have this Government decide on building hotels, which is what the Fianna Fáil Government did. Instead of that we are building houses, twice as many houses as Fianna Fáil thought necessary in 1975.  We built almost 26,000 last year and over 26,000 the year before.  The record of Fianna Fáil is there to be checked on.  They set their target at 13,000 or 14,000.</P>

      <P>Section 13 provides for the position arising in regard to the custody and immunity of persons who are in the State for the purpose of the taking of evidence under section 12.  The section deals with the position of a person who has come here to attend before a commission being held in this jurisdiction where a witness in this jurisdiction has been unwilling to travel to the other jurisdiction for the purposes of the trial.  It is the reverse of the procedure which has been, one might say, the consideration behind this debate.  We have assumed that Northern fugitives will be tried in our courts; this deals with the position of a fugitive from the South or some person against whom extradition cannot be exercised being tried in the North for an extra-territorial offence committed in the South.  This section provides for the immunity of a person while he is in the State attending at the taking of evidence on commission.</P>

      <P>Without repeating myself and putting forward all the arguments already put forward on this side of the House in regard to the Bill as a whole, I appreciate that this section is necessary if the Bill is ever to work.  I have already stated my doubts regarding the workability of the Bill but if it is meant to work this section is necessary.  Part III deals with the power given to the Garda to arrest an accused person from Northern Ireland if he escapes.  There is nothing very controversial in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One query could well arise.  When a person has been in the custody of the Garda here and is being returned to the North of Ireland, is there any way of protecting our gardaí against trumped-up charges that could be brought against them by a person who has been in their custody?  I am suggesting that before the gardaí hand over such a person as is contemplated <Col N="574" /> in the section there could possibly be a medical examination by qualified doctors of the condition of that person.</P>
      <P>The Minister appreciates that one of our greatest concerns throughout the Bill is lest there should be any imputation of improper conduct to our gardaí or the courts.  This type of provision could leave them vulnerable to unfounded allegations.  I do not say these would arise regularly but the possibility is there.  Would the Minister contemplate having a proper medical examination of people who have been in Garda custody and are being handed back to Northern Ireland so as to ensure that subsequently there could not be anything arising that would impugn the good name or conduct of the Garda?  It could happen that a person subsequently injured in some way&mdash; or he could have contrived the injury in some way&mdash;could lay the blame for the injury on totally innocent gardaí who are being asked to operate what we regard as unworkable and undesirable procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the hazards facing a policeman carrying out his duty is that he can be subject to malicious charges by criminals or people evilly disposed.  It is a hazard that police all over the world have to face, and it is one of the considerations that makes the whole question of complaints procedures against the police such a sensitive subject.  The protection for the Garda here is the protection that they have at the moment against such a charge&mdash;and I think it would be wrong to try to inhibit the right to make such a charge &mdash;maliciously made without foundation. That protection lies in the present procedures to protect the Garda against such charges.  They are the investigative procedures, whether they be the internal Garda procedures or in the courts whereby a person seeks to prosecute a garda, and I do not think there is anything more required in this instance.  I think it would be wrong to differentiate between the situation when it arises here and the ordinary situations, so to speak.  The present procedures are adequate to ensure that the Garda will not be subject to being <Col N="575" /> wrongly convicted.  It cannot stop them being accused because we would then thereby produce a new consideration.  What we want to ensure is that no unjust allegation can be sustained against the Garda.  I am satisfied that the present procedures designed to investigate such allegations and ensure that justice is done to the Garda and the complainants are the proper procedures to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The present procedures that the Minister refers to could be criticised by people outside the jurisdiction.  In regard to the cases the Minister refers to, with which he is so easily satisfied, he is talking about cases that remain at all times within our jurisdiction.  Therefore, if a citizen, justifiably or not, makes a complaint against a member of the Garda Síochána he invariably takes the case to court.  I have been involved in some such cases.  He has at all times to remain in the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Here we are in a different position altogether, and that is what makes that ordinary procedure which the Minister is talking about acceptable. Where our Garda hand someone over out of their custody to another jurisdiction, we can see that the situation is not as simple as the Minister seems to suggest.  If he is mistreated, maltreated, or contrives or appears to be so when he has left our jurisdiction, this is an entirely different position. We want to guard against that kind of imputation.  It is fine to say the ordinary procedures apply and that the Garda would be vindicated in civil proceedings or criminal proceedings being taken against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time to ensure that, even if such proceedings were taken, the best evidence would be available for the garda's defence, I would suggest that there would be an examination by a competent doctor before a person is handed over out of this jurisdiction to certify that at a given time and place before leaving our jurisdiction and the custody of our Garda, A.B. was in good, sound physical and mental condition and was not suffering from any ill-treatment. <Col N="576" /> This is without precedent. I sympathise with the Minister to this extent only: in his whole attitude to this Bill and the various problems we have raised he has talked about the normal guarantees and procedures and provisions as if we are dealing with a normal situation.  It is because it is abnormal and without precedent that we have to ensure that we propose that there be something without precedent as well.  It is a practical step and one that I can see no good reason for not taking.  It would ensure that if such vexatious claim was brought, the best evidence that could be made available would be made available by a doctor who had been present to examine the person before he left our jurisdiction.  We are concerned that our Garda Síochána, who certainly have won and earned the best respect for us since the formation of this State, should not be vulnerable to any vexatious claims.  Unfortunately, we cannot express confidence to a similar degree in the police force at the other end.  We have to be realistic and introduce some practical safeguard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction to be made between the two points the Deputy has made.  One is the answer to a vexatious claim.  The answer to that is that under our procedures the vexatious claim cannot succeed until it is proved beyond doubt.  The other point the Deputy makes is that the Garda should be warned in advance to take steps to have evidence that would prevent them being wrongly convicted on foot of a vexatious claim.  I rely on the common sense of the Garda to ensure that they will be in that position.  If they decide that the procedure demands that there should be automatically an examination before handing back the accused there would be nothing whatever to prevent that, unless the person has refused to submit to medical examination as he would have the right to do, but he could not allege ill-treatment if he so refuses. Again, he might make allegations of ill-treatment that would not show up in medical examination.  Suggesting that medical examination is the answer does not tell the whole story. <Col N="577" /> Whatever the Garda have to do to ensure that they would not fall into the predicament that Deputy O'Kennedy envisages would be a mater for themselves to decide administratively in a particular case.  We could not write into this section a direction for the Garda to take steps to ensure that they have evidence in advance to meet a vexatious claim made by an accused in the other jurisdiction.  There would have been nothing in the Bill or the section that would inhibit the Garda from taking common-sense steps to protect their interests.  In so doing in a particular case I would expect that as a matter of prudence&mdash;and the Garda Síochána are prudent men with antennae as sensitive as any of us to sense what might be to their detriment&mdash;they would take appropriate steps in an appropriate case, but this is not something we can write into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Minister's response because he is conscious of the fact that possibly it might not be something that could be introduced by way of amendment. There is no end to the inventiveness of the human mind.  I am glad the Minister has said he would expect the Garda to take certain steps if they thought that such vexatious claims could be made against them.  I take it from that that it will be open to the gardaí&mdash;the Minister might even encourage them&mdash;to arrange for such medical examination, and if such is the case I would be quite happy.</P>
      <P>When the Minister talks about a vexatious claim having to be proved beyond doubt he overlooks the fact that it is not necessary in a civil prosecution to prove a vexatious case beyond doubt, simply on the balance of probabilities.  I hope the Garda authorities will now know they have this right to protect themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This gives the right of audience to Northern barristers or solicitors in our courts.  The reciprocal right is given to our barristers or solicitors before the commissioner. There is not a reciprocal right before the courts in Northern Ireland that would arise in a case where a person from the South is being tried in the North.  Where a person has taken refuge in the North and wants to be represented by counsel from the South, there is no reciprocal right as of now.  One reason for that is that it is not possible under the system there to provide full reciprocation because solicitors have no right of audience in the higher courts, but I think the general movement towards the right of establishment under the EEC is going to take care of that.  Anyway, there may be certain reciprocation between the two Bars which will deal with it as well.  In fact, I imagine that a situation where somebody from the South is standing trial in the North and has refused to come down South for trial and that person wants a solicitor and counsel from the South, would be extremely rare if it ever arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be no objection in principle to this section.  There is only one small matter I would like to raise, that is, the right of audience, as mentioned by the Minister, to Northern Ireland barristers or solicitors who have the right of <Col N="579" /> audience and to practise in relation to any proceedings before the commissioner. It appears that a corresponding right is not provided for in the English statute, namely, the right of Irish barristers and solicitors to attend before the commissioner in Northern Ireland. This is not given in the English statue. The corresponding English statue would seem to have schedule 4, Article 4b, as the appropriate reference, which does not seem to provide for the right of audience to an Irish barrister or solicitor.  I am not so much concerned about safeguarding the rights of barristers and solicitors but I am concerned about the rights of the accused person.  Even if an accused person is adequately represented by a Northern Ireland barrister or solicitor before the commissioner, the important matter is that he should have the freedom to have his own barrister or solicitor appear at such a hearing.  In many cases he may wish to have the services of an Irish barrister or solicitor at such a hearing.  It can be argued that this is a small point, but it is indicative of the lack of care that the English authorities are displaying for the rights of an accused person.  In its own small way it may serve to highlight the fears we have about this Bill, because these fears are based in great measure on sound reasons.  If the rights of an accused are not spelt out in express terms by legislation, then we must ask the question: What rights does he have?</P>
      <P>The Minister is relying on the <i>bona fides</i> of the Northern Ireland security forces in relation to matters about which there are statutory provisions. To rely on the <i>bona fides</i> of such persons in the absence of expressed statutory provisions and expressed statutory rights seems to be not on, as it were.</P>
      <P>I should like to have the Minister's views on this.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the right of an accused to have counsel and solicitor from the South, assuming that the commission is in the North, is guaranteed.  He is given the right to be represented by counsel or solicitor in <Col N="580" /> the proceedings, the proceedings in question being before a commission and not before a court.  I am advised that, as drafted, it ensures that the counsel or solicitor does not necessarily have to be a person practising or living within the jurisdiction where the commission is being held because the commission is not a court as such.  Consequently, as drafted, the paragraph to the Schedule to which Deputy Collins referred gives an accused the right to have counsel or solicitor from this jurisdiction.  That has been clarified to my satisfaction and that is the interpretation that is put on it in the other jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>There may be a lot of ancient anachronistic restrictions which might make this difficult, but it seems very desirable that, as the Minister has presented this Bill to us, it is reciprocal in every possible detail. In this rather important detail it is not reciprocal.  The Minister will note that we did not take any issue on section 14.  Where a particular accused persons opts for trial in Northern Ireland, he could well have a preference for a particular solicitor or a particular counsel.  As the Minister knows there are a number of counsel and solicitors in Dublin who specialise in defending in the broadest sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That sort of case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  They discharge a great obligation in doing so.  Otherwise our system would break down; people would be motivated by their own personal prejudice. If their choice would be that a particular solicitor instructing a particular counsel would defend them in the proceedings in Northern Ireland, I cannot see why it could not be reasonably arranged that they could be so allowed, particularly in so far as <Col N="581" /> a person from the other side being charged here can express such a choice in favour of his solicitor and his counsel.  If we are going to be reciprocal in this legislation, then let us be reciprocal in every possible way. If section 14 is to operate, the immediate consequence of that should be that the person who has instructed his solicitor or counsel here should be allowed to retain them.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, a certain degree of confidence and trust grows up in pre-trial consultations, and so on, between the person who is being charged and those who professionally represent him.  That cannot start to be developed again in a totally new environment in the North of Ireland. I welcome the provisions in section 16 of our Bill.  I welcome the fact that barristers or solicitors from the North of Ireland, in relation to these offences, can have the full right of audience in our courts the same as their colleagues from the South.  I welcome that whole-heartedly.  That is all we are concerned about here.</P>
      <P>What difficulties or objections has the Minister met from the other side in according the same facility to a person from our professional groups representing people there?  If I were engaged on behalf of somebody and I felt I owed it to him professionally to defend him to the best of my ability, with the fullest of my attention, I would want to defend him wherever I could.  As the Minister knows, it is not my function to come to a decision as to a person's innocence or guilt. Perhaps the Minister could tell us a little more about the problems he met in failing to get this reciprocal facility for solicitors and barristers in the South in defending people in the North as is being provided for their colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The right to audience was written into this Bill in recognition of our general policy here that there should be as much movement as possible between the two communities North and South, and that thereby barriers would be broken down and that, if we were serious about having <Col N="582" /> an all-Ireland dimension, notwithstanding what might be lacking in the other Bill, we could not have our Bill not giving this right of audience which we think is desirable.  It has not been reciprocated.  I must say I regret it was not possible to have it reciprocated.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Kennedy will agree that the need for reciprocation will almost certainly never arise.  In theory under section 14 I suppose it could arise, but we have to debate the Bill in the context of reality.  The reality is that, if a person has an option, and if he is the type of person who cannot be defended except by the lawyers who specialise, it is extremely unlikely&mdash;indeed, it passes comprehension&mdash;that such a person would opt to go for his trial to the other jurisdiction. In reality I think it will not arise. As I say, that is the argument looking at the reality, but it does not exclude the theoretical position that it might arise.</P>
      <P>I regret that reciprocation in this regard has not been given.  It is available for the commission, but not for an actual trial.  One reason is the fact that solicitors here have audience in all courts.  In Northern Ireland their right of audience is still confined to the lower courts.  That is one point which was put to me.  A second point, which may not be as relevant now as it was when the Bills were being constructed, is with regard to&mdash;I do not know what the expression is&mdash;mutual calls or exchange of calls.  There may be developments on that front shortly which would, in practice, ensure that there would be reciprocation.  There was, perhaps, an element here of the professional bodies rather than the executive authority of the two States being involved.  As Deputy O'Kennedy knows, these bodies are autonomous and they are quite jealous of their privileged position.  There are certain considerations in that regard as to why reciprocation was not offered.</P>

      <P>No.  There is another professional legal body in a privileged position here and there and, while there would be executive good will for <Col N="583" /> full reciprocation, it was felt that until such time as the professional bodies were in agreement with it, it might not be apt to legislate for it.

      <P>In the event of a member of the Northern Ireland Bar being called to the Bar here, the provisions of this Bill do not have to take effect.  He would be entitled to practise as a member of the Bar.  It is important to distinguish between what happens in relation to those who have been called to the Bar here.  This enables them to practise in any event in the courts here.  I welcome that development to a very considerable extent.  There have been some very distinguished people, even in the recent list, who in one sense did us the honour of being called to the Bar in the South.  Like the Minister, I welcome this trend.  I do not want to name names.  These names are well known, or some of them in any event.</P>
      <P>It has to be put on record that if this facility is there for members of the Northern Bar to be called to the Bar here, it is regrettable that it is not available <i>vice versa.</i> We might as well state some facts.  We have to question, why not?</P>

To the extent that I have not got long to wait, we are getting some good news today on a couple of matters from the Minister.  The Taoiseach is not inclined to give any information. There was the famous occasion when the Taoiseach unburdened his soul to the Minister about the contraception debate and how he intended to vote on that occasion.

If we are anxious to co-operate, and communicate, and give the right of establishment, to use the European term, there can be no justifiable objection to according a similar provision <i>vice versa.</i></P>

We can try to knock down barriers&mdash;and I welcome each barrier that is knocked &mdash;but we must recognise that this does not mean we should not deplore the fact that barriers are not being knocked at the same time, and at the same rate, and with the same enthusiasm, by those in the North of Ireland. We must regret that.</P>
      <P>If what the Minister anticipates is correct, this section will not be necessary. When the Minister said it almost passes comprehension that the provisions of section 14 would be called into operation&mdash;a good deal of this Bill passes comprehension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In other words, the section sets out that the names can be given to the court, its officers, the parties, their counsel and solicitors and, provided the court considers it is in the interests of justice, to any other person.  It will be for the court to decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Here again one of the fundamental principles in the procedures of our courts, that the law will be administered in public and that the people will have the right to free, open and public trial, has to be compromised because of the nature of the procedures being introduced.  Anybody can understand the practical reasons for refusing to disclose the names of witnesses but this is one of those provisions which I regret has to be introduced into our law.  One of the great guarantees of our criminal law is that cases under that law are heard in open court in the interest of the defendant and so that the public can see that justice is being properly administered.  The newspapers can report on such cases to the public.  There are stringent regulations <Col N="586" /> which operate on reporting cases. Such reporting must be limited to the detail of the case, as distinct from comment on it, and the fact that any matter that might be <i>sub judice</i> cannot be reported pending a judgement.</P>
      <P>This is all long established, the relationship of the accused to the court, to the public and the relationship of each of these to the press through whom the public will become aware of what is happening.  Now we have to undermine all that; we have to set that at nought.  I can see the practical reason, but it only confirms the objections we have to this procedure. The Minister must have a great degree of reluctance when he sees all the anomalies as they turn up on this Bill, anomalies that are new to our law and which will, in the final analysis, make this unworkable and, in many ways, very undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share with Deputy O'Kennedy his regret for the situation that gives rise to this Bill but I do not share his regret for the Bill because the provisions in it are good and appropriate to the times that we are in.  I share the Deputy's regret that the situation is such that a Bill of this type is necessary.  The Deputy's sentiments are impeccable when he says he would like to see a situation where justice could be fairly and openly administered.  We would all like to see that but would justice be fairly and openly administered if a person who was prepared to give evidence found his life in danger or lost his life by reason of publicity attending the giving of evidence by him?  That is a live possibility.  Witnesses have been murdered.  I can recall the horrific case of the bus driver in Belfast who witnessed the hijacking of his bus. Because he happened to be the bus driver he was in a position to identify the hijackers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That happened in the North but can the Minister recall cases that happened here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the case I referred to happened in the North but that witness was shot down in front of his wife and children at his <Col N="587" /> own hearth because he was in a position to say who hijacked the bus, a serious offence but not serious in comparison with others.  We are debating this Bill in an all-Ireland context and this Bill seeks to provide for the trial down here of offences committed in the North, and, presumably, the witnesses will be from the North in regard to actions committed in the North.  In theory, there would be witnesses who would be in the same position as that unfortunate man.  That is why we have to face up to the fact that we are not debating the Bill in the context of normal times but rather in the context of abnormal and horrendous times.</P>
      <P>In the Bill we must take power to protect witnesses or otherwise justice would come to a standstill.  It is a proper provision to have in the Bill.  It is not novel in our system in so far as we have in the Special Criminal Court Rules a provision that the court may direct that the name and address or any part of the evidence of a witness not be published.  That goes further than what is in the Bill.  Indeed, it is possible because of the provision of that rule that it might not be necessary to have it in the Bill.  While I agree Deputy O'Kennedy's sentiments are impeccable and in normal times are what should be in a Bill&mdash;a provision like this in a normal Bill would not be acceptable to me either&mdash;we cannot debate this Bill out of the context of the present time.  That context requires that witnesses be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding, I said I recognised the practical need for a provision of this nature having regard to the unusual times that are in it.  I pointed to it as being another indication of the fact that so much that is new and unwelcome in a normal time is now having to be imported into our law in this Bill.  I would vie fiercely with the Minister in my determination to deal with people of this nature.  It is our obligation.  I believe any Minister charged with this obligation will show the same determination, may be not so <Col N="588" /> much publicised&mdash;I am not speaking of the Minister in this regard.  A Fianna Fáil Government would do just that.  I feel the same determination and I agree with the Minister that this has to be done.  However, after all of that this type of Bill and this provision underline the things we have to do to our law to give effect to procedures proposed in the Bill.  We proposed alternatives and they were unacceptable so that we have to work this one as best we can.  In so far as we are doing that I accept that section 17 is necessary.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 18.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 18 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There may have been some misunderstanding about section 18.  Prior to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, in preliminary proceedings in the District Court there was a procedure whereby the evidence of the prosecution was taken on oral deposition. This was an extremely tedious procedure.  What happened in practice was that each prosecution witness was called, his evidence was given by him verbally and written down, in longhand, by the District Court clerk before being signed by the witness.  It was a most tedious procedure.  If cross-examination took place at that stage&mdash; this was most unusual&mdash;the answers were written down in longhand.  It meant an abnormal use of the time of the District Court and it was a procedure that was of no benefit to the parties, prosecutor or defendants.  There was general consensus that is should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change was made in the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  It provided that this preliminary examination could be conducted by means of documents served beforehand on the accused.  Those documents were handed to the district justice and he decided on foot of those documents whether there was a <i>prima facie</i> case. Instead of the witness going into the witness box and having his evidence written down verbally, the evidence that was available was typed out by <Col N="589" /> way of statements and was handed to the accused, his lawyers and the district justice.  When the district justice considered it he could hear any submissions that might be made by the defendant as to whether there was a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <P>In the 1967 Act the right was preserved for an accused to insist on an oral deposition if he wanted.  That is sometimes availed of, but not very often.  It might be availed of where defending counsel thought that, if a witness had to go to the court twice, he might change his feet on the second run.  The procedure is only occasionally availed of.</P>
    <P>What the section did not provide for was that, if the witness is outside the jurisdiction and is not reasonably available, his verbal evidence be dispensed with.  Consequently, there was a gap in the 1967 Act.  This amendment seeks to close that gap not merely in relation to proceedings under the Act but in regard to criminal proceedings generally.  In the case of a preliminary hearing, should the witness be outside the country his unavailability to give verbal evidence will not invalidate the trial or the preliminary proceedings.  His written documentary evidence will be available. Should he maintain his absence for the purpose of the substantive trial, and if his evidence is critical to the prosecution's case, of course the case must fall and there will be no injustice done to the defendant.  However, to ensure that advantage will not be taken of this loophole at the preliminary stage this amendment is being introduced now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that a situation could arise at a preliminary hearing where a person could be examined by way of sworn deposition&mdash;it is not as unusual as the Minister has suggested.  The defence counsel, solicitor and the defendant have one opportunity of watching his demeanour and to some extent seeing if the person is wrong-footing himself by comparison with his subsequent evidence.  They have one opportunity to do this at the preliminary investigation. Subsequently at the trial in <Col N="590" /> normal procedures&mdash;to use the Minister's phrase&mdash;the witness appears again.  In many cases he appears twice and is examined twice.  To a real extent that was the intention behind section 7 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>In this case, as distinct from the normal procedure, we can have a situation where a witness does not appear at the preliminary hearing and, secondly, he can have his evidence taken on commission in the North of Ireland and will not appear at the trial.  The accused may never see the witness.  We could have a situation that is in striking contrast with our law where a person is available physically at the preliminary examination and at the trial.  Under this procedure if it appears to the district justice that a person is outside the State or where it is not reasonably practical to secure his attendance, he can dispense with him under section 18.  The district justice can make that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but I have been concentrating on the physical presence.  A person who cannot be produced here at the preliminary examination to enable him to be tested, which is the purpose of that section in the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, can absent himself from the trial.  He can give evidence on commission in the North of Ireland and a document is sent down here, certified by the commissioner in the North and probably counter-certified by the judges who sit as observers. That is the extent of the evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must accept that is a major change from anything in our law and it is a most undesirable change.  It is not just a question, as the Minister seemed to imply, of curing what was not in the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  The Minister knows that if a person was not available normally to give evidence in a normal criminal case here for an offence committed here, the answer was that his evidence was not available anyway, that if one were depending <Col N="591" /> on his evidence to have someone charged and convicted, the DPP or the counsel representing him would decide to drop the prosecution because there would be nothing to go on.  Here we have the manufactured position where there is nobody to go on, where the only thing available is a document.</P>
    <P>This is a very undesirable novelty. What we are trying to do here is to turn the system topsy-turvy and, even more important, it is not according to an accused what we have always endeavoured to accord, namely, a full proper trial with every known protection and guarantee.  One such guarantee is that the witnesses attend. Up to now we guarantee that if necessary they attend twice but under this Bill it could happen that they would not attend at all.  That is some change and one that we will regret.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that they would not attend.  Under the procedures of this Bill their attendance may be by way of commission, but that is vastly different from saying they do not attend at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is connected with the trial.  Deputy O'Kennedy has interpreted this section as if it is going to be part of the procedure of the Special Criminal Court whereas the contrary is the case.  The preliminary hearings that are part of normal criminal trials do not, except in very rare circumstances, occur where the trial is before the Special Criminal Court, because the person goes directly to the Special Criminal Court, obviating the need for this preliminary hearing, on the Attorney General's certificate or if it is an offence scheduled under the Act constituting the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure we are discussing here does not normally come into the picture in cases coming before the Special Criminal Court, and extra-territorial offences will be Special Criminal Court offences and will go directly to that court.  It is the preliminary investigation in the District Court we are talking about on this section <Col N="592" /> and this section has not been introduced to deal merely with this particular Bill and the new regime, but with the law in regard to proceedings in respect of all criminal offences.  It will not apply to offences coming before the Special Criminal Court except on very rare occasions.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of anything that has happened in the last few years in that way.  There is power in the Attorney General to avoid this preliminary deposition procedure and to send the accused directly for trial to the Special Criminal Court.  There is no question of a double appearance of the defendant arising.</P>
    <P>This amendment is meant to deal with the preliminary procedure in regard to ordinary criminal trials.  In such cases there is a preliminary hearing in the District Court which can be on oral or written depositions and this provides that, if there is a call for oral depositions and the witness is not available because he is outside the State and it is not reasonably practicable to have his attendance, the preliminary proceedings can proceed notwithstanding. The case can then go before judge and jury and if at that stage the witness is still missing and there is a gap in the prosecution case, and if that gap appears to be fatal, a <i>nolle</i> can be entered.  The fact that the preliminary hearing takes place without the physical presence of the witness does not do any injustice to the defendant.  What takes place in the District Court is preliminary only, to see if there is a <i>prima facie</i> case. Supposing that the missing witness is critical to the prosecution or if his written evidence is inadequate to support a <i>prima facie</i> case, then the matter will be dismissed at District Court level.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the ordinary criminal procedure does not apply to Special Criminal Court offences. Accused persons go directly to the Special Criminal Court without preliminary procedure and the trial will not be vitiated because a witness is not available to give evidence orally at the preliminary hearing.  However, if he continues to be absent at the later hearing the case falls.</P>

      <P>Accepting it does not apply in regard to the Special Criminal Court, the Minister will appreciate that sections 17 and 19 relate almost exclusively to extra-territorial procedures and this seems to have that in mind.  In most of these cases there would not be a preliminary hearing in any case, and the procedure before the Special Criminal Court would not operate in that way.  However, on reading the section it appears the district justice would have to be satisfied on two counts: (a), the person is outside the State, and (b), it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance before the justice.  Then, on what evidence is the justice to be satisfied, first of all, that the person is outside the State?  Would a certificate be presented, would evidence be given or would a member of the Garda say, &ldquo;We are satisfied he is outside the State&rdquo;?  Would the justice have to be satisfied on both counts of the person being outside the State and of it not being practicable to secure his attendance?</P>

      <P>In practice there would not need to be evidence if it appears to the district justice that the person is outside the State and that it is not practicable to secure his attendance.  Both conditions have to be satisfied.  In practice this would be a prosecution witness, a witness the defendant had asked the prosecution to produce, and the prosecution would have to come to the court and say, &ldquo;I am sorry, this witness is outside the jurisdiction and it is not practicable for us to have him here&rdquo;.  If it so appears to the justice that his absence does not prejudice the preliminary proceedings, I think an averment by the prosecution authorities, having regard to the onus on them to see that justice is done before the court, might make it appear to the district justice that the witness is outside the jurisdiction and could not practicably be produced. If on foot of the averment by the State it appeared to the district justice that the presence of the witness could not be secured, that would be the end of it.</P>

      <P>The Minister will see that the wording of the section is <Col N="594" /> that a simple averment by the prosecuting counsel would make it appear to the district justice that the person was outside the jurisdiction, but does not that seem to be going very far?

      <P>It is not an averment prosecuting counsel would make lightly.  He would make it only when satisfied of the true position.  The defendant, having asked for the witness, would probably know of his whereabouts, and if it was known that he was in the State, prosecuting counsel could be contradicted there and then.  If it appeared to the district justice that the witness was not outside the State a new situation would arise. There might be information available to the Garda which would be passed to a prosecuting counsel which in turn would be passed to the court and an averment would be made conscientiously and <i>bona fide.</i> If the defence could show that it might have been made otherwise the district justice would be entitled to say that it did not appear to him that the person was outside the State.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section also has given rise to some misunderstanding. It was argued that it gave very, very wide powers of arrest without warrant, some sort of new and draconian powers.  That is not so.  In all but a very few cases powers of arrest exist in respect of the corresponding offences committed within this State. What this Bill is doing is creating new offences.  The acts comprising these offences are not new.  They are already well known to our criminal law but, technically speaking, these are new offences because acts outside our jurisdiction are being made offences against our law.  Legally then they are new offences.</P>
      <P>These same acts committed within the State are part of the criminal law here and have been for quite some time and powers of arrest already exist in regard to them.  In most cases these powers of arrest without warrant exist by virtue of the common law because the offences are felonies.  In a few cases the powers of arrest are conferred by the statue creating the offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not provide that these new offences, committed extra-territorially in Northern Ireland, are to be felonies and, if we did not have this section, it would not be possible to arrest for these acts without a warrant. If, for example, a person suspected of committing a murder in Northern Ireland were seen in this State it should be possible to arrest him or her without first getting a warrant and, unless we take this power in this section, it would not be possible because the offence <Col N="596" /> would not be a felony.  Murder committed within the State would be a felony and the old common law power of arrest without warrant would apply.</P>
    <P>As I said in my Second Reading speech on 20th November, 1975, at column 1702 of Volume 285 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Section 19 confers powers of arrest without warrant in connection with an extra-territorial offence. These powers correspond to the present common law powers of arrest in respect of felonies, and they are given by the Bill because the offences in question are not being made felonies.  If, as I hope, provision is made by legislation here abolishing the distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours in the case of offences generally, these are the powers which I should expect to see conferred by the legislation in consequence of the abolition.</P>
    <P>If, at some future date, this old distinction between felonies and misdemeanours is abolished, and I think it should be because it is anachronistic and leads to anomalous situations, certainly the measure abolishing it will have to include powers analogous to the powers now in section 19, namely, powers to arrest without warrant for these types of offences.  Section 19 seen in that context then is clearly not to be seen as anything draconian but as a reasonable consequence of the legal innovation this Bill devises.  As the laws stand, most acts which are deemed extra-territorial by section 2, if committed within this State, would be felonies and the person committing them could be arrested without a warrant. The acts committed in Northern Ireland carry the same consequence of arrest without a warrant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The House and the Minister should be extremely slow before extending the unfettered right of arrest without warrant.  Apart from anything else this section imposes certain obligations on the Garda in relation to searching and it would be of interest to know whether or not the Minister obtained the views of the Garda Síochána before the section was drafted.  I am not altogether sure <Col N="597" /> that the additional powers given to the Garda are powers they were looking for or would necessarily want.  I would like the Minister to clarify for me whether or not a member of the Garda Síochána can now enter any building, institution or house and arrest a person under sections 2 and 3 without a warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to subsection (5), which provides:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of arresting a person under any power conferred by this section a member of the Garda Síochána may enter (if need be, by force) and search any place where that person is or where the member, with reasonable cause, suspects him to be.</P>
      <P>If a garda has reasonable cause to suspect an offence has been committed under section 2 or section 3 he can enter a house without warrant and search that house.  It is not quite correct to say these are new powers given to the Garda.  They already have these powers.  Every citizen has the power of arrest under common law where criminal acts are committed within the State.  If we had put another subsection in section 2 saying that &ldquo;all offences under this section shall be felonies&rdquo; there would be no need for section 19 because the common law power to arrest would follow and there would not be a word of criticism.  We did not put that into section 2 because the movement is towards abolishing the distinction between misdemeanours and felonies, but that does not mean we should also move to remove the old common law right of arrest without warrant because the nature of the crime is so serious there must be power for gardaí and citizens to arrest without warrant.  If there were not, grave harm and mischief could ensue to individual members of the community or to the community itself. Far from giving extra power to the Garda this merely restates in statutory form powers they have always had.</P>

      <P>The Minister must agree with me that a farcical situation can develop under this section of the <Col N="598" /> Bill.  If an ordinary lay person, say, Deputy Brugha or I, can go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Under sections 2 and 3 of this Bill we are coming into your house, we are looking for somebody, we will arrest you&rdquo; is this not far fetched?  Is it not impractical? Does it not show there is something wrong?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What power has the ordinary layman got?  Section 19 (1) provides that any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing an offence under section 2 (1).  If Deputy Brugha or I, being law-abiding citizens, meet the Minister in any part of County Longford or County Westmeath and say to him: &ldquo;Come along with us&rdquo; have we any power to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies must suspect me of being in the act of committing an offence under section 2 (1). If, subsequently in the court, I sue the Deputy for unlawful arrest and false imprisonment I will succeed in getting substantial damages against the Deputies unless they can show they had reasonable grounds for what they did.  The common law power is not untramelled in the sense that it can be exercised viciously or vindictively. It is a power which can only be exercised when the person exercising it has reasonable cause to suspect. That is a matter for the person's own judgement at the time.  The Deputy may say that people will be conservative in the exercise of that judgment. It would be only right they would be conservative because it could be a pretty draconian power if not so tramelled.  There is a proper obligation binding on the person who proposes to exercise the power to exercise it reasonably.  He can only do that when he has a suspicion.  It would have to be a reasonable suspicion.  The court would not hold that a mere flight of fancy or some particular piece of bias would be a <Col N="599" /> suspicion within the meaning of this particular power.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins and Deputy Brugha, if they decided to exercise such a power, would leave themselves open to the consequences I mentioned. What is said in section 19 (1) is merely restating in statutory form what is the present position with regard to a felony when it is committed within this jurisdiction.  I concede that the situation where the power which is given under section 19 (1) would be exercisable would be extremely rare. In practice, it would boil down to the ordinary citizen actually observing a felony about to be committed or in the course of commission.  When one bears in mind that we are dealing with extra-territorial acts here it is unlikely that two citizens here would see such an action taking place because the substantive act would take place in the other jurisdiction.  They might see, or become aware of, here the preparation for a crime to be committed on the other side.  For example, the preliminaries to cause an explosion would be an offence under section 2.  It is possible that that could be an arrestable offence or the type of offence that could reasonably be expected to come within the ambit of section 19 (1).</P>

      <P>This would be a wonderful section on which to discuss suppositions for the remainder of the evening.  However, I do not propose to use the section for that purpose.  As an ordinary layman, I feel that the power of arrest given to the ordinary person or, indeed, the power of arrest under warrant given to members of the Garda Síochána is very wide and is something that instinct tells me we should be very careful of.  If two people decide to arrest somebody whom they believe can be arrested under section 19 (1), can the Minister say how far they can go in arresting a person?  If under section 19 (1), as an ordinary citizen, I arrest a person what happens if that person offers resistance?  Can I forcibly bring that person in?  What happens to me if I get injured in the process, have a permanent injury, loss of a limb or some disability?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins has raised three issues.  He asks if he can arrest, how does he do it and what are the consequences for him?  The answer to the first question is that he can arrest a person.  All the Deputy needs to do before he arrests a person is have a reasonable suspicion that that person has committed an offence under section 2 (1) or section 3.  He can also arrest him if he has a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the act of committing an offence under section 2 (1).  We are speaking of extra-territorial offences.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins or any citizen has a similar right already under common law in regard to similar acts committed within this jurisdiction.  That right is already there and has always been there.  By section 19 we are extending it to acts committed outside the jurisdiction. Deputy Collins can exercise that right provided he reasonably suspects that the crime has been committed by that person or reasonably suspects that that person is in the act of committing an offence&mdash;that is, under section 2 (1).  Those rights are given under section 19, subsections (1) and (2), which deal with the rights of the ordinary citizen which <i>a fortiori</i> include members of the Garda.  The Garda get extra power later on in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 19, subsections (1) and (2), the position of the ordinary citizen is dealt with.  If the ordinary citizen has reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence is being committed under section 2 (1) of this Bill or that a person has committed an offence under section 2 (1) or section 3, he may then arrest without warrant.  There is no doubt that the answer to the first question is that if Deputy Collins has reasonable suspicion he is entitled, by virtue of this section, to arrest the person. How he arrests the person is a matter of the practicality of the situation that he meets.  He is entitled to use a reasonable amount of force to restrain that person and bring him to a lawful place of detention.  How much force he can use will depend on his physical size <i>vis-à-vis</i> the size of the person he proposes to arrest.  This is a matter of common sense and what is <Col N="601" /> feasible in the situation.  He is legally entitled to use an appropriate amount of force to arrest the person concerned.</P>
    <P>The third question asked by Deputy Collins is what happens him if he gets injured.  That is not a question he should ask because a brave citizen going to carry out his duty will not be deterred or will not even take such a matter into consideration.  However, it is a highly practical question.  Until recently nothing could happen and Deputy Collins would have to suffer his injury.  Since we introduced in 1974 the scheme for compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted Deputy Collins, like any other citizen who would be criminally injured, would be entitled to claim from the State compensation for injuries he might receive in the very commendable act of arresting a person for an offence under section 2 or 3 pursuant to the powers given under section 19, subsections (1) and (2).  I want to emphasise that the powers given in this section are not new powers.  They are restating in statutory form the common law powers which exist already and always have existed.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on subsection (2) of the section. The Supreme Court has laid down that bail is an absolute right.  At present under the 1967 Criminal Procedure Act in very serious cases bail can only be granted by the High Court.  It seems to me to try to limit the granting of bail to cases where the Attorney General's consent is required and this may not be in accordance with the law as to bails laid down in Callaghan's case.  It seems that the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act are more desirable, namely, in very serious cases the right or power to grant bail is to be confined to the High Court and cannot be dealt with at a lower court level, whether the Special Criminal Court or a District Court.  It seems to be unnecessary and undesirable and possibly contrary to Supreme Court rulings in regard to bail to require the consent of the Attorney General before bail can be granted.  The Minister might deal with that matter briefly.</P>

      <P>I do not think the section could be interpreted as Deputy Collins has set out.  The section says:</P>
      <P>Where a person is charged with an offence under section 2 or 3, no further proceedings in the matter except such remand or remands in custody or on bail as the court may think necessary shall be taken except by or with the consent of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this means is that the Attorney General is the person who determines when the trial is to take place and that no further proceedings can take place without his consent other than such remand or remands in custody or on bail as the court may think necessary. The consent of the Attorney General obviously is not relevant to the question of whether there is a bail application or not.  That is the accused's right. Obviously, the Attorney General's view on whether there should be bail or not is something that he is entitled to make known to the court but he cannot in any way block the right of <Col N="605" /> the accused to apply for bail.  That is not what the section says or purports to say because as the Deputy points out, it could be a matter concerning the Constitution, having regard to judicial decisions already made.  It cannot be open to that interpretation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 45 and 46, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister for Justice shall not make an order under subsection (2) of this section until either (a) the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe have made a decision under article 32 of the European Convention on Human Rights on the Report of the European Commission of <Col N="609" /> Human Rights on the case of Ireland against the United Kingdom brought in December 1971, or (b) that case has been decided by the European Court of Human Rights.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that this amendment speaks for itself but I suppose the Minister, who during the course of the debate was not even prepared to accept the advice of his own Coalition colleagues that there should be a 12-month time limit on the operations of this Bill in the first instance, is extremely unlikely to accept my amendment at this stage.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not likely to appeal to the Minister because of the views expressed in this House in relation to the case brought to Strasbourg. The Minister is on record at column 579, Volume 287, of the Official Report of 28th January, 1976, as saying that this happened five years ago, compensation has been paid and we should not go overboard about it. At column 540 of the same volume in answer to Deputy O'Kennedy he stated that the acts complained of occurred over five years ago, people had been compensated in the ordinary course and the Convention was the reason compensation had been paid and redress got.  The Convention has been found adequate to provide protection.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is very wrong for the Minister to regard compensation paid to victims of the most vicious assaults as an adequate answer.  The Strasbourg case was not brought to get compensation for those people, but to ensure that the United Kingdom would secure for everyone in Northern Ireland the rights and freedoms guaranteed to them by the Convention and to make sure that the responsibilities the United Kingdom undertook when she ratified the Convention, would be observed by her in Northern Ireland.  Compensation had nothing to do with the case and it is a sad reflection that the Minister for Justice should regard the payment of money as an answer to anyone who makes substantiated allegations against the security forces.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on the last occasion <Col N="610" /> we discussed this Bill, of all the cases referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions over a certain period of time scarcely one person who was a member of the RUC or the British Army has been successfully prosecuted. Surely this is the correct sanction for a Government allegedly interested in human rights to apply, namely, the suspension or removal from the police force of persons against whom these allegations have been made and proved in the courts, if one is to gauge by the large sums of money paid in individual cases.  Instead, the United Kingdom Government are seeking to buy themselves out of trouble by agreed awards of damages.  This Government seem to be prepared to go along with that proposition.</P>
    <P>When speaking on section 4 I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that the section was a vivid example of how much the operations of this Bill, if enacted, would depend on the integrity and <i>bona fides</i> of the RUC and the Northern Ireland Special Branch. On that occasion I instanced that one of the differences between the Minister and myself was that he was prepared to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the RUC and the Northern Ireland Special Branch until the contrary had been proved, whereas I would change the onus and accept <i>mala fides</i> until the contrary had been proved.  Whichever of us is right, I believe that ultimately it is on their integrity and <i>bona fides</i> rather than on the <i>bona fides</i> of our judges or legal advisers that the honest operation of this Bill depends, and I believe that this will be contained in the report of the Strasbourg case.</P>
    <P>We now know that the Government have that report because the Government Information Services issued a statement to that effect.  The existence or otherwise of the report was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle on the advice of the Department of the Taoiseach when the question was asked by our leader, Deputy J. Lynch. We must be quite clear about what the report may prove or disprove.  Allegations of the most serious nature have been made against the RUC and the Northern Ireland Special Branch.  We know from various Press releases issued by the European Commission <Col N="611" /> that a great number of witnesses, both Irish and English, have been heard by the Commission.  In that report, there must be a finding as to whether these allegations are substantiated or not.  If they are not, it may well be that the Minister is right to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the RUC and the Northern Ireland Special Branch.  If they are substantiated and if these people are guilty of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, and if the allegations about people who have received large sums of money from the United Kingdom Government in settlement of civil claims have been found by the Commission to be substantiated, and if it appears that people who perpetrated these physical abuses on people in their custody are still holding office and rank in the police force in Northern Ireland, then my proposition is correct and it is the <i>mala fides</i> of these people we should accept until the contrary is proved.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Government know the answer because they have the report and must know what is in it.  I fully understand and accept that the Government are not entitled to publish this report at the moment.  In the context of this Bill, I believe the public are entitled to know the findings of the Commission before this Bill comes into operation.  Probably the only way the people will know is for the Government to take a decision to send the report to the European Court of Human Rights.  When the case has been referred by the Government to the court, as distinct from the Committee of Ministers, the report may be published.</P>

      <P>The point is that, as far as this Bill is concerned, we are looking to the future.  We are looking to the future to use this Bill to end the scandal of the fugitive offender. I have dealt at great length, on the various sections, with the guarantees, the protections and the assurances available to me administratively and <Col N="613" /> by virtue of the sovereignty of this Parliament to ensure that the apprehensions raised by Deputies on the other side of the House will not be realised.  I am satisfied that the protective measures which are available will be adequate to ensure that the like complained about to Strasbourg will never happen again.  It is relevant to point out&mdash;and we cannot close our eyes to this fact&mdash;that we are five years on.  Part of the trouble of this nation is that we can never forget our wrongs.  We have to debate this Bill in the context of 1976 and in the context of the times ahead to ensure that this scandal of the fugitive offender is removed with all the ill consequences that scandal brings for this island.</P>
      <P>I should not like to be quoted as saying that the mere payment of compensation is adequate recompense.  I made that statement in the context of saying we must have a balanced view on this point.  From the point of view of an injured party, payment of adequate and, indeed, substantial compensation is a very real gesture. He might not thank you for a finding by a European court.  He might regard an award of damages as being much more practical.  I would not denigrate it or run down the discharge of this obligation in the way Deputy Collins has done.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any point to be served in accepting this amendment. I give Deputy Collins no marks for guessing that might be my view. It is my view very firmly.  This Bill has to be passed into law and has to be operated as soon as possible.  We have a duty to ensure that this jurisdiction is not availed of as a sanctuary by people who are allegedly guilty of the most heinous crimes against fellow-Irishmen in the other part of this island.  It is no answer to say the security forces in that other part may be suspect, or were suspect, or were guilty in the past.  That is not an answer justifying refusing co-operation now and in the future.  We have to ensure that co-operation is with forces whose <i>bona fides</i> henceforth is without suspicion and without cloud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures and <Col N="614" /> protections and assurances available to me, and available by virtue of the machinery of this Bill, will be adequate to protect persons from an excess of process by any of these forces. Quite frankly, I do not anticipate that any such will occur, but should any such occur, there is ample means to deal with them and ample means to prevent them.  I do not think there is any need for this amendment.  It is a contentious amendment and, in the delicate times we are living in at the moment, it is an ill-judged amendment.</P>

The law and order boys think we could not be trusted, but I regard that approach as an insult to our integrity. Shortly we will be in a position to prove we are more reliable than the Government who make such a virtue of it.</P>
      <P>I want to put some historic facts on the record.  The Minister for Finance has always been known to be a person who gave tongue fairly freely and without much responsibility.

In relation to this complaint which is relevant to our amendment, the Government at the time took the decision on the basis of information available to them after some painstaking research.  It takes a considerable time to get the necessary evidence, even the basic evidence, to launch a complaint as serious and as wide-ranging as that was.  It may be easy for a spokesman for the Opposition to give tongue to his views here or elsewhere, but the Government have the responsibility to ensure that what they present to an international Commission to which we have always paid the greatest attention and respect is well-founded and well-documented.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil did just that.  There can be no suggestion that there was any lack of enthusiasm and determination in the way it was approached.  The serious attention being given to it in Strasbourg, the satisfaction many people felt not just in Ireland or England but elsewhere, vindicated the step taken by the Fianna Fáil Government.  It has been proved that they diligently inquired and conscientiously presented the complaint on behalf of people who had not got the authority of this State to back them, and many others who were tortured according to the views presented to us.  We gave the weight of the Government's support to those people before the Commission on Human Rights.  We have been vindicated in so doing, whatever the outcome.  I do not imagine the Government who inherited that had the same enthusiasm for pursuing it as we had for launching it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> I want to put another matter on record.  During our time in Government&mdash;and I am sure during this Government's time in office&mdash;there were representations and persuasions and pressures to drop the case.  In the interests of natural justice, and in the interests of bringing our people together in the true sense of what our rights and obligations were, not blinding ourselves to the reality of torture, Fianna Fáil resisted those pressures.  Be it said to the eternal credit of our leader, he resisted them very effectively and firmly.  Pressures were applied, but to no avail.  It comes badly from the Minister to imply that the previous Government at any stage had to be goaded&mdash; goaded is not too strong a word to use about the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He seems to enjoy the needle very much.  He probably was prodding then as he is now.

      <P>I was present when this complaint was lodged, not that my presence was necessary but I was attending a meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe when it was lodged with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.  I can assure the Minister that it was presented in a most formal and responsible fashion. The response to it from the Council of Europe was equally formal and responsible.  There was no attempt to embarrass anybody, rather that it would be simply presented and the process of the commission would get under way.  For all of this the previous Government were responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The Minister said he is satisfied that what was complained about at Strasbourg will never happen again but, as I said previously, the Minister is too easily satisfied.  I am not saying that nothing has been learned anywhere in the last five years although, unfortunately, there is some evidence still in the North of Ireland&mdash;even as late as today&mdash;that very little has been learned.  We all want to see a situation arising where the representatives of the minority in the North can give their full support to a representative police force, and we want to be able to back it with support from this end.  We want to see that day as zealously as anybody on the other side wants it because we recognise that it is only through a properly constituted police force, with the support and respect of the community they serve, and protect, that we can have the type of peace and security that is needed.  I have used the words, &ldquo;peace and security&rdquo; advisedly, as distinct from the much hackneyed phrase &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; that has been abused in both ends of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot have peace and security without law and order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One can have both but the Minister should recognise that the phrase, &ldquo;law and order&rdquo;, has been used everywhere from Nazi Germany to Alabama in the name of vindicating certain privileged positions over unprivileged positions.  On many occasions it has been the excuse for some terrible deeds done in the name of humanity. I am not saying that the Government have any such intention but they should be careful in the public expression of their zeal for law and order that they do not become over zealous to the point that they forget that the law serves the public and the order can only be guaranteed as long as the public are fully and totally responsive to that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why &ldquo;peace and security&rdquo; in this day and age might not be a more relevant and appropriate term to achieve what we want <Col N="618" /> than the hackneyed phrase, &ldquo;law and order&rdquo;.  The end result we all want to achieve is the same and we only differ in the manner we present our intention.  The Minister asked us if things had changed since Strasbourg five years ago.  Of course, they have changed but not to such a point within the police structures in Northern Ireland. I recognise that the vast majority of the police in Northern Ireland are anxious to carry out their business as a police force but the reality is that within the last couple of years there have been scandals associated with them, weapons were taken from the UDR and losses experienced in different areas.  There were grounds for concern because of the association which appears to exist between the forces of law and order in that part of our country and some para-militaries. Para-military is another euphemism we could do well to rid ourselves of.  An organisation is either lawful or unlawful; its aims are either to be abhorred or not.  They are either a group of murderers or not but para-military in the way it is being used is a little bit of special pleading.  Anything done to create violence, to kill or to maim, should not in any way be lessened by being perpetuated by &ldquo;para-militaries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are such associations and there is reason, minimal though it may be, to have concern about such associations. For instance, there is no reason to be concerned about associations between our Garda and the IRA.  We wish that one could have the same confidence in relation to the police force in Northern Ireland and the UDA, UVF, Red Hand or the Freedom Fighters, but the Minister must recognise that that is not so.  For the sake of the police authority in Northern Ireland, the majority of whom we respect, we should do as is suggested in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that the chairman of the police federation there&mdash;I greatly support his call&mdash;has been presenting the role of the RUC as being that of a civilian police force. He expressed the view that he would like to see eventually an unarmed police force.  This is an encouraging sign, and I feel sure that the vast <Col N="619" /> majority of the serving members of the RUC feel that way, but the fact that the vast majority of them may feel that way does not allow us ignore the fact that there are still grounds for apprehension.</P>
    <P>In our amendment we are seeking to clear the air.  We do not wish to feel vindictive about what may have happened; we have no right to feel vindictive but those who have been injured have such a right.  Those who have been tortured understandably feel vindictive.  It is to be hoped that in the course of time they, in generosity, will learn to forgive, but they have cause to be apprehensive.  The Minister is being a little less than realistic in asking them to forget all that because it occurred five years ago.  If those who were tortured respected the force that tortured them now we would not have to press this amendment. We are not talking about how we feel; we are talking about how the people in the North feel.  If the people of parts of Derry or Belfast feel this distrust it is not for the Minister to tell us that things are changed.  It is those people who have to be won around to respect the police force there.</P>
    <P>The only way to convince those people is by a little honesty.  We must be generous and understanding but we must also be honest.  I do not wish to see us vindicating ourselves over anybody else but I want to see us approach things realistically and honestly. Until such time as we know to what extent those charges were well founded we cannot have that honesty on the part of everybody.  It is sometimes suggested that we should forget all of this.  The Minister went along that line and I would not like it to be thought that we are less forgiving than the Minister or members of the Government.</P>
    <P>We all want to be forgiving and to forget as much as we can but that does not rid us of our responsibility. Throughout the debate on this Bill the Minister has indicated that he relies on guarantees given to him, that if they do not operate the Bill will not <Col N="620" /> operate and that if the first two, three or four persons are badly treated or are beaten nobody else will go up to the North.  That is fine but, as we said, that should not arise.  If we have confidence in these people we should not have doubts about the first two, three or four people.  We should be able to say that our police can confidently and totally co-operate with the police in the North of Ireland without any reservations.  The Minister has no reservations.</P>

      <P>A few days ago ITV or UTV did a long programme on the assassination of the unfortunate Kenneth Lennon.  In the United Kingdom itself there are many people who have grave reservations about the conduct of the police in that case. The reservations may or may not be well founded but they exist.  There have been reservations about special police activities, about assassination squads and so on.  Yet, the Minister has no reservations; I should like to be like that.  The reality of the situation is that there are serious reasons for reservations.  We want to dispel them.  It is not a question of the South being vindicated over the North of Ireland; in fact, the South was not really involved other than the Government taking up the case on behalf of people in the North.  It is not a question of the South asserting itself over the North, it is simply a case of disclosing the full facts so that we may learn from them.  It will enable those who have been wrong to purge their wrong-doing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 45 and 46, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister for Justice shall not make an order under subsection (2) of this section until either (a) the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe have made a decision under article 32 of the European Convention on Human Rights on the Report of the European Commission of Human Rights on the case of Ireland against the United Kingdom brought in December, 1971, or (b) that case has been decided by the European Court of Human Rights.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister said we should forget things but I do not think it is reasonable to say to me that I cannot suggest what is involved in these reports and complaints in relation to the amendment.  If I were to be so limited I would simply talk in terms of time. I am not concerned with the tactics of time; I am concerned with fundamental, substantial issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us he is concerned with the scandal of the fugitive offenders.  It is a scandal and one we are anxious to heal.  The Minister wants to heal it his way and we thought our way was more effective.  There are other scandals and you do not attack one by ignoring the other.  The reality is that the scandal of the conduct of some members of the RUC and the UDR is still there.  We want to see this publicly disclosed and we want the position publicly determined.  When that is done, perhaps everyone can learn from the scandals.  Perhaps those who are charged with responsibilities in relation to the police in Northern Ireland can take certain steps and the majority of the police who are not involved in the scandal will have their names cleared.  At the moment, because of association their names are not cleared.  If there were two or three or even a small minority in our police acting irresponsibly it would not be sufficient to undermine the good name of the Garda Síochána because as a force they have total respect.  We are not talking about individuals; we are <Col N="622" /> talking about a complete force.  While that cancer may be there the problem still exists.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are being asked to involve ourselves with the police authority in Northern Ireland, to surrender people into the custody of police in Northern Ireland, a custody over which we have no control and where we cannot exercise any responsibility or give any guarantees.  I do not see why we cannot wait until we know whether our complaints against that police force, or elements within it, are vindicated. When we know that fully and publicly, we can begin to consider how far we can go in this Bill.  When we know that and when the public in Northern Ireland know it, they can begin to reconsider how much support they can give to the police in the North.  In the final analysis it is not our response to the RUC that is important, any more than the response of people in the North to the Garda Síochána is significant. What is important and significant will be the response in the North, particularly that section that is known as the minority, to the police.  The Minister must recognise that until such time as all the communities in the North, particularly those with a nationalist background, can give their full support to a police force that deserve it we will not have an end to this terrible problem.  Dealing with the symptoms, as we are doing in this Bill, will not eradicate the cause.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the Minister can so easily say that we are five years on and that all has changed.  I wish it had. Perhaps a fair amount is changed but to say all is changed is naive.  Telling it to us is one thing but telling it to those people who are entitled to look to a police force for respect and protection is another matter.  That is the great worry.</P>
    <P>How many of the minority in the North have been pressurised, forced in more ways than one to turn to the IRA for protection when it was denied to them by some of those charged with maintaining law and order?</P>

For the first time the matter has been publicly disclosed to the world.

      <P>I cannot quote the Minister verbatim because the unrevised Official Report is not yet available, but the Minister stated here today that we are five years on, that the trouble with this nation is that we never forgive and forget.  This appears to me to be the first chink in what appears to be the Government's intention of dealing with the torture case against Britain and bringing it to its conclusion.  The <Col N="624" /> Minister obviously shares the view widely held that a number of Ministers in this Government were prepared to abandon the Ireland versus Great Britain case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We can see how this gained currency because the Minister himself is of the view that we are five years on and that the trouble with the nation is we do not forgive and forget. Is it any wonder that a number of Ministers wanted to abandon our case against the UK having regard to the views expressed by the Minister here this afternoon?  Deputy Collins quoted him at length from a statement of the nature of that made here tonight&mdash;let us forgive and forget.  It appears to us that what the Minister means is that the Irish Government will hold on to the report of the Court of Human Rights in the torture case, which we know they have.  There is speculation that the decision contained in that report vindicates the decision of the then Irish Government to take the action they took against the UK, and now we are led to believe the present Government are prepared to accept that the matter has been going on for some five years, that the individuals concerned in the cases brought before the court were compensated, and the corollary of what the Minister has said is &ldquo;Compensate and be damned &mdash;compensate them, give them money and let us get on with this Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in essence, would appear to be what the Minister has in mind and we on this side, as well as many others, have come to the conclusion that this <Col N="625" /> amendment is vital because we believe that the Bill, and section 22 in particular, is another piece of Government window dressing to present the law and order image to the people.  Law and order must be supported from this Chamber and the performance we saw here this evening of the leader of law and order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>The reason why we want to have this amendment accepted by the Government is to ensure that whatever judgments may be made in the context of the operation or otherwise of the Act, should be in the context of the outcome of the torture trial.  It is a totally reasonable proposition which any reasonable person would accept on the basis that when this Bill was to be introduced in the Seanad many months ago we were told by the Minister in the Dáil that it was being introduced in the Seanad because it was a matter of extreme urgency that it be enacted.</P>
      <P>All we are asking the Minister to do is to send the report of the torture case to the European Court of Human Rights.  It should be an easy matter for the Government to do that unless our suspicions are well founded that they will continue to stall the publication of the report in the context of &ldquo;Let us forgive and forget and let us compensate those badly done by&rdquo; by the so called forces of law and order, with whom the Minister proposes to co-operate through the operation of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back to the point made by Deputy O'Kennedy, <Col N="626" /> the amendment deals specifically with the coming into operation of the Bill and the postponement of the publication of the report on the torture case. We have asked that the Minister shall not make an order under subsection (2) until</P>
      <P>either (a) the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe have made a decision under article 32 of the European Convention on Human Rights on the Report of the European Commission of Human Rights on the case of Ireland against the United Kingdom brought in December, 1971, or (b) that case has been decided by the European Court of Human Rights.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What we are asking is that the Bill go into legislative suspension, as it were, until such time as the conditions sought by Deputy Collins's amendment actually arise.  There is a time element in it and that time element depends on when the conditions sought are accepted.  If, however, the Minister finds the amendment acceptable, then the Bill goes into the legislative Limbo.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy quite properly referred to the people from whom the Minister will have certain guarantees, the RUC and the British Army.  Let us take the British Army first.  They operate in the north-eastern part of the country.  That cannot be denied by the Minister.  We were told recently that certain members of the British Army were issued with Press passes. There is the possibility of these individuals actually appearing in this part of the country.  Is that the kind of army with which we want to co-operate?</P>

Over the years the latter have had 100 per cent co-operation from the people in the Twenty-six Counties.  There is no question about that.  They deserve that trust because those constituting the Garda Síochána are men of integrity.  They have never been found wanting in the service of this nation.  Measure that particular standard against the standard where the suggestion at the moment is that the present Inspector General, or whatever his title is, is being removed because of political pressure.  Again, the RUC do not have 100 per cent support of the population of that part of this island they are charged with securing for the time being.  They do not have the support so necessary and fundamental to any law enforcement agency. This is the agency the Minister for Justice of the Republic is prepared to consort with.  We reject this absolutely and we will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has properly said, many of the arguments have already been made and he is no doubt wondering when we will cease repeating them.  These arguments bear repetition.  They need to be repeated over and over again if only to convince the Minister that Deputy Collins's amendment is well worth while.  We have argued our case in the light of <Col N="628" /> Ireland v. the United Kingdom, on the one hand, and also from the point of view of the need to give guarantees, probably outside the Constitution, in the context of this Bill.  We have argued that the European Convention on Human Rights should in the last analysis be the place where an individual or individuals might seek redress.</P>
    <P>This amendment is founded on justice.  To argue that we are trying to give shelter or provide shelter for violent men is unfair and unworthy. The argument is spurious and such motives should not be attributed to us because nothing could be further from the truth.  What we want to enshrine in our legislation is a just concept of what the law should be.  We do not want to give succour to or help people who have debased the coinage of the causes they allegedly represent.</P>

      <P>I have not heard anything in the last two speeches to convince me that there is any need to accept this amendment.  I am well satisfied that the procedures devised and the inherent guarantees which will be given to ensure there will be no abuse are adequate to protect our citizens or others involved in the procedures prescribed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dismisses the amendment by saying all this happened five years ago and it is about time to forget it; compensation has been paid and let us not go overboard about it.  Whether or not the Minister has a short memory he should recognise the weakness in his own argument.  Compensation is not everything.  The Strasbourg case was not brought to get compensation. It was brought to secure for everybody in Northern Ireland certain rights and freedoms guaranteed to them under the convention and to make sure that the undertakings given by the United Kingdom when she ratified this convention would be observed by her in Northern Ireland. The Minister completely misrepresents, perhaps deliberately, the situation when he says compensation is everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said compensation was paid and, because it was paid, he is dismissing the whole matter.  He wants to forget it.  Compensation had nothing to do with the case.  This torture case was not brought for compensation.  It is a frightening reflection that the Government and the Minister for Justice should regard the payment of compensation as a total answer to anyone who makes substantive allegations against the security forces.  This was a case involving torture, whether we like it or not.  It was a case involving assault and inhuman treatment.  The Minister, no matter how he tries to dismiss the importance of this amendment, has during the course of his contribution this evening said that he accepts the <i>bona fides</i> of the RUC and the Special Branch.  I am sorry I cannot accept the same <i>bona fides</i> of the RUC and the Special Branch.</P>

      <P>This Bill can only operate successfully if the people in the Republic can depend on the integrity of the RUC and the Special Branch.  Unless we are 100 per cent sure of the integrity of these people we are going the wrong way about it. I am satisfied that many people are anxiously awaiting to see what is in the report and to know what the findings are.  We are not asking for too much.  We are only asking that this Bill be put &ldquo;on ice&rdquo; for the short period which must elapse before the Government can publicly say what is in the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I want to say.  The Opposition are worried that in the event of the report making findings of ill-treatment and worse against the RUC and the other forces in Northern Ireland that this <Col N="630" /> would be a matter of apprehension for us in regard to the operation of this Bill.  I want to say, without prejudice to what this report may find in this regard, that I am satisfied that no citizen or a person resident in this island, who may be involved with the procedure of this Bill, has any grounds for fear from those forces of any conduct or treatment that can come under the category of ill-treatment or torture.  I am satisfied that any such fears are misplaced and that there is no need for them.  My satisfaction is based on the knowledge that the sanction to ensure that state of affairs is the sovereignty of this Parliament and our ability to cease operating this particular measure.  That is the sanction to ensure that there will be no ill-treatment of any persons affected by this legislation.  I am satisfied that that sovereignty will be respected by the other jurisdiction and that it will never have to be called into force.</P>

      <P>The Minister is satisfied because of the sanction which we as a sovereign Parliament can exercise.  He knows that is nonsense because we cannot exercise any sanction in respect of the people Deputy Collins is talking about.  Let us not get an exaggerated notion of the effect of our sovereignty in so far as it relates to the control of the police in Northern Ireland.  We have another purpose in this amendment.  We want to ensure, so far as we can, that the Government pursue this report to the Court of Human Rights.  We want to be reasonably sure that this will happen.  Our amendment would mean that until such time as the Government had done that this Bill could not come into force.  We have, because the Minister is so easily satisfied, grounds for apprehension about the intention of the Government.  We are living in total ignorance of what they may do, what they have read or what reports are available to them.  We would like to be sure that the Government will pursue this to the Court of Human Rights so that all of us can be satisfied, as the Minister is satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second point the Minister, in a revealing response to Deputy Collins when he was asked about the RUC at the moment, said that he had an open mind.  It is the first time that he disclosed that he has an open mind.  Whatever that means, he is satisfied.  If the Minister were to be asked that question in relation to the Garda Síochána he could not, and would not, reply that he had an open mind.  He would properly say that he is perfectly satisfied. The Minister disclosed the weakness of his position when he said, in reply to Deputy Collins, in relation to the RUC, that he has an open mind.  It is because we think that this is no case for an open mind in their interest or <Col N="632" /> in ours that we want to see this amendment accepted.  If the Minister is satisfied with his open mind, being realistic and not vindictive, may I say we are not so satisfied and could not be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This proves our case from the beginning to the end of this Bill.  The Minister's reply to Deputy Collins about his satisfaction with regard to the integrity of the RUC was: &ldquo;I have an open mind.&rdquo; This has vindicated the opposition of the Fianna Fáil Party to this Bill from section 1 to section 22.  Our stand on the various sections has proved to be correct in the light of the most extraordinary reply the Minister has just given to Deputy Collins.  This reply was developed by Deputy O'Kennedy and it brings me to my feet to copper-fasten what Deputy O'Kennedy said.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an open mind about the RUC and by definition has an open mind about the forces which assist them in the discharge of their duties, mainly the British Army.  The RUC and the British Army are concomitants as far as the security of that part of the island is concerned. They must be seen working together so the operability of this Bill is seen to depend on the Minister's open mind.  Before the Minister brings this Bill into law he must be certain, he must be without doubt, in relation to the people he is dealing with on the other side of this artificial Border, which is the absolute cause of the tragedies which exist in this island at present and, in the future until this Border goes.</P>

      <P>The Minister's open-minded reply, will become as infamous as the Bill before us.  The Minister in reply to Deputy Collins vindicated Deputy Collins's stand on this Bill from beginning to end.  It is a tribute to Deputy Collins that when the Bill has almost gone through the whole legislative process he finally elicits that the Minister has an open mind as regards the people who will be dealing with the implementation of this Bill on the far side of the Border. It is a tribute to Deputy Collins that he could finally prove that he and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party who have been arguing on this side of the House have been right all along.</P>

      <P>Lest there be any misinterpretation of what I said regarding Deputy O'Kennedy's comparison, I have not an open mind about the Garda Síochána because I am in a position to have complete knowledge of the Garda Síochána.  I cannot, nor can anybody in this jurisdiction, have similar knowledge to form a definitive opinion about a police force in another jurisdiction. Consequently, I cannot be definitive and must have an open mind about something which I cannot know intimately.  In the same way, I still have an open mind about the Opposition in regard to certain aspects of this Bill.</P>

We believe that this Bill can only be implemented if the integrity of the RUC, the B Specials, the SAS and all the others can be accepted.  I say no, it cannot.  It is on their integrity and <i>bona fides</i> rather than on the <i>bona fides</i> of our judges or legal advisers that the honest operation of this Bill will depend.</P>

There is no purpose in dragging on the debate further&mdash;we have not dragged it at all; we have submitted our case to the Minister.

I anticipate that they would not take very long, and subject to any question of referral of the Act, I would imagine the order could be made within a matter of six to eight weeks.  However, I would be pretty well speculating as to that, but there would be no reason why there should be any undue delay in making the order.  As I say, there may be the question of referral.

    <P>I move this motion because for the past 12 months or so the animal disease eradication programmes which have been running in this country &mdash;the bovine tuberculosis scheme for 21 years and the brucellosis scheme for about nine years&mdash;have come to a virtual standstill.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, no worthwhile or real attempt has been made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to secure a resumption of disease eradication.  I do not know whether any trade dispute in the recent history of the country has been permitted to drag on for such an extraordinary length of time especially when one considers that there is no necessity whatever for a cessation of bovine tuberculosis testing. As far as I am aware, no dispute whatever exists between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the veterinary profession in regard to bovine TB testing, but since the 16th May last the Minister himself has caused the bovine TB eradication scheme to grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of attempts on the part of the Minister and his colleagues in the Government to seek to ascribe the blame for the recent situation to areas other than where it rightly and properly belongs, that is to say, on the shoulders of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries himself.  In considering these facts, the Minister must stand condemned in the eyes of everybody in the country, particularly in the eyes of the farming community whose livelihood is most immediately bound up with the future of the cattle herd in this country. As I say, no serious attempt has been make by the Minister to emerge from his entrenched position in this dispute and come to terms with the veterinary profession.</P>
    <P>It would be an interesting exercise to attempt to come to a figure that <Col N="639" /> would represent the loss in millions of pounds that has been caused by the intransigence and incompetence of the Minister.  One must use these words when one is talking about a trade dispute that has been allowed to fester for 12 months.  Surely during the passage of that time some solution, if it were earnestly sought, would have been found a long time ago.  If one were to attempt to put a figure to the nearest £10 million on the losses that have been sustained by the reinfection of the cattle herd right throughout the length and breadth of the country, both with active tuberculosis and brucellosis, I am sure it would come to a sum that would appall the whole country.  We recognise the appalling damage that has been done to the cattle herd generally by the present administration, apart from animal disease.  We recognise that the value of the drop in the numbers of cattle in the last 12 months, valuing them consevatively indeed, is probably in the region of £10 million.  The cattle herd is diminished by that amount in value and in numbers, although the price per head for cattle on the market at present is quite buoyant.</P>
    <P>What I am endeavouring to point out is that the results that have been attained over 21 years of campaigning in bovine tuberculosis and in nine years of brucellosis testing has been put totally in jeopardy by the intransigence and incompetence of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his colleagues in the Government with whom he shares responsibility.</P>
    <P>At present throughout the country, if anybody takes the trouble to inquire, open cases of bovine tuberculosis, open active lesions, are being discovered in carcases in every meat factory. Throughout the length and breadth of the country, north and south, brucellosis is raging.  As everybody knows, both these diseases have very, very serious implications for human health as well as for animal health.  Their spread endangers the health of the population with the transmission in the case of brucellosis through milking and other ways causing <Col N="640" /> chronic undulant fever, with infection of humans with tuberculosis as well.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling state of affairs when farmer co-operatives in the north-western part of this country are issuing circulars to their shareholders warning them of the danger in purchasing calves from the south of Ireland because they are said to be so laden with brucellosis as to be a danger to the diminishing health levels of cattle in the northern part of the country.  It is true to say that our own countrymen in this part of the country are taking care to warn their shareholders that the purchase of calves and young stock from the south is courting disaster.</P>
    <P>This is the situation that has been allowed to grow in the last 12 months by the failure of the Minister to bring about an end to the dispute with the veterinary profession.  Exports to the Six Counties have almost ceased for the same reason.  More recently the very influential British farmers' chairman, Sir Harry Plum, issued a very dire warning which I would interpret as a notice to the Irish Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to take his finger out of his mouth and get on with the business of settling this strike at once.</P>
    <P>The Irish store cattle trade is still of great value to the cattle industry here.  We would naturally prefer to see an increasing number of our own cattle being processed in our own factories but until such time as the commercial practices of both the co-operatives and the privately-owned factories have been improved, possibly by legislation, it will be necessary for the live export trade to be maintained in order to keep some price discipline on the meat factories.</P>
    <P>We raise this question against the background that has been there all the time, against which we have been attempting to eradicate these two diseases in particular.</P>
    <P>On the 1st January, 1978, we will have entered a completely new situation. Unless the situation alters very dramatically in our favour in the meantime&mdash;and there is no reason to expect that it will&mdash;our cattle, either <Col N="641" /> alive or dead, will not be able to gain entry into the EEC, and that means Britain as well as the remaining seven continental countries.  During the past 12 months we have seen our seed stock, the calf herd, robbed, totally uncontrolled or interfered with.  Even that trade, destructive as it was to the real interests of Irish farmers, will have to be stopped.  The overall drop in the numbers of herd in the past 12 months alone adds up to a staggering 533,000 cattle.  If these cattle are valued at a very conservative £200 per head, one will realise the size of the hammering the cattle industry has taken at the hands of the Government.</P>
    <P>To the bitter amusement of the nation the Tánaiste suddenly discovered that what the country needs is an economic plan.  He has been sitting quite happily in Government for the past three years and only last night it struck him that we needed an economic plan.  We should probably say &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo;.  If there is to be an economic plan, if there is to be a rebuilding after the wreckage wrought by the Coalition Government to the economy generally over the past three years, it must be based on the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>About 24 per cent of our work force is engaged directly in agriculture and a further 22 per cent are engaged in directly processing the products of their labours.  This makes approximately 45 per cent of the work force engaged in these industries.  In all these areas, there must be a sharp slide.  This party warned the Government almost 12 months ago that if there was to be a continuation of this totally uncontrolled exploitation of the cattle industry, in the long run it would amount to massive disemployment in the meat industry.  This is upon us now.  The Government statistics show a drop in numbers of every type of cattle.  Cows in the dairy herd were down nearly 50,000; other cows were down by 127,000.  These figures, supplied by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, are not reliable because they are taken from a very small sample.  The reality is that about one-third of all the cows in the country were slaughtered last year and a <Col N="642" /> great many of those were in calf.  In the case of heifers under one year, the drop is 100,000.  That is the kind of management we are dealing with at present.</P>
    <P>As I said, it has just struck the Tánaiste that an economic plan is needed.  It should strike other members of the Government, and possibly the Tánaiste too, that the first thing to do is to start rebuilding the herd to the level it was in 1973, and thereafter continue its expansion to a target figure of ten million cattle of all kinds. They need not necessarily stop at that figure.  There will be no economic plan for recovery unless we begin with the cattle industry.  Both the dairy and meat processing industries depend on the prosperity and well-being of the cattle industry, as does the prosperity of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It must be plain even to the members of the Government, none of whom has any direct connection with agriculture and possibly ought not to be expected to appreciate the value of the industry to the country, that the resource upon which our eventual recovery from the havoc wrought by the Coalition must be based on the rebuilding of the cattle industry.  Even the former pace of eradication before the present dispute occurred was unsatisfactory. The rate of disease eradication during our administration was not fast enough but it was a great deal faster than the backward sliding we are experiencing now.</P>
    <P>If any realistic attempt is to be made in reaching the EEC deadline by 1978&mdash;or even by 1980&mdash;the Government will have to face this reality.  A totally new approach to the general question of animal disease eradication will have to be made. For this purpose, a special task force will have to be created.  They will have to enlist the participation of every veterinary surgeon in the country.  It will also necessitate the participation of lay staff.  This, I understand, is the nub of the dispute between the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the veterinary profession. It has been thrashed about stupidly and aimlessly for the past six or eight months without any achievement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> The Minister must face the reality that he is dealing with a hard, tough trade union who will not take dictation from him or anybody else.  It would be wrong to say he is dealing with people who would put the welfare of the country in jeopardy for their own selfish means.  That would be an over-statement and possibly a false one.  That being the case, we must take a new look at the approach we are making to animal health. We will require to double the efforts made prior to the dispute.  I would call it a lock out rather than a strike. Unless we do that, we will not be able to export cattle after 1978, and that is unthinkable.  It may be that it will be possible to negotiate some cheapjack rate for our products after that.  That is not what we want.  We want to get top quality prices for our top quality produce.  They will not be top quality unless we eliminate disease.  Far from there being no disease elimination over the past 12 months, there has been very rapid regression and a sliding back into the uncontrolled disease situation which obtained many decades ago before any attempts at disease eradication were made.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been doing a Duke of York act for the past 12 months on the question of lay staff. The original proposal was that lay staff should be used for the taking of blood samples in the brucellosis scheme.  The veterinary profession object that this is a job of a professional kind which they and they alone should carry out.  This question is unresolved.  There must be a settlement. There must be a compromise. The compromise I would suggest to the Minister and the veterinary profession is this: in the context of a new and vigorous and properly financed assault on animal disease, the incorporation of lay staff for the carrying out of non-professional tasks within this new animal disease task force.</P>
    <P>The first task one would think of for using this type of staff would be the mobilisation of herds for blood sampling and testing and reading.  The common practice on the ground, the <Col N="644" /> common experience on the ground, is that when the veterinary practitioner arrives to test the herd, as often as not he is late for his appointment because of previous bad staff work and the herd may have been released again and have to be rounded up again.  Expensive veterinary time is frittered away while the herd is rounded up, put in the crush and made ready for his professional attentions.</P>
    <P>I should like to see lay staff doing the business of ear tag reading and the recording of ear tags, and the recording of tests, and test measurements in the case of bovine tuberculosis, skin measurements and, in general, the courier type of work which is so necessary in properly organised disease eradication.  I do not see why this would be unacceptable to the Minister or the veterinary profession. If the Government show their earnestness, and the reality of their realisation of the vital urgency of the expansion of animal disease eradication, when the need for lay staff is demonstrated, the veterinary profession will accept it.</P>
    <P>For the moment before accelerated eradication takes place&mdash;and it must take place immediately or soon, at any rate&mdash;the lay staff ought not to be called upon to do any type of professional work.  Thereafter I would expect and hope that the demands on professional skills and time would be such that, with the acceleration of disease eradication, the veterinary profession would recognise that certain types of work might then be undertaken by the lay staff, provided always there were no veterinary surgeons available to do that work.  The field of animal disease eradication is so wide that any fears the veterinary profession might have of working themselves out of a job, as it were, would be groundless.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government will last much longer.  I think the task will be ours.  I hope when we get the chance we will have a major assault on animal disease.  The reason I would entertain that hope is this. If we do not have it, we are letting down the main resource this country has got for economic recovery.  We <Col N="645" /> will not be able to do it unless we get serious about it.  I do not want to dwell again on the appalling destruction which has been wrought by the Government on the cattle herds in the past three years.  It is intolerable that even this Government should contemplate its continuation.  Certainly when the change comes, and coming it is, it will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude, as far as one can read it throughout this whole affair, his approach to the veterinary profession, is as if he were saying to them: &ldquo;Do as I say or else.&rdquo; That approach to a union of the strength of the veterinary union is simply not realistic, and the pawns in the game are the herd owners.  One suspects that, lurking somewhere at the back of the lethargy of the Government in all this, is a secret rejoicing in the Department of Finance and by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, at the enormous amounts of money he has not got to spend buying reactors out of herds which have been tested and reactors identified.</P>
    <P>It is the blindest Mad Hatter economics one could possibly imagine but one suspects, because of the total inertia of the Government that there must be some secret acceptance: &ldquo;Damn it all, even if the herds go to pot, and if the work of the Fianna Fáil Governments over the past 21 years is to be set at nought, look at all the reactors we do not have to buy. Look at all the millions we have saved.  We can dish this money out to the people to purchase their votes,&rdquo; as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said.  The Government have no hesitation and no compunction about lavishing hundreds of millions of pounds higgledy-piggledy on what Deputy Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, says is the purchase of votes for the next election. When the health of Ireland's No. 1 national asset is at stake evidently no money is to be spent.  This is a nice cameo of the savage cynicism of the Government.  It falls to our lot for the time being to point out from this side of the House that we recognise this cynicism and condemn it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> The Minister and the veterinary unions have no right to hold this country up to ransom.  Having said that, I want to say without any reservation that this party believe that the onus is on the Minister, and on the Minister alone because of the office he holds, for the immediate settlement of this strike.  This strike can be settled.  Whatever the difficulties are the contemplation of a continuation of the strike for another week, or another month, is unthinkable.  Even though members of the Government might not have a personal commitment in the cattle trade they have no right to wreck the efforts made by the herd owners under the direction of successful Governments&mdash;almost all Fianna Fáil&mdash;in eliminating animal disease.</P>
    <P>The progress made in the case of bovine tuberculosis in 21 years is in jeopardy again, particularly in Kilkenny and Waterford.  Those counties are in dire need of special attention, possibly by annual testing, until bovine tuberculosis has been eradicated. However, nothing has been done and the Minister, in his extraordinary manner, seems, like Pontius Pilate, to wash his hands and say he is not guilty; it is not his baby.  The responsibility is the Minister's alone. He should incorporate lay staff, with the co-operation of the veterinary profession, to carry out unprofessional jobs.  He should concurrently undertake to make a real attack on animal disease and not just mark time and keep the disease eradication programme ticking over.  The EEC door has been shut in our face and there is only one way to open it, by a serious disease eradication programme. If we show we are serious the door may be opened.  It is not realistic to expect that we will have attestation status, especially in brucellosis, before the 1st January, 1978.</P>
    <P>The Government should demonstrate to the veterinary union that they are in earnest about carrying out a realistic attack on animal disease. If they could be convinced that their professional future was assured they would take a different view of the question of the lay staff but it is not <Col N="647" /> on to use lay staff for professional purposes with the low intensity campaign that is being operated at present. The field of veterinary medicine is vast as is the field of disease eradication. There are so many epizootic diseases that have not been thought of at all.  One that comes to mind immediately is mastitis.</P>
    <P>One could contemplate the creation of a national veterinary health scheme, possibly contributory.  I hope the day that will come about is not too far off.  I hope when the management of agricultural affairs passes into our hands again we will examine that idea in detail.  We need a massive attack on animal disease, a proving to the veterinary profession of the sincerity of the Government.  If this is demonstrated, the co-operation of the veterinary profession will be won.  I suggest that the Minister fall back to using the staff for non-professional work only.  I accept that there will be a need for a great many lay staff and in that the Minister's position was probably the right one but it will not be possible to use lay staff for professional duties in the present situation.  I appeal to the Minister to face his responsibility.  A further continuation of this strike is impossible and unthinkable.  The strike must end now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am starting off on a factual basis.  At a time when all parties in this House, and all farming organisations, should be showing their best endeavours to resolve this difficulty through the strike of the veterinary surgeons we should make a factual appraisal of the position and put the blame where it should rest. The eradication of brucellosis and BTE is of great importance.  That has been realised since we commenced the TB eradication scheme 22 years <Col N="648" /> ago.  The cost to the Exchequer of the scheme, up to the end of 1975 was £93.9 million.  From 1957 to 1973 Fianna Fáil were in office and Deputy Gibbons was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries during that period.  On several occasions then I mentioned that we were dissatisfied with the progress of the eradication scheme.  We felt that with the limited number of cattle, and the expense involved, the disease could have been eradicated some years ago if there was a proper drive by the Department then.  However, they did not do so and the position is not a bright one in some areas including Deputy Gibbons's county.</P>
      <P>A few weeks following the outbreak of the strike I said it was not good for us to be declaring publicly our factual position as far as the eradication of BTE and brucellosis is concerned.  We all know about the value of our cattle industry without being informed by Deputy Gibbons and we are tremendously pleased that cattle prices are quite good.  In the 1974 period when there was a falling off in cattle prices, particularly in the price of stores and calves, there was a considerable rumpus in the Dáil.  One would imagine we were in a theatre because the Opposition were so full of glee that prices were going down. From their point of view the only one to blame was the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Today there is a different situation. We have a satisfied farming community, whether dairy farmers or beef farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, we have a contented group of farmers at all levels.  They are contented because they are satisfied that the man appointed by this House to take responsibility for agriculture is giving a good account of himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I meet as many farmers as any Deputy <Col N="649" /> and I have found that irrespective of their political views they agree that the present Minister is working in a responsible and effective way to improve agriculture at every level. That view is held by many people who will not vote for the National Coalition Government at the next general election because their allegiance is to Fianna Fáil.  However, they are broadminded enough to give credit where credit is due.  I said the same of individual members of the Opposition when they were in Government. Some of them did a reasonably good job but others were not so good.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned that the eradication scheme has cost the people £93.9 million during the years.  If that were to be equated in present-day money values, it would be much more because the money spent in the 1950s and the 1960s was worth so much more than at present.  There is an obligation on the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to ensure that a major scheme of such importance is carried out as effectively, efficiently and as economically as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not mind interruptions but I would point out I did not interrupt the Deputy during his speech.  I appreciate that in Private Members' business the time of speakers is limited.  At this point I should like to summarise Deputy Gibbons's speech. According to his own party he is supposed to be the be-all and end-all of agriculture and no other Member of the House, particularly on the Government side, should dare to speak on the <Col N="650" /> subject.  Even those Deputies who represent rural areas are according to him supposed to know very little about agriculture.</P>
      <P>So far as the motion we are discussing is concerned, I should like to ask some questions.  Did the Minister do something drastic because from Deputy Gibbons's statement one would think he did?  The only inference I got was that the Minister, the person who was appointed on 14th March, 1973, to take charge of agriculture, should hand over his powers to the union of the veterinary practitioners.  I think that was the sum total of Deputy Gibbons's contribution.  It would be a very peculiar Minister and one not worthy to take charge of our major industry if that were to happen.  What did he do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He introduced proposals to employ lay technicians to take blood samples.  At the moment the proposals stand that lay technicians be employed in the north-western counties to take blood samples on a 50-50 basis with veterinary practitioners. I do not think that is anything drastic.  Did it happen in the northern part of our country?  Yes it did, and without any difficulty.  Did it happen in the neighbouring island of Britain?  Yes it did, and it has worked quite well.  All the reports available to the Department indicate that this type of sampling can be taken quite efficiently by lay people.  In fact, in the hospitals throughout the country where human beings are concerned lay people take blood samples.</P>

      <P>We are quite satisfied that this sampling could be done by technicians.  If I get a prick of a thorn in my finger, do I send for a doctor to remove it?  Not likely.  He is above that.  If I have 5 cwt of goods to remove I do not employ a ten-ton lorry to do the job and pay the extra cost.  I should like to point out that despite all the money paid out, the results were not good.  A situation confronted the Minister.  The Department found themselves waiting for samples much longer than anticipated. It is on record that the Minister expected a much greater improvement and decided that the employment of lay staff would ensure greater control of the operation of the scheme and a quicker flow of samples to the laboratory. Previously, sampling due to be completed within a year in some instances took two years, double the time.</P>
      <P>Our idea was that the lay samplers should work side by side with the professionals and if the lay samplers did a speedier, more effective job, then that would serve as a whip.  What right has a group of people who are well paid&mdash;I acknowledge they are giving an essential service in so far as the Department are concerned&mdash;to hold the gun to the Department's head? During the years, they have been paid more than £30 million for their services. Now they want to dictate to the Minister: &ldquo;Do not do what you think you should do; you have no right to do it; you must do as we tell you.&rdquo; Deputy Gibbons wants votes but the stock of his party is declining.  He would do anything to give him some hope of winning an extra vote.</P>

      <P>Speaking on 10th June last I said the blame for the dispute must lie with the veterinary practitioners.  The Minister was confronted with a demand for an increase of more than 100 per cent in their scale of fees.  I mention this because on another occasion a member of the Opposition indicated to the House that the cost of taking blood samples by laboratory technicians would be almost equal to that of the professional people.  There is no need to waste time answering that but it is no harm to remind those concerned that money does not fall from heaven, that we have to go to the pockets of the people to finance our operations.</P>
      <P>It was completely out of place, when the brucellosis scheme was getting under way, for this professional group to put the gun to the Minister's head and say: &ldquo;You dare not employ lay technicians.  If you do we will go on strike and if you employ us exclusively you will pay us double&mdash;86p instead of 43p per sample.&rdquo; Was the Minister to say he could not do anything about it, that they are a special group?  I do not believe in pressure groups putting the gun&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They would be delighted to participate in the scheme but they cannot do so because there are people at the top who will not move, who say: &ldquo;We are going to keep the gun to his head.&rdquo; These people should be told where they get off.  They are getting a fair deal from the Minister. Indeed, I think he has been a little too soft with them.  Instead of getting criticism here, especially from the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, he should be getting approval for his stand.  We cannot afford to be weak-kneed in matters like this.</P>

      <P>I know it is the wish of everybody on this side of the House, and I am speaking for the two National Coalition parties, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, that this dispute be resolved.  We know from experience that compromises had to be reached in the past in order to resolve disputes and, in the negotiations the Minister has had with representatives of the veterinary profession, I believe the Minister has gone more than half way in trying to resolve this dispute. In a recent proposal he has suggested that 50 per cent of the work in the north-western clearance area should be carried out by lay technicians and 50 per cent by professional veterinary surgeons.  He has mentioned the advisory council about which he will tell the House tomorrow.  His aim and objective is to secure on that body the involvement of everyone interested in agriculture.  He has included on it the creamery milk suppliers, the farmers' association, the veterinary association and union, the National Agricultural Advisory Body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is set up for the purpose of reporting on animal diseases.  We all know animal diseases dig deeply into our pockets.  When Deputy Haughey was Minister, and that is quite a number of years back, he stated the figure was £25 million.  It was a sizeable sum and I am sure it is much more than that now.  The position was that we were not getting value for money in some areas.  Some of those paid to do a job were not doing it efficiently. The evidence is there in the departmental files in black and white.  I do not think we can afford to pay people who do inefficient work.</P>

It is confined to people who really ought to be prosecuted for carrying out so inefficiently the duties for which they were well paid.  Now that is not a reflection on the whole profession.  It is a reflection on some members of it.  Probably the same reflection could be cast on members of other groups.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows the facts.  They have been stated time and time again here.  This proposal to employ lay technicians was under close examination by Fianna Fáil before they left office.</P>

      <P>I hope common sense will prevail among those involved in this dispute.  Indeed, many of them do not want it any more than the Minister does.  They are fed up with it. They know they are being treated fairly.  They should go out and do their job.  They should get a democratic voting system so that those who are anxious to get back to work would be able to do so with the small number of lay technician samplers to be appointed for the purpose of eradicating brucellosis from our cattle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the introduction of the calf heifer scheme and the beef incentive scheme our national herd had been expanding at an ever-increasing rate.  Unfortuately this is no longer the case.  The recent cattle census shows there has been a drastic decline in cattle numbers.  The export of calves and the large-scale slaughter of cows over the past year or two have contributed to the destruction of our national herd.  Because of that it is most important now that the Government should display foresight and understanding <Col N="657" /> in all their negotiations and all their dealings in relation to the improvement of our national herd.</P>
      <P>I am afraid we cannot credit the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Government with any of that foresight in relation to their dealings with the dispute we are discussing tonight. The deadlock reached in the talks yesterday between the Minister and the IVU gives an excellent opportunity, as has been pointed out in the newspapers today, to the British to stop the importation of Irish cattle. It strikes a very serious glow at our £105 million cattle export trade.  We can well imagine what effect that decision will have on our balance of payments and on the cattle and meat trade generally in the country.</P>
      <P>This dispute has been going on for almost 12 months and has been allowed to continue for too long.  Various proposals have been put forward by the farming organisations and other bodies who are interested in having this dispute settled but the parties concerned, the Minister and the IVU, have become deadlocked and are not prepared to compromise on the main issue in the dispute, the employment of lay technicians to take blood samples.  This is the one issue which has to be resolved at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can appreciate the position of the IVU in this dispute.  They have to protect the jobs of their members. That is what is expected of any trade union movement.  At this time the practices of most vets throughout the country are declining.  In recent months many of them had to lay off staff.  Young vets who qualified last July, whose parents spent a considerable amount of money in having them qualified, have not got jobs. I see nothing at all wrong in a vet being responsible for testing in his own area and being allowed employ two men, one to catch the cattle and perhaps put on the tags and the other to mark up the books.  When a vet goes to test a herd and there is an animal sick on the farm he can treat that animal and save himself the trouble of an additional journey and also save the farmer the cost of having to pay him for a further journey to the farm.  This would <Col N="658" /> involve lay personnel as well as allowing the vets to deal with the professional side of the business.  I am convinced that there would be no saving in the employment of lay personnel.  It would do nothing to speed the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis, which is our main concern and which we are all very anxious to see the end of.</P>
    <P>Since this dispute began disease has been rampant and the fruits of our efforts over the years to eliminate brucellosis and bovine TB have been destroyed.  It is difficult to estimate the overall costs of the dispute to the Exchequer.  It has certainly destroyed our chance of achieving our goal to have a disease-free herd by 1978, the deadline set by the EEC.  In a dispute of this kind one does not like to take sides, for many reasons. However, when I see farmers having to pay for their own testing and also when I see a serious threat to our cattle exports and our national herd I am not prepared to sit on the fence any longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the person responsible for our national herd and the person who mooted the idea of lay technicians, which is now causing the dispute, must now be held responsible for the serious situation which exists.  He has made proposals which are unacceptable to the veterinary union.  It is not good enough for the Minister to sit back for almost 12 months and allow a situation to arise where our cattle exports are threatened and animal disease is allowed to become rampant. The Minister's attitude seems to be: &ldquo;These are my proposals, take them or leave them.  If you do not accept them your source of income will be diminished and I will starve you into accepting them.&rdquo; Is it any wonder that for the past few months farmers are thinking that the Government are prepared to let this dispute drift on to save them the cost of eradicating bovine TB and brucellosis?</P>
    <P>In view of the present economic situation, the short term advantages of this course may be tempting but the long term loss to the country is too great to meddle with.  Unless total eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis <Col N="659" /> is secured within a reasonable number of years our cattle industry could be faced with serious obstacles in relation to trade.  Nobody who is interested in the welfare of the country and in the improvement of the cattle herd wants to see that situation arise.  At a time of world recession, when most industries are finding it very hard to keep their heads above water, why should we allow a serious dispute like this to destroy our major industry?  Agriculture is our major industry and our national herd is our greatest source of income.  I would not hazard a guess what this dispute has cost the country since it first began but I am sure it must run into a couple of million pounds.  This money could be utilised in many ways.  If not required in the agriculture industry it could be used to help keep some other industry ticking over and keep our people employed.  The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary realise this is an agricultural country and any depletion of our national herd is a loss we cannot afford.  Some years ago when Fianna Fáil were in office there was a national outcry from the farming organisation when a Minister refused to grant certain concessions to that organisation, but the issues then involved were not nearly as serious from a national viewpoint as those in this dispute and the effects were not as serious on the country's economy.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has taken a stand on the question of lay technicians and naturally has his pride and does not wish to give way. I say to him that, unless he has some alternative to offer to the vets, in the interests of our cattle industry I would advise him to come down from his pedestal and settle this dispute which has been allowed to drag on too long. That is necessary at present.  Different bodies have tried to intervene.  They have been fair in their arguments and have tried to avoid taking sides but in the interests of the national economy a dispute cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed in listening to the Parliamentary Secretary because I had hoped for some signs of compromise from the Government.  If the <Col N="660" /> attitude of the Minister is to be the same as that of the Parliamentary Secretary I fear we are wasting time discussing this motion.  We put down the motion in good faith hoping our contribution would help to bring the dispute to an end.  There is no dispute, as Deputy Gibbons said, between the vets and the Department in regard to bovine TB but since last May this scheme has been suspended.  I wonder why.  Surely it is important to eradicate TB.  It is as important as brucellosis.  Both diseases are a source of danger, not only to animals but to humans.</P>
    <P>The official figures issued by the Government Information Services show the serious decline in cattle numbers over the past two years and if this is allowed to continue unchecked I shudder to think what the state of our national herd will be in four or five years time. The figures show that the number of dairy cows has dropped by 44.5 thousand in 1975; other cows by 127 thousand; heifers in calf by 3.5 thousand, and the situation is even worse in regard to younger cattle.  In the case of two year olds and upwards there is a reduction of 104.6 thousand; in the case of one year olds to two year olds, 59.5 thousand.  This is a serious situation.  When I last spoke on an agricultural motion I pointed out this to the Minister or Agriculture and Fisheries.  I think he did not believe me then but, unfortunately, it is a fact.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have seen the increase in the export of calves to the continent and this coupled with the slaughter of cows strikes at the very base of our herd.  Another very important factor in this connection is the limit of £200 for reactors.  Any of us attending marts recently realise that this figure is not realistic now.  When the scheme again gets under way and when, as I earnestly hope, this dispute is settled, this dispute which is causing so much trouble and worry to the farming community, I trust the Minister will see fit to raise this limit of £200.  Cows being sold in marts at present are fetching from £300 to £350 and in some cases more.  It is very unfair to expect the farming community to pay for testing.  It is all <Col N="661" /> very well for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that farmers had a good year in 1975 and are having a good year in 1976.  They may be getting good prices for their livestock but input prices have also increased considerably, fertilisers, seed potatoes, seed oats, barley and so on.  If one goes into details one finds the profit margin is not very great.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch as ucht an seans a tugadh dom an cheist seo a phlé ar an Athló anocht.  Inniu sa Dáil ag Tráth na gCeisteanna chuir mé na ceisteanna seo ar an Aire:</P>
      <P>31.  Chun a fhiafraí d'Aire na Gaeltachta cé mhéid airgid a cailleadh le tionscal Soltoys Teo., an Spidéal, Contae na Gaillimhe ó chuir sé ar bun é an bhliain 1975.</P>
      <P>agus</P>
      <P>32.  Chun a fhiafraí d'Aire na Gaeltachta cé mhéid duine a bhí fostaithe i dtionscal Soltoys Teo., an Spidéal, Cantae na Gaillimhe an 31 Nollaig, 1973, 1974, 1975 agus ar an dáta is déanaí is eol i mí Feabhra, 1976.</P>
      <P>Sé an freagra a thug an tAire ar cheist a 31 ná:</P>
      <P>Níl figiúirí ar fáil don Spidéal amháin toisc go mbaineann an tionscal sin le Croithlí i gContae Dhún na nGall chomh maith.  Tuigim ó Gaeltarra Éireann gur tharla caill teanas mar seo a leanas ar an tionscal iomlán:</P>
      <P>£67,340 sa bhliain go 30 Meitheamh, 1974 agus £126,768 sa bhliain go 30 Meitheamh, 1975.</P>
      <P>Ar cheist a 32 thug sé an freagra seo:</P>
      <P>Thug mé an t-eolas i dtaobh na fostaíochta go dtí an 31 Nollaig, 1975 ar an 29 Eanáir, 1976.  Tuigim ó Ghaeltarra Éireann gur tháinig deireadh ó shin leis an gcuid de thionscal Soltoys Teo a bhí sa Spidéal agus gur tugadh fostaíocht i dtionscal eile do 43 de na daoine a bhíodh ag obair ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar fhreagra ar thuille ceisteanna uaimse thug an tAire an t-eolas <Col N="662" /> seo a leanas: (1) Gurb é a thuairim gurab é Gaeltarra Éireann a íoc as an chailliúint £200,000 idir Meitheamh, 1973, agus Meitheamh.  1975, ach nach raibh sé ró-chinnte cé íoc as nó cér ab as a tháinig an t-airgead.  Ní raibh mé sásta leis an fhreagra sin agus teastaíonn eolas cruinn uaim faoi sin; (2) Dúirt an tAire chomh maith go raibh 74 faoin gcéad de ghnáth scaireanna Soltoys Teoranta ag Solas Teoranta agus chuir Solas Teoranta £11,020 isteach sa chomhlacht nua i dtús Aibreáin, 1973.  Más fíor an méid sin, nochtann sé scéal aisteach ar fad, sé sin, gurbh fhéidir le comhlacht phríobháideach 74 faoin gcéad de chomhlacht Stáit ar fiú a luach ar a laghad £300,000 a fháil ar íocaíocht £12,000.</P>
    <P>An é seo an scéal seo ar fad?  Níor fhreaghair an tAire an cheist eile a chuir mé air, sé sin, an fíor gur chuir Gaeltara Éireann £120,000 ar fáil do Soltoys tar éis 74 faoin gcéad de na gnáth scaireanna a thabhairt do Sholas Teoranta i 1973?  Chomh maith leis sin an n-innseodh an tAire an fíor gur aontaigh Gaeltara Éireann i mí Márta, 1975, £115,000 eile a thabhairt do Sholtoys Teoranta, agus más fíor é sin agus chreidim é, an bhfuil an t-airgead sin ar fad íoctha le Soltoys Teoranta ó shin?  Agus, fós, ba mhaith liom a fháil amach an fíor gur chuir Gaeltara Éireann £90,000 eile isteach san gnó seo, airgead a bhfuaireadar ar iasacht ar an choinníoll go mbeadh Gaeltarra Éireann sásta an méid sin a íoc le Soltoys mar dheontas chun fiacha bainc a glanadh.</P>
    <P>De réir an méid atá ráite agam, fuair Solas Teoranta margadh an-mhaith ar fad; sé sin, 74 faoin gcéad de ghnáth scaireanna, meaisíní, stoc ar fiú ar a laghad £300,000 iad, agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an figiúir sin aníseal. Chomh maith le sin, fuaireadar deontas de £235,000, sé sin, £535,000 ar fad agus gan le híoc ag Solas Teoranta ach £12,000.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire sa Dáil inniu, de réir an Tuairisce Oifigiúla go ndearnadh socraithe i 1973 le comhlacht Sholas Teoranta chun dul isteach sa tionscal sin agus gur éirigh cuíosach maith leis an gcomhlacht nua sin sa bhliain 1974, sé sin, d'éirigh leo an caillteanas <Col N="663" /> sin a laghdú ó £107,000 i 1972 go £67,000 i ndeireadh na bliana 1974. Má cheapann an tAire gur éirigh cuíosach maith leis an chomhlacht sin i 1974 agus nár cailleadh ach £67,000, an bhféadhadh sé a mhíniú don Teach cad a thárla don £120,000? Nach caillteanas díreach é sin?  An bhfuil sé ag rá gur cailleadh £120,000 in éineacht leis an £67,000 a luaigh sé, sé sin, £187,000, ar fad i 1974?  Nó an bhfuil sé ag rá gur cailleadh £67,000 tar éis an deontas de £120,000 a bhaint den chaillteanas iomlán?</P>
    <P>An fíor nár ghlac Gaeltarra Éireann aon pháirt i riaradh na comhlachta nua Soltoys Teoranta ó Aibreán 1973 go Samhradh 1975, cé go raibh, de réir an Aire, 26 faoin gcéad de na gnáth scaireanna ann, go raibh £120,000 deontas íoctha acu. Deirtear liomsa nach bhfuil an méid a dúirt an tAire linn inniu ceart, sé sin, faoi 74 faoin gcéad de na scaireanna a bheith ag Solas Teoranta. Tuigim go raibh céad faoin gcéad de na scaireanna fós ag Gaeltarra ach nár ghlacadar aon pháirt i riaradh an mhonarchan go dtí Samhradh, 1975.  Más fíor é sin, is an-aisteach an scéal é agus tá míniú ag teastáil.  Chomh maith leis sin, dúradh go raibh rogha ag Solas Teoranta 74 faoin gcéad de na scaireanna a ghlacadh tar éis trí bhliain.</P>
    <P>Is léir gur deineadh praiseach ceart den tionscail seo a bhí bunaithe le bréagáin a dhéanamh sa Spidéal i monarcha nua ó 1963.  Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire anocht cad tá in ann anois do thionscail na mbréagán sa Spidéal.  Deireann an tAire go bhfuil sé beartaithe an tionscal seo a dhúnadh ar fad agus an gnó a aistriú go Dún na nGall. Tuigim go raibh dhá mhonarcha ag Soltoys, ceann in nDún na nGall agus ceann i nGaillimh.  Bhí 62 daoine fostaithe i nGaillimh; ní raibh ach 41 fostaithe in nDún na Gall.  Cén fá gur bheartaigh sé an ceann is mó sa Spidéal a dhúnadh agus leanúint ar aghaidh leis an gceann i nDún na Gall agus na meaisíní, an stoc agus aroile a chur suas go dtí Dún na Gall?  Is masladh é sin do mhuintir Ghaeltacht Chonamara gur dúnadh an mhonarcha <Col N="664" /> ar chor ar bith agus go háithrid gur dúnadh é agus gur leanadh ar aghaidh leis an ceann i nDún na Gall.</P>
    <P>Cad tá in ann anois do thionscal na mbréagán?  Cad tá in ann dóibh siúd atá gan obair anois sa Spidéal? De réir figiúirí an Aire, tá 19 daoine sa Spidéal as a bpost de bharr an rud seo ar fad.  Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil na mílte púnt imithe le sruth.  Cad tá in ann don mhonarcha atá folamh nó beagnach folamh anois?  An cheist dheireanach&mdash;beidh 20 nóiméad ag an Aire chun freagra a thabhairt&mdash;cé mhéid airgid ar fad a chailleadh leis an mbeartas seo, Solus Teoranta, Gaeltarra Éireann agus Soltoys Teoranta?</P>

Anois, iarraim ar an Aire an chomhlacht Stáit seo a chur ar an liosta sa dóigh go mbeidh caoi ag an gcoiste sin dul isteach i gcúntaisí na comhlachta sin chomh maith le CIE agus na comhlachtaí Stáit eile.  Ba mhaith liom fios a fháil cé mar atá an scéal maidir le deontais le haghaidh na comhlacht atá i gceist anseo cé mar tá an dearcadh amach i dTír Chonaill, cad iad na pleannana atá ann i dtaobh fostaíocht, agus margaí a chur ar fáil?</P>

      <P>Thugas an t-eolas a bhí ag teastáil ón Teachta um thráthnóna nuair a bhí mé ag tabhairt freagra ar a cheist.  Mar sin féin, tá áthas orm go bhfuil an deis agam an scéal go léir a bhaineann le comhlacht Soltoys a phlé os comhair na Dála.  Le blianta fada bhí tionscail bhréagáin á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra Éireann sa Spidéal agus i gCroithlí agus, faoi mar a tharla le nua-thionscail eile a bhí ag Gaeltarra, bhí caillteanas gach bliain.  Is mar seo a leanas a bhí an caillteanas iomlán ar thionscail Ghaeltarra, go dtí an £1,000 is cóngaraí: 1970, £208,000; 1971, £278,000; agus 1972, £260,000.  Faoi mar adúirt mé sa Dáil inniu, bhain na <Col N="665" /> scéimeanna seo a leanas le tionscal na mbréagán: 1970, £85,000; 1971, £91,000; 1972, £107,000.</P>
      <P>Ní aon ionadh mar sin gur cheap Bord Ghaeltarra gur mithid iarracht a dhéanamh chun dream eile a thabhairt i gcomhair leo d'fhonn feabhas a chur ar thionscail na mbréagán.  Sular cheapadh mise mar Aire, d'éirigh leis an bord comhaontú a dhéanamh le comhlacht poiblí Éireannach a raibh cáil mhór orthu agus taithí acu ar earraí plaisticiúla a dhéanamh.  Nuair a bhí an tógra sin scrúdaithe i Roinn na Gaeltachta agus sa Roinn Tionscail agus Tráchtála, is mise a cheadaigh an comhthionscal nua Soltoys Teo., agus tig liom a rá go raibh áthas orm é sin a dhéanamh mar bhí lucht banaistíochta ag teacht ó Sholus Teo.  agus dóchas ann go gcuirfí feabhas mór ar an dtionscal.</P>
      <P>D'éirigh leis an gcomhchomhlacht nua Soltoys Teo.  an caillteanas a laghdú go dtí £67,000 sa chéad bhliain go 30 Meitheamh 1974, i gcomparáid le caillteanas £107,000 sa bhlian 1972.  Sa dara bliain, áfach, bhí deacrachtaí móra sna margaí thar lear agus chuaigh an caillteanas i méid aríis go dtí £127,000.  Ba léir um an dtaca sin gur gá atheagrú bunúsach a dhéanamh sa tionscal, agus cuireadh chuige sin.  Socraíodh go ndéanfaí an tionscal a chomhdhlúthú i gCroithlí agus go bhfaighfí tionscail nua don Spidéal.  Le comhoibriú ó na hoibrithe féin agus óna gceardchumainn, rinneadh an t-atheagrú agus cuireadh fostaíocht eile ar fáil do na daoine a bhí ag obair sa Spidéal.  Ghlac 43 de na daoine sin leis an bhfostaíocht nua, ach bhí 19 nduine eile arbh fhearr leo glacadh go deonach le hiomarcaíocht.</P>
      <P>Sé toradh an atheagraithe anois ná go bhfuil tionscal fiúntach bréagán i gCroithlí agus gach seans ann go n-éireoidh go geal leis feasta agus go gcuirfidh sé fostaíocht mhaith leanúnach ar fáil.  I gConamara chomh maith, tá fostaíocht eile curtha ar fáil do na daoine a bhí ag obair sa Spidéal.  Sílim to bhfuil anchreidiúint ag dul do Ghaeltarra dá bharr sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba chóir atheagrú a dhéanamh ionnas go mbeidh an tionscal bréagán <Col N="666" /> nó déantús bréagán go léir centralised. Agus chomh maith leis sin d'éirigh liom fostaíocht a chur ar fáil don lucht oibre a bhí sa tionscail sa Spidéal. Mar atá an scéal anois: tá an deantús bréagán centralised i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Tá tionscal plastics i gConamara agus dá bharr sin tá mé sásta anois go mbeidh obair sheasmhach ag an lucht oibre i nDún na nGall agus chomh maith leis sin go mbeidh fostaíocht sheasmhach ag an lucht oibre sa Spidéal.</P>

      <P>These children are basically eligible for free school transport.  However, they reside in a locality to the east of the school which is remote from the localities catered for by the two transport services operating to the school.  Accordingly, it is not possible to cater for the children within the terms of the free transport scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The names of the children appeared on the requisitions forwarded by the school authorities at the beginning of the school year and they were issued <Col N="571" /> with travel permits in error by CIE. When it was subsequently discovered that no transport services operated near them CIE withdrew the travel permits.</P>
