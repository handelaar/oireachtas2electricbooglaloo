      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill restates the statute law relating to juries in civil and criminal trials.  The principal Act is the Juries Act, 1927, which was amended by the Juries Acts of 1945 and 1961 and certain provisions of other Acts.  The Bill proposes to repeal all the existing provisions so that the relevant law will now be contained in one Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make large changes in the present law.  The most important changes concern the persons qualified and liable for jury service. The 1927 Act based liability for jury service on the occupation of landed property of a certain rateable value.  Stated shortly, the Act provided <Col N="1850" /> that Irish citizens aged 21 or upwards and under 65 who were on the electoral registers and who possessed the rating qualification should alone be qualified and liable. Moreover, the Act provided that women should not be liable for jury service unless they themselves applied to serve.  As a result, only a small part of the adult population was qualified for jury service.  In particular, the rating qualification excluded all men, however well educated, who did not happen to have landed property; and in practice women hardly ever served on juries.  In the ten years up to 1974 only nine women are recorded as having applied to serve and so became qualified to do so, and of these only five were called for service and three actually served.  It is of interest to mention that in 1963, the last year for which figures are readily available, the number of persons liable for jury service was just under 84,000.</P>
    <P>I should now refer, briefly, to the procedure under the 1927 Act by which the persons liable for jury service have been identified and selected, because this procedure has depended on the rating qualification.  When the officers of the local authorities make up the electoral registers, they mark the names of those liable for jury service with the letter &ldquo;<b>J</b>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Every year the officer prepares a draft jurors list containing the names of the persons considered to be liable for jury service and submits it to the county registrar, who revises and settles the list after holding public revision sessions.  After that the names of the persons liable are ready for entry in the jurors books, which are made up by county registrar and from which jurors are empanelled as required. The jurors books are not made up annually, but only when a book is exhausted and a new one is required. When panels of jurors were required, they have had to be taken in strict alphabetical order from the jurors books.  Each jurors book has remained in force until all the persons whose names were included in it had been summoned once for jury service.  The life of a jurors book has varied between three and ten years.  The books have been revised annually by deleting <Col N="1851" /> the names of persons no longer liable, but persons who become qualified for jury service during the life of a jurors book cannot be included in the book and are, therefore, in fact, free from liability to be summoned until a new jurors book has to be made up.</P>
    <P>I was of opinion that this restricted system of liability for jury service was unfair and I have been anxious to change it so as to remove the sex and property qualifications.  I was strengthened in my views by the reports on jury service on these points made as long ago as 1965 by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Walsh. Accordingly, I had the drafting of fresh legislation put in hand and it was introduced in the Seanad in July of last year.  Its preparation and more especially the construction of a system to implement the changes proved long drawn out and quite difficult.  The scheme was evolved by a working party representative of the county registrars, the local authorities and the Departments of Local Government and Justice and I would like to convey my thanks to the members of the working party.  In the meantime the decision of the Supreme Court was given on 12th December last in the case of Máirín de Búrca and Mary Anderson v. the Attorney General.  The court held unanimously that the provision in the 1927 Act restricting liability for jury service to persons with the requisite rateable qualification was contrary to the Constitution and&mdash;by a majority of four to one&mdash;that the virtual exclusion of women from jury service was also unconstitutional.  This decision made the need for the new Bill a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide this new system.  At the same time, the opportunity has been taken to rewrite the existing law and, in doing so, to make a large number of substantial changes.  These, I hope, will considerably improve the law.  These changes follow generally recommendations made by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their second and fourth interim reports entitled &ldquo;Jury Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jury Challenges&rdquo;<Col N="1852" /> respectively.  I should like to pay tribute to the painstaking and valuable work that the committee have done and my only regret is that so much time has elapsed since they reported. Once again a Minister for Justice has the agreeable duty of expressing in public his thanks to Mr. Justice Walsh and his colleagues for the public benefits they have provided by their examination of the difficult matters they have been asked to consider. In the present case, it is right to mention in particular that the committee anticipated the recent decision of the Supreme Court by recommending that the rating qualification for jurors should be abolished and, by a majority, that the exemption of women should also be abolished.  The committee also recommended that, in consequence of the abolition of the rating qualification, jurors should be empanelled directly from the electoral registers; and this is what the Bill proposes. In the preparation of the Bill consideration has also been given to recommendations in the valuable report of the English Departmental Committee on Jury Service under the chairmanship of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, which was published in 1965. I have also had the advantages of studying the recent legislation in Northern Ireland in 1974 and 1975 governing juries.</P>
    <P>I said that the Bill replaces the existing statute law on juries.  As a result, it contains a certain amount of detail which at first sight might seem unnecessary.  But I feel sure that anybody who takes the trouble to compare the Bill with the 1927 Act and the amending enactments will agree that it will be a great benefit to have all the relevant law in one Act.  Moreover, the 1927 Act goes into a great deal of detail on matters of procedure, such as the method of balloting for juries in court.  Much of this detail can be left to administrative arrangements and is, therefore, not repeated in the Bill.  As a result of these omissions and of other simplifications, the Bill will be only about a third of the length of the existing statute law, and I am sure we shall all be grateful for that.  The explanatory memorandum attempts to summarise the provisions of the Bill <Col N="1853" /> and draws attention to the more important departures from the present law.  I hope Deputies will find it useful in examining the Bill.</P>
    <P>I come now to the provisions of the Bill.  I do not think I need go into any great details as many of the provisions relate to the procedural matters, the details of which are set out in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>Part I contains the usual formal provisions.</P>
    <P>Part II includes the most important provisions which relate to qualification and liability for jury service.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is technical, though important. It provides for the division of the country into jury districts. County boroughs will no longer be separate jury districts as at present but will be included in the respective counties.  The present power to subdivided counties into jury districts is being continued.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is the most important section as it states the new rule as to qualification and liability for jury service. Every citizen aged 18 or upwards and under 70 who is entered in a register of Dáil electors will be qualified and liable unless he is ineligible under section 7 or disqualified under section 8.  The reduction from 21 to 18 in the lower age limit and the increase from 65 to 70 in the upper age limit are important changes and the former at least is a matter as to which there is room for some difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>It may be argued in favour of keeping the lower age limit at 21 that many persons aged 18, 19 or 20 are likely to be of insufficient maturity and experience to discharge the duties of jurors satisfactorily.  In particular, older people involved in litigation might feel aggrieved at the thought of their cases being decided by juries including members as young as 18.  On the other hand, there is the consideration that younger persons who are themselves involved in litigation might feel equally aggrieved at the total exclusion of persons under 21 from the jury.</P>
    <P>There are two arguments of principle in favour of reducing the lower <Col N="1854" /> age limits to 18.  First, since the Legislature and the public, by reducing the voting age and the age for making a will to 18, have accepted the propositions that people of 18 are sufficiently mature to be trusted to take vital decisions, it follows that we ought to regard these young people as sufficiently mature to serve as jurors. The second argument is that the involvement of young persons in the administration of the law should increase their sense of being responsible citizens.  There are also practical difficulties that would follow from keeping the lower age at 21.  The electoral registers, from which jurors will be selected, include all persons of 18 or over and it would require a substantial amount of administrative work and additional expenditure to distinguish persons under 21.  The law could, of course, provide that persons under 21 should be ineligible even though their names were on the electoral registers, but there might be considerable difficulties in determining whether particular persons summoned from the registers were over or under that age.  Some persons under 21 might conceal the fact because they objected on principle to not being treated as qualified to serve; others, thought over 21, might claim to be under that age in order to avoid serving.  As a result the county registrars or the courts might have to require the production of birth certificates to determine whether young persons were under or over 21.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that on the whole the right course is to reduce the lower age limit to 18.  If either party is against the inclusion of a young person in the jury, the party may challenge him under section 20, which section, as I shall mention later, increases the number of jurors who may be challenged without cause shown.  There should be little difficulty in avoiding having a disproportionate number of young persons on a jury since the proportion of persons aged 18 to 20 who will be selected for jury service is likely in any event to be small.  Moreover, as I shall also mention later, whole-time students will be excusable as of right if summoned as jurors.  I should add that in <Col N="1855" /> England and Northern Ireland the lower age limit for jury service has been reduced to 18.</P>
    <P>The raising of the upper age limit from 65 to 70 will, I feel, be generally welcomed.  There must be many people, including retired people, between those ages who feel, and are, perfectly competent to serve on juries, and they may well resent being treated as too old to do so.  But under section 9, read with Part II of the First Schedule, they will have the right to be excused if summoned.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the persons specified in Part I of the First Schedule shall be ineligible for jury service.  The classes of persons to be ineligible correspond broadly to those ineligible under the present law.  The differences are summarised in paragraph 47 of the explanatory memorandum.  There are two matters which call for comment. The first is that a considerably wider range of persons than at present will be ineligible on the ground of being &ldquo;persons concerned with the administration of justice&rdquo;.  The exclusion of these persons is desirable in order to preserve the essentially lay character of juries and also because of the grievance that accused persons in criminal cases might well feel, if the jurors trying them included lawyers or members of the Garda Síochána or other persons connected with the administration of justice.  The second matter is that the complete exemption from jury service enjoyed by civil servants and local government officials under the present law is being abolished.  Instead the Bill provides that heads of Department <i>et cetera</i> shall be excusable as of right and other official only on a certificate by the head of the Department.  This scheme was recommended by the Courts Committee.  I shall return to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>Section 8, to state its effect shortly, proposes that a person should be disqualified permanently from jury service if he has been sentenced to five years' imprisonment or more and that a person who has been sentenced to at least three months' imprisonment, <Col N="1856" /> provided he has actually served any part of the sentence, shall be disqualified for ten years.  The section will apply to sentences passed in any part of Ireland.  The provision is a substantial departure from the present rule, in section 4 of the Juries Act, 1927, which was, in my view, more than ripe for reconsideration.  The 1927 Act provision excludes only persons convicted of treason, treason-felony, any other felony or perjury, and this applies however small the sentence passed and however long ago the conviction occurred.  Thus a person convicted when a child of stealing an apple is in law disqualified for life but a person who has been convicted of a large-scale fraud which happens to be a misdemeanour and been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment is not disqualified.  Section 8 proposes a more logical basis for the disqualification of convicted persons.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that certain persons shall be excusable as of right from jury service and that other persons may be excused for good reason at the discretion of the county registrar or the court.  The largest class of persons excusable as of right will be those specified in Part II of the First Schedule.  These classes are summarised in paragraph 48 of the explanatory memorandum.  The Bill proposes to make a procedural change in respect of these classes of persons apart from the changes in the classes themselves. The procedural change is that at present the persons in question cannot be summoned unless they volunteer for jury service; under the Bill they will be liable to be summoned but will be entitled to be excused if they wish. The largest change from the present law is, of course, that women will have no absolute right not to serve. The next most important change is that to which I have referred earlier that public servants, who are at present completely exempt, will instead be liable to be summoned but will be excusable as of right only to the extent provided in Part II of the Schedule.  In future the heads of Departments <i>et cetera</i> will be excusable as of right and other members of the staffs will be excusable as of right only if the <Col N="1857" /> head gives a certificate that&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;it would be contrary to the public interest for the civil servant [or other official] to have to serve as a juror because he performs essential and urgent services of public importance that cannot reasonably be performed by another or postponed&rdquo;.  Such certificates will, therefore, be issued only in most exceptional circumstances and in general public servants will serve on juries.  The teaching staffs of universities, schools and other educational institutions will be treated, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> like Government Departments, and in addition whole-time students will, as I have mentioned, be excusable as of right.  I have also already referred to the fact that the classes of persons excusable as of right will include persons between the ages of 65 and 70, who are at present not liable for jury service at all.</P>
    <P>Under section 9 also persons who have served or duly attended to serve, on juries during the previous three years will be excusable as of right.  The section also gives statutory recognition to the practice by which a judge sometimes, after a long trial, exempts the jurors from further jury service for a fixed period or for life.</P>
    <P>Section 9 also gives a general power to county registrars to excuse any person summoned for jury service for good reason.  At present jurors are excused by the judges, though in some instances the judges have delegated the power to excuse to the registrars of their courts. To give a general discretion such as proposed seems clearly desirable, especially now that so many more people will be liable for jury service. This applies especially in the case of women, who may have homes and young children to look after.  Similarly, the county registrar might excuse a person for pressing family or business reasons or if he is in ill-health.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives a person whom the county registrar has refused to excuse a right of appeal to a judge of the court to which he has been summoned. It also provides that, at the stage when the juror is required to be in attendance at the court, the judge shall have a similar duty or discretion to excuse as the county registrar <Col N="1858" /> has at the stage when the juror is summoned.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains the procedural provisions as to the empanelling and summoning of jurors, the selection of the jury from the panel, the mode of swearing, the rights of the parties to challenge jurors and a few other matters.  There are few questions of principle involved and I need only mention the more important changes from the present law.</P>
    <P>Section II provides that the county registrars shall empanel jurors&mdash;that is to say, select from the electroal registers the persons who should be summoned to attend the court.  No special method of selection is prescribed but the registrar will be required to use &ldquo;a procedure of random or other non-discriminatory selection&rdquo;.  This contrasts with the present law, under which, as I have mentioned, the composition of the panels is predetermined alphabetically according to the order in which the names appear in the jurors books. The county registrars will be given guidance as to a suitable method of random selection in the administrative instructions that will be issued to them under section 27, to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the summoning of jurors by the county registrar. The form of summons will be prescribed by the Minister for Justice by regulations.  The summons will be accompanied by a notice informing the juror of the effect of the provisions of the Act as to qualification and liability for service, ineligibility, disqualification and excusability as of right; and the notice will inform the person summoned of his right to make representations to the county registrar with a view to the withdrawal of the summons if the juror is not qualified for jury service or wishes or is entitled to be excused.  It will be necessary to serve the summons at least a fortnight before the juror's attendance is required, because section 34 (3) provides that the juror will not be liable for non-attendance unless he has had this length of notice. In fact I propose that the administrative <Col N="1859" /> instructions should include an arrangement by which the summonses will be served, so far as possible, approximately four to six weeks in advance.  Under the present law only four days' notice is required.  I propose also to include in the instructions an arrangement for county registrars to send out with the summons a form of return which the juror will be asked to complete and in which he will state whether he is qualified or not.  The form can be used in order to apply for excusal.  The juror will be under no legal obligation to return the form; but it will be in his interest, as well as helpful to the county registrar, for the junior to return it.  It will be helpful to the county registrar because, if the form is returned, he will be better able to judges whether there will be enough jurors or whether he will have to summon more.  It will be in the juror's own interest to return the form, because, if he is not qualified or is excusable as of right or has a good claim to be excused, the county registrar will be in a position to tell him that he need not attend the court.</P>
    <P>Section 15 includes two important provisions.  The first is subsection (3), which provides that, before the balloting for a particular jury is begun, the judge shall warn the jurors present in court that they must not serve if ineligible or disqualified and as to the penalty, under section 36, for doing so. The judge will also invite any juror who knows that he is not qualified, or is in doubt as to whether he is qualified, or who may have an interest in the case or a connection with the case or the parties, to mention this fact if he is selected on the ballot.  In the ordinary course, any question whether a person summoned as a juror is or is not qualified will have been raised by the juror himself in the form of return to the summons, but section 15 will provide an extra safeguard in case a juror has neglected to inform the county registrar of his want of qualification or in case he has ceased in the meantime to be qualified.  If a juror claims not to be qualified or raises a doubt as to whether he is qualified, the <Col N="1860" /> judge should ordinarily have no difficuly in deciding on the matter.  In a doubtful case the judge may excuse the juror under section 9 (7)&mdash;provided that the juror is willing to be excused&mdash;or he might discharge him under section 24, to which I shall refer later, or one of the parties might challenge the juror. The other change that section 15 makes is that in future under subsection (4), jurors will choose their own foreman. At present the first juror to be sworn always becomes foreman.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 to 19, which relate to the swearing of juries, include only one change of substance from the present law.  This is that section 17 (2) provides that jurors shall be sworn separately. At present jurors may be sworn collectively in all except capital cases. The greater solemnity of individual swearing will, I feel, emphasise the duty of jurors to give a true verdict in accordance with the evidence.</P>
    <P>Section 20 proposes to give each party to civil proceedings, and the Attorney General or Director of Public Prosecutions and each accused in criminal proceedings, the right to challenge up to seven jurors without cause.  At present in civil proceedings the plaintiff, or the plaintiffs between them and the defendant, or the defendants between them, may challenge up to three jurors without cause shown. In criminal proceedings a single accused may challenge up to five jurors without cause.  Where there are more than one accused, they may between them challenge up to ten jurors without cause in treason or murder and up to six in other cases.  In criminal cases the Attorney General or Director of Public Prosecutions has no right of challenge without cause, as such, but he may direct any number of the jurors to &ldquo;stand-by&rdquo;, with the result that they are not included in the jury unless a complete jury cannot be formed without them.  The new provision will take away the privileged position of the prosecution.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their Fourth Interim Report, recommended increasing the number of challenges to five. The reason why the Bill proposes to make this further increase to seven, is because of the larger number of <Col N="1861" /> younger persons who will be liable owing to the reduction of the lower age age limit to 18.  This reduction was, of course, not contemplated by the committee, as the voting age had not been reduced at the time when the committee reported so persons under 21 were not on the electoral register.</P>
    <P>Section 24 gives a general discretion to the judge at any stage of a trial to direct that a juror shall not serve, or shall not continue to serve, if the judge considers that for any stated reason it is desirable in the interests of justice to give the direction.  The courts committee thought that there was an inherent power to give such a direction but that, as there was some doubt about the matter and as the power would be useful, provision should be made expressly conferring it.  They instanced &ldquo;physical disability on the part of the juror&rdquo; among the possible grounds for giving the direction.  Of course, section 24 will not affect the power or duty of a judge to discharge the whole jury in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that in all jury trials the jury may separate before considering their verdict except where the judge otherwise directs.  At present the jurors may not be permitted to separate in cases of capital murder, treason or treason-felony.  It seems to me that the decision whether the jurors should be allowed to separate can properly be left to the discretion of the judge in all cases.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill contains certain general provisions.  Only two of the sections call for special comment.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides that the Minister for Justice may issue administrative instructions to county registrars with regard to practice and procedure so as to secure consistency in the administration of the Act.  The instructions will relate principally to the method of selecting the persons to be empanelled as jurors and the general procedure for summoning and for dealing with applications for excusal. Draft administrative instructions are at present being prepared in consultation with some of the county registrars in anticipation of the passing <Col N="1862" /> of the Bill.  Section 27 expressly prohibits the issue of any instructions as to whether particular persons should or should not be summoned for jury service or, if summoned, should or should not be excused.  It would clearly be entirely wrong for the Minister to be able to give any such instruction.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is intended to protect employees and apprentices from losing pay owing to absence from their work for the purpose of complying with a jury summons.  The section provides that they shall be treated for the purpose of the contract of employment or apprenticeship as being employed or apprenticed during any period when they are absent for jury service.  They will thus be entitled to their pay for the period as if they were still at work.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this point that the Bill makes no provision for jurors to be paid out of public funds for their service.  This is also the position at present.  I am of the opinion that a citizen should not look to the State for payment for doing a civic duty which will arise most infrequently, perhaps once or twice in a lifetime.  If payment were to be made, it would be pointless unless it were adequate to compensate fully for loss, and, of course, that would place a substantial burden on the Exchequer.  The provision that an employee will not lose wages through being absent on jury service is a substantial improvement on the present position so far as an employed person is concerned and such a person cannot have any cause for complaint.  I recognise that the self-employed person does not run the risk of loss, but at least he can order his affairs so as to minimise his loss and maybe pull up for it later.  Moreover, a self-employed person who would suffer grave hardship if he had to leave his business to attend court can apply to the county registrar for excusal.</P>
    <P>Part V specifies the offences under the Act.  Section 34 penalises failure without reasonable excuse to attend in compliance with a jury summons, not being available when required to serve and unfitness for service by reason of drink or drugs.  Section 35 <Col N="1863" /> covers making or being party to the making of a false statement for the purpose of enabling the maker or somebody else to avoid jury service and refusing to answer or answering falsely when questioned by a judge for the purpose of determining whether the offender is qualified to serve as a juror.  Section 36 makes it an offence to serve as a juror when ineligible or disqualified, and section 37 deals with refusal to be sworn as a juror.</P>
    <P>The range of offences is wider than under the existing law.  Since all persons on the electoral register will <i>prima facie</i> be qualified and liable, it will be particularly important to penalise the making of a false statement in order to avoid jury service and also to penalise serving when ineligible or disqualified.  All the offences will be punishable on summary conviction in the District Court.  The maximum penalty will be a fine of £50 except in the case of serving when disqualified owing to a criminal conviction, when it will be £200.  The much higher penalty for the latter offence is proposed owing to the particular serious harm that may be done to the interests of justice if a person with a criminal record manages to serve on a jury.</P>
    <P>The provisions as to failure to attend the court contrast with the present law.  At present the judge must impose a fine of £3 on an absent juror but he may afterwards remit or reduce the fine if the person makes representations for the purpose.  The provision for a fine of a fixed amount seems inappropriate when the circumstances may vary so much.  Moreover, £3 is clearly far too low a figure in these days.  The prospect of a prosecution in the District Court and a fine of up to £50 should discourage persons inclined to disregard jury summonses.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Bill will extend the duty and privilege of jury service to the population as a whole, will improve the present procedure in several respects and will considerably shorten and simplify the general law relating to juries and jury service.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, this Bill is very welcome and I compliment all those associated with its drafting and framing.  An excellent job has been done and where credit should be given it should be given generously. The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, presided over by Mr. Justice Walsh, in their second interim report set out certain criticisms of the position obtaining in the Jurors Act, 1927 and I should like to quote from it:</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>The property qualification operates unfairly in the circumstances of the present day.</i>  It was claimed that a very large number of persons fully competent to act as jurors were not liable because of the qualification.  The great majority of the opinions expressed to the Committee favoured its abolition.</P>
      <P>(b)  <i>The exemption of certain classes is not justified in present-day circumstances.</i>  It was urged that the exemption of civil servants, local government officials, members of the Defence Forces and others in the State or Local Service operated unjustly in present-day conditions.</P>
      <P>(c)  <i>The difficulties caused by the present system.</i>  It was claimed that jury service is a hardship on owners of small or one-man businesses, on tradesmen or workmen who receive no remuneration while absent from work, and on travellers and salesmen who suffer loss of commission. The difficulties caused to businesses and industries by the absence of men in key positions were also stressed.</P>
      <P>(d)  <i>Remuneration for jurors.</i>  The present remuneration for jurors is fixed by the Juries Act, 1927, Section 62, at 5/- per head for each case, in the trial of civil issues only, in which a verdict is returned.  No remuneration is available for criminal cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  <i>Undue length of service and inconvenience to jurors attending and not called for service.</i>  It was argued that the period of service of jurors is sometimes too longs.  Duration of service may last for four to eight weeks per terms.  Jurors also complain that, though in attendance, <Col N="1865" /> they are not necessarily selected for service and feel that their time has been wasted in coming to court.</P>
    <P>(f)  <i>Inadequacy of notice to jurors.</i> Complaint was also made that the present notice to jurors is inadequate. Four days notice is required under Section 39 of the Juries Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>(g)  <i>Lack of instructions to jurors.</i> Many jurors complained that they come to court for the first time in complete ignorance of their duties and functions.  In particular, they mentioned the fact that jurors are unaware that they may ask questions to have some point, concerning either evidence or the circumstances of the case generally, explained to them during the hearing. They suggested that a short written summary of instructions should be made available to jurors at the time they are summoned.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court, in the case of Máirín de Búrca and Mary Anderson v. the Attorney General, judgment of which was delivered on the 12th December, 1975, struck down as unconstitutional the requirement of the Juries Act, 1927 whereby there should be a property qualification for jury service.  By a majority verdict, Justice O'Higgins sitting in the same court decided that the method by which women were liable only for service if they applied was an unfair discrimination.  On this side of the House we recognise that this Bill gives effect in large measure to the recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and also gives effect to the Supreme Court decision.  It must be stated that some points dealt with in the report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have not been put into effect.</P>
    <P>With regard to the property qualification, I accept completely that a person's ability to serve on a jury cannot be governed by the extent of the rateable valuation on his house. Under the Jurors Minimum Rating Qualification Order, 1927, Statutory Order No. 92 of 1927 the Minister for Justice fixed property qualification by reference to rateable valuation which <Col N="1866" /> varied considerably from one part of the country to the other, one example being that the qualification in Wexford would be a poor law valuation of £40, whereas in the adjoining county of Waterford the poor law valuation requirement was £15.  Mr. Justice Walsh, in the course of his judgment in the Supreme Court, dealt with the property qualification as follows.  I quote from page 11 where he said:</P>
    <P>It is true that for a long time, before the foundation of the State, and since then, jury service was based upon a property qualification.  So also was the franchise in other periods.  Up to comparatively recent times the franchise in local government elections in this State was based upon a property qualification. The fact of the existence of property qualifications in such circumstances, now and in the past, is not a valid argument to rebut a claim of inconsistency with the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution.  The property qualification undoubtedly discriminates between those citizens who have the qualification and those who have not and does so solely upon the basis of the amount of the poor law valuation of property in a particular district.  This property qualification could not conceivably be said to refer to the physical or moral capacity of a prospective juror.  Can it seriously be suggested that a person who is not the rated occupier of any property or who is not the rated occupier of property of a certain valuation is less intelligent or less honest or less impartial than one who is so rated?  The answer can only be in the negative.  Can such a discrimination be based on social function?  Just as a man's intelligence and honestly is not directly proportionate or proportionate at all to the poor law valuation of his house or lands, which seems to be the underlying assumption of the property qualification, it cannot be said that such a qualification marks him out as having a social function which makes him more fitted for jury services than another, if indeed it does in any way constitute a social function within <Col N="1867" /> the meaning of Article 40, section 1 of the Constitution.  If a case could be made for having the property qualification it could not reasonably be confined to one particular type of property.  It would be just as rational to suggest that jury service should be confined to the owners of motor cars of over a certain horsepower or motor cars of more than a certain value.  This particular type of property qualification totally ignores the realities of wealth.  A man may be a most highly qualified person for jury service and may indeed be a very wealthy man and not be the rated occupier of any property. On the other hand, the rated occupier of property may be illiterate and poverty stricken.  He may even be a person of unsound mind.</P>
    <P>That is what Mr. Justice Walsh had to say.</P>
    <P>I do not share the apprehension felt by some people that because the liability for jury service is spread over a wider range of people, broadly those on the electoral register, subject, of course, to certain exemptions, ineligibility and persons who can get excused, the quality of juries will deteriorate.  I consider that the availability under the new legislation of civil servants and Local Government officials will strengthen the pool from which jurors are drawn.  I consider the extension of the liability of jury service to be a very welcome development.  Its restriction to persons above a certain property qualification was discriminatory and its abolition is timely.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposition that women are now liable to jury service this, too, is a move to be welcomed. It follows from the Supreme Court decision that despite the special constitutional provisions whereby the rights of a mother in a home and the rights of a family are specially dealt with, nevertheless everybody knows the role of women has changed radically in the last 40 to 50 years.  There seems to be no reason in logic or on constitutional grounds, whether jury service is regarded as a privilege or a burden, why it should be restricted to one sex exclusively.  The same <Col N="1868" /> question fell to be decided by the American Supreme Court only last year in the case of Taylor v. Louisiana which is reported in the official reports of the Supreme Court of the United States, column 419, page 522.  In delivering the opinion of the court Mr. Justice White at page 530 said:</P>
    <P>Community participation in the administration of the criminal law, moreover, is not only consistent with our democratic heritage but is also critical to public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system.  Restricting jury service to only special groups or excluding identifiable segments playing major roles in the community cannot be squared with a constitutional concept of jury trial.</P>
    <P>On page 533 of the same report it says:</P>
    <P>There remains the argument that women as a class serve a distinctive role in society and that jury service would so substantially interfere with that function that the State has ample justification for excluding women from service unless they volunteer, even though the result is that almost all jurors are men.  It is true that Hoyt v. Florida 368 U.S. 57 (1961), held that such a system 14 did not deny due process of law or equal protection of the laws because there was a sufficiently rational basis for such an exemption 15. But Hoyt did not involve a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community and the prospect of depriving him of that right if women as a class are systematically excluded.  The right to a proper jury cannot be overcome on merely rational grounds 16. There must be weightier reasons if a distinctive class representing 53 per cent of the eligible jurors is for all practical purposes to be excluded from jury service.</P>
    <P>In the existing service the load was borne by a small group of people, and this of course applied especially in cities.  I hold that this load is unfair, and the spread of the burden of jury service over a wider section of the <Col N="1869" /> community will mean that people will have to answer for jury service less often, though indeed it is provided in the Bill that if a person shows to the satisfaction of the county registrar that he has been called for service within three years he can claim to be exempted.  It might be safely provided that period should be extended to five years.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides that employees and apprentices are to be paid while on juries.  No formal remuneration is provided for the self-employed or the owners of small businesses and so on. The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended that there should be a payment of £2 a day to serving jurors, and if one were to update this to bring that recommendation in line with the value of money, the figure would have to be in the region of £5 per day at present. Provision of some remuneration to serving jurors should not be an undue burden on the State, since the jury burden is so important in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>This section creates a discrimination between certain jurors who are, in effect, will-nilly being paid for their services to the extent that their employers have to reimburse them, and those who happen to make a complete sacrifice by getting no remuneration whatever.  I accept that there was no payment for those serving on criminal juries before this. Payment for those who served on a civil jury was very small indeed, regarded by some as being contemptuous, 25p to each juror.  It was necessary to abolish that absurdity because it brought the whole role of the juror into disrespect.  However, in 1927 the fee of five shillings, or 25p, could at least buy a fairly substantial meal, but nowadays it would not be good enough even to help one with a thirst problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made in the report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure that jurors did not get instructions, the committee have paid attention to this and are of the opinion that it is desirable that advance instructions and information should be made available <Col N="1870" /> to jurors.  They feel that this would be a help to them in the discharge of their function.  The committee accordingly recommended that a brief explanatory list of instructions and information concerning jury service be issued to each juror, preferably at the time he receives his preliminary notice for his summons for service. It is a matter for regret that this has been omitted from the Bill.  We might be able to do something about that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I turn to Part V which deals with offences under the Bill.  The existing penalty for failure to attend court is a fine of £3 which is imposed by the trial judge.  The new requirement is that the person is prosecuted in the District Court and is liable to a fine not exceeding £50.  It seems to me that this is a rather serve maximum penalty for failure to attend.  Also it must surely be a rather expensive form of prosecution, since proof of service of summons would have to be adduced, proof that the man served was liable for jury service would have to be available, his non-attendance at the court would have to be proved, and so on.  The hurdles confronting anyone bringing a prosecution would be quite formidable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of the county registrar set forth in section 9, this seems a common-sense approach to the matter.  The county registrars generally have very wide experience in this matter and understand the situation and the procedures in dealing with people who send in medical certificates and so forth under the existing legislation.  The provision in section 9 (2) whereby a county registrar may excuse any person whom he has summoned for attendance during the whole or any part of the session, if that person shows to his satisfaction why he should be so excused, seems a very sensible approach.</P>
    <P>While dealing with this Bill we have available to us the reports of the discussion of the debate which took place in the Seanad.  That, coupled with the Minister's comprehensive contribution here this morning is a help, in that one can see the arguments that were made in the other <Col N="1871" /> House for any against certain important parts of this Bill.  The question of reducing the age limit to 18 was argued.  I believe this is a step in the right direction, that people at the age of 18 and upwards be given this responsibility.  The Minister and the Government were quite right in adopting the line they did in this regard.  We know the arguments against, but I think the Minister has taken every precaution possible to safeguard against any abuses which might show themselves in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that neither he nor the Government favour any form of remuneration or payment for jury service, except those covered by section 59 of the Bill, those who are guaranteed their payment by their employers. Civic duty is something that we all talk about, and if we do not we should as often as we can.  We need to be conscious of it.  Perhaps our educational system is showing its lead here, since in recent years we have had civics courses in our schools.  I still believe, as was stated in the report on jury service I mentioned earlier, that some compensation should be made even though these people will be called only very rarely.  Civic duty can mean different things to different people.  Civic duty is acceptable to those who will not be faced with hardship or who will not be faced with a burden when called on for jury service; of course, they will face up to their responsibilities and do what is required of them.  However, now that we are considerably broadening the base of eligibility for jury service, the Minister and those advising him have seemingly overlooked one very important section of people.  Perhaps their thinking was orientated to urban or city life, but they completely forgot about a problem which any rural Member of this House would see immediately.</P>
    <P>At the present time&mdash;and I am not saying this to score any political point &mdash;there are approaching 120,000 people unemployed.  About 99 per cent of them, that is those over 18 years of age, are, I am sure, on the register of electors.  There are, in addition to this <Col N="1872" /> number, also on the register a sizeable number of people who are in receipt of allowances from health boards to enable them to subsist.  If a single man drawing £7 or £8 a week social welfare benefit or a married man drawing more because of his dependants, is called for our jury service, is he exempted because he cannot afford to go?</P>
    <P>If such a person has to travel from west Cork to Cork city, from west Limerick to Limerick city or from the west of any county to the county town, distances sometimes involving journeys of up to 70 miles, does he get free transport?  Will he get a voucher for it? If the case goes on more than four or five hours necessitating his stay overnight in a hotel or elsewhere for bed and breakfast, is he expected to pay for this out of his £7 or £8 social welfare benefit?  If he is, it is grossly unfair. If a married man with £20 social welfare benefit on which to keep his wife and children has to give jury service on the same lines as I have stated, that is not civic duty; it is a hardship.  It must be a hardship because the allowances, generous though they might be, are not sufficient other than to keep these people just above the breadline. I would like the Minister to examine this problem and see if anything can be done about it.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the 120,000 people who are in the queues for the dole at the labour exchanges, I would remind the House that one of the requirements that must be met for these people to qualify for allowances every week is that they be available for work.  Are they available if they are on jury service?  If they are offered a job on the day they are offered jury service, which comes first?</P>
    <P>I am not very happy about section 14, which deals with the summoning of jurors to make up a deficiency.  I propose to put down an amendment to the section on Committee Stage.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  If it appears to a judge of a court that a jury to try any issue before the court will or may be incomplete, the judge may require any persons (being persons qualified and <Col N="1873" /> liable to serve as jurors in that court) to be summoned by the county registrar in order to make up the number needed.</P>
    <P>(2)  The judge shall specify the area from which persons may be summoned (which may be the area in the vicinity of the court) and the method of summons, whether by written notice or otherwise.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of the parable about the man who gave the wedding feast to which nobody turned up and he sent his servants out to the streets to ask people to come in to participate in what was going on.  There is a touch of that about this section, and maybe we could talk about it in more detail later on.  I would like to see section 15 tidied up.  Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>Before the selection is begun the judge shall warn the jurors present that they must not serve if they are ineligible or disqualified and as to the penalty under section 36 for doing so; and he shall invite any person who knows that he is not qualified to serve or who is in doubt as to whether he is qualified or who may have an interest in or connection with the case or the parties to communicate the fact to the judge (either orally or otherwise as the judge may direct or authorise) if he is selected on the ballot.</P>
    <P>A warning might not be good enough. As the base of selection of jurors is so broad, I think the judge should do more than warn, that he should explain fully what is involved to people who might not be as familiar with the situation as the Minister or the judge or anybody else might think they were.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the method of swearing a jury.  The Minister makes the argument that the swearing in of jurors separately would lead to greater solemnity.  I have not been in too many courtrooms in my life, thank God. The once or twice I was there, unfortunately I was there on business and had to be sworn in, and I hope I do not have to go back too often.  When I was being sworn in as an individual the rí rá and the ruaille buaille that was going on at the back of the court almost distracted myself.  I do not <Col N="1874" /> mean any disrespect to our courts: there is meant to be silence but in fact this is not so, as I am sure the legal profession, who are much more familiar with what happens in these places than I am, would probably agree.  I accept the argument put forward by the Minister, but I do not think it will achieve what the Minister wants it to achieve, that is, solemnity, so that the person realises he is swearing an oath to God to tell the truth, the whole truth.  That solemnity would not be helped by the fact that while people are being sworn in one by one, we are possibly running the risk of distraction at the back of the court.  I agree with the Minister that, in principle, if it could be done it would be very valuable.  Perhaps if we gave discretion to the judge under this section to decide whether it should be done on the individual basis or done as a group, that might be a worthwhile consideration on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides:</P>
    <P>With a view to securing consistency in the administration of this Act, the Minister may issue instructions to county registrars with regard to the practice and the procedure to be adopted by them in the discharge of their duties under this Act: but nothing in this section shall authorise the Minister to issue any instruction as to whether particular persons should or should not be summoned for service as jurors or, if summoned, should not be excused from attendance in accordance with the summons.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is room for argument on both sides.  Perhaps it might be better if whatever instructions, or whatever directions, are being given would be given not just as an instruction from the Minister's office to the county registrars but in the form of a statutory instrument.  That might be better.  It can be considered at a later stage as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I think this is my first time to say this to the Minister. This Bill is certainly a step in the right direction.  I am sorry I could not say the same about other Bills he has before the House at present.  I will <Col N="1875" /> give credit where credit is due.  We will do everything we can to facilitate. the Minister in getting this Bill through and having it in operation very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention will be brief.  I rise to welcome the Bill.  It is a somewhat overdue piece of progressive legislation.  I commend the Minister on its introduction.  I hope it will get a speedy passage and be enacted as law in the shortest time possible.  It is now over ten years since the Committee on Court practice and procedure recommended changes in the Juries Act of 1927.  Despite considerable pressure, particularly from women's organisations who are incensed by the diminution of the rights of women contained in the 1927 Act, it is fair to say that successive Ministers for Justice failed to introduce this necessary legislation.  I accept the Minister's statement that consultations were required and technical difficulties had to be overcome.</P>
      <P>There are four main provisions in the Bill.  First there is the change in the system whereby landowners of a certain valuation only, and over, were liable for jury service and the replacement of this by the extension of the liability for jury service to all persons between the ages of 18 and 70 years. This is a very welcome innovation in the law.  The second change is that women are no longer exempt and are now liable just as men are.  On the Minister's own admission this morning, this is the main change brought about by the legislation.  The Minister said that in the ten years up to 1974 only nine women applied for jury service and only three women actually served.  He went on to say that 84,000 persons in all served as jurors.  This demonstrates the small number of citizens who were involved in this service.  It also demonstrates the very small part women were allowed to play in decision making in this area as in all other areas in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of women is long overdue and it is welcomed by all women's organisations and all people interested in giving full civil rights to <Col N="1876" /> women.  The inference that all the capacity for judgment, all the integrity, all the general qualifications required for jury service could be found only in the holders of a considerable acreage of land and that these virtues reposed principally or exclusively in the male sex was highly offensive to women and it was also offensive to the general body of the population.  It constituted discrimination against women on the grounds of sex.  It also discriminated against people with no property.</P>
    <P>The other provisions mainly are that jurors will be selected at random rather than by strict rotation according to their place on the jurors' book.  That is also fair.  We have the abolition of the Attorney General's right to stand by jurors.  He is placed in the same position as the prosecution with regard to challenging jurors.  This is a laudable change.  On section 29 and the question of the payment or remuneration of jurors, I might have one reservation.  I believe that the remuneration of all jurors is the right course to take.  The same argument was made at one time against the remuneration of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not think the remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas has in any way interfered with their sense of duty, or their service to the community, or with the performance of their duties.  Again on the subject of women's rights, section 29 will discriminate against women who are employed in the home, housewives whose services in the home have never been recognised in terms of money.  If they engaged somebody to perform their duties in the home no compensation was forthcoming.  This would curtail them in the performance of their duties as jurors.  The same argument could be advanced in favour of self-employed people.  Self-employed people would be said to have some form of income.  Married women who work in the home should be given some form of remuneration to allow them to leave their home and perform their duties as jurors.  Otherwise very few married women will be able to leave their homes to perform this duty no matter how much they may be personally inclined or anxious to do so.</P>
    <P>I am also very much in favour of <Col N="1877" /> extending the right to jury service to persons of 18 years of age.  I know arguments are advanced for and against the extension of the age of eligibility to people of 18 years to 21 years. Maturity is not strictly related to ages. There are immature people of all ages. Other rights and duties of adult citizens have now been extended to 18-year-olds. They have voting rights.  They have always performed military service. Young offenders have a right to be tried by a jury consisting partly of persons in their own age group.  Apart from the administrative difficulties which I know will be very great, as of right people of 18 years plus should be able to serve as jurors.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House. This is a very worthwhile measure.  It is long overdue.  I commend the Minister heartily on the introduction of the Bill.  It will eliminate much of the injustice which existed in our society with regard to the administration of the law.  We can have further discussions on Committee Stage.  It is my wish that it should be passed through this House and become law in the shortest number of days possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure every Member of the House will welcome this Bill and endeavour to give it a speedy passage through the House.  I welcome it for a wide variety of reasons.  It extends the jury panel. Since the original Act was passed there certainly is a different attitude to the rights and obligations of the public at large in the discharge of their civic responsibilities.  When one looks at the removal of the property qualification one recognises that here we are giving expression to a major change in society since the passage of the 1927 Act.  At that time the property qualification was taken to be confirmation of responsibility and lack of property brought into question whether or not one had some measure of responsibility.  That approach has long since vanished.  If I have any criticism&mdash;it is not very valid though cogent&mdash;it is that it would have been as well for a Bill of this kind to have been introduced before the necessity for doing so arose as a result of the <Col N="1878" /> Supreme Court decision.  That does not lessen my support for this measure but had two citizens not taken the action they did, even despite the commission's recommendations, we might have had to wait considerably longer for this Bill.  I am sure the Minister will admit it is long overdue.  I am not apportioning blame.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that but the Bill is not that complex and could well have been under way some time back.  It is not a major point but it does illustrate that to some extent extensions of the law depend on the actions of citizens.  That is a very healthy thing.  We may not always agree with the political attitudes of those taking these actions but such actions give an impetus, and only an impetus, to the administration and the Legislature in updating the law in order to take account of developments.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be a major contributions to court procedures.  More important still, it will increase the respect citizens should have for the courts.  Time and time again here we have stressed how important it is that the position of our courts, a special position written into the Constitution, defining precisely the doctrine of the separation of powers and functions, is fully respected and, to ensure that, it is vitally important that citizens would be allowed as far as possible to involve themselves in court procedures because doing so will increase their respect for the courts.  The courts are there to protect the liberty of citizens and ensure their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some comment on extending the panel to include young people of 18.  These young people are now qualified to vote and they appear on the register of electors.  We recall <Col N="1879" /> the heart searching when the question of allowing people of 18 to vote arose. The reality is that the more people are excluded from their responsibilities and rights the more irresponsible they are likely to be.  I do not say they will be but the fact that they are now eligible to vote makes it a matter of inevitable consistency that they should serve on jury panels trying issues of liberty where fellow citizens are concerned.  Many of these will be of the same age group.  They will also be called upon to try issues of right as between infringements or injury suffered by citizens, if not through criminal act certainly through negligence in the civil law. This is vitally important.</P>
    <P>I suspect the remote cause for the Bill, if one applies the old distinction in regard to battles and wars, was the exclusion of women from jury service. There have been debates on the role of women in our society and there are many women who do not take the same determined view as to the new role.  There are some women who see their role as the fundamental one of mother, looking after and caring for children, ensuring their moral and social welfare.  No one can ever take from the significance of that role.  It is recognised in our Constitution and it gives women, in my view, a very special place in society.  That is not to say new roles should not be given to them.  With the wide discretion given to county registrars women who, for one reason or another, prefer looking after their homes will be in a position to seek release from jury service.  The choice is there.  The Bill recognises the special position they have.  This is not cutting across increasing involvement by women, both married and single, in the country's affairs.  I hope that involvement will continue.  There is a notable absence of women in Government and also in the Dáil and Seanad.  Nevertheless, this Bill is significant because it represents the right of women, if they so wish, to involve themselves fully in the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>Coming to juries now, on the criminal side one has the right to be tried by one's peers.  This is long <Col N="1880" /> established in the law of our country, even in the inherited law.  It is a very special provision which means that so far as a person's liberty is concerned he cannot be deprived of it except by the judgment of his peers.  That is vitally important.  Equally, it is important that the panel be extended to include peers in the real sense of the word.  Having regard to the social conditions, it happens that there may be a higher proportion of young people on trial for criminal offences than those in the older age groups. This is not to decry young people.  As people get older they may become more responsible and mature, less inclined to rebel and to react to events. Very seldom do we find a person of 70 years on trial for his liberty but this can happen more frequently to an 18- or a 20-year-old.</P>
    <P>That being so, it is most important that young people be included on the panel to give that balance and to integrate them further into society. To a certain extent the distinctions are still being too vigorously applied.  I have been impatient about this for some time.  For a period I had responsibility for youth policy, which incidentally is noticeably absent in the Governments proposals.  I always tried to put across to youth organisations with whom I had associations that the organisations and the young people should not look on themselves alone as being in a special compartment of society.  Each age group is in a special compartment and it is only when this is recognised that it is possible to see where each has its obligations to the other.  I accept that 18- or 22-years-old people are under particular pressure from commercial organisations but they are in a special compartment only to the extent that the same applies to people of 60 years or 70 years.  It is only in the mix of responsibility that one gets a happy and secure community. In contrast to the problems that exist in some cities, the distinction between youth and the aged is not as great in rural Ireland.  For that reason there is more integration between the young and old in rural areas; for example, they join in local parish functions or they may play <Col N="1881" /> cards together, to a degree that does not happen in the cities.  We should begin to consider if that is in any way responsible for the problems of delinquency in the cities and, if so, perhaps we should consider having community activities in the cities.</P>
    <P>In my view, including young people on juries is a step in the right direction. It will guarantee that those who determine the liberty or imprisonment of their peers are drawn from all sections. It will also mean that the young people will have an increased sense of involvement and responsibility and that can only do good.</P>
    <P>When we were in government we introduced the provisions enabling the Special Criminal Court to be established. This is a court that does not have a jury as applies in other cases. It was necessary then and, in my view, it was necessary now that that court should continue to operate in the circumstances of today.  However, I hope the Government are keeping constantly in mind the fact that it is most desirable and important that as soon as possible trial by jury be applied as distinct from trial in the Special Criminal Court.  Where there is a doubt as to whether a person should be tried by a jury or in the Special Criminal Court, in my view it should be resolved in favour of trial by jury. This guarantees that the public and those who have responsibility are given the onus and the right to try people to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Even in ordinary criminal cases the view is sometimes expressed that juries generally are rather more lenient than a judge might be on his own.  That is possibly fair as a general comment.  If so, one must recognise that it is a judgment of 12 representative people and if they are not satisfied that the prosecution have discharged their responsibilities or have proved the matter beyond all reasonable doubt their verdict is the verdict of the people.  That is their obligation and their right.  The oath they have taken obliges to do that.</P>
    <P>There may be faults and blemishes in the system but this is the guarantee we have that people will not be convicted <Col N="1882" /> unless a jury, as distinct from an individual judge who has a legal attitude, are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the matter.  It is likely that judges with their legal experience, and possibly with their experience of watching people's demeanour in court and the way they answer questions, might take a rather different view if it were left to them.  It is not left to them and they are glad of this. On occasions they might convict where juries would not.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that all cases going before the Special Criminal Court be appropriate cases to be tried by that court.  There have been one or two cases where people have felt there was some doubt as to whether persons should be tried before the court.  In my opinion that doubt should be resolved in favour of trial by criminal juries in the ordinary way.  It is a matter about which we must be eternally vigilant.  I recognise the function of the Special Criminal Court, the way in which they have discharged their responsibilities and their importance to the security of the State.  Equally, I recognise they should not be asked to deal with every case.  Grave consideration must be given before a case is referred to them for trial.</P>
    <P>We have been discussing the solemnity of the oath and the provisions in this Bill for taking the oath. I share the concern of our spokesman in relation to the manner in which the oath is sometimes taken in court.  It is fair to say that the judges have become aware of this.  In the courts in which I practice they insist that while the oath is being taken there must be absolute and total silence and stillness.  People are not allowed to move around the court or to talk.  The oath is not something that should be taken as a matter of course because it is a very special affirmation before God, and while a person is taking the oath, such a solemn affirmation, there must be total recognition of what that involves, total silence and an opportunity given to the person taking the oath to concerntrate on what he is doing.</P>
    <P>In the District Court in cases of summary jurisdiction gardaí are called to give evidence regularly.  Indeed, they <Col N="1883" /> are the most numerous witnesses in driving and lighting-up offences.  Each of them has to take the oath and this in the nature of things means that in the course of a sitting each of them must be sworn several times.  The Minister may be aware that some gardaí have expressed apprehension about the necessity for taking the oath on all such occasions.  They are aware of the solemnity of the oath.  A garda cannot give evidence without being sworn and I am sure the Minister has had some communication from them expressing concern because for every single minor case they have to take the oath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>An opportunity may arise again.  I thought it appropriate to give expression to a reservation <Col N="1884" /> and apprehension which I know a large number of gardaí have.  The Minister does not seem to share the view.  I am not saying the oath should be abolished but in some cases some consideration should be given to it and, of course, a similar provision would have to be applied to defence witnesses in such cases.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of procedural problems, the Bill gives county registrars a discretion which I welcome.  They are to be given extra responsibilities and obligations in relation to juries, summoning, registering and so on, and it seems clear this will involve increasing burdens on them and their staffs.  This inevitably will mean increased expenditure of which the Minister will, of course, have taken account.  That being so, why cannot the Minister accept the suggestion that for appropriate cases there should be payment for jury service? It is not likely there would be more than 12 juries sitting throughout the country in any one day.  If you were to pay each member of a jury £5, each jury would cost £60 per day, £720 for 12 juries, £3,600 per week. Therefore, the annual cost would not be any more than £200,000 if every juror was to be paid.  There will be no loss of earnings in some cases because they will be secured by the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that there are people who would suffer fairly heavy financial loss through jury service although I appreciate that even some self-employed people might not suffer.  That does not mean there should not be some provision for payment to the minority who will suffer because of jury service and as I said, if we were to pay all jurors it would not amount to more than £200,000 annually.  There should at least be a provision whereby those who would actually suffer financial loss would be paid at the rate of £5 per day.  I do not think it would cripple the Exchequer nor do I think it would imply that because some people were being paid they were not fully cognisant of their civic responsibility.  As Deputy Desmond pointed out, there was a time when service in this House was regarded as a civic responsibility <Col N="1885" /> which should have little or no remuneration. Indeed, the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; in the Constitution gives expression to that attitude.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, we all recognise that service in the Oireachtas can be very demanding, is very important and deserves to be remunerated.  Likewise, in a lengthy criminal trial jurors can serve for three weeks or more and we must take account of such exceptional cases.  I am not one to advocate extension of the financial burden in any area&mdash;one must keep a critical eye on expenditure&mdash;but the Minister must have considered this matter and, perhaps, he will tell us when he is replying what he estimated the cost would be if payment was made to those suffering actual financial loss by serving.  If he says he rejects this suggestion on the basis that jury service is a civic responsibility which would be tainted by payment, I reject that argument. People should not be penalised financially for fulfilling their responsibilities. I know it is not something which we can propose by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  It would involve, and I would suggest to a very limited extent, a charge on the Revenue and, therefore, our hands are tied on this side of the House.  The Minister's hands are not tied.  He might have another look at it to see whether the question of payment to people who will suffer loss should be included.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say why in civil cases a majority verdict of nine will be sufficient to determine the jury's verdict, and in criminal cases it must be unanimous?  Why has that not been written into the Bill?  This is an established fact.  The Minister says, rightly, that this is a consolidating statute and will now be a statute to which we will all refer when we look at the function of juries, their rights and obligations but there is no reference in the Bill to the nature of the verdicts and whether or not it will be a majority verdict in civil cases or a unanimous verdict in criminal cases. Could the Minister, through his advisers give us any reason why a specific reference was not made to that in the Bill, that this very desirable <Col N="1886" /> goal, that of unanimity, and it is one that is not applied universally in every other country, is not maintained in this Bill, and that of the majority verdict in civil cases is not written into the Bill?</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to refer to relates to the question of what seems to be a small thing, the selection of the foreman of the jury.  Up to the moment, as everyone knows, it is done quite simply because the first person sworn becomes <i>ipso facto</i> the foreman of the jury.  There is a great element of chance in that selection. Equally, there is a great element of chance in the selection of the jury in any event.  Everyone recognises that the selection of the foreman materialises simply because of the fact that he is the first person sworn.  I wonder if it is necessary to change it to the extent the Minister proposes.  The Minister suggests that it will be done by the decision of the jurors themselves. These will be men and women who, to a very considerable extent, will not know one another.  I do not know what procedures will be applied in this case. The jury will retire into their room. One of them will propose somebody or other.  Maybe it will be the strong-willed person on the jury, the fellow who goes in and talks most for the first three minutes in the room.  Perhaps he will be proposed.  He may be a suitable foreman who will express the jury's view or ask the questions competently to the judge.  We know how chairmen are generally selected at meetings.  The fellow who decides that he is going to make his voice heard above others generally says a few appropriate words at the appropriate time.  When it comes to selecting a chairman someone proposes that man because he is fairly sound, or at least not too timorous to speak out.  He may not be the right kind of person to have as foreman of the jury.  For that reason why the proposed change?  There is no special authority attaching to the foreman at the moment, except that he must record the verdict and hand it to the judge.</P>
    <P>Under the new proposal he will have the extra authority that he is now a man selected, probably haphazardly by his or her fellow jurors <Col N="1887" /> who will not know him or her and who will decide he or she is their foreman.  There is the possibility that he may decide to exert his authority in some cases in a way in which it would be better not to exert it. Allowing that the present system is haphazard as is the selection of jurors, I wonder why the Minister thought this was a desirable proposal and if he thought through the proposals and their consequences.  Apart from that, there could be a delay involved.  A ridiculous situation could arise if at the beginning of the trial, there is an extra delay now as each man has to be sworn individually.  That will take some extra time.  Then the jury retire to their room.  If the accused and the judge and the representatives of both sides are waiting some time while the decision as to who will be foreman of the jury is being determined inside, there could be a delay. What happens supposing there cannot be a decision?</P>
    <P>Section 15, subsection (4) says:</P>
    <P>The foreman shall be such member as the jurors shall choose and the choice shall be made at such time as the judge may direct or, in the absence of a direction, before the jury bring in their verdict or make any other communication to the judge.</P>
    <P>The judge can tell the jurors to make the choice.  He can hardly tell them to make it when they are sitting in the box because then it is not making a choice at all.  In practice, in many cases, this may not pose a problem.  It seems from that that they do not, in fact, have to select a foreman before they retire because the subsection says: &ldquo;...or in the absence of a direction, before the jury bring in their verdict...&rdquo; It is quite open and feasible, apparently, under that provision, that when they retire to consider their verdict they can also at that stage for the first time decide on who their foreman is to be. That might not pose a problem, but I would not like to think that the start of a trial could be held up pending the selection of the foreman of the <Col N="1888" /> jury.  I would not like to think that this matter, which is not of considerable importance, should in any way interfere with the main function of the jury, that is, coming to an appropriate verdict in civil or criminal cases.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Collins that the present £3 fine is far too small having regard to the fact that many people have willingly stayed away in the knowledge that £3 would be very small in comparison with the financial loss they would suffer if they attended. Nevertheless a fine of up to £50 on summary conviction is going the other way.  This could give rise to undue problems in some cases.  The simpler thing would be to increase the maximum fine at the discretion of the court but to make it an offence liable to a fine on summary conviction of £50 is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  Again, it will give rise to extra procedures in court.  It will give rise to extra trouble.  The Minister may be concerned about saving a few £s on jury service but he may be throwing away a great deal more in the procedures which will have to be amended where cases of this sort are brought before the District Court.</P>
    <P>With these comments and these limited reservations, I certainly welcome the Bill generally.  It is in spirit and in detail the type of legislation we require at the moment in regard to juries, I am quite sure that in practice, allowing for the few limited reservations I have expressed, jury service will be, in fact, what it should be, the verdict of the people in the real sense of the word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it in so far as the Bill repeals all the existing provisions of the law relating to jury service so that the relevant law will be contained in one Act.  I also welcome the fact that the ladies will now be liable to jury service.  That is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had considerable hesitation regarding the reduction of the age limit for jury service from 21 to 18.  When I read the Bill for the first time I thought that that was not a good thing but <Col N="1889" /> having heard the Minister and the various Deputies who have spoken in this debate I have changed my mind. As the Minister says, it would be very difficult to have a minimum age of 21 in respect of this Bill because of the fact that the electors list is made out on the basis of a minimum age of 18 years.  The increase in the number of juryment who may be challenged, from five to seven, is an adequate safeguard.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of section 34 with the Minister and what I say about that section can be said also about sections 35, 36 and 37, but the number of cases to be dealt with under sections 35, 36 and 37 will not be as high.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Opposition speakers that £50 is too high a penalty. It is not the minimum figure.  I take it that £50 is the maximum figure and that whoever hears a case will take into account the circumstances of the person who had committed the wrong.</P>
    <P>What worries me about section 34 is the summary conviction provided for. That means that before a person is made liable to pay a fine under that section proceedings have to be brought in the District Court.  That is a very cumbersome procedure.  The District Court is already overburdened with work.  A much simpler procedure could be adopted.  I would suggest to the Minister that instead of this cumbersome procedure of having to take out a summons and bring the person before the District Court, the judge hearing the case for which the jury was being empanelled would fine the juryman who did not attend and that court would send out a notice to the juryman concerned to the effect that he had failed to attend for jury service on a certain date and that he was fined the sum of, say, £10 and that a judge of the High Court would sit on such and such a day to hear any representations he might wish to make in regard to the imposition of that fine.  That would be a much simpler arrangement. A high Court judge could sit in the High Court one day on which jury cases were not being heard and that would mean that there would be time <Col N="1890" /> and a court available to hear such cases.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a Circuit Court judge could sit on a certain date to be arranged, in the Circuit Court, to hear cases where persons had failed to attend for jury service in that court. That would be a much simpler procedure and would be easily adopted and it would lead to less internal administration than the procedure set out in the sections I have referred to would involve.  I would press the Minister to amend section 34 and I suggest that he should adopt the procedure I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Again, I would congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  The Bill is a good Bill.  It is a good thing that the law is being set out in this one Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to you, Sir and to the House for my croaking voice.  I hope you will be able to hear what I have to say.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues on both sides of the House, I welcome the Bill but I do so with many more reservations than my colleagues appear to have about the Bill.  The Bill could be likened to the curate's egg.  There are good parts and there are bad parts. When they are good, they are very, very good and when they are bad they are horrid.  The parts that I complain about are merely procedural and technical matters and I will deal with them as briefly as possible in a moment.</P>
      <P>I do appreciate the dilemma created for the Minister by the de Búrca case. He had to produre the legislation in a hurry and the Bill bears all the marks of being hastily drawn.  That is a pity because had the Minister been given the opportunity to take more time with the Bill he would have availed himself of that opportunity to produce a major piece of law reform.</P>
      <P>I agree completely with the revolutionary and far-reaching changes which have been introduced in the Bill, particularly the extension of the right to women and those over 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has many shortcomings.  It would be better if the Minister withdrew it and replaced it with a short Bill, an interim measure, to rectify <Col N="1891" /> only the constitutional objections in the present jury legislation.  Deputy Collins dealt with the unemployment situation at the moment and painted a picture of 120,000 unemployed.  All these people should be readily available for jury service.  Many of them are teenagers. It would have been better to delay this Bill until &ldquo;Richie the Rake&rdquo; puts the country into some kind of economic condition to allow us to have not alone law reform but every other kind of reform.  I do not see any point in having this type of reform until this rake's progress is halted.  This is another piece of diversion.</P>
    <P>I will deal as briefly as possible with the technical objections I have to this legislation.  I object to the transfer of the duties of sheriff to the county registrar.  There is no need for this.  As far as I know it applies only to the cities of Dublin and Cork because the county registrar is the county sheriff in all the other cities.  It will involve additional staff who must be trained and it will involve additional work for the county registrar who must get more money for it.  I would have left the situation as it is.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the sending to county registrars of the registers as soon as they are compiled.  As far as I understand it under the Electoral Act there is an obligation on those who compile the county registers to send them to the registrars.  Sections 12 and 13 deal with the serving of jury summons but it does not state specifically by whom the service will be carried out.  Are the Garda no longer qualified to do it?  If they are, will they do it? Are they under a duty to do it?  There is no right conferred on them by any of the provisions of this Bill to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced into the Bill what I call two random sections, sections 11 and 14.  Section 11 provides for non-discriminatory selection. There should be some directions given to a county registrar to compel him to use some pattern in the selection of jurors from the panel.  If that is not done, there will not be uniformity in any part of the country.  County registrars will do it in different ways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> I do not know if they will have a private sweep of their own with the names of all those liable for jury service in a drum, or if they will engage in some kind of game of their own to elect a panel of jurors.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the summoning of jurors to make up a deficiency. That is a random procedure.  At what time, the beginning of a trial or during the trial, will the judge decide there is a deficiency of jurors and how will he select them?  Will he send somebody out to the highways and byways to march people in?  Nobody is appointed under this section to do this work.  Who will select them?  What powers have they got to go out into the highways and byways to get people to come in and serve on a jury?  Will it be by arrest or request that these deficient jurors will be brought into the court?  What will happen in the meantime? If the court is in progress and if there are five, six or nine jurors sworn, what will happen to the judge and the sworn jurors while somebody is out in the highways and byways looking for the jurors that are needed?</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the selection of a foreman.  This has already been referred to by Deputy Collins.  He asked the Minister a number of questions. It is not clear in the section what jurors the foreman is selected from, whether it is from the jurors who try that action or the whole panel of jurors. I presume it is one of the jurors selected to try a particular case, one of the 12 just men, but again I am not certain what method will be used.  Will it be by simple majority of the 12 men? Will the judge give them any indication which of them will be chosen as foreman?  If six are for a particular way of selecting the foreman and six are against that, there will be a deadlock. What happens then?</P>
    <P>I can visualise a jury spending the whole day deciding amongst themselves who should be foreman or, as it is phrased in the section: &ldquo;the choice shall be made at such time...&rdquo;.  It is too vague in regard to procedure, time and method.  I would ask the Minister to visualise a situation where 100 jurors are brought in to try a case.  Twelve jurors are on the panel and the rest are <Col N="1893" /> dismissed for the day.  If they cannot agree amongst themselves on the foreman, the day is wasted and you have to wait until the following day to pick another jury.</P>
    <P>In section 16 (1) provision is made for free copies of the jury panel for all the parties involved in both criminal and civil cases.  When the High Court is sitting in Cork 300 or 400 jury men are called each day.  There will probably be more now with the very much enlarged numbers who have a right to serve on juries.  All the interested parties are therefore entitled, under section 16 (4) to apply at the county registrar's office.  There could be 150 to 200 cases listed for decision for the two sittings in the year in Cork.  Of course, the registrar's office will be bombarded by the parties in these actions seeking copies of the panel, which I submit is waste and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 to 21 deal with the empanelling of jurors.  This, as we all know, is the introduction of the American jury system.  I do not want to dwell on it because it has been mentioned by a number of speakers, but it could involve a delay of weeks. I have particularly in mind the Hearst case which is being tried in America at the moment and in which it took between a fortnight and three weeks to empanel the jury.  We could easily have that situation here, especially with a lot of young people; I am not suggesting they are irresponsible but they are certainly not experienced in these matters.  Parties to a trial could stand by and object to up to seven people, and more with cause shown, which could lead to an intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 25 could the Minister say what happens if the judge directs the jurors to stay together during a trial which lasts two or three days or a week?  There is no provision in this Bill for putting anybody in charge of the jury.  At the moment when a jury is sworn an officer of the court and a member of the Garda Síochána are sworn to what one would call, mind the jury during the course of a trial.  Will that procedure be continued? If so, why is there no statutory provision?  If the jury have to remain in an hotel overnight who will pay for it?  At present juries are entitled <Col N="1894" /> to receive a meal when the court rises at lunch time, which is usually for an hour or an hour-and-a-quarter. I see no provision for that.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this provision should be specifically written into the Bill.  I must apologise when I say I do not know whether it was written into other Juries Acts.  Certainly it is done.  They can, as a matter of right, get this meal.  Are they to ramble around the streets and into pubs?  Will there be a member of the Garda Síochána and an officer of the courts in charge of them?  Are they to be kept together during the trial, if necessary, overnight?  Who will be in charge of them?</P>
    <P>The question of remuneration for jurors has been mentioned by many people.  This is a perennial cause of complaint by jurors.  The British pay their jurors.  They pay them subsistence allowances, travelling expenses, and loss of earnings. I do not know why we cannot do that.  Our economic state is not much worse than Britain's&mdash;it is not very much better either.  I cannot see why we cannot do it.  I appreciate that it would cost quite a considerable amount of money, but jurors are fulfilling a duty, and carrying out an obligation which is absolutely essential for the maintenance of law and order.  They should not be at any loss. They should not be out of pocket. There is provision for paying apprentices and people in employment.  The words used in the Bill are &ldquo;under contract of service&rdquo;.  What about the self-employed?  What about the unemployed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>Who will pay them? They have the same right to be on a jury as anyone else.  What will happen to a person who has not got the train fare to travel from Bantry or Skibbereen to Cork city, who cannot get a drive and who cannot get there, and who is supposed to be there every morning at 10.15 and then get home at night and back again the following morning?  Will that be a reasonable excuse?  Is that reasonable cause?  Does that person have to go into the District <Col N="1895" /> Court and employ a solicitor to defend himself or herself?  If these are good defences they should be written into the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the case of apprentices and other employees I should like to know what about those who appear in court every morning and who are not called or empanelled?  What will they do for the rest of the day?  Will they be paid if they are idle?  The juries will be empanelled in a quarter of an hour.  What will happen to the others who are called?  Many are called but not all are chosen.  The only one chosen is the foreman.  What will happen to the others for the rest of the day?  The employer must pay them for two or three weeks.  I do not know how long the session lasts in Dublin.  It is probably five or six weeks.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in a case where jurors are not empanelled, they should be issued with a certificate from the county registrar of attendance but non-service which they could produce.  I also suggest that a certificate of exemption should be given by the county registrar to jurors who are exempt for a period of two, three or ten years.  This is a frequent occurrence when jurors get involved in a lengthy trial.  These certificates would eliminate a great deal of trouble.  They would also eliminate the necessity to make application to the county registrar to see whether they were exempt.  It would avoid the necessity of going into court to tell the judge that a person was called again in this random fashion.</P>
      <P>I already mentioned the question of the increase in the number of challenges.  I believe that will lead to enormous delays and dreadful problems, especially in criminal matters. We are all in agreement on the solemnity of the occasion of swearing.  I do not know whether it is a statutory requirement that the Testament should be taken in the right hand. That is always done.  It is not stated whether it should be taken in the right hand or in the left hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual swearing of jurors and the multiplicity of challenges allowed under this Bill will lead to delays. <Col N="1896" /> I do not think it would detract from the solemnity of the occasion if jurors were sworn, as they now are, in batches.  I see nothing at all wrong with that.  I do not agree with my colleague on what he said about the administration of the oath.  I do not know what court he was in. Certainly in the High Court due solemnity is observed by everybody. Perhaps I would agree in a very serious criminal matter that there should be separate swearing.  In criminal matters, if the accused insists upon it, he should have the right to have the jury sworn in individually. Otherwise they should be sworn as they have been heretofore.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I should have mentioned when I was talking about the choice of a foreman.  It occurs to me now that very often a jury is sworn to try two or three cases or several cases.  When a foreman is chosen, is he the foreman for one case, or for two, three or several cases?  Is it necessary to have a separate foreman for each trial?</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time to pay tribute to all the people who in the past have served on juries and we should express our thanks to them for their contribution to law and order at all times.  That contribution has been a significant one since the foundation of the State.  Under the new system juries may be better or they may be worse, but they will certainly never be the same.  I have had some experience of juries and I never failed to be impresssed by their intelligence and their integrity and, very often, their courage. I think it was the late Seán Lemass who said, in relation to the Cabinet, that it should be representative, like a jury.  Instead of having a whole lot of whiz kids it should have a representative mix.  I believe he was right.  He was not speaking about his own Cabinet and I am not referring to the present Cabinet.  I will say no more. I should not like the Minister to think I was referring to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important measure consolidating the law relating to juries.  Obviously a great deal of thought has gone into the measure. The Minister referred to the Walsh Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. The recommendations of that committee were made many years ago and it was fully intended that the law should be brought up to date in regard to jury service. However, it took the de Búrca case to bring about the reality.  The case was a fine example of an individual pursuing a civil right. The plaintiff is to be congratulated. Indeed more people should be encouraged to bring questions of constitutional law before the courts.  They should not be discouraged by expense or otherwise from pursuing such cases.</P>
      <P>The Bill incorporates all the law in relation to jury service.  Trial by jury is probably one of the hallmarks of civilisation.  It is a satisfying experience on a Tuesday morning in the country to see the large numbers travelling into the county town ready and willing to serve on a jury.  Of course, the atmosphere in a particular area or existing conditions may not always be suitable and in Border counties cases are often transferred to the Central Criminal Court.  There are objections to this being done from the point of view of the interests of the accused person.  We can also point to the Special Criminal Court as another diminution of the concept that an accused person be tried by 12 of this peers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that people get the Government they deserve.  I believe they also get the law they deserve in the sense that if, in a Border area, it invariably turns out that an accused person will be acquitted that tends to weaken the law and diminish respect for the law.  I have known people serving on juries to say at the end of the day that the accused was culpable but he got off.  I do not mind that so much because any accused person <Col N="1898" /> being tried by a judge and jury suffers in a way a certain punishment.  The concept is that it is better that ten guilty persons should go free rather than that one innocent person should be convicted.  There is a certain price to pay and it is better that we should pay it in the interests of the innocent.</P>
    <P>The Committee on the Status of Women also dealt with jury service at length but it took a Supreme Court case to bring the Legislature to its senses and introduce this measure.  It is an important measure and it will affect everyone from 18 years to 70 years.  For that reason it deserves the serious consideration of the House. Eligible people for jury service will be taken from the register of electors. In the past the only people who were really interested in the proper makeup of that register were politicians but now it will have added importance. Rate collectors, ratepayers and all citizens will regard it as an important document.  It will be an added incentive to people to ensure that they are on the register not only to allow them to vote but also to serve on juries.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the qualifying age for jury service has been reduced to 18 years.  There were reservations by some Members of the House but they said they would withdraw them because of the administrative difficulties that would be caused if we reverted to the previous age of 21 years.  I accept that a plaintiff in a civil case or even an accused person in a criminal case. might have some anxiety about an 18-year-old sitting on a jury and deciding on a case.  However, the plaintiff in a civil case or the accused in a criminal case can challenge a member of the jury.  The increase in the number of people whom the accused person can challenge is to be welcomed and any reservations that may exist about people of 18 years not being mature enough can be balanced against the increase in the number of jurors who can be challenged.</P>
    <P>If a man or woman has a right to vote they should have a right to serve on a jury.  Bringing young people into the jury system and letting them see at first hand how trials are conducted and how our courts operate will increase <Col N="1899" /> their respect for the law.  The reduction in the age to 18 years is complemented by the extension of the upper age limit from 65 years to 70 years.  Many people retire in their early sixties and they would be in a good position to serve on juries.  After a lifetime of experience they could be regarded as eminently suitable.</P>
    <P>The main reason we have this legislation now is due to the fact that women had no right to serve on a jury up to the present.  They could apply to serve but in the history of the State since 1927 only about nine women have applied.  That was a sad state of affairs.  I welcome the right now given to women to serve on juries particularly because it gives a female plaintiff or defendant in a civil case the advantage and benefit of women sitting on a jury to decide their case.  Where an accused person on a serious criminal charge is being tried, the ideal thing would be to have a proportion of the jury comprised of women.  Allowing women to serve on juries will increase their understanding of the law and it will be for the betterment of justice. Much has been said about women with large families not being able to attend but the Bill provides that they may be excused from jury service.  A large proportion of the women will be ready and willing to serve on juries.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the county registrar has now a wide discretion relating to the empanelling of jurors, excusing them and generally dealing with the setting up and conduct of juries.  This is an area which is quite properly left to the county registrar. If he makes a decision regarding service on a jury about which the citizen concerned may be aggrieved, that citizen has the right to appeal to the judge.  The discretion given to the county registrar must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The procedure regarding fines imposed on people who do not attend for jury service is cumbersome.  I agree with Deputy Dockrell in that there should be no going back to the District Court to deal with a simple fine imposed on a citizen because he did not attend a jury.  The method as it stands at present is ideal.  I agree that a fine of £3 on <Col N="1900" /> jurors who fail to answer a summons is ridiculous.  There were many people whom it would pay to stay away and to pay that fine and I am glad to see the amount has been increased.</P>
    <P>In relation generally to jury trials, I submit that the trying of civil cases by juries should be reviewed.  I was glad to hear that this had happened in regard to the Circuit Court where there was the anomaly that in the case of a person claiming £2,000 there was not the right to have the case tried by a jury but if the claim was for £3,000 the right did exist.  I submit there should be a similar review in regard to all civil trials by jury which, in cases of negligence, can involve long drawn-out hearings with tremendous expense. This could apply to an ordinary running-down case in the High Court where one can see jurors turning up morning after morning perhaps to find that the case had been settled before going to trial.  Of course, there is always the possibility that the trial will be long drawn out.  I submit that assessment of damages in civil cases should be left to a judge or a bench of judges.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to remuneration for jurors and it was suggested that something in the region of £5 a day should be paid.  To a certain extent I agree but I do not think it can be incorporated in legislation until the system of civil trials by jury has been reviewed.  There is a civic duty on all citizens to sit on juries in criminal cases if they are asked to do so.  In relation to civil cases I think the question of remuneration for jurors will have to be considered. I am glad the Bill has been received well on all sides.</P>

      <P>It appears to be the hallmark of this Government that in relation to legislation on women's rights and so on they have to be taken to court, either domestic or international, before they take legislative action.  We have had the sordid spectacle of the Government being brought to the European Court on the matter of equal pay and here we are discussing a Bill brought before us as a result of court action taken by four women.  If the case had not been <Col N="1901" /> brought to provide that women as a matter of right would be entitled to serve on juries, we would not be discussing this Bill today.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for a Deputy to come in after the contribution of Deputy Brosnan who brought his considerable experience as a barrister to bear on an analysis of this Bill, which repeals the 1927 Jurors Act and consolidates other aspects of the law in this respect.  Deputy Brosnan's contribution was one of the finer contributions on the Bill and it was more admirable because he was burdened with an indisposition which prevented him from speaking as he would wish to.  Those of us who have some small experience of juries have an obligation to bring that experience to bear on this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister interrupted me and I was replying to him. The Bill properly abandons property disqualification which was a historical throwback to the squires and squireens who had cornered the market in regard to assessment of the value of an individual's work to be put or not to put in jail or to be awarded a sum of money or not.  This Bill introduces a classless feature into our legislation which is to be welcomed. To say a person is a better juror because he owns a piece of property is <Col N="1902" /> nonsense and to exclude him because he does not is equally nonsense.  We must go on the premise that all men and women are equal until that has been disproved in some way.  Now, women as of right are entitled to serve on juries equally with men.</P>
      <P>There were undoubtedly difficulties caused by the present system.  There were hardships imposed on small or one-man businesses and on self-employed tradesmen or workmen who if they were absent from work for jury service were not paid.  Under the system as it operates at present the question of payment does arise, but it is an insult to the intelligence of the person to whom the payment is offered&mdash;the foreman.  The 1927 Act provided that in civil jury actions the miserable sum of 5s be proferred to the jury if a verdict was returned&mdash; only on that basis.  If he were in a hung jury situation I do not know what happened to the five shillings.  It would be better not to talk about paying jurors if we are going to offer them five shillings, not per person but for the jury as a whole.  That was the old law, and that is the law, as I understand it, as it exists at the moment. Now the Minister is suggesting that in some of the cases that is gone too, that it is not intended to pay jurors in civil actions.  In criminal cases the question of payment did not arise.</P>
      <P>There was talk about jury service as a civic duty and so on, and I would not be too enamoured of that either. With a criminal case it should be seen as a civic duty, and the population of the country, male and female, should lend minds and hearts to the examination of a particular individual's breach of his duty to society.</P>
      <P>However, in civil cases it is a different matter.  I cannot for one moment see a strong case being made that it is a civic duty necessarily to serve on a civil jury-a jury, for instance, in a road traffic case.  If we decide that there is some doubt about the civic nature of one's duty on a civil jury &mdash;for example, in road traffic cases&mdash; in certain circumstances or in all circumstances those individual jurors should be paid for their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is envisaged in this new legislation <Col N="1903" /> is that the employees, the person who gets out of work, is not paid by the State for the service he is giving to it.  Consequently, his employer has to carry the wage can, as it were. There is no suggestion that the employer has to pay the unfortunate juror who may have to serve on a jury, but in most circumstances employers would be bound to pay the juror or the employee serving on a jury.  In this way it can be said that employers are paying for what effectively should be a service paid for by the State.</P>
    <P>This is a form of discrimination in itself and may be challengeable.  It is a very good point indeed which has been discussed at some length, for juries involved in civil cases are not entitled to some form of reward or remuneration.  The Government are satisfied that it is a civic duty and such a juror should not be out of pocket because of a service which is mandatory on him.  This may raise problems under this Bill in future if somebody challenges the constitutionality of one's entitlement to payment, the constitutionality of being out of pocket for mandatory jury service.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern is the question of notice to jurors.  At the moment the maximum notice required is only four days.  It has been suggested that this could be well extended. It will be said that bureaucratic problems would arise, but nevertheless the time could be extended to some 14 days' notice, that the juror should get adequate notice to make arrangements for himself or herself to arrange for the duty he or she is going to perform.  Four days' notice, particularly in relation to a housewife, who might want to make arrangements in her household and leave her affairs in order might not be sufficient.  Not all housewives are anxious to serve on juries, but a considerable body of them would be anxious to do so.  There is no statutory mention of notice in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has to be at least 14 days, and it is the intention, as I said in my speech, that it will be four to six weeks' notice.</P>

    <Col N="1904" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is excellent.  It is a tremendous improvement and should be welcomed.  We are extending the age for jury service to between 18 and 70.  We should not underrate young people, quite the contrary.  Nevertheless, experience arises out of, possibly, age or involvement and so on.  I do not know whether a young person of 18 to 21 would be experienced in matters of jury service and the whole paraphrenalia and traffic of the courts.  The Minister may have mentioned this in his opening speech which I did not have the opportunity of perusing. Would it be possible that in the near future a pamphlet or booklet be produced and sent to all people entitled to give jury service, so that everyone on the electoral register would be informed of the working of the courts, the court system, the matter of jury service, to whom it applies, and to whom it does not apply, the qualifications, disqualifications, eligibility, ineligibility and all relevant matters? The Minister might say that the Bill will get publicity and so on.  That is not the reality.  We may have a sort of incestuous legislative atmosphere in that section.</P>

      <P>Well, introspective or incestuous, the Minister knows what to expect.  If there was an analysis of how many people read Dáil reports in the newspapers it would be rather shattering to the sensitive souls among us.  Nevertheless, this suggestion of a pamphlet or booklet should be examined by the Minister. Possibly it could be sent out with the notice when a general election is being called, which should not be in very distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can send out this pamphlet with the election <Col N="1905" /> literature.  It is important that people should know what they are about and, knowing what they are about, should come to proper judgments and decisions.  We on this side of the House believe that a short, snappy rundown of the working of the courts system plus the people's duties under the Bill would be helpful towards a proper discharge of those duties.  The Minister states he is now going to extend the notice from four to six weeks.  The Minister says it is 14 days at present.  As I understand it, section 39 of the Act required a minimum notice of four days.  I think I am correct in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The way the Bill is phrased is that prosecution for noncompliance cannot be taken unless 14 days' notice has been given.  Administratively, we intend four to six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with various speakers on both sides of the House who dealt at some length with section 15 subsection (4) of the Bill. This is the matter of the foreman.  The section provides:</P>
      <P>The foreman shall be such member as the jurors shall choose and the choice shall be made at such time as the judge may direct or in the absence of a direction before the jury bring in their verdict or make any other communication to the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am totally against this section, which is cumbersome.  The old system would certainly appeal to me where the first man called automatically became the foreman of the jury.  It was a tidy and efficient system.  Now we have to swear in the jurors and, obviously, they have to go into a room off the court and by ballot or show of hands choose a foreman.  The section does not impose any obligation on the judge to look for the appointment of the foreman at the beginning of the trial.  There is no absolute obligation on the judge to make the appointment except where the jury, having retired, might send out for some direction from the judge who would then direct the jury to choose a foreman before he gives the direction asked for.  This is cumbersome nonsense and the Minister <Col N="1906" /> should review the section with a view to retaining the old system.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have an answer to the points I and other speakers have raised in relation to section 15 (4) which appears to me at the moment to be cumbersome nonsense which should be expunged from the Bill by way of an amendment to delete it.  That will be a matter for the Opposition on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which arises in relation to the unemployed.  There is gross discrimination in respect of which, perhaps, the Government may be brought to court.  It is in relation to the unemployed 18-year-old girl who is asked to serve on a jury.  The social welfare system does not recognise an unemployed 18-year-old girl despite the fact that the system does recognise a boy's entitlement to benefit under the social welfare code.  I accept that there may be a case made for the civic duty nature of serving in civil cases but in criminal cases it does seem grossly unfair to bring in a young woman who is unemployed and who has to suffer financial hardship even in getting to the court and who is told on arrival that she is picked for duty, for which she does not get a penny.  It is a disgraceful situation. Not only is discrimination being continued under the social welfare code in respect of that young woman but there is discrimination in the fact that that unemployed young woman does not get a halfpenny from the State may respect of jury service which she may not want to give.  It is not all joy to serve on a jury.  Not everyone wants to rush into jury service.  If a ballot were taken in the street to find the number wishing to serve on juries, the result would be shattering.  There is a civic duty but it is questionable if there is a desire to perform that civic duty.</P>
    <P>The second interim report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure states at page 10:</P>
    <P>The Committee are satisfied that the existence of the property qualification limits liability for jury service to a small number of the adult population. Thus in Dublin City and County, the number of adults, as <Col N="1907" /> shown by the Electoral Register for the year 1962-63, was 416,646, while the number liable for jury service in the same area, as shown by the Jurors Book for 1963, was only 24,679, or about one in seventeen of the adult population.  The burden of jury service, however, is borne by a still smaller number.  As is shown by the figures set out in Appendix D hereto, only about 40 per cent of those who are summoned attend in court to answer to the summons (i.e., about one-fortieth of the total adult population of the area).  The reasons for this are noted in the report of the sub-committee already referred to (see Appendix B).  The same picture is repeated throughout the State, the total number of names entered in the jurors books for the entered country being 83,997 for the year 1963, while the number entered in the Electoral Register for the year 1962-63 was 1,666,653, a proportion of about one to twenty.</P>
    <P>That explodes the theory that there is a great revolutionary movement in the country in relation to service on juries, criminal or civil.</P>
    <P>I want, very quickly, imposed by the limitation of time on the debate and the need to have the Minister get in to reply to the various points, to refer to the fine of £50 being made a summary offence.  This is appalling and I do not think it is operable.  It seems extraordinary that, on the one hand, we are not prepared to pay people for serving on juries while, on the other, we are prepared to fine them for not appearing to discharge their duties, to make it a summary offence and to have to bring the person to the District Court because of his non-attendance for jury service without reasonable cause shown.  This seems to be grossly unfair.  I am sure the evidential aspect of it has been gone into at some length by the Minister and his Department.  I can see considerable difficulty arising in relation to the proof necessary to actually prosecute successfully and fine a person for non-attendance at court to take part in a jury if required.</P>
    <P>There is one final point, an <Col N="1908" /> omission, which we will make clear on the Committee Stage.  Deputy O'Malley, who asked me to articulate this point, could not be here this morning because he had to attend a very important function in his constituency. He asked me to place on the record of the House representations from the Institution of Engineers of Ireland in relation to the Bill.  There is a short memorandum from this institution which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Juries Bill 1975 has been passed by the Senate on 5 February and is coming before the Dáil on 11 February.  We would like to have an amendment introduced. Our case for the amendment is as follows:</P>
    <P>Under the Juries Act 1927 Members of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland engaged in the active practice of their profession were exempted from serving as jurors but entitled to serve on application.  Other professionals who also enjoyed this privilege included doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, chemists, teachers, pilots, masters of vessels.</P>
    <P>All of the foregoing except Members of the Institution are exempt from jury service as of right or through certification by the Head/Principal of their Departments under the Juries Bill 1975.</P>
    <P>Members of the Institution are employed in many areas of activity, performing essential and urgent services of public importance, e.g. construction industry, manufacturing industry, chemical plants, exploration, consulting, mining, road contracts.  The absence of an engineer or engineers from such areas would not in our view be in the public interest as it could lead to interruption of work for possibly large numbers of employees, adversely affect safety standards and reduce essential elements of supervision, direction and leadership.</P>
    <P>We suggest, therefore, that members of The Institution of Engineers of Ireland be included in Part II of the First Schedule to the Juries Bill 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> We have to be consistent about this. I would include all qualified engineers who may not necessarily be members of the Institution of Engineers of Ireland who would find themselves in a similar situation.  In addition to the case they make for themselves, there are engineers who actually give evidence, particularly in road traffic cases, to prove maps and so on.  It seems necessary that these people be included.  Engineering is a profession and you must exclude an engineer because of the fact that he is a member of a profession which requires exclusion. Engineers are required in Road Traffic Act and Factory Act cases to prove maps.  Their evidence can have quite a considerable bearing on the outcome of a case before a jury.  I strongly urge the Minister to take note of the representations brought by the Institution of Engineers of Ireland to the attention of Deputy O'Malley. There is much more which could be said but we are limited by time in extending our contributions.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister is anxious to get the Second Stage of this Bill and I will not delay the House more than five minutes.  I welcome this Bill and I congratulate all those who have been responsible for drafting it.  It was wrong that only certain types of people with property could give justice.  Every person with a vote who can decide who should come in here should be able to decide court cases and to see that justice is done.  I also welcome that women are included on the jury panel.  I do not believe that many of them will be anxious to serve.  I believe the same applies to men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Juries are so badly treated that people want to get out of the service. Jurors are brought into a cold room and left there.  No expenses are provided. I do not believe they could be given adequate expenses but at least they should be provided with some expenses. An unemployed person could be called now.  It is shocking to think that everybody in the court is paid except those deciding what type of verdict will be brought in.  Unemployed people may not even have money to get something to eat.  If people are <Col N="1910" /> kept too long out of business and are worried about something going wrong at home, this could have an effect on the number of people who will serve on juries.  It is ridiculous that the 12 people who decide whether or not another person is guilty are not paid any expenses.  I am sorry that this is not in the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on the rest of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As a public representative I have always heard the complaint from jurors that no expenses were paid.  At one time it was said that Members of this House should not be paid an allowance.  If that were brought to its logical conclusion nobody would have authority in the country except people with money.  Anybody who was not paid could not afford to be in this House.  We would then only have people with large incomes so we would be back to the days when the landed gentry ruled the country instead of the ordinary people.  The Minister is bringing everybody in now but he is making no arrangements to give them reasonable expenses.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider amending the Bill to give reasonable expenses, without putting too great a charge on the Exchequer, to people who have to serve on juries and ensure that they are properly accommodated and not treated as they are at the moment.  We have heard the law aspect of this matter explained. I am just putting up what the ordinary man in the street has to say about serving on juries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies who contributed for the welcome they gave, with some reservations, to the Bill.  I will deal with the various points which came up in the course of the debate in a random and non-discriminatory fashion, to take some words from the Bill itself.  There is no doubt that this reform was overdue.  Deputy Andrews said it was regrettable that it had to wait on a decision of the courts to force this reform.  My first answer to that is that the recommendation for the reform was made as far back as 1965.  Deputy O'Kennedy fairly acknowledged that if blame for <Col N="1911" /> delay is to be placed it can be placed on both sides.</P>
      <P>I am not going to make any further point about it except to say that I had taken the decision to introduce this reform and had recommended to the Government in the spring of last year that the reform was desirable, and that the Government had made the decision in principle and had given authority for the preparation of the Bill.  Because the Bill is a consolidating measure, not in the whole area of law relating to juries but in the area of the mechanics of jury service, its preparation took longer than I anticipated.  In addition, the Bill can be described as the tip of an iceberg and the rest of the iceberg, the administrative arrangements for operating the new system of empanelling and summoning jurors, has involved a lot of work and has been a task of some magnitude.  However, happily we are at the stage now that when the Bill does become law, the administrative arrangements to bring it into effect are ready and the new regime can be implemented immediately.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins raised the point about instructing jurors.  Jurors are laymen, and now with the widening liability to service there will be many people, including young people, with no conception at all of what happens in the courts or of what is a jury's role and function.  He recommended that jurors be instructed in advance as to what their duties would be.  I agree with him entirely, and it is our intention to send out with the jury summonses a pamphlet or leaflet in layman's language giving a synopsis of what happens in court and what the position of a juryman is.  This will be provided for in the administrative instructions which have been prepared and which are being issued to county registrars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins asked if it would not be better to have these instructions in the Bill and make statutory instruments of them.  I considered this and thought it would be better not, that if they were to be given the force of a statutory instrument it could lead to a difficult situation where, <Col N="1912" /> if the least direction of the statutory instrument were not complied with, there might be room for a challenge and for legal argument as to the validity of anything that took place subsequently.</P>
    <P>Again if we were to have it provided that the instructions were to have the force of a statutory instrument we would have to be extremely careful as to how those instructions were drafted, and they might be open to criticism on the grounds that they were inadequately drafted, that they were not sufficiently full.  There would be an obligation then to use legal language, whereas what we want to do is to give in layman's language an idea of what is going to be involved for the layman in jury service.</P>
    <P>A further argument against making these administrative instructions a statutory instrument is that we are entering into the operation of a new mechanism and it is only in its operation that teething troubles will become apparent and the changes and adjustments in the procedures that may become necessary.  If we had to attend to all of these by way of statutory instrument it could be cumbersome and there could be legal constraints which I think are not necessary here.  This is an administrative rather than a legal matter, and I think the better way for it to be done is by way of administrative instructions through the normal channels of the bureaucracy of the State.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in the Seanad that these instructions might not be obeyed unless they had the force of a statutory instrument.  That is not an argument I accept at all, because these are being issued to county registrars who themselves were involved in their compiling and who are aware of what is involved.</P>
    <P>The question of juries in civil cases and juries generally was raised.  Deputy Total raised a question-mark about juries in civil cases.  That point was also raised in the Seanad by Senator Ryan, but I think Deputy Total and Senator Ryan are lone voices.  I would accept the majority opinion of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure; I am not going to waste <Col N="1913" /> the time of the House by repeating what is already on record, but I would be in favour of the arguments set out by that committee for retaining juries in civil cases.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a good argument to say that because juries were abolished in the Circuit Court, where the jurisdiction is £2,000 they should also be abolished in the next court where the sum involved may be marginally over that.  To all intents and purposes, the sum claimed in the next court is an open-ended sum and, therefore, it is necessary and desirable to have the intervention of a jury.</P>
    <P>The question of juries generally has not been debated, because this Bill deals more with the mechanics of jury service than with the principle of juries and all that involves.  An interesting point was made in the Seanad by a Senator whose discipline is that of a sociologist, that the jury brings to the case which it is adjudicating the values, the moral judgments and all that sort of thing, of contemporary society, that these might, in fact, be prejudices and that they might be unjust values, and that they could intervene to impede or inhabit the application of pure law and pure justice.  It is an interesting point.  I do not propose to follow it. I just make it as an instance of how the debate could be widened.  It is not relevant to this Bill to widen it to that extent.</P>
    <P>There was a general welcome for the reduction of the minimum age to 18. Deputy Dockrell said very fairly that he started off as being against the reduction. I think all of us possibly shared that feeling and while we would recognise that logically there is no basis for it, having provided for the reduction to 18 there might still be with all of us an unexplained or illogical residue of doubt in that regard. However, I am confident that the safeguards provided against a preponderance of too young people on a jury are adequate.  The main safeguard is the extension of the number of challenges without cause.  Mathematically it is extremely unlikely that there will ever be a jury panel summoned or a jury balloted out of that panel which will have an inordinate number of 18-year-olds. <Col N="1914" /> There may be many juries in which there will not be a person within the age group of 18 to 21 at all.</P>
    <P>The question of the fines to be imposed on absent jurors was raised by most Deputies.  The present situation is unsatisfactory because, first of all, the level of the fine is not adequate. A fine of £3 is not a deterrent, and it is common knowledge that many people suffered the imposition of that penalty rather than turn up to answer their summons and reckoned that they got good value.  One thing that a penalty should be is a deterrent.  It was suggested that it should be raised to £20 and that a judge would have power to apply the appropriate sum within that limit.  Again, this overlooks the fact that it has been applied in the case where the juryman is not present to indicate to the judge the reasons why the maximum fine might not be imposed on him.</P>
    <P>There must be serious legal if not constitutional question marks about a procedure where a person is punished in his absence, without being heard as to the reasons why he is absent or without being given an opportunity to be heard.  There is an element of criminal sanction here, and it is for this reason principally that I am altering the basis of the imposition of this fine to provide for prosecution in the ordinary way in the District Court.  I do not think it would be a cumbersome procedure or that the difficulties about proof to which Deputy Brosnan adverted will arise, because section 13, subsections (3) and (4) provides for certain certificates to be handed in which would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of service and non-attendance.  The maximum of £50 is realistic.  The punishment will have to be made fit the crime as the District Court so decides.  It is preferable that the matter will now be heard by the District Court.</P>
    <P>A Deputy suggested that the prosecution be taken in the court where the juror failed to appear.  This would be putting a strain on that court's time.  It is a summary procedure.  The District Court is a court of summary jurisdiction, set up specially to deal with summary matters.  The proper <Col N="1915" /> venue is the District Court and the proper procedure is by way of summons. The present procedure is inadequate because of the size of the penalty. If that were to be increased, we could be introducing a great deal of injustice, apart from the constitutionality of the procedure.</P>
    <P>The one area in which most Deputies were in agreement, with the possible exception of myself, was on the question of money for jurors. I used the word &ldquo;money&rdquo; deliberately, because the sentiment that jurors should get something is impeccable.  It would be a mean person who would carp at it. When we come to define exactly what they should get, how much they should get, why they should get it, or how they should get it, we have a wide variety of views.  Deputy Callanan says &ldquo;at least something reasonable&rdquo;, while other Deputies used other expressions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that in appropriate cases there should be payment for jury service.  He then suggested £5. That amount might not always be an appropriate payment.  Deputy Andrews said the juries should be paid for their service.  That raises a further issue.  Are they to be paid for their service as jurors or are they to be paid for having to come in, leave their places of employment and possibly incur expense?  He used the phrase &ldquo;some form of reward, some form of remuneration&rdquo;.  All these differing approaches highlight the nature of this problem.  Are we to fully compensate jurymen for their absence?  Are we to give them a flat figure and say &ldquo;Take that&rdquo; in the knowledge that it will be no good to some, too much for others, and adequate for more people.  Are we to say that we will pay subsistence and travelling?  Are we to say &ldquo;You will get whatever you can vouch&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is a difficulty.  Essentially what we are dealing with here are self-employed persons.  The <Col N="1916" /> mechanics of trying to devise a system which would take account of all the differing situations would be impossible administratively, most expensive to administer, and very expensive in the actual money which would have to be there to fund it.  The suggestion of a flat £5 would not be excessively expensive, but it would not be the answer to the problems that have been raised in this debate.  A flat £5 to the unemployed person coming from West Cork might be quite useless to him.  He would fall to be excused under section 9.  If a person did not have the means of travelling because of pecuniary circumstances, he would have to be excused.  I have no doubt county registrars, being men of reason, would see that as a good reason for excusing them.  I do not anticipate that a person who is unlucky enough to be unemployed, would not be excused by the county registrar.</P>
    <P>In essence, we are dealing here with the self-employed person, whether he be the farmer or the businessman.  The employed person is attended to in so far as it is provided that his contract of employment is deemed to continue while he is serving, and he cannot be docked his wages while doing jury service. The position of the self-employed person is eased considerably by the fact that he will get four to six weeks' notice in advance of his liability to serve on a jury.  That should give the average self-employed person enough time to make arrangements for his temporary absence. Farmers often have to leave their farms for a day and neighbours will come in to milk the cows for them. This happens regularly in the country.  I do not anticipate that if we give reasonable notice self-employed persons will not be able to adjust their affairs to alleviate, if not totally remove, hardship and loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This civic duty should be done and it is not too much to ask a citizen to carry out a civic duty which may fall on him very infrequently, once or twice in a lifetime.  I do not think it is too much to ask a citizen to do that for nothing.  It was suggested that Deputies are doing their civic duty and have to be paid.  The analogy between the duties of a Deputy and those of a juror, called on once or twice in a lifetime, is not a good one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brosnan, Deputy G. Collins and Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of the swearing of juries and the need for solemnity.  This need is being met by dispensing with the old practice of jurors being sworn in batches.  There is more solemnity if they are sworn individually.  This is being provided here.  It is a matter for the presiding judge to ensure that there is silence and stillness in the courts when this process is taking place.  Invariably this is what happens.  It is treated as a very solemn part of the court's proceedings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brosnan also raised the question of the transfer from sheriff to registrar.  This was to carry out a recommendation of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  The second interim report recommended that the functions of sheriffs in relation to jurors should be transferred to county registrars.  It is to fulfil that recommendation that the changes are being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised the question of engineers.  The Institute of Engineers feel they should be exempted persons.  I also had an interview with the president of the institute and <Col N="1918" /> heard his case.  In not granting them exemption I am following the recommendation of the second interim report. That report said that the number of persons with automatic exemption should be curtailed and it instanced corporate members of the Institute of Engineers as a class of person who should no longer have automatic exemption.  I agree with that.  I explained my reasons in some detail to the president why I thought blanket exemptions would not be right in their case.  In the odd case where hardship would ensure or where there would be serious consequences on a building site or in a factory that would be an appropriate reason to be dealt with by the county registrar under section 9. I have not the slightest doubt that county registrars are sensible men and would give the exemption in the appropriate case to an engineer whose situation demanded and deserved it. I think I have covered all the points raised during the debate.</P>

It might be better to retain the old procedure&mdash;the first name out of the hat would be the foreman.  But, nevertheless, we are accepting the recommended change that the juries select their foreman.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brosnan raised&mdash;I am sure he will agree it would be an unlikely event&mdash;the question of a jury dividing 6-6 and being unable to agree on a foreman.  In the event of that unlikely situation happening, the judge on being informed of the position would, I am sure, tell them to go home and he would get a new jury.  I thank the House for the welcome given to the Bill and I look forward to dealing, in more detail on Committee Stage, with many of the points raised.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  My experience of enlisted men in the Army is that whatever tasks they are asked to perform in this time of subversion, death, murder and pillage they will do in the name of the State.  They would stand by the oath they took when they entered the Army.  I should like to say that the minimum number of them are involved in the duties referred to by the Deputy but they are doing them freely.  I have seen non-commissioned men promoted for what I would call, if not acts of heroism, acts beyond the ordinary call of duty in the course of their duty. The prison referred to by the Deputy is there because if there is a necessity for the incarceration of people who would murder, pillage and destroy we must have some place to put them. <Col N="1922" /> There is no desire on the part of the Government to put anybody in there nor is there any desire to employ one more soldier than is necessary in dealing with people of this kind.  More than 1,400 people have been killed since 1969 and that imposes duties upon us all.  It imposes a duty not only on the Army, whom I compliment on the excellent nature of their services, but on every citizen to go to a soldier, or a garda and tell them anything about subversive acts going on in their area.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the decision to have this type of prison in the Curragh Camp, and to deny the opportunity to civilians to act as warders within the Curragh Camp, means that soldiers who enlist as soldiers will have to act as warders as long as that prison is there and operative?  Does the Minister not consider that an undesirable situation?</P>

      <P>The exigencies and demands of the State at this time, when democracy must be preserved, fall upon the Defence Forces, notably the Garda and the Army.  What the Army is asked to do is done gallantly since I became Minister for Defence.  I commend them and I do not accept that they complained. The moment it is unnecessary to have them as warders they will not act as warders.  To have a place in the Curragh where people could be incarcerated if such were necessary to save human life and try to prevent further murders, robberies and pillage, is a State necessity.  It is empty of prisoners at present and please God it will remain so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter before with the Minister and he told me that there was no prison at the Curragh, that none would be built. He knew nothing about it when he was answering on the Estimate for the Department of Defence.  Now we are told the prison is there.  I should like to know why the site was selected in view of the fact that the Army cannot accommodate recruits. Recruits have been sleeping in their own homes from time to time because of the inadequacy of accommodation. <Col N="1923" /> Why was a military barracks taken over?  If the Government wish to build a prison why did they not build one elsewhere?  We all agree with the necessity for law and order.  The Army did a good job for the country long before the Minister took over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is completely untrue in every statement he has made.  I did not say there was no prison in the Curragh at a time when there was.  There is, in fact, a barracks in the Curragh where £200,000 has been spent and around which there is a fence and the usual look-out posts for sentries.  If necessary, should there be a doomsday situation and persons are sentenced by the courts, and the ordinary prisons cannot contain them, we can then incarcerate those people there.  They will be treated well if that happens.  As I have said, nobody wants it to happen.  I pray to God that it will not happen.  As well as that, £175,000 was spent to provide alternative accommodation for persons who might have been sleeping in and using the barracks now referred to as a prison.  In fact, the barracks now referred to as a prison has been used in the recent past by NCOs who came there to take courses for promotion. They found it provided excellent accommodation.  When this terrible time is over, the fence around that prison can be knocked down and we will have a first-class barracks in the Curragh; in fact, the best barracks for NCOs and men in the Curragh.  I resent people doing this double think and saying: &ldquo;We must not have the Army acting as warders.  We must not have a prison within an Army camp.&rdquo; The fact is that we have to stop this subversion.  The two units which will stop it are the Garda and the Army. If we got the backing from Fianna Fáil we should get, may be we would have it stopped sooner.</P>

      <P>I would not agree that there is an injustice.  I agree that a number of people have complaints because of the fact that they are not included.  I understand what the Deputy is getting at.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with him.  Everybody who wanted to apply for a new house grant should have done so before they commenced building.  This was repeated in practically every advertisement issued by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept, especially in the cases to which I refer, that a fashion had grown up that the builders applied <i>en bloc</i> for the State grant?  I will not say the Minister's Department condoned it but they accepted that situation.  An unfortunate applicant who contracted last June or July with a builder, now finds that, with the withdrawal of the grant his repayments, if he capitalises £325, will be almost an additional £1 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Tunney does not get the point.  Before builders apply for the State grant they apply for certificates of reasonable value. Before they can sell a house they must have a certificate of reasonable value.  There would not be any difficulty at all in the case of those people who have filled out a contract.  This matter is fairly clearly defined.  At present I am looking at the final phase which they asked me to look at. In a case where a contractor applied for a certificate of value and it was not issued to him because some further information was required, should that also be included?  I am having a look at that part of it.  The people Deputy Tunney is talking about are well covered.  The only <Col N="1929" /> people not covered are the applicants for a single house.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department would save money and would the Minister not agree that, in those circumstances, equally where a person had the foundations poured he should now be included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Deputy is mixing this up with something else. Before 10th February, 1973, anyone who had foundations poured was considered to have started the house and was, therefore, not required to give a certificate of reasonable value.  Contractors took advantage of that.  As far as the other is concerned, application was made and nobody went out to see whether the foundation had been poured at a particular date.  The details were given on the application form.  While I would like to cover most of the people about whom questions are being asked, there is no point in saying we will continue to make changes because, if we do, the scheme will never come into operation.  While the sum is relatively small this year, next year it will be a very sizeable sum.  There are about 16,000 or 17,000 grants which will be paid because they applied already.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that while the regulation says you must make your application before you start, traditionally we have gone away from that over a period.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I agree with Deputy Lalor I have had a number of representations made but that is not one I have come across.  We looked at this because it was something that had to be gone into before a decision was made but it would take a great deal of trouble to establish when houses actually started.  What CIF wanted dealt with were those who had made application and had got a certificate of valuation or had applied and were held up and I suppose that was their end of the bargain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has laid down qualifications for learner driver instructors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it desirable that a person can set up as a driving instructor immediately after passing his test without any further training of any description?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not desirable and I am not aware that it is happening. There is a relatively small number of driving schools and driving instructors but, if Deputy Faulkner brings something specifically to my notice, I will have a look at it.  A great many people do driving tests without going near a driving school or an instructor. The number here is relatively small as compared with other countries&mdash;70 per cent in Britain and 20 per cent here, for example.  It is not a problem, but if Deputy Faulkner has a case and brings it to my notice I will investigate. Deputy Haughey raised this matter with me some months ago and, as a result of my investigations, it did not seem to be a desirable thing at this point in time to start laying down qualifications.  In fact, laying down qualifications, as the Deputy will agree, would be a difficult thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree there is some responsibility on the Department in a matter like this.  If we are to have driving tests then the Minister must agree there must be some responsibility on the Department to ensure that those who act as driving instructors are properly qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The onus is on the Department to ensure that the people <Col N="1933" /> who are tested as drivers know how to drive.  If someone is foolish enough to go and pay the very substantial sum required to someone who sets himself up as an instructor and he knows very little about driving, then the onus is on the individual to ensure he does not get codded.  I do not know of any case like that referred to by Deputy Faulkner but, if there is such, I would be glad to know about it.  This is the first that has come to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>How would a person who went to a driving instructor know whether that instructor, especially in the early stages of instruction, was competent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two types. You have the instructors in country towns who are known because, in country towns, everybody knows everybody else, and there are recognised driving schools.  I doubt whether someone who had just passed a driving test would be employed by a school to teach others how to drive.  If a person goes to someone who has only learned to drive and does not take the trouble to find out whether he is competent or not, that is his mistake.  If Deputy Faulkner knows of a case I wish he would give me the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>But should not the public be protected?  A person could have done six tests and, having failed on five, succeeded on the sixth.  He could then advertise in the local paper offering himself as an instructor in driving lorries and, in such cases as that, would the Minister not consider it proper to lay down qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If I can get evidence that it is happening on a wide scale, naturally, something should be done about it but the evidence I have before me is that that is not so.  That is why I am asking Deputy Faulkner if he will tell me.  Deputy Lalor knows that if somebody in his town set up as a driving instructor he and everybody else in the town would know when that person qualified and whether or not he was competent to teach.  That is the position in all the towns all over the <Col N="1934" /> country.  Therefore, I cannot visualise how the fellow who has just passed his driving test could blossom out as an instructor the next day and be accepted by the public who would pay good money to be taught by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that any further statement, as such, in regard to local government reorganisation is called for at the moment.  My intention is to proceed as opportunity arises with the implementation of those reforms which I feel to be required. A gradual but substantial reform of local government has, in fact, already been made by the phased transfer of health and housing charges from the rates to the Exchequer, the many electoral reforms which have been introduced and the devolution from my Department to local authorities of several schemes previously administered centrally.  I should also like to say that a fair measure of consensus has emerged from the debate on the discussion document issued by me in December, 1973 as to the reforms in the local government system which are required.  Legislative proposals are being prepared to give effect to these reforms and I hope to present them to the House later this year.</P>

What I have done is to notify them that additional forward land acquisitions, which are not vital to the <Col N="1936" /> local authority's housing programme in the next three years, should be deferred for the time being.  Bearing in mind that local authorities have sites for almost 94,000 dwellings already in their possession, I am quite satisfied that this requirement is a very reasonable one in existing economic circumstances. Cases of Special difficulty may, of course, arise from time to time and I will consider these on their merits.

      <P>Under the Housing Authorities (Loans for Acquisition or Construction of Houses) Regulations, 1972, the determination of the rate of interest to be charged on a house purchase loan is a matter for the housing authority concerned and is not one in which I can intervene.

If, in fact, they cleared it but did not start building or did not apply for an instalment of the loan maybe for months, maybe for a couple of years, as has happened, does Deputy Tunney suggest that the person should continue to get the loan at the rate mentioned in the first place?</P>

      <P>I will give it.  In the case of an application the applicant was notified last October that the cheque was ready for collection.  He was also told to advise a solicitor accordingly.  The applicant did this. Because of a backlog in the local authority or because of circumstances where they were not able to administer this as quickly as possible, the appointment for collecting the cheque was not made until the 3rd January, 1976.  Does the Minister think it is fair to charge that applicant the new rate of interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not.  If Deputy Tunney will give me particulars of that case I will be glad to take them up with the local authority concerned. This is the sort of thing I feel very strongly about, particularly in relation to some of the larger local authorities: that people are promised cheques and are not paid that money for a very long time.  I wish more people would complain about this and we would not have the situation we have now.</P>

      <P>I want to call some of what I believe is the Minister's bluff in relation to this question. Is it not true that, once a Minister for Finance announces an increase in interest rates from a specific date, the money from the Local Loans Fund to the housing authority, by a motion passed at its meeting, approves the payment of the new interest rate and that no further moneys that have not been paid out are available to that housing authority until that motion is carried by the local authority?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has not got his facts correct, although I think he was a member of a local authority for some time.  He does not seem to understand how local authorities work.  A lot of money could be in the possession of the local authority and it is only to money which has not been issued from the Local Loans Funds that this would apply.  Deputy Tunney said that the cheque was ready to be paid out.  In that case the money must have been available at local level to meet that cheque.  In that case there is no question whatever of what Deputy Fitzgerald is talking about affecting this matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the number of canning cows slaughtered in the years ended 31st December, 1974, and 31st December, 1975; and if he will make a statement on the effect this will have on cattle, milk and meat exports in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Slaughtering of cows at meat factories in the years 1974 and 1975 totalled 412,700 and <Col N="1949" /> 585,800 head, respectively.  It is estimated that about 15 per cent of these would be in the canning category.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my replies to earlier questions on this matter on 4th November last.  There is no evidence of any significant reduction in cow numbers in the dairy sector and, given satisfactory weather conditions, I would hope that milk output this year would exceed even the record level of 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear there is no reduction, although I would not be inclined to agree with him.  Would he think that the change in the beef incentive scheme would lead to a reduction and more cows being sold for canning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think so. What Deputies do not seem to appreciate is that the build-up in cow numbers between 1970 and 1974, which was 460,000, came as a result not of more heifers being put in-calf but as a result of the retention of old cows. It was inevitable that the end of that road would be seen and that these cows would have to be slaughtered at some time.  That is what gave us the excessive slaughterings last year and part of the year before.  This year we expect slaughterings to be back to a normal level because of the very substantial increases in prices and the brighter outlook for cattle and beef generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the reduction in the amount that can be got under the beef scheme, does the Minister not agree with me that there is likely to be an increase in the number of cows slaughtered for canning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that Deputy Callanan should be always looking for subsidies from the Department. The market place is the place to get the profit, and that is where the profit is coming from at the present time.  It was never so good.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices which bacon factories pay for pigs are not determined solely by the price of Irish bacon on the London Provision Exchange since the bulk of our production of bacon is sold on the home market.</P>
      <P>Currently our weekly exports account for 15 to 20 per cent of our factory throughput and it is only to this quantity that the increase referred to by the Deputy applied during two weeks in January.  Short-term price rises of this nature cannot be expected to have an immediate significant effect on pig prices.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The market value is the basis that has always been used for the value of reactor cattle in the previous Government's time and in the present Government's time, so that there is no change there, and there has always been a differential between the upper limit to be paid for non-pedigree and pedigree animals, and that will continue to be the policy if there is any change in valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice of the Minister to call, once in a while.  The Minister for Justice will note the contrast between what he has had to tolerate over the last few days without any support and the mass gathering at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the budget, in a flash of inspiration and disclosure, the Minister for Finance told us that <Col N="1960" /> we had passed through the second year of the worst economic depression the western world had witnessed for almost 50 years.  He could have spared us the trouble because we know it better than the Minister seems to realise.  It is significant that the Minister started his budget statement on that basis because clearly he is following the line&mdash;as he did throughout his speech&mdash;that what is happening here is something over which we have little or no control, that it is due almost entirely to circumstances in the worst economic depression the western world has witnessed in almost 50 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have been a little more critical in his analysis of all the factors that have brought about &ldquo;the worst economic recession in 50 years&rdquo; without presenting what he called, &ldquo;this unpalatable fact&rdquo;.  The reality is that the Minister, and the Government, are sheltering behind what they call &ldquo;an unpalatable fact&rdquo;.  According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we had been witnessing pressures and raging tempests of inflation long before this year.  The Minister for Finance said that when they came into Government he was asked what happened the moneys saved by virtue of not having to subsidise our agricultural produce on the British market as a result of our EEC membership.  He told us that these moneys were consumed in a raging tempest of inflation.  That was in 1973.</P>
    <P>If we have had a raging tempest of inflation to the extent that the moneys that were available to the Minister then were lost without trace, it is hardly fair to look at the situation as if our problems today derive from the worst economic depression the western world has witnessed last year.  There is more to it than that. The Minister went on to make a terrible admission&mdash;he did not intend it to be an admission&mdash;when talking about the urgency and the problem of tackling inflation that the highest priority would have to be given to tackling one economic problem that was to some extent at least within our own power to control, inflation. <Col N="1961" /> He then presented this gem: &ldquo;The first steps in this direction were taken in my June, 1975, budget&rdquo;.  That is something I agree with but he had to do it because he was urged and pressured into doing it by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has told the House that the first steps to control inflation were taken by him in his June, 1975 budget.  For once I agree with him.  We know what those steps were.  The Fianna Fáil Party appealed to him to introduce those steps in his January budget but he ignored those appeals.  Two years after they came into Government they took their first steps to combat inflation.  In a demonstration of self-righteousness during his budget speech the Minister turned to these benches and said that those of us who had any criticism to offer should decide for themselves what to do now.  This is not a little game in which the Minister says to the Opposition, two hours before the budget is introduced: &ldquo;We have brought you to this depth of depression due to our failures over the last few years, and particularly by our failure to tackle inflation; you step in now and take it from here with all the problems you will inherit from us and see what you will do in an hour's time with the budget I am introducing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will put forward my own proposals later but by their own admission the Government have failed to tackle a matter which is within our control and which is not directly related to the world economic recession.  As far as inflation is concerned the people who were supposed to be generating inflation, our European partners, for a considerable time have been suffering from a much lower rate of inflation than we are.  The Minister took his steps too late and we are all paying the price now.  What is the Minister doing now to ensure that next year the situation will not be worse?</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister told us that when the long awaited economic recovery comes there could be no assurance that it would restore the pattern of growth to which we have become accustomed since 1960. It is no coincidence that the pattern of growth in the 1960s did not take <Col N="1962" /> place under a Coalition Government. There can be anything but an assurance that if this Government continue in their confused and ill-conceived attitudes towards the economic wellbeing of our country there is a likelihood of us ever returning to the long awaited economic recovery.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the first budget introduced by the National Coalition because it is an indication of where Fianna Fáil would have to start and how the Government set the impetus under way.  For a short time, from December to March, I was a member of a Government.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that most of the time of the Government at that time was taken up in the preparation of the budget which we would have introduced in March or thereabouts of that year had we remained in office.  It is no secret that the Fianna Fáil budget of 1973 would have introduced very severe restrictions on public expenditure.  Ministers had accepted the discipline which is part of the obligation of government collectively to prune public expenditure to the greatest possible extent.  I will direct one example to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the Government's promises, we kept any promises we made.  Any promises we made we stood over in a responsible way.  We did not try to match the easy promises the Government made because we knew we had a responsibility. Each Minister responded, sometimes reluctantly, in the knowledge that the national interest at the time called for this response.  There were indications of a developing recession. Our programmes would have been tailored, as they were up to then, to ensure constant control and stringency in public spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take education.  The Parliamentary Secretary will recall the days when Fianna Fáil, as a matter of educational policy, and also as a matter of financial policy&mdash;despite some significant opposition around the country <Col N="1963" /> and despite some emotional reaction &mdash;I personally was involved and had to face some of this emotional reaction in two or three centres around the country&mdash;introduced our proposal for community schools.  We believed this to be correct educationally.  We also knew that financially, so far as future planning was concerned, and even planning in the current year, it would cost considerably less.  We took the flak.  Before we left Government we had got some measure of agreement from the various interests involved in education on the development of the community schools programme. What happened when the new Government took office?</P>
    <P>From then on it was not to be a question of the Government taking unpopular decisions in Dublin which were not acceptable around the country.  This Government were to be responsible to the public mood. This Government were to be popular. This Government would capitulate wherever they saw some popularity to be gained by capitulation.  This budget statement acknowledges that a high percentage of our current expenditure is going in the area of education.  Inevitably, it will increase because of the increasing demands for education and because of the increasing number of our school-going children.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education announced with a great flourish that the community schools programme was gone. They would take a fresh look at the whole thing.  This was the new responsive Minister for Education, and the pattern was the same with other Ministers.  They were having a fresh look at everything.  People in various sectors said that was marvellous, that it was different from those Fianna Fáil Ministers who would ensure that they would do what they wanted irrespective of public reaction.  Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.  Then the Minister found this was not quite working and people were asking for a little more than he could deliver.  He introduced the famous Thurles compromise. After a few months he found the Thurles compromise did not work either.  Now in Thurles and elsewhere nothing is working very well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> The Government had not got the sense of responsibility to do what they knew was right, to give the example. They should have shown there was a need for restraint in every sector.  We are dealing here with psychological reactions.  Throughout his budget speech the Minister for Finance almost criticised what he calls the unreasonable expectations of people and the fact that people are now looking for more and more and are prepared to pay less and less by way of tax.</P>
    <P>Does the House remember the great design introduced by the Tánaiste about free hospitalisation for all?  In his budget statement talking about public expenditure and general considerations the Minister for Finance said&mdash;and it is a quotable gem:</P>
    <P>There is, moreover, a growing contrast between the demands of the public for services to be provided &ldquo;free&rdquo;, or at prices which do not cover their cost, and their obvious reluctance as taxpayers to pay for them.</P>
    <P>That is a terrible indictment of the public by the Minister if it is true.  If there is a contrast the Government should find out to what extent they were responsible for that contrast.</P>
    <P>What public demand was there for the Tánaiste's grand design for free hospitalisation for everyone?  I do not recall that public demand from any sector of the community, much less from those who would be covered by its introduction.  There was no public demand for that public service. There was no demand which was unreasonable, as the Minister suggested, by people who said they wanted it and they would pay less tax for it.  Far from it.  The Tánaiste had a grand design like every other member of the Government at the time.  We were all in a great new world of expansion, of new services, of dependency on the Government who were so concerned for us.  He gave us a ludicrous figure of the cost. I cannot recall what it was but it was ridiculous.  It was in the single figure of millions as to what the cost of the free hospitalisation would be. He was laughed at, and properly so, <Col N="1965" /> from this side of the House.  He laughed back and said we were jealous because we could not do it. He subsequently acknowledged that that programme would have cost much more than he originally envisaged. He was not able to go ahead with it.  He and the Minister for Education and the other high-flying Ministers travelling and press-projecting in various directions created an expectation in the public mind.  As they spent and promised&mdash;and we learned today that the Minister for Labour is still spending for his own personal accommodation&mdash;they and only they created a public expectation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that it should be recognised that the people who set the pattern and created the expectation, and who showed no discipline or restraint in their policy statements, in their attitudes, and in their spending, were the Government who are now complanning about the unreasonable demands of the public.  There may be evidence to substantiate what the Minister said.  One of the saddest things about the state of our country at the moment is that the morale which is so vital, the sense of community responsibility, the sense of spontaneous restraint in the national interest, are not as forthcoming as they should be because leadership in that direction is not being given by the Government.  Therein lies the real failure of the Government over the past three years, not just a failure to deal with these problems but a failure which can be more clearly seen in the terrible contributions they <Col N="1966" /> have made towards aggravating the problems the country is now obviously facing.</P>
      <P>Could I just remind the House that this inflation against which the Minister, on his own admission, took his first steps in June, 1975, had been seen and recognised by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, much earlier.  Two years ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us we were in a raging tempest of international inflation.  It is not today or yesterday this problem arose. It has been there for a considerable time, fuelled to a considerable extent by the Government's own high-flying proposals and clear lack of any sense of direction or programme.</P>
      <P>One looks to a budget for a number of factors.  There are certain essential elements.  Tax revenue is a crucial element. Much higher in the order of consideration should be a programme towards which tax expenditure will be directed.  Such a programme must be clearly stated.  Budgetary policy is not just a matter of telling us how serious things are or how rampant inflation is, hiding behind world problems and so on, and then saying taxation must be raised and the net spread as widely as possible and showing zeal in attacking tax evaders and so on.  That is not enough.  But that is the impression most people have of this budget and the Government's reaction towards our crushing problems.  What is really disconcerting is that the Government do not put all this in context and follow from budget to budget a consistent programme for economic and social development.  If such a programme does not exist&mdash;it certainly does not exist in this Government's policies or, rather, lack of them&mdash; then there is, of course, no direction the country can follow.  There is no lead given.  Above all, there is no restraint on the Government by way of judgment on their targets and standards. If they do not clearly set the targets and the standards, they cannot be judged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How this Government have enjoyed not being judged over the last couple of years.  I remember once when <Col N="1967" /> Fianna Fáil were in Government a supplementary budget had to be introduced. There were howls of rage as if something dreadful had been done.  That supplementary budget was exceptional.  Under this Government budgets are no longer exceptional. The Minister has made it quite clear that we can expect another budget later this year if his hopeful prophecies are not realised.  We need more than hope.  We need direction and confidence.  The cliché was &ldquo;A-budget-a-day government&rdquo; and we have had a series of increases in Post Office charges, in ESB charges, in petrol and so on outside of the budget altogether.  Why should the Government restrict themselves to being answerable once a year on an annual budget?  Why should they restrict the free spending programme?  It is much easier to raise money or borrow it as one needs it.</P>
    <P>Does not every businessman, every farmer, every worker and every housewife know it is much easier but, equally, they know that, while it is easier to go along and just get the money when they need it, they also know that that is the sure path to disaster.  It is certainly not responsible. The ordinary businessman must at the beginning of each year set his targets and then go to his bank manager. He must explain fully to his bank manager how much he will need and what the outcome of his investment will be. That is a natural discipline one has to apply in ordinary life.  This Government ignores that discipline completely. They tell us we must be responsible and, if we criticise, they say we are irresponsible, particularly when we argue people should not respond to them even though there is so little to respond to.  Psychologically this is one of the great failures of the Government.</P>
    <P>I honestly would not be too worried if I thought the only effect of the Government's action would be that in a year or two things will improve, even though in the interim we have had a bad time.  That would not worry me if I thought the morale of the country had been sustained during that year or <Col N="1968" /> two.  What is needed is a sense of determination in response to programmes. That determination showed itself many times during Fianna Fáil governments.  If that most vital policy were preserved intact what is happening now would not be so disconcerting. The Minister says a certain unreasonable public attitude is increasing.  I have to accept that, unfortunately, as an unpalatable fact.  It is a disaster. Apart from torpedoing our economic policies the Government have undermined national morale.  Until such time as they produce programmes that can be followed and policies we can understand, together with a sense of direction so that we will know where we are going, there can be no improvement. All the Government are doing is making confusion worse confounded. The public are sidetracked on issues not in the national interest and the more the Government dissipate energies the more they undermine public morale.</P>
    <P>The best that can be said for this budget is that there was nothing in it for us.  That is about the kindest thing people have said about it.  We had doom and gloom presented to us in chronic orchestration, which was only natural because the voices could not be in harmony since there were two different elements involved.  All of us expected severe tax impositions.  We were told we would be facing a maelstrom of problems and somehow or another, having been told that, the budget did not seem all that bad.  We were meant to be relieved.  Taxes were not as heavy as had been anticipated. But there was no new plan, no direction, no confidence, no programme designed to lead the people out of recession, out of the collapse of morale in which we are all floundering around in confusion.  This worries me.  Had taxation been raised to help the building industry, for instance, more employment would have been generated thereby ensuring more people would pay tax, to say nothing of lessening the burden on the smaller and diminishing numbers in employment at the moment.</P>
    <P>Even in the Budget which was meant to take down inflation there <Col N="1969" /> have been proposals, one in particular, widely recognised now to be an injection of the virus of inflation. That was the proposal relating to the increases on petrol and motor car tax. We have all told the Minister that the reality of life around the country is such that this meant for most people in employment who travel about ten miles to work a day in a 12-horse power car an increase of about £3 a week.  They were being told to exercise restraint.  It is impossible to think that a Minister could overlook that.  Whatever might be imposed on what we recognise as non-essentials&mdash;and there is a limit to what we can take&mdash;for example with spirits I think, frankly, people were surprised that the tax on them was not a little more.  There might have been another few million pounds there.  With cigarettes we are in a delicate area because of consumer resistance.  I could cut down on cigarettes; I could probably avoid drinking any spirits; but I certainly could not avoid the consequences of the increased car tax and petrol increases unless I stopped doing my work.  If that is true of me it is certainly true of a large number of people in employment around the country who have to travel on an average ten miles to and from their work every day.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that in that alone surely he is fuelling inflation. Surely the Minister must be consistent when he calls for wage restraint. He talked about introducing the tax-free index.  When people hear of &ldquo;tax-free&rdquo; they always assume there is some new allowance coming. But, in effect, what the Minister is doing, is increasing the cost of living, which will rise because of the VAT increases in this budget.  It is significant that they will not be taken into account in any negotiations relating to the wage agreements arising out of the increases in the consumer index.  That is being a little bit unrealistic.  Take the case of a man who has to pay three pounds a week more for his car and a fair bit more, because of the other increases in the VAT rates, maybe resulting in an average increase of £5 a week.  The Minister says &ldquo;Ah, yes, but this we ignore&rdquo;.  Is that being realistic? <Col N="1970" /> Can you ignore reality?  That is the reality that so many people are questioning.  Why has this tax been necessary?  Because the Government have by their policies been the major agent of our ever-reducing employment in the private sector.  This, of course, must give rise to an increase in social welfare benefits, which in turn must give rise to an ever-increasing tax burden on those who are fortunate enough to remain in employment. Those are simple consequences which flow one from the other.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to take some points the Minister gave on this tax position in the course of his speech.  It is interesting to know, for instance, that at the moment about 5 per cent of the tax revenue comes from limited companies. For a different purpose he introduced the contrast with the position in 1960-61.  Those were the good days of Fianna Fáil, which had confidence in itself and had the confidence of the public.  The position then was that 31 per cent of income tax was contributed by limited liability companies compared with 5 per cent now. The point the Minister was making was that now it is time to bridge that gap, that these companies, who are now apparently getting away without paying their fair share, would now pay a greater share.  However in 1960-61 companies bore over 31 per cent of income tax.  Last year their share had shrunk to about 5 per cent.  Is it because of taxation provisions that the share had shrunk to 5 per cent?  I do not think tax provisions have made so much difference.  If their share had shrunk to 5 per cent it means clearly that the payment of people under PAYE has increased dramatically in the same period.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister should examine the state of these industries so that he can bring them back to the situation they enjoyed in 1960-61.  With increased output, increased economic activity and increased profit&mdash;and that is not a bad word&mdash;they would get back to a situation in which they would be paying a much higher share than 5 per cent of the national tax revenue.  That is not done by simply increasing the taxation on them.  Life <Col N="1971" /> is not as simple as that.  What they need above all else is encouragement, inducement and an opportunity to ensure that they can expand in a way that they certainly have not in the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>By increasing taxation you simply diminish output, thereby imposing a greater burden on the direct income tax payers.</P>
    <P>An interesting thing arises.  The Minister talks about the restraints and the huge increases we have experienced in the last few years.  We must not forget the particular gem contained on page 6 of the typescript of the Minister's speech but that is not appropriate at the moment.  The Minister talks about income increases on the scale that we have suddenly experienced over the last two or three years.  I quote:</P>
    <P>A consequence of that is equally clear.  For the rest of this decade there is no scope without the risk of recreating inflation on a most damaging scale for income increases on the scale that we have suddenly experienced over the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>A strange coincidence&mdash;the past two or three years were the two or three years in which this Government were in office.  Were all the income increases just due to the fact that people suddenly became unreasonable where previously they were reasonable or suddenly unreasonable expectations and demands were made where previously they were reasonable? Was it not due to a very considerable extent to the fact that, when this Government came in, in the first flush of euphoria and enthusiasm they threw it around in their very first budget, like snuff at a wake, to the extent that those of us who had been in Government and who were preparing for a stringent budget could not believe where the Government were getting it in that first budget of 1973?  Quite seriously, we just could not believe it.  I remember the euphoria around this House and in the refreshment rooms of this House on the day of that first budget. It was rather different from the <Col N="1972" /> reaction to this budget.  On the day of the 1973 budget Government Deputies were applauding the Government and themselves on a fantastic budget.  They were saying, &ldquo;We knew we could do it and we did it&rdquo;.  We have all been paying the price in the meantime, and it was a considerable price, in the increase in demands over the last two or three years on the scale we have, as the Minister says, suddenly experienced.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged now that public expenditure has grown to over 50 per cent of our GNP. One could say: &ldquo;Cut back on expenditure in the public sector.&rdquo; That seems to be fine if one could do it and it is not that easy. Obviously, in order to reduce the percentage you must increase output in the private sector dramatically. The public sector will continue to grow.  Any legislation that is introduced in itself gives rise to increasing administration.  That is inevitable. The public sector has within itself the capacity to continue to grow and in order to reduce the percentage one must ensure that the private sector will grow at least at the same rate. That 50 per cent is the highest in Europe.  It is alarmingly high.  If we were a full-blown socialist state it would be fine.  We can hardly be called that.  I do not think the Taoiseach would recognise himself as being a socialist Prime Minister. We are not.  If we were there might be some justification for this high percentage.  We are still free enterprise, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has so fiercely reasserted.  Nonetheless, we find this situation that the public sector has gone ahead to that extent.  That, cannot easily be solved by cutting back on the public sector.  But a good start, even in the public sector, would be if the Ministers were to go back to the personnel limitations in their own offices that we had when we were in Government.  It would be some example.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that since they came into Government the staffs in their own personal offices have increased of the order of 25 per cent <Col N="1973" /> to 30 per cent and we heard what the Minister for Labour was providing for himself today.  If they have increased staff in their offices, that means increasing staff down along the line to service the staff in the Ministers' offices.  That would be an example. The major thing would be to show in this budget some real crash programme for development, for agriculture and above all else in private industry and in the housing sector.</P>
    <P>I would say once again that the Government have never been prepared to accept the effects that their tax proposals have had on the enthusiasm and determination of our investing public, our self-employed people and industrialists.  They have been very significant.  I am not and this party are not in any way against the principle of a wealth tax; but we believe&mdash;and in this we are being realistic&mdash;that such a tax can only be introduced at a time, first of all, when the yield from it will be significant: it is not; it was not worth all the argument.  Secondly, and over and above that only when the country can support it to the point that you know in introducing it you will not restrict or limit the capacity for expansion in the country.  I believe and everyone I talk to believes that this tax has had a very significant effect in undermining investment confidence in the country.</P>
    <P>The Government and all of us are paying the price for the Government's popular promises before the last election. These promises were ill-conceived and hastily presented.  The Government should have recognised that the thing to do was to get the private sector under way and not to penalise it in the way they are doing. The restrictions which they have introduced mean that people do not consider it worthwhile to fill in the forms from the Revenue Commissioners. It is undermining confidence. If these people on whom we depend were given their head to continue doing what they did in the past, there would be a much bigger proportion of GNP coming from the private sector.  We could have again the atmosphere that prevailed in the sixties <Col N="1974" /> when under Fianna Fáil leadership the people felt motivated.</P>
    <P>The people who paid the price for these popular promises are not the wealthy people who we were told would pay the price.  The wealthy people can hide their money, as many of them have done.  They can go away. It is the unemployed who are in the first line of battle.  The others can retreat from the battlefield.  Those in the first line of battle are falling like ninepins. As they fall, the fewer there are in employment and the more there are unemployed.  The figure is increasing all the time.  Unfortunately, even in my own constituency over the last week I have had evidence of established industries being affected.  The meat factory in Roscrea is certainly an established industry.  There are cases of established industries making 60 or 70 employees redundant.  As that happens those who are getting their just entitlement under social welfare, pay-related and unemployment benefit will be drawing on fewer and fewer who are paying.</P>
    <P>What is missing is any sense of a national programme, any sense of direction, any clear indication to any sector that this is where our money is going.  We were told, for instance, that expenditure on social welfare has trebled.  That is fine, but one cannot talk of a social welfare programme on its own.  The expenditure may be quadrupled as unemployment increases and pay-related benefit increases.  The expenditure has to increase.  It is running pell-mell.  It has gone out of control. The Government may boast next year that it has quadrupled.  That is hardly a matter for boasting.  That should be a matter of concern and self-criticism but it is here as being an indication of the Government's commitment to their social programme which we have in the absence of any national overall programme.  The Minister referred to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act in his speech and he said:</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided that the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, should be amended to allow industries to defer equal pay if it should lead to loss <Col N="1975" /> of jobs.  Sex discrimination in public service pay rates is being eliminated with effect from 31st December, 1975, at a cost of £2.5 million in 1976.  This action completely fulfills our EEC obligations and fully conforms with the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, when they can be so wrong in something that was so obvious, that the Minister can only express hope rather than confidence? There is only one way that a Government can discharge their responsibilities. It is not what they give the public. It is certainly not what they give in social welfare.  That is the very antithesis of what a Government's attitude should be.  It is what the Government motivate the public to do for themselves.</P>
    <P>This happened previously in the history of this country.  We had it in the days of the Economic War where the people suffered for a principle because they knew they were laying the basis, the foundation, of our infant industries and our future development programmes. We had the 1960s when there was a real economic take-off because people felt the sense of confidence and determination.  All of that is lacking now.</P>
    <P>When the Government excused themselves in relation to the worst recession which has hit the western world, one thing should be remembered. The 1950s, were really the last years of industrial development here. Then we were in recession and we were the only country in Europe in recession because all other countries at that time were lifting themselves from their knees after the trials and sufferings they had gone through during the war period.  We were receding.  Our young people, like now, were out of employment. This undermined the morale of the people for years.  It is under way again.</P>
    <P>The short term effects of this budget and the Government's policy are bad, but the long term effects on our national morale are far worse.  I do not believe that the Government know how to cure it.  When I spoke on the <Col N="1976" /> budget two years ago I said it would be worthwhile if we anticipated the Government members' qualification for pensions, paying them off then, and we would be well rid of them.  Even if the Taoiseach were to call a general election tomorrow they have qualified as of now because by the time the new Government would come into office they would have had their three years.</P>

The sooner they go and collect their pensions the better, so that this party, which have confidence and determination, can once again motivate the people.  Meanwhile, we can only wait in despair and confusion and listen to the Government excusing their failures by reference to everyone else's.  What a way for an Irish Minister to talk to a country which has a real potential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>To me, and I suppose to many other Irish people, this budget has projected a vivid picture of a Government in complete disarray.  The measures introduced were in a panic situation.  No proper assessment was made of the present situation of our economy.  The approach made to rectify the state of our economy was disastrous.  Deputies on this side of the House have stated that the Irish people are losing confidence in the future of the nation.  This would be the greatest tragedy which could befall us.  Deputies who have to go to industrialists pleading for employment for people are being told that they are sorry, that they are not taking on people but are talking about making people redundant.  Surely the atmosphere which exists in the country must be of great concern.  People are looking for leadership.  They are looking to the Government to provide a policy for recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe any member of the Government, irrespective of his party affiliations, will not agree that this is <Col N="1977" /> the atmosphere people are now living in.  A Government are elected to run the affairs of the nation.  This Government have failed to live up to their responsibilities and they now blame the people for their mismanagement. They have been warned on a number of occasions by spokesmen of this party and by economic experts that corrective measures were essential, but they continued on heedlessly in their reckless borrowing.  Mismanagement is on a scale which was never dreamed of, even in past Coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget speech spoke about a pay pause.  Later on he increased the cost of living far beyond the capacity of a worker's income. How then can the Minister for Finance or the Government expect the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to recommend never mind encourage a pay pause to the workers of the country?  In relation to borrowing the Government have shown quite an extraordinary disregard for even the most elementary canons of financial prudence.  They have left themselves this year with a borrowing requirement for non-capital purposes of £400 million.</P>
    <P>I would not criticise them for borrowing even such large sums which are now involved if the object was to reduce unemployment and create more jobs.  The figure I have just mentioned in relation to borrowing is as near as you can get to the definition of bankruptcy for the economy of the nation.  They are borrowing for nonproductive purposes.  Since they came into office the Government have been involved in a most cynical exercise of borrowing to pay for popularity and votes.  God knows we had the experience of quite a lot of that in the by-election in Mayo.  In the process they have brought the country to its knees and, worse still, they have mortgaged the future of our children. Apart from the purpose of borrowing there is the size of the national debt.</P>
    <P>Already since coming to power the Minister for Finance has the dubious record of being the first Minister of State to double the national debt in three years.  He may well treble it this <Col N="1978" /> year.  At present the national debt is over 60 per cent of GNP.  This is seven times that of France; five times that of Germany and three times that even of Italy.  Only the United Kingdom is on the same level.  It might be interesting if somebody did a little exercise as to what it means to the people.  The annual sum required to service our national debt is now equivalent to £7 to £10 per week per household.  I give that figure without fear of contradiction.</P>
    <P>The economic disease of inflation is the most virulent of all.  It destroys the most stable elements in any economy, particularly a small economy like ours.  The primary objective of Government policy for 1976 should have been to reduce it.  Instead of that the Minister has recently introduced a budget which, apart altogether from wages, is bound to be severely inflationary. This will carry with it no vestige of advantage either in terms of growth or the creation of jobs.  It is extremely unlikely that the Government will be able to bring inflation down to 15 per cent this year.  They have neither the will nor the capacity to do so.  In 1976 we have the worst of all possible worlds.  We have massive and rising unemployment.  We have the most draconian taxation in the history of the State and we still have not begun to solve the basic problem of inflation.</P>
    <P>One of the most disappointing aspects of the budget was the total unconcern of the Minister for Finance for the 50,000 young people who completed their leaving certificate last year.  This year over 80,000 students will complete their inter and leaving certificates.  It will be said that some may go back to education.  Dealing a lot with young people I can say education is so costly now that they cannot return.  It is alarming therefore to have the prospect of 80,000 more young people seeking employment by the end of next June.  One must appreciate the concern of parents who have made sacrifices to educate their children, and we must appreciate the frustration building up in our young people at the failure of the Government to provide the necessary moneys for employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> The Minister must be aware of the many community services which could provide work for young people.  The Leader of my own party made this important point in his speech here on the budget.  The proviso of such work would at least convey that the Government were interested in their future.  Anyone dealing with youth will agree that the frustration suffered by these young people is very dangerous. I would ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour to look at the whole structure of AnCO in the hope that they may facilitate the involvement of young people in community work.  It has been done in the western part of the country by AnCO, and I appreciate that very much.  Young people who would, for instance, restore the homes of old people, would be doing work of benefit to the nation.</P>
    <P>The building trade has the greatest employment content of all the nation's activities.  It is difficult to understand &mdash;and I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is here&mdash;the recent announcement of the Minister for Local Government on behalf of the Government regarding housing grants and the increased rate of interest on housing loans.  Last year 80 per cent of the people building their own homes were entitled to a grant.  Only 40 per cent will be so entitled this year under the new regulations laid down by the Minister for Local Government.  Yet it is estimated that 25,000 workers in the building trade will be among those in the labour exchange queues.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that the measures taken by the Minister for Finance were panic measures, because the most beneficial area of employment to any nation is the building trade.  There are so many people involved; even the little man in the village shop is selling something that is of importance where building is concerned.  It is sad to find even local authorities being asked to slow down their building programme. We have yet to hear from the Minister for Local Government what moneys will be allocated to local authorities for their building programme this year.</P>

Fewer cars are being bought with the result that fewer rubber tyres will be needed.  There are two other great industries in my constituency, breweries, which down through the years have also given employment.  I defy the Minister to contradict me when I say that only a Minister in panic would have brought in such a budget. One must assess the overall picture before presenting a budget.  It has been said that the Minister changed his budget a week before its introduction. I am inclined to believe that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Coalition claim to be a Socialist Government.  If that were true the Minister's budget would not have been aimed at the working middle classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary looks at his own constituency he will see <Col N="1981" /> that many of his constituents have to travel very long distances to and from work.  The Minister for Finance was talking as if a motor car was a luxury. In my constituency many hundreds of workers travel to Verolme Dockyard, Irish Steel, and so on.  I estimate that it will cost them between £6.50 and £7 a week extra because of the increases in insurance, road tax, petrol and so on.  I appeal to the Minister to give some income tax concession to the worker, or any person who must use his car for his livelihood.  The people are not as blind as the Minister thinks.</P>
    <P>I read in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> last Tuesday that we will have gas in Cork in 1978.  Under that article was the heading &ldquo;Cork Harbour Development Plan Shelved&rdquo;.  Every time there is a crisis in the Government, every time there is an increase in the cost of living, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister for Foreign Affairs makes a statement to the country about the civil war in the North or the threat of civil war in the South.  In my view it is terrible that the tragedies of the North should be used to distract the people from the appalling state of our economy.  I hate to condemn anyone but I am sure the editor of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> was thinking as I am thinking. We are told that we will have gas in 1978 but the most important thing <Col N="1982" /> at the moment for Cork city, county and neighbouring counties is the Cork Harbour development plan.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister know just how important this is?  Recently members of my local authority went on a deputation to Scotland to see the kind of development they had and which we would need.  We are talking about gas and oil but the harbour, one of the greatest in the country, is not ready and will not be ready for many years to meet the requirements of the oil and gas companies.  As I said earlier, measures were taken in panic and a proper assessment should have been made of our economy.  Any money injected into a plan like this will be of benefit to the nation.  We have been told by other countries that oil companies do not just sit back; they come into the local authorities and say: &ldquo;We want this, and we want it now.  If you have not got it, goodbye&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>A deserted wife's allowance has been continuously in payment to the person named by the Deputy since 21st January, 1971.  This allowance was reduced to the personal rate with effect from 5th July, 1973, when she ceased to have a qualified dependant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> According to the information on the original claim form the applicant was under 40 years of age in July, 1973, when her last qualified dependant ceased to reside in the State.  On that basis she was not entitled to the deserted wife's allowance, but due to an oversight payment of the allowance continued.  The apparent error came to light in September, 1975, when it was also found that her dependant had resumed living with her on 4th July, 1974.  This meant that she was again entitled to the deserted wife's allowance from that date, but would have been disqualified on age grounds between July, 1973, and July, 1974. The applicant then stated, however, that her date of birth had been wrongly taken as 15th November, 1935, when it was, in fact, 15th November, 1929.  In view of the possibility of an earlier overpayment, the arrears due from July, 1974, in respect of her dependant were withheld until the position regarding her date of birth was clarified.  She was unable to furnish a birth certificate to support her claim that she was born in 1929 and inquiries at the General Register Office failed to trace such an entry. She has now, however, furnished a baptismal certificate showing her date of birth as 15th November, 1929, and this has been accepted.  A payable order for £182.70 covering the arrears due has accordingly been sent to her.</P>
