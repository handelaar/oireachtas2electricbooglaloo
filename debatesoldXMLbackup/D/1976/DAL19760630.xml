      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in ten days&mdash;and it is approximately that length of time since this question was tabled&mdash;he should have had an opportunity to inquire into the accurate position and as to why the regulations were not adhered to in this instance?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is fully aware that the contractor in the case has certain legal rights, that these are very definite things and that the whole matter has to be looked at from this point of view.  The Deputy knows perfectly well that the Government and I are very desirous that there should be the maximum amount of employment given in the country, that we do not desire at all to see foreign goods being used but there are difficult and involved legal matters here.  I am doing my best for the Deputy and for the effort we want to make but the Deputy need not try to put the blame on to this side of the House.  The Deputy is fully aware that under EEC regulations we cannot specify that Irish goods must be used.  He is merely playing mischief for no other purpose except to gain votes in Monaghan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Our main concern is to retain any employment left in Monaghan, that we would retain that in spite of the Government's efforts. Is the Minister not aware that heretofore tender forms were sent out to <Col N="1971" /> manufacturers and producers and that, in this instance, that was not done with this concern in Monaghan? They normally gave a letter of clearance if they were unable to supply those goods.  They did not get an opportunity to tender for them, which is the normal procedure in such instances.  I want to know why were the normal procedures not adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is fully aware that the normal procedures were adhered to.  He is fully aware also that this was not a question of Departmental tender.  It was a question of a contract a firm made to build the barracks in Monaghan.  That firm has its rights within that contract and that matter is being looked at.  The Deputy is deliberately playing mischief for no other purpose except to suggest in Monaghan that we do not want to see Irish tiles used.  That is not true.  But within our requirements under the Treaty of Accession to the EEC, we were limited in what we could do.  We made our contract. The matter of sending out subtenders is not one of the Department of Defence.  It is for the successful tenderer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's contention.  I maintain that the normal procedures were not adhered to and I have evidence that they were not adhered to.  That is why I am asking the Minister to tell us why they were not adhered to.  He can talk until the cows come home about playing mischief or politics but the facts are that the normal procedures were not adhered to in this instance and why were they not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of adherence or non-adherence to practice is a matter for the contractor concerned. The Department of Defence are involved in this only to the extent of the contract they made, which was done bearing in mind our position in relation to the Treaty of Accession to the EEC.  As far as the Government and my Department are concerned, we <Col N="1972" /> make every effort to see to it that Irish goods are used.  The matter is most complex and the Deputy, as I said before, is playing mischief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants an absolute definition of a situation in which one could define exactly how a successful tenderer would behave in relation to a contract to a Government Department.  I have indicated to the Deputy that there are difficulties in relation to the Treaty of Accession to the EEC.  But the question of normal tendering, or definition of how one would behave, is a matter more for the contractor than for the Department. <Col N="1973" /> It is a highly complex situation and we are looking at the position to see what we can do.  Our every effort is to help.  Deputy Leonard and Deputy Wilson&mdash;who will be in the same constituency next time&mdash;are playing mischief.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that, on a number of occasions, we had to get in touch with his Department regarding local suppliers not being given an opportunity, that we had to get in touch with the Department regarding sand, gravel, concrete pipes, pre-cast concrete beams?  Is it not a sad situation that this is the fifth time we have had to get in touch with his Department to seek fair play for local producers and providers of products which were freely available inside the county, which were labour-intensive and which would have provided jobs sorely needed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we be clear on this matter?  The Estimates now are being rushed through by the Government in a matter of hours.  This side of the House has consented to the Government's proposals in this regard on the basis of two facts: (i) that we will be allowed to debate the major Estimates afterwards on a token Estimate and (ii) that it is necessary from the legal point of view to get these Estimates through now.  I would have thought that, in those circumstances, there would be a degree of flexibility.  Since we are not enabled to develop various points we would have wished to develop regarding <Col N="1974" /> various Estimates, I would have thought there would have been a degree of flexibility whereby questions could be asked and short speeches made.  I would ask that the Chair would co-operate in that regard because I assumed that it was the intention of the Government side that there would be a degree of flexibility in dealing with these Estimates.</P>

      <P>I have never been accused of being bullying or intimidating in this House before.  I was not bullying or intimidating.  I want to repeat what I have been saying, perhaps at the expense of being out of order.  My Department did not invite tenders.  There was a sub-contract for tiling.  There is a legal document and there is the Treaty of Accession to the EEC.  Those are the matters that are involved.  For the Deputy to try to throw mud over on this side of the House on that basis is quite mischievous and is done for purposes not proper to the best interests of the House.</P>

The Department have so far helped to the extent of an expenditure of £178,000, subject to correction and without going to my file, on three prototypes and at the point in time when real interest will be shown in the way of purchase then we would try to help Professor Timoney in every <Col N="1976" /> possible way, but we do not want to intrude on his rights.  We have our rights, having spent the money to produce the prototype vehicle, and he has his rights as the person who evolved the vehicle.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this vehicle has been advertised in an international magazine as being made in a factory in Bornem in Belgium? There is in the magazine a photograph of the Timoney personnel armoured carrier in which this State has invested £178,000 and we now find these vehicles are being manufactured in Belgium for distribution on the Continent and elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely at a time when there is high unemployment here, every effort should be made to ensure the development of this vehicle at home to provide much needed employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to Professor Timoney and the Belgian trip is that he desires that a large portion of the work on his vehicle will be done here by him and another portion done in Belgium.  I would not like to give any percentages but, at this stage of the negotiations, it would appear to us that, if he succeeds, he will create very considerable employment here.  The manufacture of portion of the vehicle would be done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>But portion will be made in Belgium.  Would the Minister indicate if there has been a dispute for some time between Timoney Bros, and the Department in regard to getting on with the job of producing the vehicle and that is the reason why Professor Timoney has gone to Belgium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I categorically deny there is any dispute between Professor Timoney and the Department of Defence.  All the Department have done is insist that the vehicle will go through its performance and emerge from that performance without any positive fault.  They are reaching a conclusion on that and, in the meantime in order to facilitate Professor Timoney, I <Col N="1977" /> agreed he could take Army personnel and one of the vehicles&mdash;he did not want any more&mdash;to Belgium.  His intention is to do most of the work here and to have certain works done in Belgium if the vehicles are for the Belgian authorities.  That is the position. All we will do here is harm Professor Timoney by going into the matter in too great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now aware that a photograph of the Timoney APC, together with a photograph of the factory where it is being produced in Belgium, has appeared in an international magazine advertising the vehicle as being manufactured in Bornem in Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware but I am prepared to take the Deputy's word for it.  Whether or not that is so, the position is there is no dispute with Professor Timoney.  We have facilitated him in every way.  The vehicle is in Belgium and he is happy with the volume of work he can do here, mainly on gear boxes and other important parts which he himself has designed, and the manufacture of these parts will create a large volume of employment. A certain proportion of the employment will be created in Belgium. There is as yet no definite bargain and so no conclusion.  I have no knowledge of the advertisement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but at this point in time I have given the House all the information I can and the wisest thing for Deputy Dowling to do now is to desist and let Professor Timoney go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sad state of affairs when we are told now by the Minister for Defence that a major portion of the production of this carrier is going to Belgium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated he is going to do the gear boxes <Col N="1978" /> here and certain other parts.  Tell us what is going to be made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not what I said. I am not prepared to go into details of what is being made in Belgium and what is being made here but, as I understand it, all the more detailed and important parts are to do with gear boxes and so on and all that work will be done here.  I leave Professor Timoney to make his bargain and come back to us.  I absolutely deny I said the major portion of the work would be done in Belgium.  I did not say that. At this point in time one wonders is it wise to be raising this matter in such detail here.  Professor Timoney is in Belgium trying to make a deal and as I see it if he is successful with the Belgian authorities he may well make other bargains which would mean the total construction of the vehicle here. That is what he is at now and I can do no more than help him, can I?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This has excited the attention of European and American personnel from the point of view of a very substantial improvement in APCs. The State has put, according to the Minister, £178,000 into this vehicle and one would expect that the production of the vehicles&mdash;we were able to produce the prototype here&mdash;would be done here to provide much needed employment and it is rather sad to be told by the Minister that portion of the vehicle will be made in Belgium. A great number of our unemployed would be only too glad to be doing a job producing this very excellent vehicle.  As I said, I will send the Minister a photostat of the factory in Belgium from the magazine in which it has been advertised as being manufactured in Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is Professor Timoney is in Belgium trying to make a bargain and he has not as yet put the bargain to the Department so all the codswallop we have been listening to from Deputy Dowling is set at naught because I cannot make a decision on something that has not come before me.  All we can do is <Col N="1979" /> wait and see what Professor Timoney will produce.  I will be glad to get the photostat to which the Deputy referred but all I know at this moment is that the vehicle has not yet passed all its tests.  At the urgent request of Professor Timoney, we allowed him to take Army personnel and one vehicle to Belgium and the indication was that the major portion of the work would be done here.  We have not yet said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to anything. All we can do at the moment is help Professor Timoney.  I do not want to stress this but, to some extent, I fear Deputy Dowling is not helping Professor Timoney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that codswallop, I repeat how sad it is to get from the Minister an indication that portion of this vehicle will be manufactured outside the country when we have so many unemployed and an excellent project, developed at the expense of the taxpayers, which could be manufactured here for the benefit of our own people, who are just as competent to do the work as the Belgians, the Italians or anybody else.  The magazine to which I referred is an internationally known military magazine which advertises such things as APCs and a wide range of weapons.  I will send the Minister the photostat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may do that but, as Minister for Defence, I have had no opportunity so far to make a decision in relation to this vehicle.  It has not finally passed all its tests by our own Army.  We accommodated Professor Timoney. We do not know what the proposal will be from Professor Timoney. There was an indication that a portion might be made in Belgium.  I am waiting for suggestions or proposals from Professor Timoney.  A sum of £178,000 of State money has been spent on it.  We will make our decision when we know what Professor Timoney wants.  At this point I do not think people are being helpful.</P>

Whether these services are to provide guards at prisons, at Montrose or at post offices is merely a question of the Army being asked out because the police force consider that they require greater numbers of Army personnel.  When the Garda Síochána want Army personnel they ask for them and the Department of Defence provide that service.  I have no knowledge at the moment of what requests have been made.  If they are made they will be acceded to because in aid of the civil power means that the Army comes out in aid of law and order and of the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuring the House that I was fortified at that time by that Government decision.  The yard has been kept going.  Drawings were examined and changes were made.  As a result of the cod war it has been <Col N="1983" /> necessary to make some expensive changes in the vessel which differ from the <i>Le Déirdre.</i> What was needed was greater water-tight integrity which means we must have a greater number of bulkheads.  If there is any kind of collision between that ship and another, the greater number of bulkheads will mean more safety.  It will mean greater safety than we have for the crew of the <i>LE Déirdre</i> at the moment.  All of that meant planning, changes and work for Verolme and all the planning has been done.  I am happy that it will be a better vessel than the <i>LE Déirdre</i> and that it is being delivered in the fastest possible time consonant with the need for work in Verolme.</P>
      <P>This Government did something that Deputies opposite should remember. We availed of our right under EEC regulations not to put this ship out for contract.  It was defined as a warship and, therefore, we did not have to send it to all the yards in the EEC.  We could buy it at home.  However, we could not just write an open cheque for it.  We had to employ Irish Shipping as our agents and we had to go into every detail of cost with Verolme to ensure that we could buy a boat in Cork at the proper price. That has taken months.  I was fortified by the Government decision when I said it would be built in Cork.  It will be available at the earliest date possible.</P>

      <P>Another matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention has to do with the west of Ireland and Shannon Airport.  We all know responsibility for running the airport rested with Aer Rianta in the past two years. Shannon Airport, which is one of our success stories, was always run at local level, under local management, with an airport manager and a controller of sales and catering.  It was run very successfully.  It always made a decent profit in sales and catering down through the years.  People employed there had a great personal interest in the success of the airport.</P>
      <P>Recently Aer Rianta have been transferring all power of decision making from the airport to Dublin. This is a matter of grave concern and it will not lead to good relations between employees and management. This is happening even at the level of appointing summer staff, or temporary staff, or holiday staff, or whatever you like to call them, at the airport during the summer season.  I understand these decisions are now being made by Aer Rianta.  All the power of the present management is being eroded by the management of Aer Rianta.  I have had many complaints already from employees, some of whom have been working there for 25 years.  It will lead to serious employer-employee trouble. We never had a strike in Shannon until Aer Rianta were involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should look into this matter and ensure that the power of decision making at local level is not removed.  If the airport had not been run successfully in the past there might be some reason for doing this, but it has been run successfully.  Even in the past two years when tourism figures had dropped the cash flow and turnover and profit at the airport helped to keep Cork Airport going, which needs a bit of a boost as the Minister knows.  The local airport manager and his staff are fully capable of running this airport without any interference from head office in small decisions <Col N="1986" /> which were always made at local level. All issues should be dealt with at local level.  I would ask the Minister to get involved immediately and prevent this happening in future, and to undo what has been done.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention legislation which was introduced here last week to provide a further subsidy for the ESB.  In our opinion it is totally inadequate and it will make no impact on the very high charges the ESB are levying on people seeking the installation of current in new houses and in existing houses.  There is provision for £300,000.  During the by-elections the Minister announced in Ballycroy in Mayo that he would introduce legislation but I doubt £300,000 would complete the installation of current in Ballycroy parish alone.  What is the procedure about making some changes and providing more money?  There will be grave disappointment throughout the country because of the expectations people had that some relief would be introduced when the Minister introduced legislation.</P>

      <P>This is the only opportunity we have of discussing State-sponsored bodies such as CIE and the ESB.  I should like to know from the Minister what interest he has taken in the deterioration in the service CIE are providing to the western seaboard and particularly Donegal.  Is he aware of their failure to effect deliveries as they did heretofore?  They are now selecting depots for central distribution.  This is causing an extra charge to be placed on goods delivered to Donegal and puts us in a rather disadvantaged position and encourages more cross-Border traffic, legitimate or otherwise.  This is a serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time does not permit me to make a long speech but I want to remind the Minister that when railways were closed&mdash;and inquiries were made into the pros and cons of the effects of the closures at the time&mdash;CIE and the Department undertook that not only would we have as good a service in the future but that we would have a better service as a result of the substitution of a road service for the rail service.  Now we are left with little <Col N="1987" /> money for our roads and with a rapidly deteriorating transport service and nobody seems to bother or worry about us.  Somebody has got to do something about it because we are left in a serious position and the people are irate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one question.  Will he impress on CIE that closing stations and cutting down services is not the panacea for all ills?  Will he request them to endeavour to promote business rather than disemploying people? The most recent instance of this was where passenger services, goods services and various other services were cut down.  I am convinced that, if they had a proper sales system, they could promote business.  On every occasion in which they find themselves in economic difficulties, the only recourse they have is to cut down services, close stations and disemploy people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that on 6th April we on this side of the House proposed a Private Members' Motion deploring the &ldquo;actions of the Government which have reduced the competitiveness of the Irish tourist industry and recommends that subventions necessary to restore competitiveness be provided&rdquo;. The Minister did not accept that motion and moved a motion: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann recognises that the aim of the Government is to carry out a development programme for tourism to enable the industry to expand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the figures were very much higher for 1976 than for 1975.  Has his attention been drawn to a recent report from the Central Statistics Office stating that, for the first three months of the year, business in hotels and guesthouses was up by 27 per cent, despite the fact that the total number of bed nights was down by 10 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister not think that is a very serious situation in the first few months after those budgetary competitiveness of the tourist indusmeasures were introduced, despite the <Col N="1988" /> try?  When this House returns the tourist season will be practically over.  Would he not think that something should be done now, and quickly, to arrest this decline of ten per cent in three months, that this massive increase of 27 per cent is entirely due to inflation and the increase in VAT from 7.35 per cent to ten per cent and the budgetary drink increases?  I would ask the Minister to examine that very carefully and to say what steps he intends to take to arrest that decline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the points as they were raised.  Deputy Barrett referred to Aer Rianta and to the Bill circulated last week in regard to rural electrification.  The question of Aer Rianta transferring decisionmaking from Shannon Airport to Dublin would be one for the board of Aer Rianta: it would be part of their internal organisation.  I am not empowered to interfere and give them directions, as Deputy Barrett seems to think I should.  However, I shall discuss with the chairman the points he has raised and the fears of the people in Shannon about the effect of decisions that may be taken in this regard by the Board of Aer Rianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not wait for the by-election in west Mayo to make the announcement about rural electrification.  I had made it previously and reiterated it there.  What I said this time last year and again in Ballycroy in Mayo was quite specific.  I reiterated a number of times in this House that what I had in mind was that there were people in remote areas who, because of the high capital charge for the connection of electricity, were unable to take electricity. I instanced a number of places, Woodford in Galway, Ballycroy in Mayo, the Black Valley in Kerry and other places including Donegal, Deputy Brennan's constituency.  I said these people were at a serious disadvantage because they were in the poorer and remote areas and that because they were in these areas, the charge was much higher than for people who had nearer sources of electricity.  I undertook to pay the capital charge being asked by the ESB <Col N="1989" /> for connection to those houses.  I was quite precise in that any time I spoke on the matter, and Deputy Barrett was there the morning I spoke in west Mayo.  That is all I undertook to do, and the Bill circulated last week will do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said the £300,000 would not be sufficient.  This is the ESB's estimate of what it will cost, not mine.  This is what they say will be involved in supplying these people with electricity, and I am taking their word for it.  The Bill will be passed, hopefully, at the end of this year, and it will give electricity to these people who are deprived, purely because of their remoteness and the cost of connecting electricity, of what is nowadays considered almost a necessity of life.  For as long as rural electrification has been going on since the end of the last war, they could not take the electricity.  They will now get it without paying a capital charge.  I think that is a good thing, and I have no apology to make to the people of Ballycroy or Woodford for whom this legislation is geared to cater.</P>

      <P>I will take that up with CIE, as I will do with any other specific instances that are given.  About six weeks ago I circulated a Road Transport Bill, and one of the provisions in that Bill is that, while up to now a licensed haulier could operate only one lorry on one licence, he will be able to operate as many as he likes. A second provision, which would be of particular relevance to more remote areas, is that no licence is required for a lorry of six tons laden weight.  It will now be possible for people who were not previously in the haulage business in a small way to go into it, or it will be possible for the licensed <Col N="1990" /> hauliers in the private sector to expand their service, because there will be no limitation on the number of lorries they can use on their licence to pick up goods where it is thought CIE are not doing a proper job.  In the meantime, if any Deputy is concerned that an inadequate service is being provided by CIE&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the extra cost?  After CIE discharge their cargo we have to get a haulier to bring it to the point of delivery.  Other counties do not have to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  In any area there are CIE depots beyond which they will not deliver.  There will always be people who will have to draw their goods from a CIE depot or dropping point.  I do not think there is a door-to-door delivery service unless you pay extra for it.  It may happen fortuitously that someone is on a CIE route or next door to a CIE depot, and he will not have to pay the extra charge, but, by and large, people have goods delivered to a central point whether it is a railway station or a depot, and must draw from there.  CIE do not lightly or maliciously withdraw services in order to impede the progress of any area or to deliberately deprive an area of a service which they enjoyed up to that.  Generally speaking, there is a sound financial reason, mainly lack of support by the local traders or local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to Deputy Faulkner's point about CIE's attitude to closing stations rather than promoting business.  I would certainly agree with him that CIE should promote business and make as many services as possible economic and profitable, but we must face the fact that the Estimate we are passing today is for £52 million, and 60 per cent of that is a subsidy for CIE, £28 million of that £52 million.  That is £500,000 a week or almost £100,000 a day to keep CIE operating.  If a line is uneconomic and if CIE keep that line on and it continues to lose money, then it has not been supported by the people for whose benefit it is there.  If there is a loss on it, that bill must be met <Col N="1991" /> by taxation.  CIE must strike a balance between coming to the ordinary taxpayer for further funds or trying to cut back.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that this is what McKinsey recommended, the consultants who were brought in in 1970, to study the whole operation. They reported that CIE could not continue to operate the vast range of railway services which they were offering at that time, that they would have to curtail, solidify and modernise their handling equipment for goods in order to become competitive with the private haulier who was continually taking trade away from CIE.  The legislation for private hauliers was originally designed partly to protect CIE, the national carrier, but of the goods hauled in this country at the moment, CIE are doing only 7, 8 or 9 per cent, something as minimal as that, and the private haulier is doing another 7 per cent, and about 80 to 83 per cent of haulage in this country is being done on what is called &ldquo;own account&rdquo; haulage&mdash;from the point of view of the economy the most wasteful method of carrying goods.  This is because the firm owners who put their own transport on the road were evidently quite satisfied that they could not get either from the private hauliers or CIE a service to satisfy them at a price which they consider competitive.  That is one of the reasons I brought in this Road Transport Bill because I want to discourage people from hauling their own goods as much as possible and to build up a fully professional road transport system that would be profitable to the road hauliers and be of economic benefit to the country in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What the McKinsey Report recommended was that rather than having drops of small parcels at a large number of stations throughout the country they could gather in one depot and make <Col N="1992" /> big drops or concentrate in a number of depots and make these viable in handling big amounts of goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I have not dealt with Deputy Leonard's point. He talked about tourism and bed-nights being down 10 per cent in March.  If he got the April figures for 1976 he would see an enormous increase in the number of bed-nights for April, 1976, over 1975.  Of course there is an explanation for this.  Easter in 1975 fell in March and Easter in 1976 was in April.  In fact the figures up to date for this year show that the overall number of people coming to this country is up on 1975, as I prophesised it would be.  It is significantly up from the mainland of Europe.  I am satisfied with the increase from America.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the figures are down in the United Kingdom, traditionally our biggest and nearest market.  We are the destination that from the customer's point of view the English people should be looking to, because the cost of going to the Continent for them, because of the devaluation of the pound, is very much higher than it was even last year.  But the figures are down for the first four months of this year over last year, and that is very disappointing.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any one reason for it.  There are a number of reasons.  But over all the tourism figures so far this year are up on last year.  It is just a matter of chance that Easter fell in March last year.  You remember last year Easter was very early, and Easter, as far as tourism into Ireland is concerned, is a very heavy period. It is one of the peaks of the tourist industry so that according as it falls in March or April, it unbalances the figures for that month.</P>

      <P>Yes, the federation applied to the National Prices Commission. They do not have to apply now, they are free to raise their own charges without applying to the National Prices Commission, but the hotels did raise their charges by 25 per cent from the 1st of January this year.  I am not sure when it was, but sometime in the last two years the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that they were one of the groups that would not in the future have to apply to the National Prices Commission to raise their prices. Therefore when they did there was not the publicity attached that there would be in the publication of an ordinary NPC report, but they did give notice to Bord Fáilte in the printing of the Bord Fáilte hotels registration book last October or November or whenever it was, and their charges for 1976 were up that much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Parliamentary Secretary is not available either, which is a pity.  It is obviously totally unsatisfactory in these circumstances to try even to begin a debate of any description on industry and commerce which is a very wide ranging <Col N="1995" /> topic.  If I get the opportunity, and I do not know whether I will, I will try to speak in some detail about it on the Adjournment Debate, but in the very few minutes at my disposal I should like to make some brief general observations about the situation in which our economy finds itself today, particularly from the standpoint of commerce and of industry.</P>
      <P>The basic problem which faces us so far as job creation is concerned today is that we are informed by the various semi-official economic commentators attached to the ESRI and other similar organisations, and it is not denied that in the 12 years from 1974 to 1986 if we are to achieve what they describe for the purposes of their academic papers as full employment&mdash;and a 4 per cent unemployment rate in this country is full employment for the purposes of economic commentators&mdash;we must in each of the years from 1974 to 1986 create net 30,000 new jobs, that is after the loss of any jobs that unavoidably are going to be lost in each of those years.  We must create a plus figure in each of those years of 30,000.</P>
      <P>We have not the faintest hope, with the way things have been going over the past two years, of even approaching that sort of target.  The figures for 1974 and 1975, as supplied by the IDA, show that there was no plus whatever, that in fact there was a net loss of jobs in each of the two years concerned. This is dealing only with jobs which the IDA are concerned with, industrial employment. This does not take into account the almost inevitable loss of jobs taking place in any event in agriculture and the apparent loss of jobs, although one cannot get exact figures for it, in the service sector of commerce. In industry alone, which is the job creation sector, there has been a net loss in each of the years 1974 and 1975.  This increases therefore our target from 30,000 jobs per annum to something considerably above that.  It makes it a figure of something in the region of 36,000 net new jobs per annum between now and 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should seriously ask itself have we the faintest hope of reaching even 50 per cent of that target, or are we therefore going <Col N="1996" /> to commit our people almost <i>ad infinitum</i> to an extraordinarily high rate of unemployment?  Are we going to deepen further in the minds of many of our people, and, tragically above all others, in the minds of young people the mentality that as long as they have enough dole in their pockets they should be reasonably happy and should not be complaining?  Is this the kind of dynamism that will allow this country to take off economically? Much of such a bad nature has been happening over the last few days in relation to wage agreements and bank closures and so on.  A very significant set of figures which was published only on Monday last, 25th June, has to some extent tended to have been overshadowed.  That is the publication of the consumer price index to mid May.  It is a frightening document.  Perhaps the figures in it have a greater effect on industry and on the long-term creation of employment than any other single factor. We have the frightening situation that in the quarter to mid May, which immediately follows a quarter in which we had a rise in the consumer price index of 7.3 per cent, we have a further rise of 6.2 per cent. That is an overall rise in the six months to mid May, 1976, of 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate in the first six months of 1976 is more than double what it is for 12 months in every EEC country other than Britain.  The indications are now that our inflation rate of 14 per cent in the six months to mid May, 1976, will in fact be more than the annual inflation rate of Britain in 1976.  What chance has our industry in these circumstances?  How are we going to create 36,000 net new jobs per annum between now and 1986 when we are faced with these kind of figures, when the competitiveness of our industry is virtually put in an impossible position?  What hope is there for any long-term job creation when we are faced with the crippling blow of this inflation?  It cannot be denied that the greater part of this inflation is Government fuelled and Government <Col N="1997" /> created because a very high proportion of that 14 per cent inflation we have suffered in the last six months is a direct result of higher indirect taxes imposed by the Government in the budget of January, 1976.</P>
    <P>We are facing a position in which our hopes for job creation, if present fiscal and industrial policies are continued, are very slight indeed.  I see it as the principal function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this or in any other free country to create an atomosphere in which new investment or reinvestment in industry is encouraged.  One has only, unfortunately, to look around one in the country today to see the lack of new investment, other than what is being handed out by the State, to see the almost total absence of reinvestment. This arises from two factors.  The first is that there are not profits to reinvest in most cases and, secondly, even where there are the whole atmosphere is so discouraging that very few people are now willing to take the risk of reinvesting whatever profits there are.</P>
    <P>I say to the Government&mdash;I cannot say it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that in the long term and indeed even in the comparatively short term the only real place that jobs will be created, the only real way they will be created, is as a result of investment in industry in the country.  We are not having it because the atmosphere is wrong.  The atmosphere is not one of encouragement to those who want to take a risk.  It is not one of encouragement to those who want to work hard.  It is one of discouragement and disincentive, tragically.  The results of that situation are around us for all to see with the highest rate of unemployment in the EEC and the highest rate of inflation not alone in the EEC but in the whole of Europe if one excludes Iceland, which is such a small country and suffering from such particular difficulties that it is hardly worth taking into account for comparative purposes.</P>
    <P>We have all these terrible disadvantages. It is important to remember that they are disadvantages which we have created ourselves.  I mean by that, that I can prove that they have in <Col N="1998" /> fact in large measure been created by the Government over the past two-anda-half years.  We have an atmosphere of economic uncertainty in the country at the moment arising from an enoromous number of sources, all adding together to one of pervading uncertainty and an unwillingness to take risks and make investment which would create employment.  We are dooming our people, if we continue as we are, to an unemployment rate of 9, 10, 11 and even 12 per cent over the next decade.</P>
    <P>We have opportunities to avail of now but we are not availing of them because people are not prepared to take the risks which are necessary. The greatest opportunity we have is, paradoxically, the fact that our £ is tied to the £ sterling which has depreciated over 40 per cent since December, 1971, against the major currencies in the world.  We have a glorious opportunity for exports. Although they are increasing they are only doing so at a figure slightly in excess of the rate of inflation that has been current over the past two years.  There has been very little increase in real terms in exports, particularly in the last 12 months, when our export figures have shot up.  A very high proportion of that increase has been due to the export of animals and animal products, whether meat, milk or milk products.</P>
    <P>Our manufacturing industries, which have had a glorious opportunity which possibly will never be repeated again, have failed to avail of that opportunity because the capital investment in those industries is not high enough and there is no incentive to create that investment. There are factories in the country at the moment working at a capacity of perhaps 75 per cent or 50 per cent because they do not feel it is worth taking up the slack that is there and which could be taken up without any great capital investment at all but which could create worth-while employment which could give worth-while opportunity for profit and for export.  Unfortunately profit in the country over the last couple of years has become a word which is regarded as almost immoral. <Col N="1999" /> It is no longer regarded as legitimate or proper that a firm or a business of any kind should seek to make a reasonable return or profit.</P>
    <P>Our average return on capital invested in manufacturing industry in the country at the moment is about 4 per cent.  It may be marginally under that.  Do the Government or the House realise what would happen if the people who have capital in manufacturing industry in the country at the moment endeavoured to liquidate that capital, if they were able to do it, and put it simply into Government loans and sit back knowing that they can get a return on long-term Government loans at the moment of about 13.5 per cent without lifting a little finger either for themselves or their country?  Is there any incentive in a situation where one is subject to tremendous risks for a very small return and where, without any risk whatever, you can get a return of three or four times as high as that for which you take a huge risk?  There is no incentive, and that is why we are in the situation we are in and why, unlike other countries in Europe and elsewhere, we are not pulling out of the general recession which was current throughout Europe and the USA two years ago.  It is not so any longer in any country other than Britain and Ireland and Britain, happily for her, shows every indication that she will get out of it very soon.</P>
    <P>I have referred to one aspect of the Government's industrial policy very often.  It is one I cannot understand.  I do not know what their purpose is in almost going out of their way, and being seen to go out of their way, not to encourage the manufacture of articles here which could be manufactured here, either small or large capital items.  Indeed they have been seen almost to encourage the purchase of such commodities abroad.  Already this morning in the very unlikely area of defence Deputy Leonard drew attention to the purchase of a whole range of commodities necessary for a barracks under construction in <Col N="2000" /> Monaghan.  All of these commodities are manufactured in this country but they are being imported.  Not alone are Irish firms not getting this sort of work but they are not even getting the opportunity to tender in many cases.</P>
    <P>There is a classic example of it in something I can recall from my time in Government as the magnificent scientific achievement of an Irishman, Professor Timoney, who designed an armoured personnel carrier which he was most anxious to have manufactured in this country.  This vehicle is now being manufactured in a Belgian factory at Bornem.  That is certainly not in accordance with Professor Timoney's wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>If he wants it built at all that is the only place he can get it built.  I have a photostat copy of a company factory, Beherman Demoen, based in Bornem in Belgium.  Their advertisement appeared in a paper in May, 1976 for BDX, a vehicle designed by Timoney.  It consists of a large photograph of the vehicle and it shows army personnel surrounding it, whether Belgian or Irish I do not know.  The advertisement states: &ldquo;Made in our factory at Bornem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This sort of thing is tragic, yet we had the grotesque spectacle of the Minister for Defence this morning trying to defend that situation.  There is one of the greatest technological achievements of Irish engineering in a decade, a brilliant piece of work, a vehicle infinitely better and more efficient than any armoured carrier in any army in Europe, which can be built for half the cost of the vehicle the French have designed, and which Irish workmen could build, now being built in a factory in Belgium.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder this country today has 109,000 people unemployed?  We had the Minister for Labour boasting yesterday that it was 116,000 a few months ago, a great achievement.  We have an unemployment rate far in excess of any country in Europe and we have the certainty that while this lunacy is being continued our unemployment rate will remain the highest in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> I can give a simple example in relation to how employment is being discouraged.  I will take the offshore gas and oil discoveries.  According to the June issue of the CII <i>Newsletter</i>, it is estimated that the cost of the offshore and onshore development of the Kinsale Head gas-field will be about £200 million.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced the issue of contracts totalling about £10 million for this development to Irish firms, and he said this represents 95 per cent of the contracts for which Irish firms tendered.  What he did not tell us is that the £10 million represents 5 per cent precisely of the value of the work which is being done and has to be done as a result of the Kinsale Head gas find.  Could this sort of thing happen in Britain?  Would the British allow British firms only to get 5 per cent of the work?  Would the Norwegian Government allow it in respect of their finds in the North Sea?  It is permitted here at a time when unemployment is far higher than in any country in the world.  Is it any wonder that the unemployment rate is so high? It is a certainty that while these fiscal and industrial policies of the Government are allowed to continue our rate of unemployment must remain the highest in the EEC and throughout Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly on a question I raised here yesterday.  I asked the Taoiseach the total number of refrigerators imported in the first three months of 1975 and 1976 and I was informed that imports of domestic refrigerators amounted to just over 1,000 in January-March 1975 and 23,044 in the same period in 1976.  Many of these were imported from Russia but the bulk of them came from Britain.  I pointed out that it was my information that the refrigerators imported from Britain came through an agent and that there is reason to suspect that these were imported into Britain before export here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is <Col N="2002" /> that the total number of refrigerators sold in this country in a full year would be between 30,000 and 40,000.  Therefore, we have a situation where more than half of the total number sold here had already been imported in the first three months of this year.  Replying to a supplementary the Parliamentary Secretary said that it might interest me to know that a possible reason for this is that the import rates were reduced as from 1st January, 1976.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is well aware that had it not been for the pressure from this side of the House by way of Private Members' motions and many questions, the same import duty would have been removed in relation to the footwear industry. We had to force him to go to Brussels to ask the EEC to give us the protection to which we are entitled for an industry which is in difficulties.  We pointed out that under Article 135 of the Rome Treaty any country newly affiliated to the EEC could demand from the EEC protection for an industry which was in difficulties up to 1977.  Therefore, because of the pressure put on the Minister from this side and because we drew his attention to the dangerous situation in which the footwear industry was and still is the Minister moved on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that unless pressure from this side of the House is brought to bear on the Minister for Industry and Commerce nothing will happen. He seemed to be unaware of the fact that a very large number of industrial workers are dependent on control being exercised and their rights being assured. In my home town there is an AET factory which makes refrigerators and up to now had a reasonable proportion of the market.  What will happen to those workers now that more than half the total number of refrigerators sold in a year has been imported during the first three months of this year?  I was astounded when, in reply to another supplementary question, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said that the Central Statistics Office had indicated that the very high figure for <Col N="2003" /> the first three months of this year was due to restocking.  That, he said, was a very healthy sign for the economy and he was sure I would agree with that.  Coming from a Parliamentary Secretary that is a shocking statement. Does he expect the 400 workers in the AET factory to rejoice now that 23,000 refrigerators have been imported?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;I regret neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor his Parliamentary Secretary is here&mdash;ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to demand immediately from the EEC that we have the right to reimpose the import duty.  I would also ask him to examine immediately the enormous increase in refrigerators which has taken place this year, particularly the imports from Britain, and ensure that dumping is not taking place.  I would like to know how our importers were allowed import 1,100 refrigerators from Russia.  What did we get from Russia in return?</P>
    <P>There is one difficulty in a matter like this because we can never prove whether there was dumping of refrigerators or not in respect of Russian imports.  I do not know how anybody could find out the cost of raw materials and labour in Russia.  Nevertheless the Government must ensure that we are permitted to reimpose the duty, which was removed on the 1st January in the same way as the duty was continued for the footwear industry.  The Minister must also ensure that a thorough examination is made of imports, source, and so on.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned solely with the importation of refrigerators.  In 1975 5,500 cookers were imported and this year 12,000 cookers were imported. Will the workers in the Dunleer factory be pleased to note the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks when he said that this was a healthy sign for the economy?  There were 4,600 electric kettles imported last year and 11,000 this year.  I could go on but I will not delay the House.  Again I am requesting the Minister to get in touch with his colleague to ensure that the jobs of the workers in AET and in other electrical factories are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> This is a scandalous situation.  It was obvious that until this question was put down the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not concerned about it.</P>

I am raising this point in relation to the Drogheda factory and in particular with the Greenmount and Boyne factory in Kingscourt, County Cavan.  I raised this matter earlier in the year with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and asked him if he would ensure that Fóir Teoranta would come to the aid of this factory which employed approximately 50 people.  This industry is very important for this small town.  I was told at that time that a receiver had been put in, but there was still a possibility that Fóir Teoranta would come to the aid of the factory, having had an interest in it already.  I understand that at the end of this month this factory will close.  This is a very serious matter and I would ask the Minister to get in touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to try to save this factory, even at this late stage.</P>

      <P>The creation of 30,000 jobs between now and 1986 is an enormous undertaking and will require co-operation, investment, a sense of responsibility and maybe sacrifice by everybody in this country. It will be a heavy strain on all of us to see that the young people particularly, and those who are, thankfully in lesser numbers, coming off the land, will find work here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recession we have been experiencing for the past two years is different from that which had been weathered by other Governments at other times, which were largely brought about by a poor return on policies and were confined within this country.  At that time the safety valve of emigration <Col N="2005" /> was still available to those who were unable to get work here.  Fianna Fáil are very fond of quoting the late Taoiseach, Deputy Séan Lemass, when he said that a rising tide lifts all boats.  They interpret this&mdash;and I do not think he meant it this way because I think he was shrewder and more far-seeing than a lot of Deputies opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  Fianna Fáil chose to interpret this remark, that a rising tide lifts all boats, as being the example of how all industries and firms inside this country rise when the tide of the economy rises.  I think what Deputy Lemass meant, and what he was shrewd enough to see from his little boat, was that a rising tide of world trade lifted the Irish economy if we were open enough to take advantage of it. This was in the early 1960s when the free trade agreement with Britain was signed and when the &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo; movement, which was probably led by and certainly backed by my party, started to gain momentum in this country.  We benefited from rising world trade then, but if a rising tide lifts all boats, a falling tide means that they all fall to the same level.</P>

      <P>That is true, and that has been the concern of this Government for the last two years: to see that the boat of the Irish economy does not go on the rocks.  The safety valve of emigration which was the advantage of the Fianna Fáil Party for years is not there now.</P>

      <P>I am talking about all Governments, but particularly Fianna Fáil who for years used the advantage of emigration to keep the people off the register of unemployed. Whether we are here, or whether there is a change of Government, no Government in the future should depend on <Col N="2006" /> emigration.  We must bend our efforts to see that we provide this large number of jobs here between now and the mid-1980s.</P>
      <P>When Deputy O'Malley spoke he said that there was no climate for investment in the private sector here, that people were uninclined to invest.  He said that they were unable to make profits and that profits was a dirty word.  At another stage he said that many of our manufacturing industries were working at 50 to 70 per cent of capacity, and he said that firms that were working to that capacity did not need capital investment, that they did not want to take up the slack.  If there is no tax being paid on exports and if they are worried about their profits why is their slack not taken up in exports if it is that easy?  Why do they not make use of Coras Tráchtála Teo., to sell their goods abroad and to point out markets to them, and what is this malaise that affects the private sector at a time of recession?  If there is no investment needed, if the capacity is there, if the export markets can be got because of the devaluation of the Irish pound and if there is no tax to be paid on profits made on that market, what is missing?  Why are not all those things put together for the benefit of this country and the lower income employment figure here?  There is something else missing.  What is the missing component which would unlock that and take up unused capacity, provide money that they would not pay tax on and lower the unemployment here? This would help their tax position because the fewer that are unemployed the less social welfare benefits have to be paid.</P>

      <P>That is right, yes. Industry in this country can be broken into a number of sectors. There are what can be called the old industries that were here before the State was formed.  There are those which were founded or set up during the protection days of the 1930s and 1940s.  Then there are the newer industries, the international componen <Col N="2007" /> panies who came here as a result of the financial benefits of establishing here.  They are still coming here, still investing, still availing of the grants being proposed by the IDA, still accepting the services of CTT to sell their products abroad and still accepting the tax exemption on profits.  If they are coming here why are Irish people who have money not investing it in this country?</P>

      <P>If international companies have confidence, what is wrong with the Irish companies?  We passed a sizeable amount of money for the IDA for investment in industry.  The sum is up by 40 per cent on last year.  Some of that money will go to internal firms but the bulk of it will go to industrialists from abroad who have confidence in this country and are willing to avail of the most encouraging set of incentives to industry possible in the world, but certainly in Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it probably went for lack of confidence in the international market for aluminium. It would not have been a large enough industry to satisfy 1 per cent of the Irish need.  It had nothing to do with Ireland at all.  It is for the same reason Dupont in Cork Harbour went and why a number of other industries went.  In times of recession people contract and try to pare down their operations so that the diminished profits they expect to earn will be sufficient to keep their show on the road.  In times of boom, or on the rising tide, they invest and take risks that they will not take at a time of recession.  Of course Alcan is not finished, but it has been put aside the same as Dupont. About six months ago the Minister for Finance said that to get through 1976 this country needed wage restraint or a wage pause.  When <Col N="2008" /> that did not seem possible in the early months of 1976 every chamber of commerce, every trade association and the big industrialists berated the Government for not being firm enough.  &ldquo;The Government should stand firm&rdquo; was a phrase often repeated in January and February of this year.  The phrase &ldquo;The Government should introduce legislation to control wages&rdquo; was also used.</P>
      <P>The directors of the banks offered a wage settlement to their employees that would have done untold damage to our economy.  We have this schizophrenic approach from the people who are most concerned, whose money is at stake, who, when they wear their bankers hat, say that bank officials are different and should be paid more than the ordinary worker, even though their qualifications are the same; but when they wear their industrialist hat they say that the workers are being paid too much.</P>

He is probably thinking of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but he has said on numerous occasions that he wants industry to make sufficient profit.

      <P>It has not been created by this Government nor can anybody point to any Minister of this Government with an anti-profit attitude. It is not true.  We can see how much time the Minister for Industry and Commerce has spent in other countries trying to bring industries here, industries that are very profit conscious.  That is an indication of the welcome, and the acceptance by them of that welcome, that awaits industries here.  He has visited all the major industrial countries of the world and asked them to establish industries here and he has been extremely successful in bringing here leaders in the field of very high technology industry which we must get. Examples are Asahi in Ballina.  Alcan and Dupont.  They will all be here and will provide the basis for a <Col N="2010" /> high-technology industrial arm for this economy.</P>
      <P>It is not only in the manufacturing sector that we want job creation. There must be expansion in the services section also.  If the expansion comes in manufacturing it will automatically follow in the service sector. We can get all the external investment which we can provide money to help and the money is there also for internal investment.  How do we get manufacturers in Ireland to accept the need to take a risk, invest and earn profits which will be tax-free? That is the key which we must find to open the door to provide the 30,000 jobs which I and every member of the Government are determined to see will be provided so that emigration will no longer be used to drive people from the country to earn their living abroad.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that there should be a time limit on what I regard as one of the most important discussions that could take place here, the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  It is more regrettable in view of the fact that on several occasions in the past months the business of the Dáil collapsed or the House had to be adjourned because of lack of business ordered by the Government.  We had a full week's adjournment only recently and this was uncalled for even if this was related to by-elections.  I believe the Dáil should have continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be serious on that for a second.  That week could have been more gainfully used in this House if the time had been made available to us to discuss important Estimates.  I am aware that I only have about ten minutes at my disposal to discuss this important Estimate and, naturally, I can only skim over a small number of points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure the Minister that there is now wholesale and general acceptance of the fact that the Government have failed very badly to protect people and their property.  The Minister for Justice, and the Government, stand accused, and rightly so, of gross negligence and total failure in the maintenance of law and order throughout the State.  It is now a fact that armed gangs of hooligans can at will successfully hold up or rob banks, post offices, shops or trains.  Instead of making crime more difficult for these people, unfortunately, the situation is the reverse. The situation is ludicrous in the extreme in that the Government for penny-pinching economy reasons withdrew <Col N="2013" /> normal Garda protection, withdrew gardaí who would be on duty to protect property and act as a deterrent to those would-be robbers.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and the Government, in an effort to save a few hundred pounds, allowed situations to develop where millions of pounds were taken with the minimum of effort.  On one occasion in this House the Minister refused to say why gardaí were withdrawn from a train that was carrying a large quantity of money.  The Minister at that time hid behind the fact that it would be wrong to disclose any information on security precautions. As time went on he saw that there was no security whatsoever.  If the Minister and the Government believe that they could save one hundred pounds or so by refusing to pay the wages of a number of gardaí whose presence on trains would be invaluable, they have the wrong attitude.  By saving a couple of hundred pounds they allow would-be robbers access to huge sums of money.  Unfortunately, practically all of this money is being used for subversive purposes.  If this is Government logic or Government thinking, the whole situation is crazy and farcical in the extreme.  It is very curious that a Government who pride themselves in their capacity for the maintenance of law and order should preside over the greatest spate of armed robberies the country has ever seen.</P>
    <P>Crime is rampant in Dublin city and the country at large.  This is also the view of the general public and of the Garda Síochána.  People are terrified, particularly the old, the infirm and those living alone.  Unfortunately, many areas of our capital city are nogo areas because policing is practically non-existent.  Homes, offices, shops and garages are broken into at will.  Indeed, the owners and occupants are being seriously molested or injured.  Policing is practically non-existent.</P>
    <P>The garda on the beat has, for all practical purposes, been withdrawn. We were all accustomed to seeing the garda on the beat and he rendered a valuable service but he is now a rare sight because of false Government economies.  Unfortunately, the Garda <Col N="2014" /> tell that the squad cars are grounded and that they do not patrol as they should.  This again is because of false economies.  Naturally, the absence of patrol cars and police crews in them leaves the public unprotected.  Those gardaí who might be on hand to protect people and prevent crime are left unprotected and not given the backup service that is required if they are to successfully carry out their duty.</P>
    <P>It is said by the Garda that crime is not properly investigated and that the follow up is not as successful as it should be.  In recent times, the Garda say, unfortunately, the criminal is winning and the Garda and the public are losing.  That is a most serious statement and it is contained in the editorial of the present issue of the <i>Garda Review.</i> I have a question on the Order Paper about this but it is doubtful, because of the number of questions on the Order Paper, that I will get the opportunity of raising it. It is a very serious and damning statement. It is tragic that the Minister still tries to play down the level of violence and criminality throughout the country.  The Garda say they have become gravely disillusioned with the attitude of the Government and the Minister.  They feel that the Government and the Minister are hiding their heads in the sand in the hope that everything will right itself in time.</P>
    <P>This is unbelievably sad and tragic. We have the situation where the Garda say that the criminal <i>de facto</i> rules our streets and our countryside. They also say that the morale of a once proud force lies battered.  They are terribly serious charges and are ones we must pay heed to.  If they were charges or utterances by people other than those who purport to speak for the Garda they would not have the same importance as they have when they appear in an editorial in the <i>Garda Review.</i> They must be listened to and we must have action to rectify the situation.  The armed robber, the mugger, the burglar, the thief and the rapist, unfortunately, know that our streets are not being policed as they should be.  Unfortunately, they also know that our <Col N="2015" /> countryside is wide open because Garda patrols are a rarity.  Many parents are asking if their children are safe going to and coming from school and if they are safe while playing.</P>
    <P>Certainly, old people in the cities and those living in isolated areas are the ready victims of these thugs whenever they wish to call upon them.  The Minister has been asked to walk through O'Connell Street in Dublin some night alone after dark and if he accepts this invitation I should like to accompany him in the hope that the reality of the situation would be seen, understood and appreciated by him. It is a very grave situation.  I know that if the Minister could see it for himself, if he could see it as it is seen by those whose job it is to see it, he would act quickly and actively on this problem.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister will again say that we have more gardaí than ever before and that more money is being spent than ever before in an effort to maintain law and order.  I know that our efforts against the subversives must be maintained and improved. The Minister knows that he has the backing of this House and the nation in this regard, as had his predecessor, Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>With regard to ordinary crime, the public now accept that ordinary crime is often uninvestigated.  If this is so, preventive policing is a thing of the past.  Recently, the Minister mentioned that the Government had decided to increase the force by 500 men.  The Minister may be assured that the public would willingly pay their taxes for proper protection. Indeed, the public would willingly give more if they were satisfied that the money was being spent on proper policing.  There would not be any criticism from this side of the House if the Minister said that he intended recruiting 1,000 instead of 500.  If the Minister and the Government have decided to take on 500 recruits, how long will it take before they are working on the streets?  The training capacity for recruits is less than 200 in every 20 weeks.  If the Minister is <Col N="2016" /> serious, and if the Government are backing him, I hope that he will recruit these people as quickly as possible and make other arrangements to train them.  There is no shortage of manpower.  Thousands of young people are walking the streets, young people who would gladly give service to the nation by joining the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that 3,500 young people are on a waiting list for entry to the Garda Síochána.  I am open to correction on that figure but the supply in this instance is certainly greater than the demand.  Our policing could be better if our policemen were allowed to do more work than they are doing at present.  I would be the first to say to the Minister that overtime must be kept under control.  I would be the first to say: &ldquo;Be careful. Do not let it get out of hand&rdquo;, but our police force is available and prepared to work.  It is a pity they have not been allowed to combat ordinary crime.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment of district justices, the Minister and the Government know the importance of appointing a man who is capable of doing the job.  The Minister knows that a colleague of his in Government has sole responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs.  The Minister knows that the success of his colleague in the Department of the Gaeltacht is due to the large amount of money that has been made available&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chairman should also hear what is being said on the other side of the House.  The Minister for Justice is undermining the confidence of the people in the Gaeltacht areas by appointing district justices who cannot conduct their business through the medium of Irish.  It is desirable that those who operate as district justices in Gaeltacht areas should at least be able to conduct their business in Irish.  I do not want to go any deeper into this point because there is a case before the courts at present and I do not want to interfere in any way with that case.</P>
      <P>With regard to the legal aid strike, the position is the same as in the bank strike.  Some people hold the view that people awaiting trial must come to trial eventually and that those who will be defending them will be paid to do so.  It is fair to say that the public are suffering as a result of this strike because people awaiting trial have to be let out on bail, some of them committing further crimes.  I would ask the Minister to do something positive to ensure that those who are awaiting trial can be tried.  The Minister cannot be accused of not becoming involved nor can he be accused of sitting back and letting the situation drift. The situation is serious for those involved and we need more action in regard to this problem.</P>
      <P>I hope that we shall have an opportunity, which the Government can provide for us, to discuss the Department of Justice Estimate in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister.  This relates to what has been said by our spokesman on Justice.  How was it that the information coming to the Minister in respect of the need for additional gardaí was so distorted as to have the Minister believing that there was no need for them.  I can remember putting a question in relation to my constituency where shopkeepers were unable to display goods because they had to have their windows barricaded, where schools were being subjected to vandalism <Col N="2018" /> every other night, where there was mugging and all the other problems to which Deputy Collins has referred.  In these circumstances I asked the Minister if he would ensure that additional gardaí be made available.</P>
      <P>He told me in reply that he had been informed that the incidence of offences and vandalism in the area was on the decrease.  However, he omitted to tell me that the incidence of offences could be shown to be on the decrease by reason of there not being an adequate number of gardaí to detect them.  I do not know whether it was a question of the Minister being naïve enough to accept the report given to him by the Garda officers in question but everybody else knew the position to be as I, and other Deputies in regard to their own areas, would describe it.  Despite this the Minister was happy to take refuge in the report made to him.  No later than a month ago he displayed a similar state of happiness but now the need for extra gardaí has been accepted.  The <i>modus operandi</i> and the sources of information which, in respect of the complaints I made, allowed the information made available to the Minister to be so distorted and so removed from the situation is a matter which concerns me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few questions I should like to put to the Minister.  First, how many extra gardaí is it proposed to provide during the next six months in order to ensure the safety of the citizens in the streets of Dublin and in other cities?  At this point I should refer to what appears to be an appraisal of security activity with particular reference to the patrol unit.  I refer the Minister to a recent editorial on this aspect which appeared in the <i>Garda Review.</i> I do not wish to delay the House by quoting from that editorial. It is already on the record of the House.  The article refers to a reduction in security activity following partly from the recent cutbacks.  The Minister denies that there have been cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know, too, how many persons are serving sentences <Col N="2019" /> imposed by the Special Criminal Court and how many are awaiting trial or are on remand or on bail pending trial in the Special Criminal Court?  Also, how many gardaí are detailed for special duty on the Border and how many are serving protective duty on banks and other financial institutions? Finally, how many cases have been reported to the Minister of ill treatment of persons detained?  What inquiries have been made in this regard and what were the results?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Estimate No. 26 there is a case in respect of which the Minister knows I have reason to refer. In the context of the case I have in mind I would ask the Minister to ensure that in future when anybody applies to the Land Registry to have property registered his request would not be complied with until such time as investigations had been carried out and the Land Registry people satisfied of the applicant's entitlement to registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case I am referring to registration was granted but when a member of the family concerned sought to see the instrument of registration this could not be found although in reply to a question in relation to the case the Minister informed me, and informed me correctly, that anybody interested&mdash; and that should include members of a family&mdash;could see the instrument of registration.  In the case in point efforts were being made in this regard during a two-year period but without success.  Eventually, after there had been a change of personnel, the person concerned was given the document. If it was considered wrong to make the document available in the first instance one must assume that it was wrong also in the second instance. The instrument of registration contains details of how the registration was achieved.  Although those concerned with the case I have in mind are of the opinion that registration was granted wrongly, they cannot get anybody who is willing to contest the case for them.  It is deplorable that a relative of a person who has been granted registration is <Col N="2020" /> not given the authority to contest that registration.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that in future everybody concerned be consulted before an application for registration is granted.  In the case I am referring to the registration was carried out in a shady fashion, to say the least.  I am raising the point so that the House might know what can happen in this sphere of activity.  In saying that I am not casting aspersions on the officials of the Land Registry office.  They are a decent lot of people but an investigation should be carried out among relatives, particularly brothers and sisters, in respect of any application for registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether, pending the recruitment and training of extra gardaí, provision will be made for existing members to work overtime so that the situation as set out in the <i>Garda Review</i> a short while ago might be coped with and also to deal with the crisis situation that has developed as a result of the closure of the banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal first with Deputy Callanan's question, I wish to assure him that the Land Registry have a statutory obligation to investigate all applications coming before them but they must take every application on its face value and if it transpires that information contained in the application is wrong, whether in respect of a declaration, a title document or even an affidavit, the situation is not something for which the Land Registry can be blamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is procedure whereby they must serve notice to parties appearing to have an interest in an application. There is an obligation on them to serve notice by registered post, but that is as far as the obligation can extend.  They could not be obliged to ensure that those notices reach the people for whom they are intended but it is assumed generally that the serving of any document by registered post is adequate.  I am aware of the facts of the case raised by the Deputy but, having heard his side of it only, I <Col N="2021" /> would not wish to prejudge it.  It is something which, when finally thrashed out, may give a fuller perspective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not deal with the fact that it was so hard to get the instrument of registration to which relatives should be entitled. It is the instrument of registration which is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Callanan is aware, there was a differing interpretation by different registrars of their right to make available instruments from the Registry.  I think that is the explanation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that the first interpretation was correct, that a relative could not get the instrument of registration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to comment on that.  That is a matter for the Registration of Title Act and I have no intention of interpreting it.</P>
      <P>I thought, listening to Deputy Collins speech, how glad I was that the Ireland of reality is not the Ireland painted by him in his speech, because he painted a most appealing picture of a lawless society, of a society in which the criminal literally rules.  He painted a picture suggesting that publice safety is a thing of the past, suggesting that crime is endemic, that indeed crimes of violence are endemic. The reality of the situation has no connection with that picture.  I think Deputy Collins may have been misled by two things: number one, his anxiety to redress what he thinks is an undue clothing by the Government of themselves with a law and order costume.  He feels this is reacting unfairly to the Opposition, that they are entitled to wear those clothes also.  I do not deny that but possibly his sensitivity in that area may have led him to make an exaggerated case.  The second factor which contributed to his misleading picture was his reliance on an editorial which I understand was published recently in the magazine the <i>Garda Review.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet had an opportunity <Col N="2022" /> of reading that particular number but I have read newspaper comments on the article in question.  I know generally what is in it.  Indeed I have read comment in leading articles on the article in question.  I recall one that struck in my mind, a leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> which, in commenting on the allegations in the leading article, warned that there could be an element of special pleading in that leading article.  This is something we do have to bear in mind, but I shall keep an open mind on it until I read it fully.  It is necessary to point out that the views in that article are not the official views of the Garda Síochána.  They are the views of the representatives of the staff, staff association views and, accordingly, their perspective must be somewhat narrow and&mdash;again to quote the leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;we must beware of an element of special pleading. Within the Garda Síochána the question of overtime produces widespread reaction.  Deputy Collins referred to the less desirable consequences and features which unrestrained overtime can introduce into any work force.  There are many members of the Garda Síochána concerned with those aspects of it.  There are also members dissatisfied with the amount of it that is available.  That is understandable when we bear in mind that, last year, it was running at a rate where there was an average payment of £1,200 per annum per man.  Bearing in mind that there would be a very large number not receiving any overtime, Deputies can begin to assess the extra payment received by some members and perhaps can begin to understand and appreciate the comment in the leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> when it said to beware of the danger of special pleading.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more than that except to draw attention to this aspect of it, to put into perspective the general tone of what was in that editorial and the case made by Deputy Collins.  I do feel he has been unwittingly misled by an editorial that might have been guilty of special pleading but certainly&mdash;and I say this categorically&mdash;it does not represent <Col N="2023" /> official Garda views.  Deputy Collins did say in the course of his speech, when referring to what was said, that these are most serious statements. Then he said: the guards themselves say.  The guards themselves do not say any such thing, because that particular article is one written by a staff association.  The facts do not bear out the suggestion that this is a lawless country.  We have only to look around us or ask the next man in the street and he is not going to express any apprehension that this is a lawless country.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are concerned with crimes that have been committed in recent months, crimes involving firearms, larceny of large amounts of property, crimes which were committed with a certain degree of callous ruthlessness.  Naturally such crimes will cause a certain amount of unrest and apprehension, but I want to remind the House that I cannot here go into the detail of the vast majority of these crimes for the very good and pertinent reason that the vast majority of them are <i>sub judice.</i> In that statement alone I have almost answered the bulk of allegations or certainly the tone of Deputy Collins' argument.  I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that the preliminary statistics of crime figures for the first quarter of 1976 show a drop of 4 per cent on the equivalent figures for 1975, the time we have just gone through, the time to which Deputy Collins referred when he spoke about a lawless country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister elaborate a little on that figure?  What is included when he says the crime figures, is it serious and non-serious, and is it indicatable offences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indictable offences reported.  Perhaps I might be allowed give some comparisons for this city and some cities across the water in the year 1975.  In the Dublin Metropolitan area the number of offences per one hundred thousand of <Col N="2024" /> the population was 2,650.  In the city of Birmingham the figure was 4,450. In 1973 Liverpool and Bootle&mdash;that is a police area&mdash;the figure was 8,000 and, in the city of Edinburgh, 5,510. Deputies will see from those figures that the claims and the case made here by Deputy Collins and by other Opposition spokesmen from time to time are exaggerated when taken in the context of a comparable society next door, so to speak.  The actual reduction in our own figures&mdash;which will improve that comparative position even more&mdash;shows that the Garda are well on top of the crime situation.  I do not know what the next quarter will bring or if the quarter after that may bring a swing the other way.  Possibly, when the year is over, the statistics may be line balled, they may be slightly ahead; hopefully, they will be back.  But I think they will be back, because this is not a lawless country and it is wrong to suggest that it is.  It causes public unease when there is no justification for it, something which, if it went abroad, could damage our prospects internationally.  We have just finished a debate on the Department of Industry and Commerce, during which Deputy O'Malley was decrying the lack of investment and the difficulties of providing a climate to provide for the number of jobs that have to be provided.  It is terribly important that foreigners who might be of a mind to invest here would not have their confidence in this country carelessly&mdash;and I say this not in any pejorative fashion &mdash;wrongly disturbed because the situation in this country does not justify the case Deputy Collins has been making.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it is quite possible that the decrease to which he refers derives from the fact that he has not the facility, or that we have not a sufficiency of gardaí, to detect offences? That is the case I am making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the statistics on which the crime report is based are compiled on the basis of reported offences, not detected offences.  Therefore, if there were no police at all the <Col N="2025" /> number of crimes being reported would be the same.  There is no connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that offences are reported.  There is no suggestion of any reduction in the level of reporting offences.  I have taken steps to ensure that the recording of crime is now more rigidly done and to ensure that everything is recorded.  I am very pleased, having knowledge of this more careful recording, to emphasise that the drop in crime statistics is even more significantly optimistic.</P>
      <P>The picture painted by Deputy Collines is not a true picture.  It does not represent the Ireland of today.  By comparison with Britain we are in an infinitely better position.  By comparison with our own position this time last year we are 4 per cent better off.  The suggestion that this is a lawless country with crime increasing and muggings happening all over the place is wrong. Indeed, this kind of talk could do the country a great deal of harm.  It is dangerous talk, and I hope there will now be an acceptance of the real position and no repetition of this talk.</P>

      <P>That does not include any extra overtime for 1976.  I do not want to keep interrupting, but in the <i>Garda Review</i> editorial statistics are given and perhaps some of the Minister's officials would advise him as to the accuracy of the statistics because, if they are not true, that should be said.</P>

It is question No. 108.  I fully appreciate that the Minister has been out of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in Question No. 108 or Question No. 109 about statistics.  If there are statistics they will be checked out.  I do not know the source of them because this <Col N="2027" /> particular magazine does not represent official Garda policy.  It is not an official magazine.  It is merely a representative body or staff association magazine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that, if figures are given, the veracity of the figures should be checked by those in a position to do so and a statement issued on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If they can be checked they will, of course, be checked.  I am happy to report that the position painted by Deputy Collins is not the real position.  Notwithstanding that, I am aware that there is unease in some parts of the country, particularly in this city, and people would like to see a more visible Garda presence. Policing is effective in Dublin and throughout the country, and the proof of that is the drop in crime for the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year.  Recently I met an association of Dublin central city traders.  They were apprehensive of the situation pertaining to the centre of the city and I promised them, with the full backing of the Government, that all parts of the city at all times of the day or night would be safe for any citizen to walk in without danger of molestation.  That is a promise I intend to keep and, if necessary, a higher level of policing will be maintained in such areas.  It is a matter for the professional judgment of the Commissioner, but I would hope that a reasonable proportion of the extra force would be deployed in these areas to ensure the fulfilment of that promise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney suggested I was misleading him and the House some time ago in regard to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that maybe the Minister's officials were misled or were misleading the Minister. There is a slight difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point. May I assure the Deputy that neither the Department nor I have any intention of misleading anybody.  Deputy Tunney was making the case&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that in <Col N="2028" /> telling him there was adequate policing in his area I am now contradicting myself in saying there is need for 500 extra gardaí.  I do not think that is necessarily contradictory because I do not know where the 500 will be deployed.  It may be that the level of policing in the area to which he referred is adequate.  His opinion may differ from that of the professional gardaí, and I have to accept the professional advice offered to me.  It does not necessarily follow that, because there is a feeling in one particular area that there should be more gardaí and I say the number is sufficient, and I announce an increase in the total strength subsequently, I am thereby somehow contradicting myself. I have, I think, pointed out the fallacy in the argument.  Deputy Tunney asked where I get my information.  The information I get with regard to the level of policing in any area comes from Garda Headquarters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brugha wanted to know the number serving sentences imposed by the Special Criminal Court.  I can give him the total number convicted.  Up to 30th April, 1976 it is 724.  In Portlaoise, where these people serve their sentences, since they are generally associated with subversive organisations, there are probably 120 or 130 at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brugha also wanted to know how many are awaiting trial. The answer is 76.  All custody cases have been listed for hearing.  I do not know how many are awaiting trial on bail.  He also wanted to know how many gardaí there are on the Border. That is not a figure I would be anxious to give.  I have not got the actual figure but I trust Deputy Brugha will understand that I am not anxious to give the figure for security reasons.  He also wanted to know how many are on bank duty.  The figure varies from time to time depending on need and requisitions from particular banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He then asked me how many cases of ill-treatment had been reported. None has been reported to me and I have no information from the Commissioner as to how many complaints have been made to the gardaí for investigation.  I have read <Col N="2029" /> many public allegations of ill-treatment. Deputy Blaney put a question to me last week in regard to alleged ill-treatment in Cavan but up to the time of that question&mdash;possibly to the end of last week&mdash;no complaints had been made to the superintendent concerned or to the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known tactic by certain elements to shout &ldquo;brutality&rdquo; when they find the screw beginning to turn and that fact must be borne in mind. On the other hand, if the Garda are concerned with their reputation they will be pleased to have complaints specifically made to them.  Where a complaint lies they will be pleased to investigate it in accordance with established procedures that will ensure a complete and thorough investigation. For their own reputation they are anxious to ensure that state of affairs.  However, neither I nor they can be expected to react to every blanket cry of police brutality, particularly when they, I and the vast majority of the people know that this is a normal tactic to be used when the police are beginning to tighten in on criminal elements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned the legal aid dispute.  I am glad to tell him that, while it is not ended, I am extremely hopeful of an end to it in the very near future.  I do not want to say any more than that because negotiations are at a delicate stage.  I may have news very shortly that it will be ended on terms that I hope will be satisfactory to the profession and to myself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brosnan asked if there would be an increase in overtime pending the recruitment of the extra gardaí.  The answer to that is no. There will not be any increase in the level of overtime available.  The budgetary amount has been allocated and, as I pointed out earlier, there has been no lessening in the effectiveness of enforcing the rule of law and order, as it has wrongly come to be called.  The statistics for the first quarter of this year show a decrease over the comparable statistics for the first quarter of last year and that is the best answer I can give to those who say the police are ineffective <Col N="2030" /> and that lawlessness is endemic. Neither proposition is true.  The police are effective, this is a law-abiding country and that is the way we intend to keep it.</P>

      <P>It is very unfortunate that this most important Estimate did not mention other important matters relating to the activities of the Garda, for example, the non-enforcement of the Forcible Entry Act and the nonrepeal of that Act.

That was not the ruling of the Chair today on this matter in which we are being forced to agree to a huge list of Estimates involving, millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money without any adequate time to discuss them.  With due respect, I do not think that is the position.  I do not intend to detain the House but I am entitled to point out to the Minister that his effort to paint a picture of a country that is law-abiding, in which the statistics for indictable crime for the last quarter are going down, according to him, falls down when one recalls that about a month ago the Minister told this House that there was no need for additional recruitment of gardaí.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer given was that the number recruited each year from 1972 went down and that this year it was the lowest number.  In view of that the Minister was asked <Col N="2031" /> if he intended to increase the recruitment this year and he said no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it is wrong for the Deputy and myself to speak from recollection; we should check the record.  My attitude with regard to increasing the overall level of the force was that I was anxious to wait until the management consultants had completed their survey but that was not an absolute condition on making a decision as to whether to increase the number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not complaining. I am saying that the Minister by that decision is showing that the case made by Deputy Collins and other Deputies was justified.  What is more, I have grave doubts about that decision.  I think it was a public relations exercise. The Minister announced a figure of 500 but he knows he will not have 500 this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that a genuine effort is needed.  There is no justification for the Minister, having told us approximately half-way through the year that he was not going to recruit further gardaí until he had an adequate report from the consultants, then to turn around and increase the number.  The decision of the Minister or the Government was to allay the genuine grave concern at the breakdown of law and order enforcement, particularly in the city of Dublin but also throughout the country.  That is why the Minister made the decision.  It was a public relations exercise and it is not going <Col N="2032" /> to be implemented in the present year, except to a limited extent.  That is the complaint I am making and it is the complaint Deputy Collins made. The actions of the Minister and the Government are the best justification for the case made by Deputy Collins about the breakdown of law and order and the enforcement of law and order, particularly in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations, 1976,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 22nd day of April, 1976.</P>
      <P>The effect of these regulations will be to increase the income limit for limited eligibility health services from £1,600 to £3,000 in the case of non-insured persons, other than farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I intend to make regulations this week to increase the present income limit of £2,250 to <Col N="2046" /> £3,000 per annum in the case of insured, non-manual workers.</P>
    <P>As I explained in my Estimates speech, the present income limits for limited eligibility health services require to be up-dated in line with increases in incomes generally in the economy.  The present limit of £1,600 was fixed in September, 1971, and adjusting it in line with national wage agreement increases since that date produces a comparable figure today of £3,000.</P>
    <P>Similarly, up-dating the limit of £2,250, which was fixed in April, 1974, in line with national wage agreement adjustments provides a present-day figure of approximately £3,000.</P>
    <P>My objective in introducing these new limits is to ensure that the same proportion of the population as heretofore retain entitlement to free hospital care and the other services involved in the limited eligibility category. The regulations are not designed to increase the percentage of the population covered.</P>
    <P>Unless new income limits at £3,000 per annum are set, an estimated 85,000 people, who are now eligible for these services, will become ineligible by the end of this year.  We cannot, of course, allow this to happen because it would mean a real reduction in our present standards of entitlement to health services.</P>
    <P>In the case of female employees, an estimated 5,000 will become ineligible by 5th July unless the new limit of £3,000 per annum is introduced.  An estimated 30,000 male, non-manual employees, together with some 40,000 dependants will become ineligible by January next, while 5,000 non-insured persons with some 5,000 dependants will become ineligible during the course of 1976, unless the new limits are introduced.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have had a number of discussions with both medical organisations and have explained to them the basis of the proposed new limits.  As a result of these discussions, the organisations are not objecting to the new limits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> Both organisations have requested that a new system for identifying eligible patients at the point of health care delivery be introduced in order to ensure that eligible patients only are treated free of charge.  The chief executive officers of health boards and myself have agreed to this request and a more efficient system of identification is being worked out at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that these regulations will have the effect of doing away with the present anomaly whereby there are different limits for insured non-manual employees and for non-insured persons.  In future the limit of £3,000 per annum will apply to both groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which the Dáil is being asked to agree to this amendment of the health regulations to enable income limits to be increased reflects in miniature the haphazard and erratic approach of this Government to the entire administration of our health services.  This proposal has followed the same uncertain course as all the others which have been brought forward over the last few years by the Minister for Health.  First of all, we have the bold vote-catching announcement; then follows a long period of uncertainty and confusion during which it becomes abundantly clear that the announcement was made without consultation, without any real assessment of the cost or the implications of what is involved, and without any regard to the possibilities of the effective operation of the proposal. Finally, a deadline approaches. There are frantic discussions, appeals, compromises, and in the end the Dáil is asked to agree to the proposal on an emergency basis, because otherwise the public at large or some section of the public will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal we are dealing with here today is a classic case of the Coalition on/off/on again approach to administration.  The debate on the Health Estimate and on this proposal has been left in a state of suspension now for some considerable time, and we are today, on the eve of the adjournment of the Dáil for the summer <Col N="2048" /> recess, asked to rush this proposal through, because if we do not some 5,000 people will be deprived of these limited eligibility benefits on 5th July next.  Of course we on this side of the House do not want to see 5,000 persons deprived of these benefits, benefits to which they have up to now been entitled.  Therefore we are going to let this motion by the Minister for Health go through unopposed. But I want to place on record our view that this is not the right way to deal with this important, complicated aspect of our health services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at last today in his brief introductory speech given us some estimate of the numbers involved, and he states that there will not, in fact, be any increase in the total proportion of the population covered for these limited eligibility benefits, that all this measure is supposed to do is to keep the same sections of the population covered as have been covered up to now.  I believe that proportion is somewhere in the region of 85 per cent of the population, although the Minister did not give that precise statistic in his speech.</P>
    <P>I do not want to encroach on the already very limited amount of time which is available to the House to deal with the business that must be disposed of before the summer recess, but there are some points which I feel I must make, however briefly.  First, I want to suggest that we in the House, both the Government and the Opposition, regard this measure as no more than an interim, <i>ad hoc</i> emergency adjustment and that we decide to return to this difficult situation later on in the year with a view to straightening it out permanently.  I believe the overall aim should be realistically to relate the services which can be provided in our hospitals to those in need of them, to try to assess the cost and what sections of our population the hospitals can cope with and for whom we can afford as a community to provide these services free of charge.  This is a concrete question that we must tease out, and decide what exactly is possible in regard to making these limited eligibility <Col N="2049" /> services free of charge to certain sections of the population and how that can be implemented.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and related to that, is the need to eliminate the anomalies that still exist.  The Minister very blandly at the end of his remarks claimed that these regulations will have the effect of doing away with the present anomaly whereby there are different limits for insured non-manual employees and for non-insured persons. In future the limit of £3,000 per annum will apply to both groups and I accept that.  But there will still be anomalies and of course the principal one is the one which is causing a great deal of anger and frustration among the people concerned, that is, that non-manual workers are still being discriminated against in relation to their manual colleagues.  That is something we must examine with a view to bringing some standard into operation. I do not think anybody can justify a situation where a manual worker with an income of £10,000 a year is entitled to these services free of charge, whereas his colleagues who happens to be in a non-manual type of employment is denied free access to these services if his income is over £3,000 a year.  There is also the fact that this anomaly gives rise to artificial distinctions between different types of employment. For instance, an electrician has been held to be a manual employee, whereas a chief electrician has been held not to be and so on.  This distinction between manual and non-manual employees is quite artificial.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want to urge the Minister to resolve his difficulties with the consultants.  That is an urgent need now.  The willing and whole-hearted co-operation of those consultants and their tradition of dedicated service is absolutely vital to the structure of our health services.  The Minister should harness that.  He should set out to create the right atmosphere and the climate of goodwill.  He should recognise that the services these consultants provide is not a routine, mechanical nine to five sort of service.  It involves a very special degree of dedication on their part and very special qualities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should now make <Col N="2050" /> every effort to resolve any difficulties which still remain in this area.  One gathers from what he said here today and from newspaper reports that some progress is being made.  He should, in the interests of the general administration of the health services, bring the difficulties which he has with this profession to an end.  Those health regulations are one aspect of the administration of the health services which could advantageously be referred to an all-party committee of the House for consideration.  The various complications which exist in the situation are the sort that could be properly teased out in a co-operative spirit by all the parties in the House coming together in an all-party committee.  We have had general suggestions about the establishment of an all-party committee.  This is one aspect of the health services which should be brought before such a committee if and when it is established.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer very briefly to a technical aspect of these regulations.  I want to make it clear that I do not expect a reply from the Minister on the point I am going to raise, but I would like him to have it examined by his departmental advisers because it is of some importance. I refer to Article 6, paragraph (3), of the Health Services Regulations, 1971, which provides as follows:</P>
    <P>The class of persons entitled to avail themselves of services under section 52 or section 56 (2) of the Act shall not include persons who require treatment for injuries received in a road traffic accident except where it is established to the satisfaction of the chief executive officer of the health board that the applicant for such services has not received or is not entitled to receive damages, or compensation in the nature of damages, from another person in respect of the injuries.</P>
    <P>On the face of it that seems a reasonable sort of proposal, but I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in cases where there is contributory negligence it can work very unsatisfactorily.</P>
    <P>That particular article envisages a <Col N="2051" /> situation where damages are awarded <i>in toto</i> but under the present legislation it is possible that a plaintiff, particularly an infant plaintiff, can have the amount of damages to which he is entitled reduced because of contributory negligence.  I believe in those circumstances the Bill which the health authority present should similarly be mitigated.  It is a technical aspect of these regulations which is causing some difficulty and some hardship in practice.  I do not expect the Minister to give me any answer to this now.  I ask that it be looked at and perhaps some proposal put forward to deal with the difficulties which arise.</P>
    <P>They arise out of a situation where the health authority have a bill for hospital and other medical services which would be perfectly all right if the plaintiff were awarded the full amount of compensation to which he is entitled.  Under the present legislation those damages and compensation can be mitigated to the extent that there is contributory negligence.  That should have a bearing on the bill which the health authority present.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House because we have a very busy day today and we are very pressed for time.  These are some comments I wanted to make in regard to this motion, but having said that, this side of the House are prepared to agree to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in case it might be forgotten, I certainly will look into the point the Deputy made with regard to road accidents and financial liability for them.  I am afraid I could not make a long comment on it now, but I will promise to do so as soon as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy complained about the manner of the introduction of this particular regulation.  I do not know if he has forgotten but I announced in the Dáil in April that the regulation was to be introduced.  There was no confusion.  There were no frantic discussions. As far as I am concerned there was no intention to rush into something without consultation.  As far as the medical organisations were concerned they were informed of this <Col N="2052" /> change.  The Medical Association and the Medical Union did not object to the increases.  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, after notifying the public and consulting with the medical organisations, I was firmly bound to the introduction of this change which, as I explained, merely retains eligibility for a certain number of the population, 85,000 to be exact.  All this information was included in the speech I made on the Estimate some time ago.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that Members of the House did not fully realise that the regulation was being discussed in conjunction with the Estimate.  As far as that is concerned the reason for the introduction of the regulation was explained and in respect of the other regulations which I propose to make this week, and which do not necessarily need Dáil approval, the intention was to retain the <i>status quo.</i> I know there are some sections of the Press which try to create the idea that there is constant conflict between the medical professions and me, and conflict as far as the consultants in particular are concerned.  There may have been a certain amount of misinformation about certain issues that there are between me and my Department and some of the medical organisations, but they have nothing and never had anything at all to do with the raising of the limits for the purpose of eligibility.</P>
    <P>There was from one of the organisations a suggestion that they might not implement in full the regulations which I trust will be passed in the next few days, but they were concerned with other things about which consultations are now in progress.  They are concerned, for example, with the filling of consultant vacancies, and I think a reasonable conclusion has come in respect of that.  They are concerned about the terms and conditions and the appointment of consultants. They are concerned about and have discussed with my officials the common method of selecting consultants. They are also concerned with the integration of certain private consultants into the health service.  They are also concerned, as the Deputy has mentioned, about the definition of a <Col N="2053" /> manual worker and a non-manual worker.  That I certainly will have to give consideration to, because I see certain anomalies in respect of the descriptions that are given to workers who have different functions.</P>
    <P>One of the things that was the concern of my Department and of the two organisations concerned was the identification of persons with limited eligibility.  It is right that this should be done, that there should be proper identification and that the people who are identified as being eligible for the services will get these services and those who are not will not get them.  We cannot afford to apply this regulation in a haphazard way.</P>
    <P>There was also a question raised, which again has nothing at all to do with the regulations I am determined to put through, about the provision of support facilities, both from inside the hospital and as far as the hospital consultants are concerned.  In any case these what appear to be differences between the medical profession and the Minister for Health are not unusual.  My predecessor had quite a long struggle over very many years in order to have implemented the choice of doctor or GMS scheme as we now know it.  The figures I have given I gave some months ago as to those who would be affected by this regulation. As I said, the purpose of these regulations is to ensure that they will not lose their entitlement by reason of the fact that their salaries or wages increased in the meantime.  I also did say in the Estimate speech that there are about 50 to 55 per cent of the population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;50 to 55 per cent of the population affected for limited eligibility.  I gave all these details in the Estimate, but the Deputy was probably more concerned about the Estimate rather than the regulations at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference by many of those who spoke in the last debate on the Estimates and on this regulations with regard to the establishment of an all-party committee.  This I have <Col N="2054" /> undertaken to do, but I could not say at present, nor, frankly, would I know what would be the best composition for it.  I would readily say as well that I will see a big input from the Members of the Dáil and possibly of the Seanad.  Whether it would be a good thing just to have Members of the Oireachtas on that committee or not I do not know, because there is a certain amount of information that of necessity must come from the medical organisations, and, of course, from my own Department as well.  It is a pity that the debate was not concluded, even though there was a fair amount of time given to it.  If I had heard all the various opinions that I know would have been expressed in the House we possibly would have been able to come to a positive decision as to what the composition would be.  I make this commitment again here today, that as far as the establishment of an all-party committee is concerned I propose to put a submission before the Government and hope to have this committee working as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There were various criticisms about the administration of the health services and as to whether or not the health boards themselves were a success or whether we should revert to the old county system.  My view is that we should not revert to the county system but if there are improvements to be made these improvements could and should be made in the health boards themselves.</P>
    <P>There are also various suggestions as to how economics could be effected.  Of course, with some allegations&mdash;I do not say unfounded in many respects&mdash;allegations of waste and allegations to the effect that many economics could be made, the Dáil Committee will have an opportunity to discuss these things.  I know many Members of the Dáil are also members of the health boards.  In any case, the input of all these people would give us the present position and possibly make recommendations for the future.  When the health boards were established it was envisaged, and I think promised by my late predecessor, that after five years a review <Col N="2055" /> should be undertaken.  I believe that too, and therefore the establishment of an all-party committee would be one of the submissions I would put to the Government.  An all-party committee with outsiders is something I would like to think about before I make that submission.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Haughey for his support of this measure.  As I have said, it merely keeps those who are at present eligible for these services in eligibility for a period of two to two-and-a-half years, if not sooner when, of course, regulations may have to be introduced in order to up the maximum limits for these services to which these people are entitled at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of allegations that continental granite is, in fact, being used in the construction of the Central Bank, Dublin, he has had any further investigations carried out since his reply of 2nd June, 1976.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question on 2nd June, I stated that I was informed that all of the granite being used in the construction of the new Central Bank building was Irish.  That information was furnished by the Central Bank on foot of information supplied by the bank's architects.  The Central Bank has since informed me that they have now learned that, while contracts for the supply of 9,585 square metres of Irish granite for use on the exterior of the complex, including the plaza, were placed with Irish suppliers, 76 square metres of non-Irish granite were supplied by a contractor to replace breakages, without the knowledge or approval of the bank or its architects. The cost of replacement of the breakages falls to be met by the contractor concerned and not the Central Bank. The Central Bank and I regret that on the basis of information then available to the bank and me the reply of 2nd June last was not entirely accurate.</P>

      <P>Even before I lodged the Question I realised that damage had been done and I accept what the Minister has said.  However, when people look at the new building they will be able to say that it contains continental granite.  Will the Minister assure me that in the landscaping of the building every slab will be of native granite?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is my desire and that of the Central Bank that as much Irish materials as possible will be included in the new building, which will serve not only a functional purpose but which should also be an edifice in which Irish people can take pride in relation both to the skills of the designers and architects and in relation to the materials used.  As I have said, 9,585 square metres of Irish granite was supplied from Irish sources, and it is only in relation to breakages outside the main contract that there was a slippage and in respect of which, unknown to the architects and the bank, a small quantity of foreign granite was supplied.  I assure the House and the country that it is my desire and that of the Central Bank that the Central Bank of Ireland will be, to all intents and purposes, as complete an Irish edifice as it is possible to erect.</P>

      <P>While I accept that the Minister accepts that no blame can attach to the architects in that the specifications stipulated Irish granite only, nevertheless, will the Minister assure me that native granite only will be used in the landscaping of the building?

      <P>It would be undesirable to put a cash figure on any materials used, particularly those supplied as a consequence of the invitation of tenders.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, and I have no reason to doubt the information, the Irish granite supplies came entirely from Ballyknockan, Valleymount and Ballybrew, Enniskerry. The granite from such quarters cannot be improved on in any part of the world.  Also, in relation to the concrete part of the building, which is being faced with granite, the facing work is being done in County Wicklow, so that it is substantially a County Wicklow job.</P>

      <P>The information I wanted to give the House, and which the Deputy has not allowed, is this: the Central Bank have been informed that the reason why non-Irish granite was supplied was because, in the particular circumstances in which the breakage arose and had to be replaced, it could be made available instantly out of stock, whereas Irish stone would have had to be cut.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the VAT system was introduced in 1972 the effective rate on private dwellings erected under normal building contract arrangements was 3.156 per cent on the tax exclusive cost of the building, regardless of the rate of tax applicable to the materials used.  Since March last the effective rate is reduced to 3 per cent.  Any modification would fall <Col N="2062" /> for consideration in the context of the annual budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the VAT on materials can be a fairly substantial cost in the building of a new house?  In view of the fact that grants are not now available to people in certain categories, would he not accept that there is an argument for reducing this VAT still further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are arguments in favour of reducing many taxes, including this one.  It is my ambition and desire to respond to them, but against any desirable tax reduction has to be set the necessity to collect revenue to meet necessary public expenditure.  This is but one of the taxes that must be looked at in the total budgetary situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that reduction in costs would encourage further production of any commodity, including dwellings.  This is one of the matters that will have to be borne in mind when considering what will be the correct tax package.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be disposed to consider the construction industry favourably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason for the inadequacy of the information supplied by the Irish Government to the EEC Commission in relation to projects qualifying for aid from the European regional development fund as contained in Document PE 44.878.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>European Parliament Document PE 44.878 is concerned with establishing a uniform procedure for the exchange of information on the quality of surface fresh water in the Community and it would not appear that the Deputy's question has any relevance to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2063" /> I utterly reject the innuendo in the Deputy's question that information supplied to the EEC Commission by the Government in relation to the regional development fund has been inadequate. I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government have always supplied the EEC Commission with all the information required under the Fund Regulation in connection with our applications for assistance from the European regional development fund. I am glad of the opportunity to put on the record of the Dáil the reply which the Deputy received recently from the Commission to a written question tabled by him in the European Parliament which confirms the correctness of the procedures adopted by the Government and by the Commission.  This reply states, <i>inter alia</i>, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Article 7 (2) of this [the Regional Fund] Regulation provides that investments costing less than 10 million units of account are submitted to the Commission in grouped applications, showing only the total amount of investment and the total of national aids granted. Moreover, in the case of such grouped applications, Article 7 (4) of the Fund Regulation stipulates that aid from the Fund is determined by the Commission `in the aggregate'.  Accordingly, the Commission's decisions on grouped applications show neither the amount of Fund aid attributable to each individual project nor the individual amounts of investment involved.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is unique in that it is the only member state whose entire national territory is treated as a single qualifying region for the purposes of fund assistance.  Hence Commission assistance for grouped applications is approved as a single figure for the country as a unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a printing error here and the question should have read document PE 44.898.  I hope the Minister accepts this was not my mistake.  That document relates to information given to the European Parliament of projects submitted <Col N="2064" /> by the nine member states for aid from the regional development fund.  In relation to this information, is the Minister aware that the only information given by the Irish Government to the European Commission relates to the number of projects that have qualified?  There is no reference to the amount of money allocated to each project from the European regional development fund.  Is the Minister further aware that all the other member states without exception have given this very basic and vital information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied the document to which the Deputy now refers and I would point out that the information in respect of Ireland is similar to that given by all other countries except in regard to the specification of individual sums per region and that is for the reason which the Commission itself explained to the Deputy in response to his own question in the European Parliament. In relation to investments costing less than 10 million units of account the application must be made by grouping together the individual items, and sanction is given by the Commission in the aggregate.  In those circumstances it is not open to either the Commission or the Irish Government to break up the items in the way which the Deputy requests.  Ireland's position is unique as being the only country in the community where the complete national territory is treated as one unit.</P>
      <P>In other countries there are some areas of the national territory which are excluded from regional fund assistance and it is therefore necessary to identify for the purpose of the EEC regulations the particular areas in respect of which applications are made and sanctions are given.  This is not so in relation to Ireland.  There is no reluctance on our part to give information.  We have given all the information required by the European Commission, and as I pointed out on more than one occasion, it is clear proof that we have met all requirements, that we were the first to receive any money from the regional fund.</P>

      <P>Despite the appearance of collusion between the Minister and certain officials of the European Commission, is the Minister aware that great dissatisfaction has been expressed by members of the European Parliament at the inadequacy of this information?

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I am aware that some people have been unable to or are unwilling to understand the provisions of the regulations which govern the operation of the European regional fund.  The Article from which I quoted which was explained to Deputy Herbert at the European Parliament, speaks for itself.  This is not a question of interpretation by officials either in Ireland or in Brussels, or a question of collusion between Ireland and the Commission, as far as the officials are concerned. The regulations have been drafted and have to be applied in their present form.  I am not saying that the regulations as drafted met every requirement of the Irish Government. They did not.  We would hope when a revision of regulations comes about that some of our representations will be met.  In the meantime we have to operate the existing system, and as far as Ireland is concerned it is very important that we ensure that nothing is done which could exclude any part of our national territory from assistance under the regional fund because it is in our interests to ensure that all the national territory will be included.  If we exclude any part of it Ireland will get less under the regional fund, and that would not be helpful.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is substantially as already published in the six-monthly reports to the Oireachtas on Developments in the European Communities (Annex II).  However, the published figures are subject to some minor amendments so as to update them in the light of the most recent information available.  The updated figures are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will see, the table contains figures for the amounts approved by way of grants and loans and the amounts of Ireland's contributions <Col N="2068" /> in respect of the years 1973, 1974 and 1975.  Figures for the period 1st January, 1976, to 31st May, 1976, are currently being compiled and will be contained in Annex II to the Seventh Report to the Oireachtas on Developments in the European Communities which is to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that, due to Community procedures, decisions on applications submitted in a particular year, or the final adjustments to amounts approved, are often delayed until later years.  As a result, the figures quoted for 1975 do not necessarily represent the final amount of Community grants and subsidies approved in respect of that year.</P>
    <P>SUBSIDIES, Grants and Loans from European Community funds approved for Ireland and Ireland's contributions to the European Communities in respect of 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>

    <P>1. Apart from amendments owing to <i>(a)</i> rounding and <i>(b)</i> more up-to-date information the figures in the above table correspond to the figures shown in Annex II of the six-monthly Reports to the Oireachtas on Developments in the European Communities.</P>
    <P>2. In addition to the headings shown in the table receipts also arise as a result of the Community regulations on social security for migrant workers.  Ireland's receipts under this heading were £1.5 million in 1973, £1.3 million in 1974 and £2.0 million in 1975.</P>

      <P>I only have available to me those figures in the various reports which the Minister has indicated which are not quite up to date, but the Minister will take it in any event that the net benefit to Ireland accruing by virtue of our accession, and our Treaty of Accession negotiated by the Fianna Fáil Government, is very considerable from the basis of the information available to me.  In terms of grants alone in 1973, the net benefit would have been £36 million.</P>

      <P>Membership of the EEC will not save Ireland or any other country from all the consequences of the global economic turmoil of the last two years.  It would be facile to argue that it could, because the whole community has suffered as a result of the global upheaval, and indeed many other countries of the EEC have suffered even more severely as far as economic growth is concerned than we in Ireland, which is of great significance. Unemployment growth has been greater in most EEC countries than it has been here, but EEC membership alone cannot protect this country against the consequences of the global recession and the enormous <Col N="2070" /> price rises, particularly in energy, over the last two years.  Nobody on the Government side has ever argued that the EEC could protect this country against the ravages of the worst world recession for the last 40 years.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring to the attention of the Ceann Comhairle the fact that the Minister has not replied to any of the questions I submitted and indeed has not obeyed the rules in relation to brevity and relevance which were laid down by the Ceann Comhairle.  I again ask the Minister if the figures themselves do not clearly underline that we have by virtue of our Treaty of Accession, negotiated by the Fianna Fáil Government, been significant beneficiaries, and in the one area where this Government should have bent themselves with some enthusiasm&mdash;the area of regional policy&mdash;they have miserably failed?  In view of that would the Minister finally acknowledge that far from excusing ourselves by reference to the Minister's failure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I ask one other question?  Would the Minister accept that if this Administration still had to subsidise our agricultural exports to Britain particularly, in the same way as the previous Administration, instead of the considerable benefits they are now enjoying they would actually have to find something in the order of £100 million?</P>

      <P>Having made up for the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party in their efforts to persuade the people of Ireland to join the European Community I shall not argue against anything the Deputy has said in favour of membership of the EEC.  Of course this country has been a net beneficiary of membership quite substantially and our current problems would be a great deal worse were we not a member of the Community.  We have never argued otherwise but all the benefits of EEC membership for this or any other country are not sufficient to protect us from the consequences of the international economic turmoil of the last few years.  If the Deputy will not believe that from me, may I suggest that he consult the economic adviser to the Fianna Fáil Party?  I do not want to name him here but he is well known and I understand that the Deputy is still on speaking terms with him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must accept that there was an effort by the commission to have some form of conservation.  That is mainly done by limiting licences.  If the Letterkenny board were prepared, as they were, to issue licences <i>ad lib</i> to anybody who offered £3 and there was an enormous number of licences issued in this way, they simply do not want to facilitate them because that would limit what they can do about conservation, because they would be giving a further percentage to the same people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for imports of New Zealand butter in the period 1978 to 1980 which were agreed on by the Council of Agricultural Ministers in Luxembourg last week implement the decision taken by the Heads of Government at their meeting here in Dublin in March, 1975.  New Zealand has not been guaranteed 25 per cent of the UK butter market.  What has been provided is that if, because of a reduction in the consumption of butter in the UK, the quota for any of the three years should represent more than 25 per cent of the total UK direct consumption in the preceding year, the excess should be diverted into the food manufacturing industry.</P>

It is greater by far than what could be produced by the whole of the Irish dairy herd and it is in competition with Irish dairy products in the British market.</P>

      <P>Regardless of who presided at the Dublin Summit&mdash;we had to preside during that six months irrespective of where the Summit was held&mdash;there was a decision and that decision was for reasons other than butter.  Let us say the decisions were made for political reasons and there was no other option to the Council of Agriculture Ministers except to implement this decision.  I think it was perhaps on the generous side in interpreting the decision and I said so and stuck to that very strongly at the Council meeting, but I was on my own in that position. I want to say quite clearly that I got absolutely no support from the other member states on the amounts that have been agreed&mdash;125,000 tons in 1978, 120,000 tons in 1975 and 115,000 tons in 1980.  But there is an element of digressivity which is useful in this if it is an indication for the future.

      <P>The number of drift-net licences issued by the board of conservators in each of the years 1972-76 in the Kerry fishery district was 5, 9, 9, 9 and 9 respectively and in the Cork fishery district 244, 182, 127, 134 and 134 respectively.</P>

      <P>Why were so many licences granted in County Cork?  Was it due to the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary represents that area?  Why were so few licences granted in Kerry?  Have Kerry fishermen been discriminated against?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary state if the stocks of salmon have become depleted as a result of so many licences being issued in County Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposite is the case.  In fact, the percentage increase on licences issued by the Kerry board is 80 per cent.  So far as Cork is concerned, in the period covered by the question the reduction is more than 40 per cent.  In 1972 five drift-net licences were issued by the Kerry Board of Conservators.  Under an order by the previous Government not more than five could be issued but under the order I made that number was increased to nine.  In the Cork district where 244 licences were in operation in 1972 before regulations were made, the number was reduced over the years by 109 down to 134.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates the position so far as part of the Kerry coast is concerned.  There is a bye-law in operation since 1913 and, strangely enough, no change was made since that time.  This precludes fishing for salmon from Crow Head to Dunmore Head, including the Blaskets. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there are four additional licences in Kerry as a result of my being in office instead of Deputy Fahey.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that recently fishing gear was confiscated from two fishing boats because the people concerned were fishing for salmon?  This was due to the fact that there are only nine licences granted for County Kerry. It is not fair that only nine licences have been granted.</P>

      <P>May I repeat again that when there were no restrictions and when licences were freely available 244 licences were issued in the Cork fishery board district which comprises mainly the coastal line of County Cork, and only five licences were issued in County Kerry.  The number of licences issued in Cork has been reduced by 109.  As I stated previously, the percentage increase in County Kerry is about 80 per cent; the number has increased from five to nine. People in Kerry have not a grievance so far as the recent orders are concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase of landings of fish is a matter for private enterprise, and I understand that a new fish marketing body composed of a number of local fishing skippers has already been set up at Dingle following the decision of the local fishery co-operative to go into voluntary liquidation.  Since 2nd February last, the EEC market intervention system, which guarantees <Col N="2084" /> fishermen a minimum return on fish landed, has been in operation at most Irish fishing ports, including Dingle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get across the point that Dingle, which was one of our biggest fishing ports during the war years and subsequently, is completely restricted.  Two factories have closed down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say why the fishermen's co-operative society in Dingle went out of business. Since then five of their leading members have formed a society to sell fish at Dingle and the new group are presently engaged in the sale of fish. I should like to refer to newspaper reports that indicated that fish were dumped into Dingle Bay.  If it happened, I disapprove entirely of such action.  To comply with the EEC regulations, to get the intervention price of fish that are not saleable at the standard EEC price, it is not necessary to dump them into the sea. They can be given to a charitable organisation.  I do not know if this dumping took place because I am only relying on newspaper reports, but if it occurred I am bound to say that it is quite out of place in 1976.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has some doubt about the dumping of fish but I can assure him that it took place this week.  The co-operative movement in Dingle needed freezing facilities which they had not got.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to get his Department to find some way so that the fish landed may be purchased and transferred to the market areas.  Dingle is a very considerable distance away and it is difficult to get to the markets.  It is not too much to ask that some help be given in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept that in the past the fishermen's co-operatives did not appear to be getting the grants that were available and that private enterprise was encouraged?   They have now left the area but they were not a help to the fishermen.  Furthermore, is the Parliamentary Secretary telling the House that he has not confirmed the position in relation to the dumping of fish in Dingle?  This has been in the media for quite a while.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil on its rising this week do adjourn until Wednesday, 13th October, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> As the House is aware, this debate is generally used as a vehicle for a review of the economy and other relevant matters.  I propose to follow this precedent.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to deal with the economy.  Many views have been expressed on this, but I think it will be more satisfactory for us to stick as far as possible to the facts.</P>
    <P>We all know that in 1975 national output declined.  We know that the world recession was in part responsible for that situation.  What has not been so obvious is the extent to which we in this country did better than most of the countries with which we trade. Last year, the decline in our gross national product, which had been estimated earlier to have been about 3 per cent, is now put by the Central Statistics Office at no more than 1 per cent.  This is a very creditable performance for our uniquely open economy in the particularly adverse circumstances which prevailed internationally. In 1975, I would like this House and the public generally to know that the decline we suffered came close to being the smallest of any of the member countries of the European Community.  I propose to use OECD figures &mdash; and the estimated decreases in GNP elsewhere last year will show that in Germany it was down 3.4 per cent, France down 2.4 per cent, Italy down 3.7 per cent, the United Kingdom down 1.6 per cent, Belgium down 1.4 per cent, the Netherlands down 1.3 per cent, Denmark down 0.8 per cent and the United States down 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our industrial exports did fall in volume terms by about 4 per cent, the first decrease for many years.  While this was in itself disappointing, the decline was comparable with those suffered by other industrialised countries and represented a less adverse result than experienced by some of these countries.  Germany, for example, suffered a decline of 10 per cent in volume terms in its exports, nearly all of which are industrial in nature.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given demonstrate clearly the extent of the recession which hit the western <Col N="2114" /> world.  There is no point in trying to hide or ignore its effects.  Neither is there point in trying to conceal the beneficial results of the budgetary and other policies adopted by the Government.  We did indeed suffer a decline in output in that year but, because of the actions of the Government and for other reasons, this decline was a great deal less here than it would otherwise have been &mdash; and was much less than in many other countries.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that the signs of recovery which I noted in opening the previous adjournment debate last December have been confirmed.  It is now clear that the upturn was maintained through the last four months of 1975.</P>
    <P>The decline in industrial production levelled off in the third quarter and there was an increase in output in the final quarter of the year.  Available indicators, in particular the external trade returns, suggest that in the current year the upturn has continued. The revival of imports has increased in tempo, reflecting increased output but also increased consumer demand.  Exports have also shown a significant increase.  There were particularly noteworthy rises in sales to countries other than Britain and Northern Ireland. Those to all EEC countries other than the United Kingdom in the period up to the end of last month were up 35 per cent in value on the corresponding period of 1975 while those to the United States rose by 66 per cent and those to Japan actually doubled.  Total industrial exports showed an increase of 30 per cent in value in this period, equivalent to about 10 per cent in volume terms.  These are not signs of a faltering economy &mdash; or of industry unstable or afraid to use its opportunities.</P>
    <P>The international outlook is encouraging. Indeed in the major economies, recent developments have been somewhat more favourable than previously forecast.  The latest estimates suggest that world trade could expand by up to 8 per cent this year where earlier estimates had been of an increase of 6 per cent.  The US economy is leading the recovery.  In continental Europe, both Germany and France <Col N="2115" /> now expect growth rates to be of the order of 5-6 per cent.  In Britain, national output grew at an annual rate of about 4 per cent in the first quarter. However, this represented a mainly export-led expansion phase and, because of the impact there of the counter-inflation policy, prospects for our goods there are not so promising int he immediate future.  Some improvement in domestic demand there is likely in the second half of the year, but this may not help us, particularly if we do not achieve the gains in productivity necessary to negative the difference between our two countries in the size of wage and salary increases being contemplated.  As is well known and has often been emphasised, Britain is our single biggest export market.  We must compete there.  In fact, the disparity in expectations on incomes in the two countries and the effect this could have on our competitiveness both here and in the United Kingdom is probably the single most worrying problem on our horizon.</P>
    <P>This is so because on the way we deal with the problem will depend our ability to keep at work those who now have jobs and to create more jobs for those at present unemployed and for those coming into the labour force. Moderation in income demands will contribute to raising our living standards in the long run.  Lack of such moderation will put thousands more out of work &mdash; and lower living standards for all.</P>
    <P>In my speech on the adjournment debate before the Christmas recess I indicated that it was the Government's view that those who were fortunate enough to have jobs should agree not to press for any further pay increases at least until the end of 1976.  The Minister for Finance in his budget speech reiterated the Government view that a pay pause from the termination of the 1975 national wage agreement until the end of 1976 was most desirable for the good of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Given our commitment to upholding the processes of voluntary agreements wherever possible, the Government, as the single largest employer <Col N="2116" /> in the country, took part in the discussions aimed at negotiating a new national wage agreement.  Regrettably the calls for a pay pause to the end of 1976 produced little concrete result in the negotiations.  We do not consider the terms of the draft 1976 national wage agreement to be the best solution to our problems.  We do however consider them to be the best solution which can be got on a voluntary basis at the present time.</P>
    <P>A rejection of the terms of the draft 1976 national wage agreement would indicate a most disturbing unwillingness on the part of the parties concerned to face up to the problems confronting us at present.  It should be clear that there can be no question of increasing the payments which would be made under the draft national wage agreement.  That should be known and understood.  Much of the objection to the draft proposals seems to be caused by the restrictions the proposals would impose on special increases over and above the standard amounts.  I would ask those who take this line to consider carefully the social stresses that would be created if strong limits were not put to such extra increases at a time when many workers have not got even the standard increases under the last agreement and have no hope of obtaining the full increases under the proposed agreement.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of a &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; would simply lead to a situation where those who think they are in a strong bargaining position would try to enrich themselves at the expense of those in weaker positions.  Those not in strong positions, obviously, have less to bargain with and their position would consequently be much worse due to their weaker situation.  The pursuit of such a policy might bring short term gains to a minority of our citizens but would do nothing for the community as a whole.  Those who would pursue such a course of action would bear a heavy responsibility, for the pursuit of narrow sectional interests at this time could tear our society apart.  As has been repeatedly said, and it is no harm to mention it again at the present time in the period <Col N="2117" /> between now and the decisions in respect of the national draft agreement, nobody owes us a living.</P>
    <P>A call for restraint in income demands does not have any attractions when made after the announcement of a 6.2 per cent rise in the cost of living in the previous quarter, but this increase is in large measure attributable to previous excessive pay increases, and sooner rather than later this fact will have to be acknowledged and short term sacrifices made if we are not to fall disastrously behind in the fight against inflation.  A particularly heavy responsibility, therefore, rests just now on those in a position of leadership or influence to help in getting this message across to the community at large.</P>
    <P>We expect that the second half of the year will see a more generalised recovery here than has so far occurred and that the growth rate for the year as a whole will be in the range of 2-2½ per cent.  I should emphasise that this estimate was made before the outcome of the current situation on incomes is known, and is based on certain assumptions as to pay levels and competitiveness. It is now obviously a matter for conjecture whether these assumptions are right.  I might also indicate that the figures I quoted from the OECD are also borne out by Agence Europe Nationale which gives the estimate for this year and which are largely in line with the other figures given.  I mentioned that because there is no fundamental agreement on the assessment by different expert bodies in this regard.</P>
    <P>I now want to review briefly the position in the principal sectors of the economy.  We have recently debated the Estimate for Agriculture and, if I do not speak at any length about developments in farming, it is not to be taken as indicating any lack of appreciation of the vital importance of agriculture. This was underlined by events in 1975.  Of the increase of £305 million in the value of exports over £200 million was contributed by agriculture.</P>
    <P>For farmers, 1975 was a good year. Output rose by no less than 10 per cent, by volume.  The cattle industry recovered from the relatively depressed <Col N="2118" /> conditions of 1974 and creamery milk production increased appreciably.  The increase in farmers' incomes is estimated to have been about 50 per cent, which more than fully made up the setback experienced in 1974 when they suffered a fall of 12 per cent.  This has brought back confidence to the industry about its future growth.  There is plenty of evidence of this renewed confidence. Market prices for cattle have never been better.  The decline in the acreage of tillage has now been reversed.  Fertiliser usage is showing a welcome and very necessary increase following the cutback over the past two years which, unfortunately, has recently led to a loss of jobs in the fertiliser industry.</P>
    <P>This resurgence of confidence is soundly based.  Within a relatively short period further advantages will accrue when the transitional arrangements of EEC membership come to an end.  I would encourage farmers to build up their herds and to develop the great potential of this basic national industry. I also want to urge farmers in the dairying sector not to over-react to the current proposals of the EEC Commission. I want to assure them that the Minister and the Government will ensure that any adjustments in the Common Agricultural Policy will maintain the scope for expansion here based on our unrivalled natural assets and ability to produce milk at low cost.  We can and must remain one of the world's leading producers of cattle and cattle products in an expanding and highly industrialised market of 260 million people.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the encouraging performance of industrial exports and to the stabilisation of production revealed by official figures.  These figures do not extend beyond the end of last year.  However, the April survey of manufacturing industry conducted by the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Economic and Social Research Institute indicated that the recovery in activity in manufacturing has, in the main, continued.  Taking manufacturing as a whole, the firms surveyed expected that production and exports will continue to increase in the next few months.  Home sales, <Col N="2119" /> however, were not expected to show any change.</P>
    <P>The assessment also varied considerably from one sector to the other, as indeed has performance in recent years.  The survey suggests that the increase in activity is mainly concentrated on intermediate goods and that there have been steep declines in the output of consumer products.  This ties in with the disquieting import trends.  Imports of a wide range of some manufactured consumer goods rose by about 30 per cent in volume terms in the last six months.  Imports from Britain were particularly buoyant.  This increase owes something to the dismantling of tariff protection which has been almost completed, so far as British goods are concerned, since this time last year. The intensification of competition, which is usual in a period of recession, probably played a part.  But there can be no doubt that the main reason for the increasing share of the home market being taken by imports is the loss of competitiveness, principally as a result of the higher pay increases we have awarded ourselves in this country.</P>
    <P>In the four-year period to the end of 1975, average hourly earnings of male workers in industry increased by 18 per cent more in Ireland than in Britain.  More rapid productivity growth here cut the gap between the respective rises in average unit wage costs to 7 per cent.  This result is, of course, an average of widely differing performances between industrial sectors.  In some branches of industry a high rate of investment or the advent of new capital-intensive firms helped to push up output per person employed and to offset increases in pay. In other branches &mdash; the more traditional sectors such as clothing, traditional textiles, paper and printing, wood and furniture and food &mdash; the greater increases in pay here were fully reflected in unit costs. Most of the 57,000 jobs which were lost in industry between 1973 and 1975 were in these sectors.  This bears out again what I and other Ministers have been saying about the link between <Col N="2120" /> increases in unit costs and unemployment.</P>
    <P>A recent issue of the <i>Newsletter</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industry gave an interesting illustration of this relationship by comparing the relative performance of the textile and clothing industries.  During the four-year period from 1971 to 1975, unit wage costs in the Irish textile industry rose 17 per cent more slowly than those in Britain, and Irish textile output increased 19 per cent more rapidly than British output.  At the same time, unit wage costs in the Irish clothing and footwear sector grew 12 per cent faster than those in Britain: output in the Irish clothing and footwear sector declined 17 per cent more rapidly than output in these sectors in Britain. There could hardly be clearer evidence of the connection between costs and employment.  Within limits, the more we pay ourselves the less we can employ in this country.  It is no argument to say that higher wages here stimulate demand and so create markets for more goods.  They do: but the markets are for goods made where costs are lower, and home industry whose prices are out of line gets no benefit.  These are the iron and indisputable laws of trade and they cannot be amended by restrictions which invite retaliation against the 40 per cent or so of our trade which depends on exports of goods and services.</P>
    <P>I have related the preceding comments to Britain since in many ways the two countries now constitute a single market in which impediments of any kind to the free circulation of goods are few.  Increases in unit wage costs in our other principal trading partners, with the exception of Italy, have been less, in some cases very much less, than in Britain or here and it is only the depreciation of the £ which has prevented our goods becoming completely uncompetitive with goods from the US, Japan and most continental EEC countries.  We cannot continue to rely indefinitely on this extraneous influence to protect us from the effects of asking too much and giving too little.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of hope in our future.  If we can draw on the lessons <Col N="2121" /> of the last few years, we can turn the results of adversity to advantage, for during these recent years we have had a complete transformation of our industrial base.  Many firms have closed. Industries have been extensively rationalised.  There has been massive investment in new plant and technology, greater, I may say, than anything we have ever experienced in our history before.  Despite the adverse international climate for investment, the Industrial Development Authority have maintained a high level of success in bringing new industries here.  Last year, their promotion work resulted in grant aid being approved for projects with a job potential of 16,500.  The authority have set a target of 17,000 for this year.</P>
    <P>When I was in America at the kind invitation of President Ford in connection with the celebration of the bi-centennial of the independence of that great country, I took the opportunity of stressing the advantage which this country possesses for American firms thinking of locating plants in the European Community. There is indeed ample evidence of the attractions of the country in the extent to which American firms have already decided to invest here.  As Deputies know, their total investment as at a recent date come to some £329 million.  During my visit there, I announced, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the decision of six more firms to set up factories here, involving a total further investment of some £53 million.  Since then, first-time inquiries have been received by the Industrial Development Authority from a significant number of other American companies; and the authority themselves have mounted almost 100 industrial presentations in America.  Their efforts, if they bear fruit, will be in the interests both of this country and America in that they will preserve for investing firms markets which they might otherwise have lost, and by promoting industrial and economic activity generally will create new and better markets generally here, in America and in the Community for the products both of industry, services and agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2122" /> At home, the Government have stepped up very significantly our support for industrial development.  We have allocated almost £54 million to the IDA for capital purposes this year.  The total allocation for industry in the public capital programme was increased by 71 per cent.  Counting both current and capital expenditure, direct State aid to industry this year is just short of £120 million.  And this does not include tax revenue foregone as a result of the scheme of tax relief for export profits and accelerated depreciation allowances.  We will continue to make available as much money for industrial development as resources allow.</P>
    <P>Given the magnitude of State assistance to industry and changing circumstances, there is an obvious need to review the various ways in which aid is provided and to consider whether they give the best possible incentives to industry to invest and to increase output and sales.  Such a review is in hands in the context of the preparations for issue of a national economic and social plan.  There is no shortage of ideas on new measures of help for industry, and the Government welcome any worthwhile suggestions or proposals.  It is noteworthy, however, that we receive no suggestions on schemes that could be terminated or abridged.  However, in current budgetary circumstances, there is a responsibility to ensure that even aid to industry &mdash; or to agriculture or other sectors of the economy &mdash; taking account, of course, of the benefits to the revenue of more buoyant activity in the economy, does not further widen the public sector deficit.</P>
    <P>The same is true in relation to public spending affecting the building and construction industry where calls for increased spending have also been heard.  There has been a substantial increase in unemployment in this sector and this is something the Government regret.  Of its nature, the industry must depend on what happens in the rest of the economy to generate demand for its products: and in this sense it is less a master of its own destiny than many other industries. <Col N="2123" /> While appreciating this, I wonder how much of the blame for high unemployment in the industry must be shouldered by the industry itself, both workers and employers. Does it push up the price of its products so much that demand inevitably slackens?  Does the operation of price variation clause facilitate this process?  For the sector's customers, be they in the public sector or in the private sector, can only secure so much funds to spend on building work.  If these buy a smaller quantity of work as a result of cost and price inflation, the result is unemployment.</P>
    <P>Again, here, the connection between the level of wages and employment is crucial; and the figures are simple.  If £325 million is available for building and construction generally &mdash; from the public capital programme or otherwise &mdash; and 40 per cent of this goes directly on wages, then some 50,000 men can be employed.  If the average wage goes up by say 20 per cent while the total amount of money flowing to the industry remains the same, then unemployment in the industry, as a matter of simple mathematical calculation, must fall. Perhaps 9,000 more men must lose their jobs.  This is the sort of roulette being played and these are the stakes in current wage negotiations.  Here as in every other industry and walk of life, jobs and wages are interdependent and there is no way in which the link can be broken.  The more out of line with productivity that incomes go the fewer jobs there will be in this country &mdash; both for those who now have them and for school leavers and others who are seeking them.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the Government have not been sparing in allocating funds for building.  Our housing record is the best example of this.  The increase in local authority housing construction since we took office culminated in a record 8,700 houses being built last year.  This increase and the other measures in our housing programme have maintained an annual rate of more than 25,000 dwellings in output.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> But to get the full measure of the work supported by public expenditure, one needs to go far beyond housing, further even than the items shown under the heading &ldquo;building and construction&rdquo; in the sectoral breakdown of the public capital programme. Spending under many other headings also provides work for construction firms and workers. Examples are harbour works, work at airports, spending by Bord Fáilte and factory-building partly financed by IDA grants.  The total provision affecting the industry in this year's programme is in fact, the £325 million I mentioned.  This represents a remarkable effort in the budgetary circumstances that prevail.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment on the discussions relating to pay in the industry except to ask all concerned to consider the points I made a few moments ago; and the reality that there can be no further allocation of public funds for building work this year.  Further, there will be very strict constraints on what will be possible next year.  Many people hold that we have reached the limit of taxable capacity &mdash; and in the interests of economic development, we must reduce the level of public borrowing.</P>
    <P>While detailed statistics on developments in the services sector in 1975 are not yet available, the level of activity in the sector as a whole was lower than in the previous year.  However, tourism improved by about 3 per cent in real terms and there was growth in certain other areas.  Figures released by Bord Fáilte show a rise in tourism numbers in the first four months of the current year.  The North American market was particularly buoyant with an increase of 13 per cent.  For the year as a whole the board forecast a rise of nearly 7 per cent in overseas visitors.</P>
    <P>The past six months have been noteworthy for the progress made towards the full exploration and development of our natural resources, on the basis of the Government's policy that their exploitation should confer the maximum possible advantages on the nation as a whole.  The work at Navan for the development <Col N="2125" /> of the lead/zinc ore body is going ahead and more than 1,000 workers are employed there at present.  Following the announcement of our intention to promote the establishment of a zinc smelter to process zinc concentrate supplies from the Navan mines, we authorised the IDA to pursue the matter and they have been doing so actively.</P>
    <P>In the offshore sector, substantial progress has been made in the last year.  Deputies are aware of the position about natural gas from Kinsale from the debate on the Gas Bill, currently before the Oireachtas.  During this session, exclusive offshore exploration licences were concluded covering areas in the South-West, West, North-East and East.  The licensee work obligations are such as to ensure that a wide-ranging drilling programme will continue over the next three or four years.  This programme has already started.  I think we can look forward with realistic optimism to results in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the discussions on a new Law of the Sea Convention which are being conducted in a global framework, and of the discussions within the European Community on a new Community regime for fishing.  Both these sets of discussions are of great importance for the future development of our fishing industry.  I emphasised this at the Luxembourg meeting of the European Council when I said that conservation was vital to the future of the industry and that the Community's new policy must give maximum attention to this question.  We are not happy with the Commission's proposals on exclusive coastal zones.  These have had to have regard to the short-term national interests of a number of our partners which are opposed to ours in this matter.  I would hope, however, that they will see the importance of adequate coastal zones to the conservation of fish stocks which, ultimately, benefits all interests concerned.  At any rate, the Government are determined, in the discussions which are continuing in the Council of Ministers, to safeguard the interests of our fishing <Col N="2126" /> industry and to allow scope to realise its potential for further development</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Luxembourg meeting of the European Council of Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers of the member states of the European Community which I attended at the beginning of last April.  In the statement I made in the House on my return, I referred to the general situation within the Community. I suggested that although the outcome of the meeting in Luxembourg was disappointing it might be best to suspend judgement until the end of this year.  This, I think, remains valid as developments in the interval do not provide a clear indication of the health of the Community or of the direction in which it is going.</P>
    <P>On the credit side, it is worth noting that, except in a small number of cases mainly relating to Italy, where Commission approval for derogations was granted, protective measures affecting other member states have been avoided.  Agreement was reached in the annual price review under the Common Agricultural Policy on a package which was satisfactory for this country, given the overall economic situation and the diverse interests which had to be accommodated.  We had further evidence of Community solidarity in the loan of 1.3 billion dollars raised by the Community for this country and Italy.  Our share was more than £150 million.  Further progress has been made in developing the external relations of the Community acting as a single unit.</P>
    <P>These are some of the Community's achievements of which we should not lose sight.  Some of them consist more of avoiding dangers than of making positive progress, but they are no less welcome for that.  However, there is no point in concealing the fact that there have also been many disappointments. These include the continuing failure to agree on a Community energy policy, the lack of progress towards convergence of the levels of development of the member states' economies, the failure to agree at Luxembourg on the size and composition of a directly elected European <Col N="2127" /> Parliament, the patent failure to coordinate Community policy, as such, in economic summits like that at Rambouillet last year and now at Puerto Rico.</P>
    <P>There is to be a further meeting of the European Council on 12-13th July. I would hope that with improving economic prospects it might be possible to make a start there on breathing new life into the Community.  In relation to direct elections to the European Parliament, the number of proposals under consideration has been narrowed down to a small number within which I would hope we could find the basis for a solution which would be satisfactory for Europe and for this country.</P>
    <P>The report on European Union, prepared by M. Tindemans, the Prime Minister of Belgium, and the discussions on the issues it raises also have an important role to play in advancing integration.  The report has been under examination by the Foreign Ministers and is to be discussed further at the forthcoming meeting of the European Council but we will not know the final outcome before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The benefits of such activity are in marked contrast to the continuing tragedy of Northern Ireland.  I have stated Government policy on the North on many occasions.  As recently as March I had the privilege of giving a full account of its main aspects before a joint meeting of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States of America.  That account received wide publicity and, I think and hope, wide acceptance.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me here to go into the detail of what I said there. I would like, however, to place again on record my appreciation of the actions of President Ford in joining with me in an appeal to American and Irish people to refrain from supporting Northern violence with financial or other aid, and for the practical measures taken to give effect to that intention.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not by words alone that progress can be made in Northern Ireland&mdash;though badly <Col N="2128" /> chosen or ill-intentioned statements can cause considerable damage.  And it is not by the length of speeches that the value of policies is to be judged. The Government have shown more than once that their will to combat violence is not merely verbal; and that they will uphold, with the considerable forces now at their command, the law of this land.  We do not want men of violence here; and we will not permit this country to become a haven for those who destroy the lives and property of our fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland, here or elsewhere. Our record on violence speaks for itself but British Ministers have joined with us in expressing satisfaction at the excellent results that have been achieved in the field of North/South co-operation on security matters.</P>
    <P>At present there is evidence of a will in Northern Ireland to discuss the way forward for the different sections of the community, most of whom wish for an environment of stability and law, in which the real problems of the area can be tackled.  By the real problems I mean the problems of unemployment and social justice and the creation of good living conditions for all its people. The discussions now going on are a hopeful sign for the future.  We here wish them well.  Our attitude will be one of readiness to help in any way we can&mdash;and to accept and support fully any institutions of Government freely arrived at which command the respect of the people of Northern Ireland as a whole.  Indeed, when I met the former British Prime Minister, now Sir Harold Wilson, in London last March, we confirmed that both Governments were agreed that only on this basis could an acceptable form of a government be established.</P>
    <P>From what I have said it will be easy to deduce the main emphasis in Government policy over the past few years.  We have sought to protect the weak from the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and to develop our economy so as to ensure that, as far as possible, people could remain in employment.  The numbers out of work are high but they would have been a great deal higher without the measures taken by the Government&mdash;<Col N="2129" /> on a scale, let me emphasise, never matched in this or in any other generation. Indeed, as Deputies will be aware, percentage increases in unemployment in other countries, brought about by the recession from which we have all suffered, were higher&mdash; often far higher&mdash;than here.  This is no comfort to those who have lost their jobs or who are seeking work, but it does bring home the size of the Government's effort to maintain employment and the comparative success of that effort.</P>
    <P>The cost has been great.  The capital and current expenditure of Government and local authorities and the capital expenditure of semi-State bodies has risen over the past three years from just under £1 out of every £2 of gross national product to about £2 out of every £3.  No matter what ideas one may hold about the influence of public expenditure on gross national product or on economic growth, it is clear that a continuance or increase in expenditure at this level is not compatible with a thriving and self-reliant industry or agriculture.  If the State and public authorities generally monopolise too many of the decisions on the allocation of resources, then other initiatives by indigenous industry just cannot take place.  The absorption or reallocation by the State and by public authorities of an increasing proportion of national wealth&mdash;no matter how worthy the motive&mdash;can only weaken enterprise and the sense of drive in domestic industry and agriculture on which the growth of the economy depends.</P>
    <P>Public expenditure is financed largely by taxation and borrowing. Our levels of taxation expressed as a percentage of total resources are not high by international standards but this statement, taken by itself, gives an incomplete picture.  First, the relative poverty of our country means that the level of taxation expressed as a percentage of GNP which would be light in a richer country could bear with great severity here.  And the structure and incidence of taxation may often be such that it weighs heavily on particular sections and may well inhibit development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2130" /> The borrowing we have had to do to maintain our capital and other programmes is not sustainable at its current level in the longer term, or in conditions such as those emerging where the major industrial nations are pulling out of recession and industry may well be starting to seek investment capital to finance its activities. Indeed at its present level borrowing is imposing a heavy burden on taxable capacity.  Deputies will have noted that in the current year the cost of extra debt services is almost equivalent to the entire buoyancy of taxation.  In other words, when the increase in the cost of debt service is met there is little or nothing for other policy options like the reduction in taxation or improvement in services.  This is the factual position which should be pondered by the many who propose further increases in public expenditure and borrowing.</P>
    <P>What then are the priorities for the Government?  The first and absolute priority is the maintenance and creation of employment.  This means many things.  It means that we must reduce our rate of inflation because at its current level it is making it increasingly difficult for us to compete in markets here and abroad where we must sell.  So far we have been reasonably successful in this area.  The danger is not in what we have done but in what we may do&mdash; not in the past but in the future.  It could well lie ahead in the consequences of wage and income increases which are too high for the economy to bear, and well above what is contemplated abroad.  Economically, we do not live on an island.  We live in the midst of a large and busy market where goods sell on price and quality, irrespective of origin.  Exporting a high proportion of what we produce, we benefit from this market, but importing also the best that it can produce, we must observe its disciplines, or suffer the consequences. It is the plainest of common sense that if our goods are uncompetitive in price or design, then employment must inevitably suffer.</P>
    <P>It is no good coming along when the markets are lost and factories <Col N="2131" /> and workshops are about to close, and urging that something be done to keep the plant alive and jobs in being. Fire brigade actions achieve little.  We will survive and prosper only by the use of good management practice and the application in time to incomes generally of the principles of realism and common sense.</P>
    <P>This does not apply only to those working in what are generally known as the productive sectors, like agriculture and industry.  It applies throughout the economy.  There is no such thing now in our country as a sector, service or industry, isolated from the rest.  Each depends on the other.  All who live and work in this country are part of the same community and depend on it for their livelihood.  It is for this reason that the Government introduced the recent legislation on the banks.  The community pays the tens of millions of pounds for bank salaries, in one way or another, just as it pays the costs of other goods and services it buys.  And the community has a real and continuing interest in what it gets for this money.  Bank costs are part of industry's prices; and their actions become examples for others to follow.</P>
    <P>Our basic aim of improving prospects for employment requires a great deal more than moderation in the rate of inflation and in the growth of incomes. It requires a new attitude on public expenditure and a critical examination of many projects and programmes. There are many questions to be asked in this examination.  To what degree is public expenditure and the taxation necessary to finance it adding to our inflation, and thus in effect diminishing our prospect of creating more jobs?  Are there within Government programmes which are contradictory in effect, perhaps at the one time involving subsidies and taxation? Is what we are spending really achieving a return for the community as a whole, as distinct from some sectional group within it?  Are our policies on welfare and taxation logical, or even compatible with each other?  Many <Col N="2132" /> questions like these are being considered and will be answered in the Government's continuing examination of public expenditure and its place within our social and economic plan. Indeed it is only in this way that we can free the resources necessary to release and sustain the enterprise and investment on which the growth of the economy and all employment depend. Again, is the emphasis within the total of public expenditure, at whatever level it is set, right, if we want to achieve our objective of ensuring that our opportunities for employment improve?  Obviously the direction of changes made in the last budget must be maintained.  There must be the greatest possible emphasis on spending which creates self-sustaining employment and does not at the same time add substantially to the tax burden, either directly or through debt service charges.  Perhaps nowhere more than in relation to public expenditure is the Government's priority of creating and maintaining employment more relevant.</P>
    <P>In what I have said about inflation, incomes and public expenditure, I am not implying that the Government alone can achieve the atmosphere of confidence&mdash;the desire and initiative to progress&mdash;on which our prosperity depends.  The Government can and will provide the environment for progress. That is what the work on the forthcoming economic and social plan is all about.  But neither any plan nor the Government can, in themselves, ensure that progress takes place.  That depends on many things like the will to succeed, the readiness to accept and benefit by change, and not least the willingness to refrain from unjustified criticism which can fuel the despondency which so many now seem to enjoy.  I have said that an absolute priority is the maintenance and creation of self-sustaining employment.  It is an aim to which all sections of the community can subscribe; and it is an aim to which all can give substance in their lives and actions particularly in their attitude to incomes.  The Government will continue to encourage and lead to its achievement.  It is the basis on which our policy is framed and the objective of our efforts and undertakings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is a prelude to the adjournment of the Dáil on tomorrow, 1st July, at an unprecedented early date, at a time when the country is in an unprecedented state of despondency and the economy is in an unprecedented state of chaos.  Apart from the general considerations of the state of the economy, the existence now of a bank strike and the uncertainty as to whether or not a national pay agreement will emerge and will become effective, we on this side of the House believe that it represents a high degree of irresponsibility on the part of the Government to insist on the adjournment of the Dáil for a period of threeand-a-half months at this time.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Taoiseach's speech which, as usual, contained its quota of generalities, selective use of statistics where they favoured the Government and with apparently to a large degree reliance on the improvements of the economy now being generated in the United States and which is spearheading a hope for improvement in the economy of the European countries, the Taoiseach has not put forward one specific proposal in his speech as to how the unemployment rate might be reduced, how the rate of inflation might be curbed and how the prices spiral might be held.  I propose not merely to highlight the failures of the Government in so many aspects of administration but to give an indication of the thinking of Fianna Fáil as to how this crisis arose and how it could have been forestalled or maybe relieved, and also to give an indication in a general way of how we in Fianna Fáil believe that a steady rate of progress of economic growth, which was experienced under successive Fianna Fáil Governments up to 1973, could be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are committed to economic development in a phased and ordered way and on a programmed basis, having regard to reasonable assumptions.  Fianna Fáil are committed as well&mdash;and our record in this respect shows it&mdash;to social improvements and development.  Unless we can have reasonable and realistic programmes, we will not be able to produce <Col N="2134" /> effective curbing of inflation, effective price stability, effective job creation, and real improvement in the standard of living.  There is no point in one Government saying that in a given year it provided £10 million, £20 million or £30 million more in social welfare benefits than its predecessor if the recipients of these benefits are obliged to pay 7, 10 or even 17 per cent more to maintain their previous standard of living or to buy the same quantity of the necessities of life that they purchased before these increases were granted.</P>
    <P>This Government have in existence a scheme of pay-related benefits. There is no point in pretending that this scheme can continue merely because the Government decide to make orders extending the scheme on the basis of three-monthly periods of extension.  The concept of pay-related benefits is fair and just if operated in a fair and just way, but if its inevitable consequence is to reduce employment, to reduce the will to work even when that work is available, then the scheme will break up of its own dynamic.</P>
    <P>What is most necessary at present is a sense of patriotism in general and a sense of practical patriotism, as people have come to know it, and also a sense of realism.  We must redefine for our people our national aspirations and re-establish, where it needs to be re-established, our national identity.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland problem will not go away merely by doing nothing about it.  It will not settle itself by the Government here saying: &ldquo;The immediate problem is none of our business; go and settle it among your selves.&rdquo; At present I welcome and support, as the Taoiseach has said, the efforts being made by members of the SDLP with members of the Official Unionist Party at finding some <i>modus operandi</i> for the administration of the affairs of Northern Ireland. Fianna Fáil have confidence in the SDLP, in the members of it who are conducting these negotiations, that they will maintain in the forefront the fundamental national ideal in seeking a solution for current problems in <Col N="2135" /> the North.  But I do not think it is fair to the SDLP, and even for their own sake I do not think it right that they should be seen to be the instigators or initiators of policy on behalf of the Dublin Government.  It is not enough for this Government to denounce the IRA or any other perpetrators of violence North or South as we did and do; it is not enough to pursue the IRA to ensure the security of the State as we did when in Government, unless the Government can establish that they have a policy in relation to the North of Ireland that will make the IRA irrelevant and be seen to be irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil produced a policy statement last October and this is being kept under constant review.  That statement was made on the eve of the demise of the Convention.  Nothing has happened since, except the talks to which I have referred, that would seem to hold out any hope of <i>rapport</i> between the two sections of the community in the North.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the restatement of our national ideals.  These include the maintenance and extension of the use of the Irish language and, of course, otherwise establishing our distinctive national identity.  It is not enough to make promises to the people of the Gaeltacht about new industries, even if only a small fraction of these promises is capable of being fulfilled, and forget about the language itself. The maintenance and use of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht is of primary importance but we must seek also to extend the use of it, interest in it and love for it in areas outside the Gaeltacht throughout the country generally.  As for practical patriotism, we must restore in the people pride in their work, confidence in themselves, and confidence in their country.</P>
    <P>We must get rid of the dole mentality, of the notion that a restatement of empty ideological clichés would solve our problem.  We must get rid of the mentality that some people opposite have that to nationalise everything in sight and tax everything that moves will solve our problems.  We must get rid of the notion that if we <Col N="2136" /> sit tight&mdash;as the Taoiseach seems to have done&mdash;improvements in the economies of other countries will inevitably spill over to us and our economy will also improve.  That is not what governments are elected for.  One of the most glaring examples of the total absence of Government activity and policy and total failure to give any leadership has been in the field of pay policy which is perhaps most relevant at the present time.  The Coalition tacticians may see this as a clever example of papering over the fundamental differences that lie between them and perhaps a small price to pay for clinging on to office but, for the nation as a whole, this lack of policy is a national disaster and is helping only to prolong the misery of unemployment and inflation.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas we were led to believe that the Government have a policy.  A pay pause, apparently, was needed in 1976 if jobs were to be saved and inflation cut down.  Then in January the Government themselves put an end to any such prospect when the budget pushed up prices by 5 per cent.  How could any trade union be expected to agree to a policy that would have meant a drastic cut&mdash;I emphasise the words drastic cut&mdash;in the living standards of their members? Having thus destroyed their own suggested pay pause policy the Government enunciated a new policy or form of pay restraint.  This was an alleged policy because in the four or five months since then members of the Government have never managed to explain, presumably because they do not know themselves, what exactly they mean by pay restraint.  Even now, with another serious bank strike under way, we still do not know what pay increase fits in with this notion of pay restraint.</P>
    <P>Since the intention of such a policy was to help preserve jobs pay restraint might be taken to call for pay increases no greater than those taking place in Britain at present because otherwise Irish costs and prices would rise faster than in Britain inevitably leading to a loss of markets for Irish products and a loss of jobs.  But despite all the early talk about statutory controls <Col N="2137" /> or talk leading to the belief that there might be statutory controls and that these would be used if necessary to impose a modest pay norm, it transpired that the Government were ready to accept pay rises which would average about 14 per cent, a figure three times as high as the figure negotiated in Britain and at a level which, to use the Minister for Finance's own colourful words, would lead to the crucifixion of the economy.  Whether through remorse, or as another propaganda exercise, we then had a belated attempt at Government toughness this time again over the clauses for special pay increases above the norm.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the present state of suspense.  We do not know if there will be a national pay agreement on the terms already announced.  We do not know if a free-for-all will follow any breakdown of these proposals. We do not know if the same penalties now proposed for the banks will apply to groups of workers and employers who will arrange for pay rises above the norm.  We do not know what the pay norm will be, whether it will be more or less than the amount proposed already.  In short, there is no trace of a credible or coherent policy on incomes and prices, as there has been no such policy for the past three years.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this Coalition cannot even learn from their own mistakes. Faced with this vital and major issue of pay rises, their only clear response is to rush through a motion providing for the adjournment of the Dáil and go on holidays in the despairing hope that the problem will somehow go away or solve itself.  Of course it will not.  Failure to act positively means that even greater efforts will have to be made towards putting our house in order in the future to restore price stability and to get our people back to work.</P>
    <P>We have become familiar in the past three years with the propaganda and manipulation of facts by the Coalition to suit their own particular case.  We had one example of this last weekend in a speech made by the Tánaiste in which he seriously misrepresented the unemployment position <Col N="2138" /> here in comparison with other EEC countries.  As reported, he stated that between April, 1974, and April, 1975, average unemployment had stabilised in only two countries.  He went on to say &ldquo;the Netherlands had an increase of 9 per cent, Italy 11 per cent and our increase was 18 per cent, which was about the Community average.  It was less than the French 24 per cent increase and the increase of 37 per cent in Belgium and Britain.&rdquo; These comparisons, he claimed, vindicated the Government's general strategy on jobs.</P>
    <P>First, I might ask: what strategy? The fact is that there is no such strategy.  These statistics were used again selectively.  They are a blatant illustration of the old adage about lies, damn lies and statistics and the clear intention in making these comparisons is to suggest that we in Ireland are at least no worse off than the EEC as a whole, and that we are better off in comparison with increasing unemployment than Britain and other countries.</P>
    <P>In fact, our performance has been much worse than those countries and the use of percentage increases in this way does not tell anything about the number of people losing their jobs. Let us take an example.  If unemployment rises from one to two, that is an increase of 100 per cent.  If it rises from 100 to 150 that is an increase of only 50 per cent, but to any sane person, and especially to a person concerned about the plight of the unemployed, the loss of 50 jobs is obviously far more serious than the loss of one job.</P>
    <P>This type of misleading comparison which the Tánaiste tried to make last weekend creates the fallacious thinking by this Government that things are going well or as well as they can make them go.  Let us take the real situation in Britain and Ireland. Between spring, 1974, and January of this year, unemployment in Britain rose by about 110 per cent.  Here in Ireland it rose by &ldquo;only&rdquo;&mdash;to use the Tánaiste's own word&mdash;60 per cent.  In the spring of 1974, unemployment in Britain was much lower than unemployment in Ireland.  In Britain it was <Col N="2139" /> 2½ per cent, and here it was over 6 per cent of the total labour force.</P>
    <P>Because British unemployment was much lower to begin with, their rise of 110 per cent means 2.8 people out of every 100 lost their jobs in the past two years.  Our rise of 60 per cent means 3.6 people out of every 100 lost their jobs in the same period. That is the factual situation.  Look at the stark comparison.  For every three jobs in 100 the British lost, we lost four.  That is what actually happened. These are the facts.  Our rise in unemployment was worse and not better than the British performance.  God knows what will happen in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>I hope people will not think this reference to statistics is one of those tedious and complicated games for experts and economists only.  It is no such thing.  It is at the heart of an understanding of the present policy, or rather lack of policy, of this Government in relation to unemployment Before I leave the subject of comparisons I should like to say that the same relative position emerges if Ireland is compared with EEC countries. Unemployment in the EEC rose overall by about two in every 100 workers in the past two years compared with the 3.6 in 100 to which I have referred.  Again our performance was much worse than the EEC average rather than far better as the Tánaiste tried to pretend.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, if we allow for the numbers engaged in agricultural employment in this country compared with the others, our figures are far worse again.  In Ireland roughly about 25 out of every 100 people employed are engaged in agriculture. In Britain the figure is only three out of every 100, and in the EEC it is only ten out of every 100. As a percentage we had far fewer people in industrial employment who stood to lose their jobs and who will continue to lose their jobs under this Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to agriculture as one of the strongest bases with the greatest potential for increased economic activity.  If we are to get worthwhile increased employment, we will <Col N="2140" /> have to look to the products and the processing of products of the agricultural industry.  It was with this in mind that the Fianna Fáil Party opposed the Coalition's tax imposition on agricultural co-operatives.  We believe genuine co-operatives need the stimulus this tax concession gives them to create and maintain the necessary expansion and to favour the necessary employment based on agricultural products.  I mean genuine agricultural co-operatives.  I do not mean the co-operative that sells soap powder or ladies' tights in competition with the man down the main street.</P>
    <P>On the question which I mentioned a few minutes ago of practical patriotism I want to refer again to the current bank strike and the pending vote at the delegates' conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to be held next Saturday.  I want to put aside completely party political considerations. I want to put aside the now universally accepted bungling of the Government in the whole national pay negotiation exercise.  I want to put aside, too, the inept handling of the current bank dispute.  Even though the Government failed to act in the right way and at the right time, I hope there is still a prospect of remedying the situation.  Even though the Government have failed to give an effective lead, I would ask all our people who have jobs, especially those in secure jobs, and all our people who have the means of earning their livelihood by their own efforts, to make some sacrifice at this juncture in the national interest.  I ask the bank officials, notwithstanding the manner in which the Government imposed the wage freeze, to suspend their strike and give a chance to the consideration by them of the verdict of an independent assessor on the present bank pay proposals.  I suggest they might do that at least until the economy shows some sign of beginning to improve and without prejudice to their reopening wage negotiations at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the unions who are voting under the banner of the ICTU next Saturday to accept these proposals that are before them and to <Col N="2141" /> put aside their immediate interests and concerns, however legitimate they may be.  Such an act of practical patriotism on the part of both groups, banks and ICTU unions, would give an example of the kind of leadership and national commitment of which this Coalition is apparently incapable.</P>
    <P>Apart from all this, the Government will have to clear their own thinking as to where we are going and how they propose to get there.  Fianna Fáil always believed that State enterprise has an important role to play.  This has been well established by the many successful State enterprises which were created by and flourished under the Fianna Fáil Government.  However, the issue today is not whether there should be total dependence on State enterprise, on the one hand, or private enterprise, on the other, but rather to strike a proper balance between the two.</P>
    <P>This discussion is not helped by the confused statements coming from the members of the Coalition, even from within the same party.  The former Senator, now Deputy Halligan, had a thesis which is apparently that private enterprise has failed and that we must therefore look to State enterprise to solve all our problems.  The Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kelly, shot down this concept at a very early stage, and thus very early as well exposed the dichotomy that exists in the two sections of this Government.  But last weekend, in the course of the speech to which I have already referred, the Tánaiste seemed to play a different tune from that already played by Deputy Halligan when the Tánaiste said we cannot rely &ldquo;solely&rdquo; on private enterprise to provide the additional employment needed.  I would like to know who suggested otherwise than members of his own party.  Certainly Fianna Fáil never relied solely on private enterprise, and the record shows this clearly.  Fianna Fáil never believed either that the State should assume control of every sector of the economy. The republican ideal implies the independence of the individual and therefore, in the first instance, we belive that individuals must be entrusted with responsibility for their own affairs and <Col N="2142" /> only where individual responsibility does not suffice is there a case for State involvement or intervention.</P>
    <P>We need both kinds of enterprise, State and private, and the challenge for today and tomorrow is not the dichotomy that obviously exists within the Government ranks but how to strike the acceptable and realistic balance.  The present problem is to achieve rapid growth, to reduce unemployment and to restore confidence. To achieve and maintain satisfactory growth means, as we all know, largescale investment.  To finance this kind of investment demands, of course, large-scale savings and adequate profits. &ldquo;Profits&rdquo; apparently nowadays is a bad word in our society, but we know they are necessary in any society, whether it is socialist or capitalist.  One of the real problems now is the failure of the Government to generate the necessary recognition of profits to be ploughed back into investment.</P>
    <P>There is no coherent plan, as far as we know, from the Government how this larger cake that we all seek will be produced and how it will be shared out between State and private enterprise. Fianna Fáil have been seeking and still seek to chart the way to provide a proper mix between these two forms of enterprise.  Let me say in relation to the lack of planning by the Government how disillusioned so many people have become by the failure of the Government so far to produce any kind of plan or even basic principles.</P>
    <P>We were told up to the June budget of 1975 that planning was impossible or unrealistic in the present difficult economic circumstances.  The economic circumstances became worse since June, 1976, but nevertheless we were then promised a plan by Christmas. The Minister repeated his promise not of a plan this time but a set of options and not by Christmas but by some time in the New Year. Come the New Year and come the January budget, the Minister repeated the suggestion of the options or the Green Paper, or whatever colour he wanted it to be, coming out shortly.  The Dáil is now coming to its summer recess.  The Green <Col N="2143" /> Paper or the plan has not appeared. We would like to believe that it might appear or at least that the set of options might appear some time in the autumn.  Then it will be for the commentators or the different vocational groups to indicate what kind of options they would prefer, and then the Government may or may not act on one or more of the options.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that we have consistently and even recently tried to chart the way for this country to make reasonable and adequate economic progress.  We already have the State-owned companies such as Bord na Móna, the ESB and others. We have as well the 100 per cent privately-owned companies.  We believe there is a necessity&mdash;and we published our proposals in this respect &mdash;for mixed ownership, that is, enterprises with worker participation and also industrial co-operatives which would be worker managed.  Because we believe that industrial democracy is vital if industry is to progress democratically and with a genuine level of participation between management and employees, we published a discussion document on worker participation in Irish industry some months ago.</P>
    <P>Our proposals were radical and inventive and, I would say, a long way ahead of the limited form of industrial democracy, if one can call it that, contained in the proposals to be put before the Dáil in the Bill yet, as far as I know, to be drafted, certainly yet to be published, on worker representation on State boards.  Our proposals were intended as a first step towards achieving more participation at all levels both in the public and the private sectors.  We accept fully that workers by virtue of their labour inputs, have rights in running and developing the prosperity and future of Irish industrial enterprises.  We want to see these workers having a real say in the effective management of their firms.  This document has been widely circulated.  It is realistic and radical.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to these matters specifically because of the allegations <Col N="2144" /> we have heard so often that Fianna Fáil have no proposals and no policies. I want to refer to a few of them as I go along.  In my Ard-Fheis speech, as far back as February of this year, I said:</P>
    <P>One new source of enterprise we would specifically like to encourage is workers' enterprise.  We would give State financial bodies such as the Industrial Credit Company and Fóir Teoranta the power to supply funds for workers who could develop self-managed firms.  We would do this, not only as one way of encouraging badly needed employment opportunities, but also as a way of promoting a valuable experiment in industrial democracy, with worker participation in the fullest sense of that term.</P>
    <P>We have the four methods, two of which are in existence, whereby we believe that the necessary impetus can be given to the expansion of employment in the country.  The opportunity of worker participation and worker management on a co-operative basis is consistent with the republican ideal of the maximum responsibility to the individual rather than hand over entirely to nameless planners and faceless officers.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that we will encourage enterprise from any source.  All this provides for the different mix of employment the Irish people would aspire to.  This may not be as easy and as neat as the ideologists would like but it is, I believe, consistent with giving the individual the widest possible freedom and would give as well to the individual the kind of encouragement for enterprise which he needs.  As we know, a lot of enterprise can be choked off and is being choked off in the bureaucratic inertia of large State agencies.  As well as that it is right, in the kind of mixed economy we have, that we should not have all the eggs of that mixed economy in one basket because one catastrophe can bring the whole lot down and we can never insulate ourselves, as we know at present, against world conditions. We can provide the means of overcoming them if we have the will <Col N="2145" /> which apparently this Government do not have.</P>
    <P>In relation to the suggestions about Fianna Fáil policies we have produced policies on health, an extensive and comprehensive one, on the status of women and our policy on youth has been fully enunciated.  We are still waiting for any indication of Government policy in this respect.  In relation to youth I put forward specific suggestions in my Ard-Fheis speech as to how at least some of those who would be coming off the school-leaving conveyor belt, young people leaving secondary and tertiary education this year, could be engaged in community work.  We have indicated how home ownership could be increased.  Again, I refer to my Ard-Fheis speech when I said:</P>
    <P>The Coalition have abolished grants for the majority of house buyers.  We suggested grants of up to £1,000 for people buying a home for the first time and a special scheme of low-interest inflationlinked mortgages which would halve the monthly mortgage repayments in the early years, as a way of helping thousands of young couples to buy their own homes, and as a way of giving a valuable boost to the building industry.</P>
    <P>In this connection we have at an advanced stage an exercise on how we can provide a home loans fund with a flexible arrangement for suitable mortgages for people in different financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Our general policy on local government was enunciated in our document, &ldquo;Local Government, 1974&rdquo;. We still believe in the concept of that document even though the Minister for Local Government has rejected it out of hand, even perhaps without examination.  Before I leave local government generally, I want to say that I cannot understand, with the normal span of preparing plans for housing, for producing and providing the necessary finance to start, how the Minister for Local Government can still claim credit for the first year, not to mention the first three years, in office of having reached record <Col N="2146" /> figures in house building.  Whatever about this year, he certainly could not claim much credit for what happened in the summer and autumn of 1973 and the spring of 1974.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, in the cross-fire about this subject, the Minister mentioned something about Fianna Fáil taking seven years to complete a scheme and I was reported as having said specifically and categorically that I admitted to being lethargic.  What I was saying was, for the purpose of the argument, assuming we were lethargic, and that it might have taken seven years, was that not an indication that most of the houses built in the first three years of the Minister's regime were planned and financed by Fianna Fáil?  However, I am leaving that aside for the moment.  No doubt, the Minister, having taken notes, will come to it but we will be watching him as he is watching me.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that we have under review the preparation of plans for easier mortgages to facilitate greater home ownership, especially among young people.  We have, too, at an advanced stage an economic plan&mdash;I would say much more advanced than the Government have&mdash;that will chart the way in the late seventies and the eighties for our economy so that the people will know what to aspire to, what the reasonable attainments are and what a Government with unity of purpose think as to how these aims can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Much of what I have said is by no means our final thoughts.  I would like to contrast all this with what the Government have been doing.  I want, for example, to refer specifically to the failure to produce legislation which was specifically promised not just when the Government took office but almost consistently since then. What has become of the legislation on mergers and monopolies?  We were told that the Fianna Fáil proposals were inadequate.  Then the Minister apparently had second thoughts and regarded them as reasonably adequate but needed a little touching up here and there.  We still have not seen any proposals on mergers and monopolies from the Minister for Industry and <Col N="2147" /> Commerce who then appeared to be in such a hurry that he could not get enough legislation out quick enough. I can only say the same about prices. He has not added a line to the legislation on prices that was in existence before he came to office, notwithstanding his criticism of the lack of that kind of legislation as appropriate legislation under Fianna Fáil</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister for Local Government again what has become of the proposed action on the Kenny Report on the acquisition of land for building purposes?  That report is some 2½ years old&mdash;in fact, it is over three years old, now that I come to think of it&mdash;and yet we have not seen any indication of what the Government are thinking in this respect.</P>
    <P>I want to know what has happened to the legislation to deal with the reform proposals on higher education that were also published as far back as 1974.  Where is the specific hospitals plan?  The Minister for Health came into the House with a set of vague proposals, leaving some of the county hospitals still in a state of utter confusion.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the economic plan. When can we expect to see it and in what form?  If it is published by the autumn may I ask how long more will it be before the Green Paper becomes a White Paper?  How long more will it be before industrialists and <i>entrepreneurs</i> and workers can see the way forward for our economy as charted by the Government?  Yet critics who obviously are disillusioned by the performance of this Coalition Government but reluctant to admit it, still keep asking: &ldquo;Where are the Fianna Fáil policies?&rdquo; It is far more relevant and appropriate for them to ask &ldquo;Where are the Government's policies, and where is the legislation to which they were committed?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I need only take specific examples of failure to act in time and in the right way.  I recall again their failure to act at the right time when we proposed the use of the green £, the Government acting eight months too late and causing a reduction <Col N="2148" /> of £30 million in the income of farmers in that period.  It is easy for the Taoiseach to say now that cattle prices are buoyant, but the cattle population is declining, and this is the real test and this is what will have to be remedied in time.  Could I ask him, too, what other remedies or proposals have they in relation to damping down the rate of inflation, damping down or controlling in some way prices to ensure that pay packets will continue in some way to be value for the notes and silver contained in them?</P>
      <P>May I revert to our proposal in the autumn of 1974 of the introduction of subsidies?  In our opinion this could have saved thousands of jobs.  It could have been linked with the pay negotiations then in existence and it could have brought about the necessary period of stability required at the time and could have broken the price and inflation spiral.  But this was not done, perhaps only because Fianna Fáil had proposed it.  The Government neglected their duty, perhaps purely for party political purposes.</P>
      <P>I do not want to continue in this vein.  I have put forward our ideas on how our economy might be produced. I have indicated that we are willing to support the Government in reasonable measures that will tend to maintain the value of pay packets in relation to prices, reasonable measures to contain inflation.  I was amused to hear the Taoiseach say in his list of priorities of policy, that the creation of employment means that we must reduce our rate of inflation, and he continued: &ldquo;So far we have been reasonably successful in this.&rdquo; May I suggest if that is what the Taoiseach describes as success, the worst rate of inflation in Europe, a rate of inflation that bids fair to be double, even treble that which is likely to be operative in Britain in the years ahead, then it is no wonder the country is in the state it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this motion for the adjournment is concerned, we believe it is untimely.  I admit that, like the Government Deputies, we would like holidays as early as possible.  The country knows that a Deputy's work does not commence or end when the <Col N="2149" /> Dáil sits or adjourns, on any day, in any week or in any session.  Fianna Fáil Deputies appreciate as much as Deputies on the Coalition side whatever pleasures a recess of the Dáil can bring.  We like to have the opportunity, as everybody else does, of enjoying the more pleasant days of July and having more time with our families and our friends.  But I regret that with the present specific issues that face the country and the general economic conditions that we have, this is no time to adjourn the Dáil.  There is an amendment standing in my name asking that we do not adjourn on tomorrow at the conclusion of business until the middle of October but that we adjourn until next Wednesday.  By then we will know whether or not there will be agreement on the national pay proposals.</P>
    <P>In this area I want to put one question to the Government.  They found it necessary at the end of last week to introduce in one day a guillotine motion and legislation imposing a wage freeze on bank pay.  I hope there is agreement next Saturday and I have publicly urged with whatever influence I, as Leader of a party representing the electoral affiliations of almost 50 per cent of the country, possess, that they would come to an agreement and accept the proposals. But if they do not and if a free-for-all follows sooner or later, more likely sooner, if a strong union negotiates a settlement which this Government regard as unacceptable, and if at that time we be in recess&mdash;as we apparently will because the Government have the necessary voting strength&mdash; what will the Government do about it?  Will they recall the Dáil to push through again a wage freeze in relation to that union or unions?</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of considerations that this Government must keep before them and from which they appear to be running away.  I repeat that we would enjoy our holidays as much as the Government Deputies would, but we regard the excuse that a three-anda-half months' recess is necessary because that is the time needed for the floor boards in the ante-room to the Seanad to be repaired as flimsy an excuse as the flimsy Government <Col N="2150" /> policies under which the country is operating and declining at present.</P>

It is a matter we could have a long debate on and it has been going on among trade unionists for several weeks.  The <Col N="2151" /> Leader of the Opposition suggested that because there was a substantial increase in the cost of living which would take away all the value of pay increases, he would not blame people for doing certain things.  That more or less counteracts what he suggested when he requested trade unionists to vote for a National Wage Agreement.</P>

      <P>It must surprise those not aware of the way things are run in Parliament to find a group of grown men and women debating whether an adjournment of the House should take place in view of the fact that the adjournment date itself was discussed for some time and agreement was reached as to the hour when it would take place, and the business was ordered accordingly.</P>

This year, with the early <Col N="2153" /> budget and so forth, we have brought it forward, but we have the position today that the adjournment is being contested and there is to be a vote against it tomorrow.  They are perfectly entitled to do it and I am not contesting that it should be done. However, all of us know we want the Dáil to adjourn and we are giving the impression that that is not so.

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition started to tell us what Fianna Fáil's policies were.  I thought I was about to hear their policies even though a few weeks ago I understand he was complaining that he did not want to take them out from under wraps because we might steal them and use them ourselves.  Then I thought there must have been a change of heart and we were now to get the policies Fianna Fáil had hidden away, policies which the think-tank had prepared for them.  There must be nothing in the think-tank during this fine weather except a few minnows which are not surviving.  What he produced here were points he had made at the Ard-Fheis.  Fianna Fáil must realise by now that a great deal of attention was not paid to what he or anybody else said at the Ard-Fheis.  If it had been, Fianna Fáil would not have suffered the electoral defeats they have since suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is simply this.  Fianna Fáil cannot tell us that they have the solution to all the problems when we and the country know that all the time they were in office they did not try to find them.  One of the criticisms which is being levelled at us by the Opposition&mdash;and their members down the country keep repeating it as if this Government had introduced it&mdash;concerns the use of State cars.  To hear some of the Fianna Fáil people talking one would think that this Government invented State cars and that they were never used before.  The second point is State pensions for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  Fianna Fáil act as if we had introduced these pensions, that they had never been introduced before and that none, of the people in the opposite benches was drawing them.  The level at which Fianna Fáil are now attempting to conduct the <Col N="2155" /> debate is so low that it is hardly worth commenting on.  As the Leader of the Opposition said in another context, if one repeats these statements often enough, somebody will believe them. It is not surprising that when this kind of statement is repeated over and over again people get the impression that this Government have done these things when, in fact, they were the practice down through the years and were always carried on.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Deputy Lynch's comment on workers' participation. When did he think of that? This is an important matter which has been operating successfully on the Continent for a number of years.  Why did he not bring out something tangible during his period as Taoiseach?  Why did his Government not do anything about it?  Why did he have to wait until he was out of office before he started throwing out half-baked ideas about what he thought should be done with regard to workers' participation in industry?  Then he tied this up in some way with the republican ideal.  It has been some time since we heard Fianna Fáil using the idea of the republican ideal.  Apparently they are getting back to it again.  On Fianna Fáil election posters we used to read &ldquo;Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It must be very small because it was not to be seen in Ballyfermot or Donegal.  Deputy Lynch was talking about the differing views of the two parties in the Coalition as if there was a big split.  He should remember that there never was such a split as that which occurred in the Fianna Fáil Party some years ago.  At that time we saw what was happening but he, the Taoiseach, did not know what was happening in his own Government.  Since they have been out of office, how many times have there been two wings&mdash;the hawks and the doves&mdash;who are at times hardly talking to each other? Yet, the person who is leading that party had the nerve to suggest that there is a split here because two members of the Coalition were prepared to <Col N="2156" /> offer what could be described as divergent views.  There are two parties in this Coalition.  While we have a unified Government, that does not mean we have to speak with one voice on every subject.  We are entitled to personal opinions on any subject and nobody stops us airing our views on them although Fianna Fáil, in their time, attempted to keep their party in line.

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition wanted to know what was happening to the local government policy which Fianna Fáil introduced in 1974.  I think he meant an earlier date, but I will let that pass.  We have a Local Government Bill almost ready.  I want to repeat that there will be no execution of the 42 small local authorities Fianna Fáil proposed to wipe out.  They can rest assured that as far as I am concerned they will stay and when this legislation passes through the House it will remain for a long time.  Deputy Tunney, usually a very sensible man, will find that there will be quite a number of innovations which will materially assist areas such as the area he represents. I am quite sure when the time comes that he will agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, we have returned to the local authorities local democracy which was taken away bit by bit by Fianna Fáil.  It had reached the stage where they could not sign a letter without first asking the permission of the Custom House.  Those days have gone and they will never return because nobody would accept that it would be right that there should be a directive handed down from central Government for every little thing a local authority want to do.

      <P>We had a comment from Deputy Dowling about the claw-back. The claw-back was introduced when the 1973 purchase scheme was introduced which was much better than the scheme which Fianna Fáil had voted for.  When I changed the system I was requested by the Dublin City Commissioners' deputation and by NATO to put in a proviso which would prevent for five years tenants who had purchased their houses under the new cheap scheme from selling them at a profit.  Fianna Fáil had previously introduced a system for local authority houses throughout the country that not alone would people have to pay one-third of the profit, which is laid out in the claw-back, but one-third of the price they got for the house.  Fianna Fáil supported this scheme and there was no question of objecting to the idea that it was the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was accepted by Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When you thump your breast and talk of a claw-back you should remember that this is the score, and that the claw-back did not gain many votes in Ballyfermot in the last election.  Reference was made to the rents, and today's <i>Times</i> reports that Deputy Dowling said that all local authority rents are being increased as from the 1st July.  This is nonsense.  There are about 108,000 local authority rented dwellings.  Of <Col N="2160" /> these 29,000 are let at fixed rents and none of these will be altered.  The balance, 79,000 houses, are let on differential rents.  Roughly 40 per cent are at rents below the maximum and none of these rents will be increased in July.</P>
      <P>It is possible that some of the 47,500 now on the present maximum of the rents scale will remain on the existing rent scale.  In other words, more than 60,000 tenants out of a 108,000 will not have to pay increased rents from the 1st July.  So far as the adjustment of maximum rents is concerned, this is intended to cater for increases since July, 1973, in the cost of maintenance and management.  This increase was a fundamental part of the new differential scheme introduced by the Coalition in 1973 to replace the grossly unfair scheme imposed by Fianna Fáil which had led to widespread rent strikes by local authority tenants.  The conditions were agreed to by the National Association of Tenants Organisations.  The fact is that tenants have had a three-year period in which maximum rents on existing scales were not increased.  Under Fianna Fáil the maximum was increased every year in many instances.  The Government have been criticised for increasing from 50 to 100 per cent the amount of shortterm unemployment benefit which is assessed for differential rent purposes. This was part of a necessary budgetary move to deal with the intolerable situation in which an unemployed man could often find himself better off than when he was working.  The Leader of the Opposition was very glib here today when he talked about what he called &ldquo;the dole mentality&rdquo;.  He said that it was wrong that people should get more.</P>

      <P>It is easily known that the Deputy is not terribly long in this House.  I remember when in this country we had 135,000 unemployed and Fianna Fáil were in power.  I also remember that when we took over from Fianna Fáil there were almost 70,000 people on the unemployed register and there were between 40,000 and 50,000 people leaving the country every year for Britain.  If you add all that together, you will find that the situation now is not what Fianna Fáil would like to make it out to be.  Certainly, I do not like to see so many people unemployed but if Fianna Fáil were in office not alone would they be unemployed but they would be a lot worse off than they are at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were the people who would ensure that there was no question of people being able to get as much as they could live on. When Fianna Fáil were in power not alone did they literally take the shirts off the backs of the unfortunate council tenants but if they attempted to buy their houses they had to pay replacement value for them.  Deputy Lynch talked about the number of houses which Fianna Fáil were building, that he gave me responsibility for. I would like to point out to him that there was not enough money to build 4,000 local authority houses in the budget which they were preparing when we took over from them.  Deputy Lynch has the nerve to tell us that there were going to be extra houses and that we were simply building not alone what they had prepared but provided the money for.  They were not able to provide the money when they <Col N="2162" /> were in office.  I still have that document which was produced by Fianna Fáil in November, 1972, which talked about the big upsurge there would be in housing and which said that coming up to the 1980s things would have improved so well that we would probably require about 18,000 new houses per year if the country could afford them. Those people have a nerve to talk about a drop-off in any type of building. In addition, we did not hear much today about the rates they were to take off houses.  Do not forget that in the 1972 document, although it was only a couple of months before the election, just as in the election manifesto, there was no reference whatever to rates.  It seems that just three days before the election they thought of it.</P>

    <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Where a spouse purports to convey any interest in the family home, such spouse or a solicitor acting in that behalf shall give notice in writing, by pre-paid registered post, of any such intended conveyance to the other spouse.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to note the intention of the amendment.  We have found in Opposition that it is sometimes quite difficult for us to draft amendments of the purity required by legislation, but I believe that this amendment conveys the intention of <Col N="2163" /> the drafters of it and consequently does not lose its effect even though it may be impure in the drafting sense. We ask that where a spouse purports to convey any interest in the family home, such spouse or a solicitor acting in that behalf shall give notice in writing, by prepaid registered post, of any such intended conveyence to the other spouse.  This section deals specifically with the consent of the spouse, and here we have an absolutely watertight provision offered by the Opposition to ensure that if there are any deals with the family home or the chattels therein, in those circumstances the spouse who purports to deal with it or a solicitor acting on behalf of the spouse shall give notice by registered post to the other spouse.  We believe this is a very reasonable amendment, and if the Minister cannot accept it as drafted we ask him to consider the possibility of working it into section 4 as it stands.  The Minister might like to comment on the proposed amendment in the first instance.  Deputy Collins may also have something to say about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern which inspired this amendment.  In considering it I would recall to Deputies opposite what the Bill provides for.</P>
      <P>It provides that a sale cannot take place without the consent of the other spouse.  The amendment proposes to make the spouse who wishes to sell give to the other spouse notice in writing of the intention to sell.  There is no point in having such a requirement when he cannot sell without the consent of the other spouse.  If he wishes to obtain the consent of the other spouse in order to effect a sale, he has thereby to give notice to the other spouse. The amendment is asking for something which is entirely unnecessary having regard to the structures proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might also only confuse the straightforward and clear policy of the Bill.  The whole point of the protection afforded to a wife by the Bill is that it places the onus on her <Col N="2164" /> husband to obtain her consent as a pre-condition of the validity of the sale, or else to take proceedings under section 4 if she refuses to give her consent.  Once there is a legal obligation to get the consent&mdash; and there cannot be a sale without the consent voluntarily given, or granted by the court&mdash;there is no point in notifying the wife of an intended sale.  The sale cannot take place unless she gives her consent and thereby gets notice when she is asked for her consent.</P>
    <P>I cannot foresee a situation in which her husband would contemplate contravening the provisions of the Bill because, if he were to do so, he would be faced with some daunting obstacles.  First of all, the sale of the home without the wife's consent would be void.  Secondly, he would have committed a serious criminal offence with a penalty of imprisonment up to five years and no maximum fine.  Thirdly, his wife would have the right to seek damages against him.  There are severe sanctions for any husband who might propose to move in contravention of his obligations here.</P>
    <P>In any event, the object of this proposed amendment is to give notice to a wife.  There is already an inherent obligation to do that because he cannot sell unless she has notice to give her consent.  The inspiration for this amendment may have come from the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  They proposed something of that nature in their Report.  That proposal was in the context of a different scheme of protection, a scheme where to get protection the wife would have had to take court proceedings.  Deputies will recall that, when introducing this Bill, I stated that I did not propose such a measure because it would put an onus on the wife to move positively, whereas the remedy put forward in the Bill puts the onus on the husband to seek the wife's consent rather than requiring her to take the initiative in, perhaps, a sensitive family situation.</P>
    <P>If that scheme were being proposed there would be some point in <Col N="2165" /> the amendment but, having regard to the protection provided by the Bill, I suggest to Deputies on the other side of the House that, while I sympathise with the motive behind the amendment, it is completely unnecessary in the context of section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that the Minister has correctly interpreted section 4 and we welcome section 4.  Nevertheless the amendment is far clearer than the section as drafted.  We do not believe the amendment would upset the section. It would make it far clearer.  As the Minister does not propose to accept the amendment, and as we have very limited time at our disposal having regard to the agreement between the Whips, it would be rather pointless to pursue it.  We believe we are right.  The Minister believes we are right also.  He believes the point is adequately covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 23, after &ldquo;the other spouse&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to enable a court in making an order under section 5 subsection (2) to direct the order in appropriate cases not only <Col N="2166" /> against the husband but also against a third party.  For example, where a third party has been in collusion with the husband so as to bring about the loss of the home, or has taken any action to render it uninhabitable, an order may be made against the third party under the subsection just as it may be made against him under subsection (1) of section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a wide section and gives quite severe and wide powers of redress against the husband.  The amendment is to make it even wider still and to ensure that a third party would be brought in.  We will be relying to a large extent on the discretion of the courts, but the courts already have a wide discretion in the area of prohibiting something in the general area of injunctions, even though the strict jurisdiction in regard to injunctions does not apply to the District Courts. It is necessary to extend the scope of the section so as to take in third parties who might be in collusion with husbands. The very fact that it will be there will be a deterrent against wouldbe transgressors of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the thinking behind the ministerial amendments.  I have one or two questions on the section.  The Minister will only too readily recognise and realise that, if a spouse believes the condition of the family home is being deliberately run down by the other spouse, she knows she has a remedy at her disposal, but at a cost.  I know we could not propose an amendment which would impose a cost on the Exchequer.  The point is, if a spouse has not got the wherewithal or the ready cash to go to court to get the other spouse to keep the house in a habitable condition, the thinking behind the section which is good and sound thinking will be wishful thinking unless the person has recourse to legal aid.</P>

      <P>Yes, because a dwelling is defined in subsection (2) of section 2 as &ldquo;any building, or any structure, vehicle or vessel (whether mobile or not).&rdquo; As regards the other point Deputy Collins raised, it is the old argument that the remedies provided here are to some extent unreal remedies in the absence of legal aid.  I do not accept that.  It has a certain validity in that certain people may be inhibited from going to law because of the fear of having to pay costs, but in the case of a wronged spouse&mdash;we are talking again in terms of wives&mdash;I cannot ever see a situation where a wife with a genuine action would fail to get legal advice and legal assistance to bring her case to court.  The legal people will realise that, except in a very rare case where it might be shown that the action was totally unworthy, the costs would be awarded against the husband, who presumably would be able to bear them.  In the odd case where that might not happen, and I am sure Deputy Andrews will bear me out when I say that I do not think any <Col N="2169" /> person would be deprived of a remedy.  Again I think it would be wrong to criticise the section on those grounds if the section is inherently good in itself.  If the principle is right, we should welcome it and look forward to the day when the other area in regard to legal aid can be attended to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a4a:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 6, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1)  The Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government, shall direct all local authorities and any other individuals, bodies or institutions, whether public or private, engaged in the sale or disposal, or otherwise, of family homes, to register such homes in the joint names, as joint tenants, of the spouses who take lawful occupation of those premises.</P>
      <P>(2)  No stamp duty, land registration fee, registry of deeds fee or court fee, shall be payable on any transaction the subject matter of subsection (1) above.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically what we would like to see here is that the tenancies of houses, for instance, local authority houses and, in particular, houses under the purchase scheme of local authorities, would be joint tenancies in the names of the married couple.  If this were done in the initial stages in regard to local authority houses, it would prevent anything going wrong at a later stage. <Col N="2170" /> When this Bill becomes law, to communicate its contents to all the people of the country will be a tremendous job, and seeing that the local authorities are so much involved in housing as it is, perhaps they have an important part to play here, as of course have, as stated in the amendment, other bodies or institutions; I am thinking of building societies and so on.  I think this amendment would be a valuable addition to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to clear the administrative consequences of the amendment.  It would involve the Minister for Justice in decisions relating to matters falling within the scope of the Minister for Local Government and, conversely, would involve the Minister for Local Government in decisions relating to matters which would be outside his sphere of responsibility.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the amendment would make it compulsory for the Minister for Justice to make a direction in regard to joint ownership.  This would be unnecessarily complex.  If we were going to do that it could be done in a simpler legal manner.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the amendment discriminates between homes that are subject to a mortgage and homes where there is no mortgage.  That would be socially and legally rather drastic.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most serious objection to it is that it would, in effect, impose compulsory joint ownership irrespective of the wishes of the spouses.  I indicated on Second Stage that at this juncture I could not propose a system of compulsory joint ownership.  It is a very complex social and legal matter and is something that will require much debate and analysis.  I would like to see a fair amount of public discussion on the merits of it and not just on the emotions of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of the Bill is to encourage voluntary joint ownership.  The Bill protects wives against vindictive sales by husbands, so in that provision it achieves one of the consequences of joint ownership.  I believe there should be joint ownership between husband and wife, and this practice is growing. The majority of new dwellings being registered in the Land Registry are <Col N="2171" /> being registered in the joint names of the husband and wife, and this is a good thing.  That trend will be accelerated by virtue of the provisions in the Bill exempting such transfers in the future from stamp duty, registration and other fees.</P>
    <P>The prohibition against vindictive sales, which is the evil we set out to cure, is fully achieved in the Bill.  There is also strong and practical encouragement towards voluntary joint ownership. What the amendment proposes is compulsory joint ownership.  This is too extreme and goes beyond the scope of the Bill.  Such a step should not be contemplated until the matter has been thoroughly debated here and in public and parties that have a view on the matter have made their views known. It is a matter which, in the context of Women's Year, has been advanced quite frequently but not advanced on the basis of detailed analytical argument. Instead it has been advanced, I think it is not unfair to say, with a certain amount of subjectivity.  The entire question needs objective analysis.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily opposed to the idea but have not, as yet, heard convincing arguments for it.  Interference with the legal rights of the parties and with the social relationships of the parties, which would be implicit in imposing compulsory joint ownership, would not be justified now.  The evil that has resulted from not having joint ownership, namely, vindictive sales by one party without the consent or against the wishes of the other, is covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes the abolition of stamp duty and fees where a home has been purchased in the joint names of the spouses.  It would be a matter for the Exchequer to decide such things.  I am proposing in the Bill that, where the home has already been bought by one spouse and he proposes to transfer it into the joint names, in the case of voluntary transfer, where there is no consideration passing, this should be exempt from stamp duty. There would not be any financial implications for the Exchequer in that provision because one must presume that those transfers would not have <Col N="2172" /> taken place at all so one encourages something to take place which would not have taken place and there is no loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In the case of local authority tenancies to create a compulsory joint tenancy in the tenancy would give the wife no greater protection against her husband than she has at present because section 3 of the Bill provides that her husband will not be entitled to surrender his tenancy without her consent. I would not be agreeable, for those reasons, to accepting this amendment. It is a very far-reaching provision and it goes against the policy of the Bill which is (a) providing against vindictive sales and (b) at this stage to encourage voluntary joint ownership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows well that since the introduction of this Bill into the House our party have accepted the principles of the Bill, that vindictive sales be a thing of the past, that they be outlawed as and from now and that we would encourage joint ownership of property in an effort to help the couples involved.  I appreciate the arguments of the Minister against the amendment.  The strongest argument put forward by him is that we are introducing a degree of compulsion into something which we are trying to encourage along the way. We are delighted that the rights of the female spouse are protected right through the Bill even if in the case of a local authority house she is not included in the vesting order.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will appreciate that this amendment is a sign of our over-zealousness to protect the spouse and to make sure she has the full protection of the law of this land at all times.  Would the Minister consider that when local authorities make every year many hundreds of vesting orders of local authority housing they might explain to the tenant who is being vested with a title to a council house the value of having the house in both their names?  The Minister might consider that and perhaps he might be in a position to do something about it at a later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good idea. I will certainly draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government to it.  If he were to issue a circular to all local authorities directing them in the application form they send out to tenants to draw their attention to the desirability of having it in joint ownership it might help.  I understand it is the practice at the moment in Dublin and some other local authorities to give joint tenancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all happy about the Minister's reply. Our spokesman on Justice has articulated the matter very well. I agree with all he has said with one or two slight reservations.  I say that with the greatest respect.  The Minister said he cannot accept this amendment on a number of grounds. He said that the administrative problems involved would be considerable. I would not accept that as a matter of fact.  This amendment merely calls on the local authorities. Once the direction is made to the local authorities by the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government, that is an end to the affair.  The direction is made and the process is put into being and effectively the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government retire from the operation altogether.  Consequently, it will be a local authority administrative problem.  That is my view in relation to the suggestion that the matter would be administratively unmanageable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made the case that the amendment in some way discriminates against homes with mortgages and homes that do not have them.  It is very difficult to follow the Minister's line of argument in that respect.  He has wide legal experience and consequently there is no point in beating that point to death.  He is quite right in what he said about the element of compulsion.  I would be ruthless about having it compulsory.  I have no doubt it is the proper thing to do, tomorrow and in a year's time and that it certainly will be <Col N="2174" /> acceptable in ten years' time.  I believe it is proper that there should be compulsory registration, at the moment of marriage between two human beings, of the roof over their heads.  That house should be registered compulsorily in their joint names.</P>
    <P>We know when a couple get married they are full of joy, love and all the things proper to a couple getting married.  Let us clear the decks in relation to the argument on divorce and all the rest of it. The vast majority of marriages in the country are solid marriages but there are human beings who, after a couple of years, cannot live together.  It is those circumstances and those human beings we have to take into account.  We are grossly hypocritical in the House by not recognising that situation in the country.  It is about time we did and it is about time the Minister saw that this particular amendment stating that the property should be registered in the joint names of the spouses is the proper answer to a problem which may never arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this only happens in a minority of cases, but we have to apply the law equally to all.  The law must be as good for A as it is for Z and it must deal with all classes and all income groups in our society on an equal basis.  It must also provide for a situation where a marriage breaks down.  It is on those grounds that I strongly urge the Minister to take the view that the time to register the property in the joint names of the married couple is at the date of marriage, no sooner and no later.  Even in the face of criticism of all the people who from one time or another have fashionable points of view I would express that view.  If it is to come to me I will demand my view against it.  It is an unshiftable view, and all the arguments that can be put up against it I would find difficult to accept.  This is not to suggest that one is inflexible in relation to another's point of view, quite the contrary.  But this is one aspect of <Col N="2175" /> this Bill which I have worked out to its logical conclusion, and I feel very strongly about it.  It is about time we stopped shilly-shallying about the fact that there is a suggestion of compulsion in this. Of course, there is a suggestion of compulsion in it.  There is no question or doubt about that. The Minister makes the point that this might not be the time to introduce it but that his mind is open in relation to it and he would like to have a public debate on the subject.</P>
    <P>The time for public debate on this sort of thing is over.  We have had a public debate for the last few years and this is the culmination of one aspect of family law reform. It is piecemeal legislation but, nevertheless, necessary.  We know what we want.  We are getting legislation relating to the vast area of family law which requires to be reformed. It is only one scintilla of that. We recognise it as such.  Nevertheless, in relation to the point Deputy Collins has so well made and I am making, the time for talking has stopped and my view is that the amendment as it stands, even if as is suggested it does introduce a compulsory element should be accepted.</P>
    <P>It would also do away with the very thing the Bill provides for, the case of a vindictive sale.  If the property is registered in the joint names of the spouses at the date of marriage, then the question of a vindictive sale at any time in the future would never arise in any circumstances because the position is copper-fastened at the very beginning of a very happy period in two people's lives, at the time they get married.  Then is the time to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has no doubt about his position.  He is completely in favour of compulsory joint ownership.  He says that when they get married that is the time for them to be required to place the home in joint ownership.  But suppose they do not buy the house at the time of their marriage?  Suppose five years afterwards the husband has left his wife or is misbehaving <Col N="2176" /> and she buys a house out of her own means, her own fortune, to protect herself and her children, is it right then that automatically a deserting or misbehaving husband should have a half-share in the house?  I mention that as one of the considerations.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to invoking compulsory joint ownership.  That is a practical difficulty and not an unusual one.  Deputy Andrews is talking about marriage and the happiness at that time, but unfortunately we know some marriages do not keep on the straight and narrow and that they go astray. There are many marriages where the couple do not buy the house at the time of marriage.  They might not be able to buy the house until some years afterwards when the situation between them might be vastly changed.  Is one spouse, the deserving spouse, then to be lumbered with joint ownership with another spouse who is not pulling his or her weight?</P>

      <P>Or is this another simple matter that is to be made an exception of in the legislation?  These are two serious practical difficulties in respect of what Deputy Andrews proposes.  We are losing sight all the time of what this Bill does.  This Bill protects the wife from a vindictive sale, and this is possibly what is behind the thinking calling for compulsory joint ownership, to ensure that the family home will not be sold over the heads of the wife and children.  This Bill completely secures that position.  To go then into the area of compulsory joint ownership raises many difficulties. I have given two very practical examples.  Deputy Andrews's answer is, &ldquo;Oh, you will draft your way <Col N="2178" /> out of them&rdquo;.  It might not be such a simple matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is a simple matter, but having made the argument and the Minister having answered it, fair enough.  We have also a plank in the amendment to the stamp duty.  That was imported from section 13 of the Act, and obviously the first part of the amendment is unacceptable to the Minister.  He certainly has not changed my point of view in relation to his well-made argument, but I assume that on the basis of the unacceptability of the first part of the amendment the second part falls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained with regard to the second part of it what is proposed is that in the case of certain purchases, where a house is being purchased in the joint names, it should be exempt from stamp duty.  This is a matter that would have Exchequer implications.  It would be for the Minister for Finance to decide to waive stamp duty on such purchases.  It is not analogous to what is being proposed in section 13.  Section 13 is to with cases where the house has already been purchased by one spouse, and the intention is to transfer it into the joint names of the spouses.  Section 13 is to ease the transfer in such cases and to encourage this by removing the stamp duty and other registration fees.  There would be virtually no loss to the Exchequer under section 13 because presumably the vast majority of those transfers would not take place otherwise. That is the distinction between the two proposals.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>In page 4, after line 56, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;() In considering whether to adjourn the proceedings under this section and, if so, for what period and on what terms they should be <Col N="2179" /> adjourned, the court shall have regard in particular to whether the spouse of the mortgagor or lessee has been informed (by or on behalf of the mortgagee or lessor or otherwise) of the non-payment of the sums in question or of any of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion made in this area by the Women's Representative Committee who wrote to me about the Bill.  They thought that there should be a legal obligation on the mortgagee to inform a wife that her husband has defaulted so that she might move as early as possible to exercise her rights under section 6 and that she would not be coming to exercise her rights when arrears would have reached such dimensions that it would be impossible for her to do anything about them.</P>
    <P>I have considered that suggestion, but there would be substantial difficulties in the way of imposing a legal obligation on the mortgagee or a lessor. To make it effective you must provide a sanction and what sanction can be provided without in some way inhibiting lending institutions from advancing money for home purchase to the detriment of the general body of couples seeking to buy a home?</P>
    <P>What I have done in the amendment is to give the court power, in considering its attitude on how long an adjournment will be given, to enable the wife to catch up on the arrears.  If a landlord or a mortgagee had been slow and as a result there was a substantial accumulation of arrears, the court could grant a longer period of an adjournment. On the other hand, if they had given prompt notice, presumably the court would not be as lenient in regard to the payment of arrears. This, in effect, is an incentive to a mortgagee or a landlord to give early notice so that the wife can move immediately.</P>

      <P>The situation envisaged by the Deputy is one where a wife takes over the mortgage payments and commences payment to the lending institution.  This Bill would not give her any right to a particular share in the house but she could apply under the Married Women's Status Act for a declaration of her interest in the house and the court would decide what her interest would be having regard to what she had paid.  It could make an order for payment in regard to the portion belonging to the wife which she could apply towards the purchase of another dwelling, but the court could not guarantee to her a sufficient amount with which to buy another house because the husband's interest would still subsist.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We received a communication from FLAC in relation to this Bill.  We have paid tribute to the work being done by them and we look forward to a continuation of that good work They make a point in their submission in relation to section 7:</P>
      <P>As regards section 7 we are not convinced of the efficacy of this section as it now stands.  It does show some desire, however, to deal with a problem that arises regularly.</P>
      <P>Example: A husband is not paying off the instalments on the mortgage on the family home, and thus the lending institution is seeking an order for sale.  The wife attends the court on the day and states that her husband will not pay the instalments but that she would be able to do so but she is unwilling to do this as she will not obtain any concrete interest in the house but only a vague hope of having her interest determined under section 12 Married Women's Status Act, 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2181" /> We feel that there are many wives who are able and often willing to take over the mortgage repayments on the family home, but we feel that greater incentives and encouragement should be given rather than just an adjournment of proceedings.  We think that the court should be given the power to determine the interest of the wife in the property when she has paid off the mortgage instalments, having regard to the payment of the mortgage debt and also any other contribution either financial or nonfinancial, direct or indirect, that the wife has made to the family home. This could be adequately done under section 8 where the court may make an order and declaration when the arrears and periodical payments have been completed.  This would get rid of the necessity of taking new proceedings under section 12 Married Women's Status Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>However, while there are certainly a number of wives capable of paying off mortgage repayments, a still greater number would not be in such a happy frame.  As one observer has put it, &ldquo;the legal freedom given by the Bill is not warranted by the economic situation&rdquo;. It is inconceivable that a deserted wife with, perhaps, a young family would have the financial resources to pay off the arrears and that even if this were the case, that she would be accepted as a viable mark by the building society in taking over the repayments.  The Bill completely disregards the people in this unhappy situation and does nothing to help them.</P>
    <P>If that is so, is not the Bill defective in this respect?  Those people do this work on a voluntary basis, though with a Government subvention.  The Minister is a democrat who may agree with us on many occasions but after a fair hearing he can do his best to overturn an argument.</P>

      <P>The submission is guilty of one serious misstatement, and it is a pity.  It states that the Bill &ldquo;completely disregards the people in this unhappy situation and does nothing to help them&rdquo;.  That is wrong.  If <Col N="2182" /> the authors of the report had read the Bill, they would see that a building society must accept the wife's payment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews criticised the Bill because FLAC stated that it completely disregards people in this unhappy situation.  I am pointing out that they have based that on a misreading or a non-reading of the Bill.  They do their work with the aid of a Government subvention which was first given in 1973.  This had been consistently refused up to that time.  It was increased since then to £11,000.  The most valuable work they can do is to provide legal aid.</P>

      <P>Deputies are forgetting when they talk of this as piecemeal legislation&mdash;I have heard this adjective used before&mdash;that it represents a staged programme of family law reform.  The alternative would have been to wait for an omnibus measure until we were grey old men. I make that point in the context that the submission by FLAC under section 7 ignores or forgets that under the Maintenance Act a wife is also entitled to take proceedings against her husband for maintenance, and obtain from him sufficient money to meet his liabilities, including the liability of providing shelter for the family.  Under section 5 of this Bill, if his conduct in failing to pay the mortgage arrears endangers the family home, he can be sued for damages.  There is wide-ranging protection for the wife which has been overlooked by FLAC in reading the Bill and consequently their submission on section 7&mdash;and I regret to say this&mdash;is essentially invalid.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment of this Bill.  I do not want to repeat myself, but very few house-bound housewives, women who do not earn incomes, are in a position to take over mortgage repayments. I think the Minister was making the case that an adjournment would be allowed until the facts were sorted out, but there could be a great deal of difficulty for a wife in such a situation.  While it may not be the function of the Minister for Justice or of this Bill, there should be a more co-ordinated service in future to assist women who are in this situation. As most of these women have no income and no resources to draw upon, State aid should be available to help them.  The fact that a woman is getting social welfare should be taken into account when she is trying to pay off a mortgage on the family house.</P>
      <P>Now we come to an allowance for taxation.  Presumably the husband is claiming the mortgage repayments on his tax.  I am not quite sure how the wife is fixed in such a case.  No matter how long a wife pays off a mortgage, she will never be the legal owner.  It could happen that a wife had reared her children and now that she is alone she might not be able, or want, to keep the family home.  She might want to dispose of it and live in smaller accommodation, maybe a flat. She will always be prevented from doing that even though it might not be possible to trace her husband. These are problems for the future, perhaps, but it must be said that they exist now.</P>
      <P>A Family Law Bill covers such an enormous area and draws on so many agencies of State that no one Bill of this nature could solve all the problems. In the very near future some effort should be made to give the wife legal entitlement to the house to which she has made such a contribution. There is a tendency to completely disregard the services a woman gives in the home because her contribution is not of a monetary nature.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that much is being done, a great deal still remains to be done in the area of family law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond raised the point of the giving of notice.  I explained earlier that it was not possible to provide a specific legal obligation because of the difficulties in providing the sanction to enforce this.  What we have done is to give power to the court to take into consideration the time at which a building society, insurance company or landlord brought the commencement of arrears to the notice of the wife so that she could move at an early stage. They might find themselves prejudiced if they were slow in giving notice.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether a wife will be able to take over the mortgage payments, that is quite separate from the Bill.  All we can do here is provide that she may do so.  We cannot give her the money to do it.  That matter will have to be determined by her own situation or, possibly, with State aid, but this, as Deputy Desmond says, is completely outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The third question is the legal position of the wife in regard to the home. Under the Married Women's Status Act she can bring an application to have her share in the home determined, having regard to the number and amount of repayments made. That will differ in each individual case.  Whether it is in her interest to take these proceedings or whether she wants to do so, is a matter for her. Her prime concern, and that of the Bill, is to ensure that there will be a roof over her head and the heads of her children.</P>

      <P>On the point I raised earlier, I would like to give the Minister a specific example.  A husband deserted his middle-aged wife&mdash;they had no children.  He went to England and was living with another woman. The wife could not finish the payments although she was awarded the <Col N="2185" /> residence of the house.  It would be a good thing if there was a section which allowed the court in such circumstances to award her the house because if she sells it she is only allowed keep half the money.  She cannot buy another accommodation with that amount of money but if she got all the money she could buy a smaller house.  She is not working, perhaps she has never worked, and has no skill or trade.  That type of person is very vulnerable.  How can she be protected?  Is there no way in which the court can use its discretion and say: &ldquo;The husband has not even bothered to appear in court, the entire house is yours.  Since you have no way of maintaining the mortgage payments you can sell the house and buy a smaller place with the money you get from that sale&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the husband has deserted and gone to England, he can be proceeded against in England through the courts here.  All the wife has to do is go to our courts and take out maintenance proceedings which will be enforced in England against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but we cannot provide for that.  If he cannot be found and the house is subject to a mortgage, and the wife is not able to meet the mortgage repayments&mdash;I dealt with the problem on Second Stage&mdash;we have to ask if we are going to allow the insurance company or building society to realise the mortgage, or prohibit them from ever realising the mortgage as long as the wife chooses to stay in the house?  If you are going to put a provision in the law that a lending institution could never realise its mortgage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I am asking.  Could the court not at its discretion award the house in its entirety so that she could sell it instead of having to give half to her missing husband, or lodge half with the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a mortgage on the house it would be wrong for the law to interfere with the mortgagee's <Col N="2186" /> rights of sale when no repayments are being made.  Where repayments are being made or are likely to be made, this Bill interferes and does not allow the mortgagee to sell the house.  In other cases, the mortgagee has to be entitled to realise his security.  If we in any way inhibited that right, the lending of money by building societies would become very precarious and there would be less of it.  We have to keep that in mind.  The situation could arise where the wife is half owner of the house already, or where she has paid sufficient of the mortgage for the court to declare that she is entitled to a half share in the house.  In these circumstances, she can have the half share, but the court could not be given discretion to confiscate the other half share.  That is in effect what the Deputy is asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am asking.  In the case of the husband disappearing off the scene completely and the wife has no other income other than the deserted wife's allowance, how can she continue to repay the house?  Naturally the building society will demand its payments. They are entitled to them, but she cannot pay.  Supposing they repossess the house which may have cost £7,000 and give her £3,000 what can she do? She cannot buy shelter for that.</P>

That submission is as true as the day when it was placed on the submission paper we received from them.  The Minister only took the second half of this statement and dismissed the conclusion of the submission on the basis of the last half of the remarks by FLAC.  The Minister did not deal with the main burden of their argument which concludes at the beginning of the sentence.  It is inconceivable that a deserted wife with perhaps a young family would <Col N="2187" /> have the financial resources to pay off the arrears.  There are two legs to the latter part of the submission.  The Minister has taken the last leg and dismissed the whole submission out of hand.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments have three purposes.  Firstly, they are designed specifically to ensure that in proceedings referred to in section 7 of the Bill, where a mortgagee or a landlord is seeking an order for possession or sale of a home, the court or either party to the proceedings will be able to join the wife as party to the proceedings.  This could be necessary in order to establish whether she would be in a position to take over the mortgage or the rental payments and pay off the arrears.  Secondly, the amendments are designed to ensure generally that third parties may be joined in proceedings under the Bill. For example, a third party who was acting in collusion with a husband might be joined.  This can arise in proceedings under section 5.  Thirdly, the amendments set out the general principle that proceedings under the Bill are to be heard in private.  However, in relation to proceedings where a mortgagee or a landlord is seeking an order for possession or sale of the home, amendment No. 7 proposes that these proceedings are to be in private only where each of the spouses is a party to them.  Otherwise the court would have to hold ordinary proceedings by a mortgagee or a landlord against a husband in private although the wife had no interest in those proceedings and such proceedings would not involve husband-wife relationships.  They would be ordinary actions by the mortgagee against a borrower or landlord against a tenant, and there is no reason why the present law should not continue to apply to them.  Once the wife becomes a party the proceedings will be held in private because they become matrimonial <Col N="2190" /> proceedings.  The amendment is to ensure that, where there is only one spouse and the proceedings are normal repossession proceedings, they will be held in the normal way in public.</P>

      <P>In relation of the joinder of parties, any person who may have an interest in the proceedings may be joined, by service upon him of a third party notice, by an existing party to the proceedings or by the direction of the court.  The section itself deals with the registration of a notice of marriage and the registry deed is mentioned here.  I presume a similar situation would arise in regard to the non-registry.  In regard to an ordinary search in the ordinary course of events there would be no such thing as a marriage registered by somebody.  Would the Minister be in a position to enlighten me in relation to the practical approach here?  Is it incumbent on a person, a solicitor acting for someone, to check to see whether or not they are actually married?  Does the Minister envisage in a situation like this, that when a person realises, or when a solicitor acting for someone realises, that there is a marriage from general knowledge does he advise that the wife and husband will join in a deed <Col N="2191" /> of conveyance, deed of transfer and so on?  Do I make myself clear?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To avoid confusion, amendment No. 8 will, in effect, be a new section and has nothing to do with section 11.  It is merely inserted before section 11.  On the question of what searches are to be made by the conveyancer taking the title, I refer the Deputy to the Conveyancing Act, 1882, which says that a purchaser shall not be prejudicially affected by notice of any instrument&mdash;in other words a purchaser will not be prejudiced by the existence of a marriage &mdash;unless it is (a) within his own knowledge or would have come to his knowledge if such inquiries and inspections had been made as ought reasonably to have been made by him, or, (b) in the same transaction with respect to which a question of notice to the purchaser arises, it has come to the knowledge of his counsel or of his solicitor or other agent, or would have come to the knowledge of the solicitor or other agent if such inquiries or inspections had been made as ought reasonably to have been made by the solicitor or other agent.</P>
      <P>However, by virtue of the new section 3 (7) of the Bill, which has been introduced by amendment, if there is actual knowledge by reason of local knowledge independent of the transaction in question, this must be taken into account by the conveyancer taking the title.  He must ensure that where the vendor is a married person the other spouse joins in the conveyance.</P>
      <P>As to the type of inquiries to be made, I think normal conveyancing practice would decree that the requisitions should be so framed as to elicit this information.  The purchaser would possibly call for a statutory declaration or take other steps to protect his title.  If the normal conveyancing practices are observed the purchaser will acquire a good title and, provided the sale is for full value, he will not be prejudiced by the subsequent revelation of a marriage, even though the spouse did not join in the transfer.</P>

      <P>We appreciate and recognise that our amendment is out of order.  We felt that it would be ruled out of order because of our experience with a similar type of amendment to previous family legislation. Can the Minister himself enshrine this type of intent in legislation?  I appreciate that we are bound by the rules <Col N="2193" /> of order and cannot import into legislation amendments which would place a charge on the Exchequer, but could the Minister, if he so wished, insert this type of amendment into legislation prepared by himself?  Without making a political point out of it, I think the Minister will agree that the free legal aid situation in civil matters has reached a very sorry <i>impasse.</i> The situation is very serious and almost dangerous because of the fact that this dispute continues and people are being deprived of proper representation.</P>

      <P>One aspect of the Bill causes me concern.  Unfortunately, I was not aware on the last occasion that the first two sections had been dealt with and that the Committee Stage was in progress.  It is a matter that I think must concern the Minister and everybody in the country.  It is the definition of &ldquo;married couple&rdquo;.  I had in mind an amendment to define &ldquo;married couple&rdquo;.  People might think that suggestion crazy but no longer are married couples&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily married as such.  I am not talking about that aspect of it, but there are people who have married in various religions, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and so on. There are also people who have been divorced in another state, remarried in another state and have come to live here.  One wonders whether the Bill provides for that provision and also whether it provides for the situation which exists to a growing extent in this country where actual marriages that have been solemnised in the Catholic religion are subsequently annulled by the church that consecrated these marriages.  Consequently, those marriages are annulled in the eyes of the church but the State does not recognise the validity of the church annulment.  A married couple are separated by the church that married them and, by definition of separation, their marriage no longer exists but so far as the State is concerned those people are living bigamously.  That is a situation of gross hypocrisy.  The Minister in Strasbourg, or Luxembourg, three or four weeks ago said he would be dealing with the whole question of contraception and divorce in some legislation or referendum in the not too distant future.  Could we get some information in respect of the Minister's statement which was made abroad?  My view is that such a statement should be made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point of my argument relates to the question of married couples and this concerns me.  My definition of &ldquo;married couple&rdquo;, in addition to the accepted norms, would be to include those persons who had <Col N="2195" /> been divorced and remarried according to the laws of another State or those persons who had been divorced according to the laws of another State and married in the State or those persons who have been remarried in the State.  Does the Bill take cognisance of those people?  If it does not, by the laws of logic&mdash;and laws are not all about logic&mdash;this Bill discriminates against the people I have mentioned. There is a lot of humbug and hypocrisy surrounding this question, and the sooner we deal with this situation and end the uncertainty from everybody's point of view the better. There would be a national sigh of relief if we had leadership in this regard. That is all we want.</P>

      <P>The Deputy reported me as saying something I did not say. This habit he has of attributing statements without having the record right is not one to be commended.  A married couple in the Bill means, obviously, a couple married legally in so far as the laws of the country are concerned.  The laws of this country, of course, would recognise the rules of private international law regarding the recognition of divorce.  Whatever that may be in regard to the marriage in question is what the law pertaining to that marriage would be and nothing else.</P>

      <P>The Government have made reference&mdash;this is something one does not like to talk about too much in public because it may give rise to apprehension on the part of some people&mdash;to the possible unconstitutionality of some part or parts of the 1952 Act.  Apparently danger of that is apprehended because there is talk of a referendum at some future date to rectify any possible unconstitutionality of the 1952 Act and, if that is so, does not the danger of such unconstitutionality apply also to this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The danger apprehended has to do with the exercise of judicial functions by the Board. Section 5 is designed to shut the door on all possible challenges under the Adoption Acts, but it cannot shut the door on people who exercise that challenge under the guise of constitutionality and so there may have to be a referendum to deal with that particular problem.  But it is a particular problem.  In general, there is no apprehension in regard to what is proposed in section 2, but that is not to say some person might not take a constitutional case under section 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to everything, and not just to section 2, under the parent Act and all amending Acts. May I say it is only a point of view with regard to the 1952 Act and the presumption is in favour of its being constitutional.  It would have to be attacked and I do not even know if it is going to be attacked.  Apprehensions in this whole area have been strengthened by what has happened and our anxiety is to close every possible door, even to the extent of hypothetical apprehensions, and it is in that context the constitutional change by referendum has been mentioned. I take Deputy O'Malley's point but, if we were to try to deal with that point, we would be looking questioningly at everything done under all the Acts so far and that is, I think, something we should avoid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to future cases and it is designed to provide for certain changes in adoption procedure, primarily with a view to enabling the board to maintain substantially its present practice of not checking back with the mother at the last moment before the adoption order is made.  It proposes that every person whose consent to the making of an adoption order is necessary and is being given shall be informed that her consent may be withdrawn at any time before the making of the order and that she is entitled to be heard on an application for the order.  She may indicate in writing her wishes as to whether or not she should be informed of the date on which the board would be willing to hear her or as to whether she wants to be consulted <Col N="2201" /> again.  Where she does not wish to be so informed or consulted it will not be necessary to contact her again but, in any other case, the board will have to ensure that she is informed or consulted and, if she cannot be found, the board will deal with the application as if the consent were not forthcoming. The idea here is to provide a legal process at a fairly early stage whereby the consenting person&mdash;I understand this is what most mothers who consent to adoption would want&mdash;may opt out of the adoption process at a fairly early stage.  If the mother says she wishes to be consulted again then she must be consulted again.  If she says she does not wish to be consulted again there is no obligation on the board to consult her again.  They might voluntarily decide to do that but I doubt very much if they would so decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Potentially if a natural mother so wished she could appear at the hearing that led to the making of the adoption order.  It has never been the practice for the natural mother to be there at the time or to be told of the date or place where it was proposed to make the order.  It is normal practice for the child and the adoptive parents to be present at the hearing that leads to the making of the order.  It would be a very unsatisfactory situation if the natural mother were to be present at the same time or in the same place as the adoptive parents.  Will the Minister state if it can be so arranged that the hearing for the purpose of the order would be held, perhaps, at two different times and in two different places if it were a case where the natural mother exercised her right to appear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy that it would be unsatisfactory. In fact, it would be contrary to all proper adoption procedures for the parties to be in an adversary situation at an adoption hearing.  This will not be done; the mother will not be present when the adoptive parents and the child are present.  If the mother wants to be heard, she can be heard by the board on a separate occasion.  That is what is meant by the <Col N="2202" /> section.  There can be different stages and different periods for dealing with the application.  It does not all have to happen on the same afternoon, on the same day or, even, in the same week.  However, I imagine the matter would be dealt with speedily once it is started.  It would be quite in order for the mother to be heard one day and the adoptive parents two or three days afterwards or they could both be heard at different times and in different places on the same day.  It would not be the practice of the board to have the parties together.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that while this provision probably was unavoidable in the circumstances it will create serious administrative difficulties.  For one thing, the same committee of the board will have to hear the natural mother and the adoptive parents.  Obviously, all the members of the board do not sit at all hearings; they could not do this, particularly as they hold many of their hearings outside Dublin.  Is there any way of avoiding that kind of difficulty?  Is it likely to give rise to further problems?</P>

      <P>We do not anticipate administrative difficulties nor do we anticipate that there will be many applications by mothers to be heard. Even if there are, we do not think it will give rise to administrative difficulties. It will be possible for the board to hear the mother separately and distinct from the other party to the application.  It is a matter of administration that will have to be overcome because we are satisfied that the provision in the Bill is the best way to deal with the problem.  Possibly it has to be dealt with in this way by virtue of what the Supreme Court said in some of their <i>obiter dicta.</i></P>

      <P>This section proposes that the board may request and authorise any organisation or person, whether in or outside the State, of whose suitability the board are satisfied, to make inquiries on their behalf. The board shall be entitled to accept and rely on the report of such organisation for the purpose of satisfying themselves that every person whose consent is necessary has given the consent and understands the nature of the consent and of the adoption order.  The idea is that the board will make contact with the mother in all cases, either through their officers or another agency.  The information that is elicited by virtue of that inquiry can be accepted by the board to satisfy them that consent has been given and that the nature of the consent has been understood.</P>

Naturally, the board have to act through agents in many of their <Col N="2204" /> activities and this will be an extension of that procedure.  The Deputy will note that the section says that the person from whom the board seeks this information must be a person whom the board consider suitable for the purpose.  Obviously, the board will not ask any casual bystander or any casual person to make such an inquiry.  The board must know that the person is suitable and, consequently, must have hard information to satisfy them that the person is suitable. Obviously, inquiries will be made through people in this field, through adoption societies or people who are engaged in the general adoption field.  There is no need to be apprehensive that the board will get information from less than worthy sources.</P>

      <P>This section provides that an adoption order shall not be declared invalid where the court, having regard to the interests of the child and to the rights under the Constitution of all persons concerned, considers that it would be proper not to make such a declaration.  The intention is to go as far as possible towards enabling the High Court to validate any order made by the board no matter what legal or other omissions may have taken place or may still exist.</P>
      <P>As I explained on Second Stage, this is a far-reaching section.  It is so far-reaching that, in effect, the High Court might be asked to disregard fraud or a serious legal omission, if the High Court decided at the time the question came before it subsequently that such fraud or illegality should be ignored because the interests of the child at that time determined it. It was considered that the interests of the child was what should move the court rather than any consideration as to the legality, or lack of legality, when the child was adopted, or when the purported adoption was made possibly years earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2205" /> As the Deputy will see, there are two matters the court has to consider. The first is the interests of the child. It is specifically directed to that but the court must have regard to the rights under the Constitution of all persons concerned.  We might find ourselves in a position where, by law, we have effectively closedoff any hope of a person attacking the order on some technical or legal ground.  If a person wanted to persist, his only hope would be via a constitutional challenge. It is in this area that amendment is being considered.  It is quite difficult technically.  If you like, that is the second leg we will be looking at from the point of view of the constitutional change, in addition to removing the apprehensions with regard to the 1952 Act.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy O'Malley may have to be faced in the framing of the question, but not necessarily so.  The matter is being teased out in the drafting process and in the discussion process.  I would have no objection to a question to overcome that difficulty.  It is a point which was raised at some length in the Seanad and in this House when the Adoption Acts were being amended in 1974.  It was felt there was a gap in our law, that legitimate children could not fall to be adopted and that the law should be changed.  That might mean a constitutional change.  It is a matter for legal argument as to whether the Constitution needs to be changed in this regard.  Possibly it does.  Whether the question to be framed to deal with the immediate problem this Bill is attempting to cure needs to be framed to take in the wider aspects of the adoption of legitimate children, is something I cannot say at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is designed to sever the issue of invalidity of an order where a declaration of invalidity is made from the issue of custody of the child.  The section proposes that, when an adoption order is declared invalid, the court shall not make any order as to custody unless the custodians who would normally be the adoptive parents are heard.  This deals with the point made by Deputy O'Malley in the context of custody. The section is worded so as to discourage the making of a custody order in these proceedings but, if the court decides to make a custody order, it has to do so in accordance with section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which provides that the welfare of the infant shall be regarded as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>The section is designed to enable the question of the invalidity or otherwise of the adoption order to be dealt with on its own.  If the court decides that in the same proceedings they will also deal with the custody, the physical possession of the child, that can only be determined on the criterion of section 3 of the 1964 Act. Preferably only the validity of the order would be decided and custody would then be decided elsewhere, if at all, that is, if challenged by the people who might have been successful in setting aside the adoption order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be unusual if a natural mother or natural parents, as in the recent case challenged the validity of an adoption order and secured a declaration to that effect, that they would not seek to <Col N="2209" /> follow it up by an application for custody?  Even if they did not, which would be unusual, would we not have the anomalous situation that there would be a declaration that the child was not validly adopted but would still continue to live with the adoptive parents and would not acquire any rights, say, under the Succession Act <i>vis-à-vis</i> his adoptive parents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Anomalous is hardly the word.  It would be a legal consequence of the adoption order being declared invalid.  It was the adoption order which gave those rights and, when it was found invalid, those rights ceased with it.  That is not to say the rights could not be provided by the adoptive parents by legal instruments. They could.  All the rights could be provided for by will or deed.  It is a point I have been considering.  It might be possible to deal with it legislatively at another date and that one could impute rights under the Succession Act to certain categories of people the custody of whom had not been taken from the adoptive parents. As the Deputy rightly points out, it is a consequence of the order being declared invalid that the rights which go with the adoption order fall.  It is then a matter for the adoptive parents to take the legal steps open to them to secure the rights under the Succession Act and any other rights they may want to give a child in their custody.</P>

    <P>This amendment is to secure a point raised by Deputies Collins and Colley on Second Stage when they said they were surprised to learn on the debate <Col N="2211" /> on one of the financial measures here that an adopted child is not treated for all purposes as the natural child of the adopter or adopters.  Part III of the Adoption Act, 1952, goes a great deal of the way in putting an adopted child on an equal footing.  It is commonplace, however, for revenue and social welfare Acts to make provision for them also.  It is not possible to have a simple, unqualified provision putting an adopted child entirely in the same position as a natural child, but, as I am generally sympathetic to what was raised, I think the amendment as drafted meets what the Deputies had in mind.</P>

I have read this Bill and agree fully with its objectives, what it sets out to do and why it has to set out to try to achieve these objectives.  But in all honesty, I have some apprehension about some of the provisions.  The Bill had to be brought in in a great hurry for obvious reasons and it has had to be passed in a great hurry.  It is one of these Bills that one cannot be 100 per cent satisfied that everything in it is perfect and that at least some of its provisions are not going to encounter difficulties in the court afterwards because of the circumstances of the particularly speedy passage.  The aspect of the whole problem as it stands now, with the passage of this Bill, which is most important is the fact that reference has been made to the possible unconstitutionality of the 1952 Act, and if the 1952 Act is possibly unconstitutional, some of the amendments to it may be also.  The question of whether it is or it is not is a matter that should be decided as quickly as possible and finally and definitively.  There still remained some element of doubt after the possibility of that had been raised, and some means should be found to get a definitive answer to that at the earliest possible time.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2213" /> That the Dáil on its rising this week do adjourn until Wednesday, 13th October, 1976.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate I was referring to the question of rates and how the rates problem was being dealt with by the Coalition Government as opposed to how the Opposition proposed to deal with it.  I pointed out that in November, 1972, the then Fianna Fáil Government produced a policy document.  In it they referred to many things, but one thing they did not refer to was rates, except for about one line which said that the question of the payment of rates was under consideration, something very loose like that.</P>
      <P>Then in February of the following year there was a general election.  An election manifesto was produced by Fianna Fáil and they fought the election on it or intended to fight the election on it.  In fact, when the parties involved in the National Coalition produced their proposal to take housing and health off rates, a former Minister of the party, a very decent man, under the impression that he was doing the right thing, prepared 100,000 leaflets, I think it was, saying that the National Coalition were talking a lot of nonsense claiming that anything like that could be taken off the rates.  He was the most surprised man in the world when, three days before the election, the Fianna Fáil party changed their mind and produced a document saying they would take rates off housing.  I think he had to burn the leaflets and that he spent more time doing that than he did electioneering, and I would not blame him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil suddenly discovered that they could take rates off housing but, so far as I could find out since I took over in the Department, they did not attempt to cost it.  The upshot of it was that they put this across as being their policy.  A few times since they have referred to it, but I notice they are not <Col N="2214" /> so noisy about it now as they were then.  It was only as a last minute effort to try to win back popular support that it was introduced by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Since the National Coalition took over we took housing and health off rates, as we said we would do.  In addition, we took off something we did not mention at all, that is, malicious injury claims exceeding 20p in the £ in any county.  This has represented a substantial sum, £1,600,000 last year. and I think £2,500,000 has been provided for this year in the Estimate. This has been of great assistance to the local authorities who are affected by this matter.  The net result of what the Government has done is to prevent, in some cases, an increase of up to a further £5 in the rates.  In no case can I find out that there has been less than £4 in the £ saved; £4.50p would be an average amount.</P>
    <P>Some Fianna Fáil members of the farming organisations have been talking fairly loudly about what Fianna Fáil would do for them under certain circumstances.  They are entitled to say these things if they so desire, but I would like to remind them that in the Fianna Fáil proposal, such as it was, to take rates off housing, they said nothing about taking rates off land. The farmers over the £20 valuation, before they start switching their allegiance, if they are talking about doing this, should look at their rates bill and see if they are not making fools of themselves or allowing Fianna Fáil to make fools of them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go any further on that except that there are a few points I would like to cover because I am afraid I lost a good deal of the time before the debate was adjourned because of interruptions and because unfortunately I said Deputy Dowling was present at a conference in the Custom House at which the claw-back was discussed. Immediately I discovered that this was not correct I withdrew the statement and said that this was incorrect. In fact, one of the first things I did when I was appointed Minister was to appoint the Commissioners to Dublin Corporation who had been suspended as commissioners.  Shortly after they were appointed they sent a <Col N="2215" /> deputation to me to discuss a number of things.  There were two Fianna Fáil TDs, who are members of Dublin Corporation, on that deputation.  The last thing they discussed on that day was the question of the claw-back. They said they wanted a proviso put in stipulating that people could not buy their houses one day and sell them the next.</P>
    <P>I understand the two Fianna Fáil TDs who came did not say anything. My recollection is that that is quite correct.  They did not say anything for or against but they were a party to the deputation which came to me on a number of points, one of which was the claw-back.  That being so it is a bit much that I should be attacked by those same people for having included the claw-back which the National Association of Tenants Organisations wanted included in the agreement, which I was then making, to give a fair rent and a fair purchase price to tenants.  I do not want to dwell on the matter any further but I would like to put that on record because it is one of the things which people tend to slide out from under if they possibly can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The other matter to which I would like to refer is a number of comments the Leader of the Opposition made.  He said that I said it took seven years for Fianna Fáil to plan and build local authority houses.  My recollection of it, and the recollection of my colleagues who were listening, is that he said: &ldquo;Yes, they were a bit lethargic about it&rdquo;.  This was recorded in today's <i>Cork Examiner.</i> My recollection is that this is exactly what he said. He said today that that was not what he said.  I want to put it on record that my recollection and that of my colleagues is the same as that of the reporter for the <i>Cork Examiner.</i> I thought it was a very honest statement of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also spoke about home ownership but he does not apparently understand that 73 per cent of the people own their own homes, for which we are very thankful and as a result of the National Coalition coming into office a very big number of people who were tenants of local authority houses are now the owners of those houses.  Therefore, we are adding to the home ownership. Day by day more people are owning their own homes.  Something which I will give him for nothing, because apparently this has not come out of the think-tank, although I am sure they have been mulling over those things, is that he apparently does not know that the percentage of local authority houses built, as against the number, was greater under Fianna Fáil than under the National Coalition.  We have built a far bigger number than Fianna Fáil did.  That has resulted in 8,792 houses built last year, which is <Col N="2217" /> a record no matter what way you look at it.</P>
    <P>Anybody who is stupid enough to suggest that houses built in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976 were planned and financed by Fianna Fáil, as the Leader of the Opposition said, should have another look at his script and see if somebody is codding him or else he has codded himself because there is absolutely no truth in it.  He asked me: &ldquo;What about the Kenny Report?&rdquo; A funny thing happened about that.  This report was given to my predecessor the day before he left office.  I did not see it for several months.  Eventually I got it.  When I inspected it I found that while there were many good things in the Kenny Report it is not easy to put into operation.  It had the effect of reducing the price of building land.  One of the biggest faults in it is that the places it should affect most, if we are interested in trying to keep down the price of sites, are the cities and towns where we now have to buy back, in many cases from landlords, who grabbed hold of properties that were deteriorating and held on to them, at a lot more than they gave for them, the sites which we require to house the people of this city.  If in 1968 the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government had signed the CPO which was put before him for signature to acquire a sizeable portion of the city in Deputy Moore's area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Where was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In City Quay.  If he signed it then this property would have been bought at very much less than under the order which I signed several months ago and under which it now must be bought, unless we are able to get some way out of it, at a very high price.  I agree that Deputy Moore wants to see his area built up.  He is perfectly correct and I will do everything I can to ensure that the centre of Dublin city is built up.  To prove it last year I gave £12.7 million for local authority housing in Dublin and this year I gave £23.7 million, an extra £11 million.  I know it will be put to very good use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2218" /> I understand I have only until 8.30 so I will have to be very brief on this.  There has been a lot of scaremongering in and around this city about the question of Dublin Corporation housing maintenance staff. The position is that five or six weeks ago the housing committee got a categorical warning from a senior official that up to 400 men would be given notice immediately because the civic officials had over-estimated the housing subsidy properly payable to them from the Exchequer.  Deputy Moore raised that number to 500 yesterday in the House.  Needless to say this statement hit the headlines in the daily Press.  I will not blame the reporters for that but the workers involved must have been shocked and the local authority tenants naturally thought that there would be a drastic cutback in maintenance and repairs on their houses.</P>
    <P>I want to say unequivocally that there has been no change in the policy in regard to maintenance and repairs of local authority houses during the past three years.  Circulars which I issued in 1973, 1974, 1975 and again in February of this year all laid down clear and consistent guidelines on the matter.  Only a relatively small number of local authorities who disregarded their proper maintenance responsibilities in the years before 1973, or who chose to ignore my circulars over the past three years, should be experiencing any real difficulties now in maintaining an adequate repairs programme in 1976.  Quite bluntly, they have only themselves to blame.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that in certain respects Dublin Corporation evidently considered that they should be immune from controls and regulations which are clearly applicable to all local housing authorities.  In consequence the corporation now find themselves in some difficulty in meeting their responsibilities for financing a full programme of maintenance and repairs.  It calls, not for the playing to the gallery antics of some politicians involved, but for a responsible review removed from the public limelight, and this I have arranged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2219" /> Senior officers of my Department and the corporation have at my request been going into the position in great detail with the object of reducing disemployment to the smallest number possible, and that number would be nothing like the figure of 400 so widely publicised since late May.  My approach is and has been one of goodwill and flexibility.  My concern has been to minimise hardship to the workers and the tenants affected, not to concede to the disregard of general principles laid down in my circulars over the past three years nor to give the impression that I am influenced by the reprehensible political posturings of some of the city councillors.</P>
    <P>I am meeting members of the city council on the matter in the near future.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions, but I am satisfied that the majority of those engaged in this work will be still employed on the work and that as far as I am concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me time to conclude that sentence and I thank the House.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Early in this debate remarks were made about the reason for it and why the Opposition should seek to postpone the adjournment. I would like to point out two things: first, that there is a very good, substantial reason why the House should at least sit to complete certain business.  In addition to that I would point out that it is a convention and I am glad to see the convention resumed. We had trouble in getting an adjournment debate on other occasions.  It is the convention that on the Motion for the Adjournment a general debate can take place and nowadays it is all too frequently difficult to have a general debate when needed.  Therefore I point out, before I return to the other aspect of the matter, that an adjournment debate in parliamentary convention is an accepted device to have a general debate before the House rises for a recess.  It is well that the public should understand that and that some misunderstandings about why such a motion is moved and opposed formally for the purpose of debate should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the usual reason.  However, I am going a little bit further to suggest to the House that there is very good reason why the House should postpone its adjournment until certain business has been completed.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that in three hours today we passed practically all the Estimates for the public service, the whole of public expenditure. We passed in a matter of minutes in this same day an Act validating <Col N="2221" /> expenditure that was rubber-stamped in the same way for the previous year.  I ask, therefore, why we cannot sit at least one week longer to go through the Estimates in a better way than we did this morning?</P>
      <P>I would like to recall the functions of this House because I am very much afraid that under the pressures of modern organisation and the complexities of modern Government this House is failing in its functions and is becoming a mere formality in many of them.  A democratic Parliament such as ours has the following functions and responsibilities and in our constitutional set-up the Parliament has a very vital role to play in making democracy work.  The first function of the Dáil on election is to elect a Government and thereafter until the dissolution to maintain a Government. The next function of the Dáil is to pass legislation providing laws under which the community live and function and authorising and enabling the Executive to carry out its functions. These are the two principal functions of a democratic Parliament.</P>
      <P>In addition to that it is a recognised and necessary feature of a parliamenary democracy that it is the Parliament that makes the financial provision, not the Executive, which in our case is the Government who are responsible to Parliament and exist only as long as a majority in Parliament support them.  It is the final responsibility of the House to make financial provision for the administration of the public service and the government of the country.  As a corollary to that the Parliament, to be effective in this, has the further duty of financial control and ancillary administrative control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these things may be summed up in the words, &ldquo;the sovereignty of Parliament within the structure of our Constitution&rdquo;.  How is this Parliament exercising its sovereignty, or is it exercising it at all?  I am afraid that long since Parliament has surrendered its sovereignty to a committee, namely the Government.  It has too long been the practice now, both here and elsewhere, with the type of system we have had, that a Parliament elect a <Col N="2222" /> Government, the Government then keep their cards close to their chest, and the people who elected them support them with their feet in the division lobbies, and as long as that support can be commanded the Government can do what they like&mdash; everything is decided by how many votes there are in the division lobbies and this becomes an automatic thing. It means sovereignty has been, in effect, handed over to the Government.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, at least it is a directly elected assembly, but we have now reached a stage at which I fear the Government have handed over that sovereignty to the Administration.  In the complexity of modern life, and with the greatest sympathy for the Government and the Administration, it is obvious that the legislation has to be prepared by staff, and if a Government want more responsibility in the hands of the staff and merely come in here as agents and mobilise their legions of foot, it means this House is nothing more than an automatic rubber stamp for what has been determined by the administrative machine.</P>
    <P>I am afraid this is the state we have reached.  If we look at the Order Paper for today we will find that item No. 4 passed all its stages.  It is the Appropriation Bill, simply a twosection Bill with a list of bulk amounts of Estimates for 1975.  They were passed <i>in globo</i> and we will never come back on those Estimates.  We passed all these Estimates in a matter of three hours without even having all the responsible Ministers here or the accounting officers behind them giving us the courtesy of being present.  I do not blame anybody but the House.  It is we TDs in the organisations we have who are ultimately responsible, and it can only go on to its logical conclusions.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with specific problems, what I am suggesting is that no matter what the excuses are, it is extraordinary that the Government do not take the initiative and say: &ldquo;We have not normally adjourned until later in July.  We will take those Estimates&rdquo;.  Three days <Col N="2223" /> would be better than three hours and we would have some idea of what we are doing with the public money.  We are passing budgets and Finance Acts imposing taxation without being allowed to discuss them in sufficient detail.  We are putting these impositions on the unfortunate individual citizen, the taxpayer, and having imposed them and got in his money we are blandly rubber stamping the legislation without properly examining it as it should be our duty to do.</P>
    <P>I am not exaggerating.  The Minister for Finance brought in a number of taxation Bills.  We tried to examine them and all we got from the Chief Whip of the Government was reiterated criticism that we had wasted the time of the House&mdash;because we tried to examine the imposition of taxation.  We had a Finance Bill unequalled and unprecedented in its ramifications and complexity, all in aid of the Administration, all aimed at making sure that taxation was imposed and collected without loss to the Exchequer.  That, naturally, took time and because some of us questioned part of that taxation on the basis of equity we were politically attacked as being partisan of some class or another.</P>
    <P>We then had the taxation of companies, the Corporation Tax Bill, and the procedure on that was a positive disgrace.  We were given reasons for the urgency&mdash;it was agreed to take it within a certain time.  I was a member of that Committee.  Let anyone look at that Bill.  It was passed at the rate of 100 sections per two or three hours and there was nothing one could do.  It was not examined.  The Committee were reduced to being a formality. They were put on a time schedule and the House counter-rubber stamped the rubber stamp of the Committee.</P>
    <P>That Bill in particular was the product of the Administration.  The Committee or the Dáil had no chance of examining it.  The situation simply is that it would have been more honest and just as effective to say: &ldquo;The Administration propose this Bill, take it or leave it&rdquo;.  This is where we have arrived now and the <Col N="2224" /> House should take note that its financial provisions, financial control and administrative control, have been abdicated to a Committee of the House, namely the Government, and that they in turn have been abdicated to the administrative machine.  I want to emphasise that.</P>
    <P>Let us then look at the realities of the situation.  I am not to be taken in any sense as criticising anybody but ourselves.  The officers of the Administration and the Ministers of the Government have their jobs to do and many of the Administration's problems are difficult and complex.  It may very well be that we need some general investigation into the efficiency of our procedures and a revision of our methods and approach to these things in modern times.  I am here anticipating what I had intended to say at the end but in case I run out of time I will say it now.  The democratic function of our Parliament is to elect and maintain a Government to provide legislation, and then the courts will protect the citizens and all other interests in the light of that legislation. We elect a Government to make financial provision for State expenditure in the public service, to exercise financial control over the collection of revenues and the expenditure of public moneys, and finally to exercise a reasonable modicum of administrative control.  If these are the necessary functions of a democratic Parliament within the framework of our Constitution, then we are not doing our job and it is time some steps were taken to review the position to see what adjustments are necessary.  That is the conclusion I want to come to.</P>
    <P>I have already said that it would be completely defeating my purpose here if what I am saying were to be presented as a conflict between the political and administrative elements. I am in no way indicting or criticising the public service or the Executive. What I am saying is that some adjustment must be made so that our procedures are realistic because the very failure of what we are doing amounts to a clog in the efficiency of the machine.  If we have procedures that we are going through the motions of <Col N="2225" /> carrying out, and not properly discharging our functions, we are impeding the efficiency of the public service. Instead of co-operating with them and <i>vice-versa</i>, which is the ideal, we are actually impeding them.  I urge the House in the very near future to review this whole matter so that realistic procedures, particularly in regard to financial control and provision, can take place.</P>
    <P>Time will not permit me to go into broader questions and, therefore, I will confine myself to the financial provisions. I made a <i>prima facie</i> case when I pointed out on today's Order Paper how we disposed of the spending of State money.  What we have done is to say to the Departments: &ldquo;Right, spend it in any way you like, so long as you keep within a certain sum&rdquo;.  That is not a fair load to put on accounting officers.</P>
    <P>When it comes to taxation we have not had a chance of exercising proper supervision.  I mentioned the Corporation Tax Act, but the Finance Act was the final straw.  It was introduced, discussed in Committee&mdash;we were even accused of delaying it in Committee&mdash; and within 20 minutes of the passing of the Committee Stage we were given copies of the Bill, fully printed, and headed &ldquo;as amended in Committee&rdquo;. Anybody who knows anything about printing knows that cannot be done in that short time.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to say that I was sarcastic and ironic when I congratulated the Minister on his speed but forgot that when one reads the Official Report a person's tone of voice and expression do not show up and it looks as if I were really congratulating him.  What does the printing of this Bill, 20 minutes after the completion of the Committee Stage mean?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing this matter in that type of spirit. I am not pinning this on any particular Minister or Government; I am looking at it on a broader base.  This means that this Bill was brought in, already decided.  The Minister, of course, said <Col N="2226" /> that he had not any other amendments but it was obvious that the Bill was already passed and he could not consider any further amendments.  One of the great things about Committee Stage is that one can argue with the Minister on a point and he will usually listen.  If he is committed in advance, as the Minister for Finance was, he could not listen.  The whole business was tied up and the parcel was delivered while we were going through the charade of discussing it.</P>
      <P>In the last few minutes left to me, by way of evidence of the type of deterioration that takes place, I have before me the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the Appropriations for 1971-72.  The Committee had reason to comment on breaches of accounting principles.  They went so far as to say that a number of the breaches to which their attention was drawn were made with the prior consent of the Department of Finance and they made strong comment in particular cases about those breaches.  I commend that report to anybody who is interested. My point here is not so much to raise matters which are passed but to show what can happen when check procedures are allowed to go.  I do not blame the accounting officers who were subjected to these criticisms.  I blame our operation of the system that allowed it to take place and this attitude to develop.</P>
      <P>At one stage in this report, for instance, an accounting officer referred to one of these breaches as a venial sin.  There is an attitude to creep in.  There should not be any sin in accounting.  At another point in the report one reads:</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Committee cannot accept that it should be necessary to breach the provisions of an Act of the Oireachtas in order to make this financial assistance available.  It finds it difficult to understand why the necessary legislation was not passed in good time.</P>
      <P>Here was a clear case of a breach of a statutory provision.  In another case, apart from accounting, we read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Committee appreciates <Col N="2227" /> the financial problems besetting CIE, it is concerned that the company in the present case deliberately refused to comply with the specific condition on which Dáil Éireann voted the additional grant.  It must insist that the decisions of parliament should be paramount in financial as in other matters.</P>
    <P>That a Committee of Public Accounts would have to write that in a report is disturbing.  In the report it is being claimed by the Administration that the Appropration Act, of itself, validates an Estimate, or validates an extra statutory grant whether or not enabling legislation has been passed. From a technical legal point of view&mdash;that is, as regards somebody taking an action outside&mdash;I shall not argue that.  But, from the point of view of parliamentary control, let us look at the logical consequences of the attitude being taken by the Department of Finance in this matter.  Whatever about the legality, the reality is simply this, that in an Estimate rushed through like that anything may be buried, expenditure can be made, public funds can be spent, without proper accounting and will only be found by the Comptroller and Auditor General, probably one or two years later.  The Committee of Public Accounts are in arrears for certain purposes but they are trying to catch up.  That will not come up, if at all, except for some such reason.  In the meantime that expenditure&mdash;which is, to all intents and purposes made arbitrarily&mdash;is validated by the Appropriation Act we passed today.  What have we done today, as we have done in other cases?  We have written a blank cheque.  Perhaps a blank cheque is not the term to use but we have written a cheque to an unspecified payee, so to speak.  We have given money with <i>carte blanche</i> for its expenditure. We did that last year and we have endorsed and certified it with this. Next year we will have another Bill like this to validate everything we passed on the Order Paper today with a rubber stamp.</P>
    <P>Now the Administration claim <Col N="2228" /> that that is all that is necessary.  If that is all that is necessary, let us face up to the fact; let us see what other controls we will put in.  If this Parliament does not do its job the Comptroller and Auditor General very shortly will not be able to do his because he needs the support of Parliament.  We are getting into a position in which we are abdicating our financial control and it is nobody's fault but our own.  I emphasise that.  I had sufficient experience, in a temporary capacity, during the Emergency of being a State servant and having to get work done. I have the greatest sympathy for and understanding of the problems of the Administration, of accounting officers in particular, and of the Executive; cumbersome procedures can put on very serious brakes.  If our procedures are cumbersome and inefficient in that way, let us have them revised, but do not let us continue with the sham.</P>
    <P>In the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts published today attention is drawn to this claim of the Minister for Finance.  There may be legal protection for him here&mdash;that nobody can take an action against him or any accounting officer, that the Appropriation Bill is statutory authority in that sense.  But, while that may be so, that submission completely destroys the control of Parliament. Perhaps I may read this part of the report:</P>
    <P>The Committee does not accept this view.  The Appropriation Act merely appropriates moneys voted by Dáil Éireann for services described generally in part 1 of the relevant estimates.</P>
    <P>Further on it says:</P>
    <P>Moreover if the principle now being advanced were accepted there would be no need for specific legislation to authorise the issue of grants out of voted moneys.</P>
    <P>It says further:</P>
    <P>The Committee reiterates its view that where, because of urgency, an Estimate is introduced at variance with existing statutory provisions, the additional grant should be voted contingent on the enactment of legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2229" /> But it comments on the long delay; the legislation was not forthcoming over a period of years.  Finally the Committee says:</P>
    <P>This is a cause of great concern to the Committee in that it amounts to an unlimited delegation of parliamentary functions to the administrative authorities.</P>
    <P>I repeat, I am not criticising the administrative authorities but I am warning the House of what it is doing in abdicating its duties in that unlimited way.</P>
    <P>Actually there were three specific cases.  So far it seems to have been admitted that legislation would be necessary because, of the three cases referred to, one was in respect of payments of certain public service pensions.  The accounting officer informed the Committee that it was intended originally to introduce specific legislation to provide for those payments. That legislation was not introduced, for reasons that he gave. It is said:</P>
    <P>The Accounting Officer pointed out in regard to the payments referred to in the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that no such payment was made without a Supplementary Estimate being passed and he regarded this as his authority to pay, but the matter was to be eventually covered by legislation.</P>
    <P>There is an admission that legislation should be introduced but it was not, for reasons given afterwards.  Therefore, the Comptroller and Auditor General had to make that comment.</P>
    <P>The next case arose on the Vote for Local Government.  Again the Accounting Officer relied on the Appropriation Act to validate the payments, as a temporary expedient, but there was a clear indication to produce a Bill to validate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In the third case <Col N="2230" />&mdash;Vote 36: Roinn na Gaeltachta&mdash; legislation to validate these payments was ready but there was difficulty about arranging to have it brought before the House.  In all of those cases, the Committee recognised that the intention was to introduce legislation but it was constrained to comment on the long delay.  This having been the attitude, it is disturbing to find the Minister for Finance going further now and saying: the Appropriation Act will do it all; there is no need to go further.  Time does not permit of further analysis.  I will summarise what I said in the beginning. The time has come to look carefully at how this House is carrying out its financial business and is discharging its functions of financial provision and control.  It has reduced itself to being an automatic instrument of authorisation and validation.  That creates difficulty both for the Administration and for everybody else.  If our procedures are too cumbersome they should be revised in a real sense.</P>
      <P>For some period past it has become very evident that sections and interests of the community are splintering away from each other.  This situation has been brought about by the Government's lack of policies. Up to about 1974 there was a commendable homogeneity in our community in all aspects, particularly in economic activity.  There was coordination. I noticed, first on television when various people were being interviewed, that individual interests saw the solution to their problems in getting more money from the Government, by pointing out that they should get more and so on without any regard for the other interests of the community.  This was long before the crisis of this year. This divisive trend has accelerated to an alarming degree this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not wishing to aggravate such questions as national pay agreements or to cause any difficulty here, I would say that such interests have been all driven to look after their own narrow domain and try to do the best they can themselves and they are becoming less and less aware of the needs of the community.  All seem to <Col N="2231" /> fail to realise that the various elements of the community hang together and inter-react.  A thing that may be of benefit to one section, if it is not in harmony with the welfare of the community as a whole, will not only damage the community but it will fail to benefit the particular interest that seeks it.</P>
    <P>During the last six months a stampede attitude of mind has developed through the economic situation, where we have unemployment, where there is a lack of confidence because of the growth of debt, where there is a heavy burden of taxation, where administrative complexities have multiplied, where there is industrial unrest, where there are large numbers of young people coming into the community who are unable to settle themselves in life and it is a question of everyone for himself. There is a great need in Government today, and for this House, to set a steadying lead, to rally the elements of the community to get them to realise again that it is an integrated community, all the parts of which mutually support each other, that salvation will lie and not in a free for all.  I am afraid that this psychology which is taking hold all around us is a very serious problem for those who purport to lead the people in this democracy.  If those trends continue, added to the type of unreality and the failures in the working of democracy that I referred to, then democracy itself will be in danger.  I say that objectively not directing it to any one particular point or purpose.  The Government have the responsibility but this trend is at large and unless a firm lead is given and a way out is shown from this situation it may go ill in the long run with our democratic institutions.  I say that without party animosity and couple it with the warnings on the workings of this Parliament which I have tried to give tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view expressed by the Taoiseach that two basic problems face our Government at present and that they reside at the core of the expansion of any modern <Col N="2232" /> mixed economy such as ours.  The first problem, as we see it, is how to regain some measure of full employment without further accelerating the rate of inflation.  The second problem is how we manage the economy in an open manner in a legalitarian manner without having excessive price, excessive wage, and excessive tax controls. It is generally acknowledged that our future employment prospects are dependent on progressive economic policies being fully implemented by any Government.  What we need in this country at the moment is a similar surge forward to that which we had in the 1960s under Mr. T.K. Whitaker in the industrial development of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Would the Deputy not give some credit to the Government of the day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes and, indeed, both to industrial development and to productive capital formation.  Our country we must appreciate has grown considerably in the late fifties, throughout the sixties and in the early seventies.  It has grown in economic expertise, in economic management, and I would also think in political judgment.  The problem of politicians in Government and in Opposition is how to be willing and capable of making constructive contributions towards that further development. It is frightening to think that many tens of thousands will be leaving school this year and next year and we may not have jobs for them&mdash;in many cases we will not.  The recent estimates of the NESC, which have now become very fashionable since Members of the House have begun to read reports which are about three years old, indicate that a net increase of some 25,000 jobs will be required to absorb new entrants to the work force, to make up for redundancies and falling job opportunities in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises, how best can Government strategy of economic and social planning assist our economic recovery?  It is particularly easy for somebody in the Labour Party to wear a simplistic, ideological badge in <Col N="2233" /> favour of economic planning as a solution.  It is a different exercise to spell out in some detail the precise mechanisms one would favour in practice.  I share the view of a man outside politics but one I respect, the managing director of the Industrial Development Authority, who spoke at a symposium of the Statistical and Social Enquiry Society last November. He pleaded that we do not waste time seeking simplistic solutions.  He correctly pointed out that the environment for industry today is far more complex than in 1958: we must cope with EEC membership, with closer world economies, more volatile industrial technology and markets, with rapid job losses in some industries, and with growing costs of new investment in technology.  Any kind of planning in that climate is a very formidable task.  If anybody in the House on either side says it is time the Government produced a plan, or time that the Department of Finance produced a one-on, one-off economic and social plan encompassing all the issues involved in economic recovery, we should stand back coolly and see whether this proposition has the merits it is supposed to contain.</P>
    <P>Irish politicians have a peculiar capacity to wait until the other fellow produces a plan and then proceed to tear it to shreds.  I believe we need a short-term plan for three or four years ahead which would take into account unforeseen conditions and the accumulation of information over a short period.  Because of the pace of economic change anything else would be rather a waste of time. Far too many Irish politicians and business people think that all one has to do is to produce a series of Department of Finance projections up to, say, 1980 and automatically everybody will know where they are going. This is not reality, but I think some of my parliamentary colleagues in Government and in Opposition suffer that sort of delusion.  Having worked for a long time in the trade union movement and in politics I have begun to appreciate fully that the real life of investment, employment, export promotion and social planning, <Col N="2234" /> of which we do very little, is far more complex.  My plea, therefore, is that those with entrepreneurial ability, or political, or public administration ablity should not sit back waiting for the Government or the Department to produce another major plan: they should get on with what they are doing, do their jobs efficiently and help in the task of economic recovery, not in any haphazard manner but rather with the will to recover, which is the most important factor of all.</P>
    <P>Since they can no longer avoid paying the taxes which they should have been paying in any event, some business people profess to have lost the incentive to work.  Some would regard as another solution the nationalisation of everything.  Again, that is a simplistic solution on which we should not waste time here.  The reality, as I see it, is that we have a basis for future economic development.  We have a strong agricultural base with farmers who pay almost no taxes; we have food based industries in which farmers and those who work in them became about twice as well off in the past five years as they were in the previous ten.  We have a private industrial and service sector which has done remarkably well even in recession, particularly in manufactured exports.  It has suffered unemployment in the domestic import competing sector but generally it is remarkable how, despite great difficulties, manufacturing industry has survived. We have a construction sector which is now more efficient and is rid of a considerable amount of speculative fat.  The days of the chancy builder are more or less gone when he could hope to make £4,000 or £5,000 on a couple of jerry-built houses in a row.  That is too costly now.  The construction industry is much more efficient.  Admittedly, it employs fewer people.  It has shed much speculative fat, and that is no harm.</P>
    <P>We also have State-sponsored bodies which, despite criticism frequently levelled at them, are in general efficient and reasonably well managed.  All the sectors I have mentioned are interdependent, and the <Col N="2235" /> tens of thousands of men and women who work in them represent the future productive wealth of the country.  Each of them can contribute to our economic recovery.  I do not believe in a grand strategy of a plan based on wordy exhortations and a national planning body superimposed in a new, huge office in Merrion Square staffed by 25 Departmental secretaries seconded to this great new body.  As a socialist, I strongly believe in planning, but for 3 million people in this country I do not believe our requirements have reached that stage as yet. Each of the sectors I have mentioned can, with State assistance, contribute substantially to economic planning and recovery.</P>
    <P>The politicians' job is to provide democratic institutions to enable these sectors to develop in confidence.  Our financial institutions must provide for the short-term liquidity and investment needs of these sectors.  I am not sure that our commercial banks have fully faced up to that responsibility. They made a fair share of profit, as we all know, in the last two or three years.  In that regard I would urge the taxation of banking profits as something which would need careful study here and which could be a useful source of revenue.</P>
    <P>We have to accept also that our external reserves and our level of domestic savings were never better in our history.  I do not accept the Jeremiah cries of woe from Fianna Fáil, because we have a sound economic base of external reserves and of domestic savings.  The level of deposits with the building societies in the last 18 months was exceptionally high and these are, therefore, in a position to contribute effectively to economic recovery. The job of our public service must be to provide a flexible administration capable of protecting the public interest as determined by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Our trade union movement has also special responsibilities at all levels, including responsibilities in relation to national wage agreements.  I have no doubt we will hear a lot about that in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2236" /> Economic and social policy formation, and planning, is a complex interaction of these forces.  To suggest that the Department of Finance should simply produce an omnibus five-year economic and social plan is to see it almost out of date before publication. We need a consultative, flexible form of review structure for the key economic and social sectors of the nation wherein the major representative bodies would have regular and adequate opportunities of effectively alerting one another to their individual problems and to their anticipated needs.  That kind of structure would be more flexible and more open to beneficial results rather than yet another massive office block in Merrion Square inhabited by the gurus of a National Planning Commission.</P>
    <P>The Government should, as an integral part of their current evaluation of economic policy strategy, envisage a more positive and more flexible role for the existing National Economic and Social Council.  In my view the NESC should develop as a common meeting ground between its members and the economic and social committees of the Cabinet.  There is need for a direct discussion and debate on commissioned and internal reports in relation to these matters.  I hold the view, having looked at past administrations and the present administration, that Cabinet status does not necessarily create a full awareness of the complex series of economic situations which can arise.  There are grounds for a more effective liaison between the Government and the NESC.</P>
    <P>There is also a great deal of need in the planning process for a very effective relationship between the Government and the National Employer Labour Conference.  In recent months, it could be said, the National Employer Labour Conference has assumed a certain role of Government in relation to the development of pay levels over the next 12 months.  I suggest that we should consider the development of existing institutions rather than the creation of new planning institutions.  Our country has a sufficiency of institutions, including <Col N="2237" /> the self-appointed institutions.  A good example of effective social planning was the development by my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Cluskey, of a programme of social welfare reform in that Department, with the full co-operation of the departmental staff.  He did a magnificent job.  That is social planning in my view.  Another example of the development of an existing institution was the giving to the Department of Industry and Commerce of a precise sense of policy, of function and of purpose by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the advancement of mineral developments. That was purposeful planning and the development of an existing institution rather than setting up of a massive new mineral body on a State-sponsored basis.</P>
    <P>For those two jobs there was no great need to set up any great new monoliths in order to create essential work. The tragedy on the Irish scene is that Fianna Fáil in Opposition have not yet begun to think about these concepts. It is a performance reminiscent of a firing squad who gathered around the man they were going to execute in a semi-circle in order to make sure he would not get away.  It is arguable that the other major area, if I may sound rather conventional and conservative tonight, and one of the most effective and sensitive short term mechanisms for economic policy, is our annual budget and the capital budget.  We tend to underestimate the importance of these mechanisms here. This, I agree, is a traditional view.  I hold the view that where a Cabinet evolves a fairly definite line of economic and budgetary policy to implement in the lifetime of the Dáil the annual budget is a reasonably fair method of implementation of economic policy.  We need a revolving capital budget with a future perspective of some three to five years hence.</P>
    <P>I urge that in the preparation of the capital budget for next year they should look ahead for about three years.  That is about as far as one can go in terms of using the capital budget in order to ensure that it makes an <Col N="2238" /> effective contribution to economic development.  As a member of a local authority I know of no more frustrating experience than to be dependent on the fluctuations of capital allocations for housing, roads or sanitary services on a year to year basis, sometimes on a six months basis.  One has to plan further ahead on the capital budget. Therefore, there is a need for more effective forward capital allocation.  I am convinced that we do not make enough use of it at present.</P>
    <P>Looking at the pressures that have been exerted on previous Ministers, for example, Deputies Colley and Haughey and the present Minister for Finance, the tendency has been inevitably to resort to short-term experience and the long-term perspectives tend to be forgotten.  I urge that in our economic planning process we take a longer look, because the longer one is in Leinster House the shorter the year is.  We need budgetary policy of some two to three years hence.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties in the current situation facing the Government is the re-emergence in the Opposition of the pragmatic Fianna Fáil economico-politicos.  They are well known in the House, and one of them has just contributed, Deputy de Valera. He and his other colleagues, Deputies Colley, T.J. Fitzpatrick of Dublin and Brennan.  I call them the past men of yesterday, unfortunately, the men of the 1960s who did not believe at all in any kind of economic or social planning. That has been very evident in their contributions in the past three years.  With Deputy Lynch, Deputy Blaney and a former Minister, former Deputy Kevin Boland, they believed through the 1960s that the first and second programmes for economic expansion were purely public relations political exercises.  They did not believe in economic or social planning at all. We all remember that when the third economic programme collapsed it was abandoned by Fianna Fáil and there was not a Fianna Fáil mourner in sight. As a matter of fact, I recall Deputy Garret FitzGerald on the Opposition side as the only mourner who turned up for that particular funeral. Perhaps there was a telegram from the <Col N="2239" /> Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I think it was more for diversion.</P>
    <P>In that context one has to consider some of the proposals at the moment for a much greater rate of job creation. I hold the view that some of the propositions are not likely to create even one new job.  I believe the setting up of a national planning office will not create one new job.  It is arguable that the creation of a national pension insurance fund would create some new employment.  I would like to see more details in regard to that proposition, modelled on Swedish lines.  Perhaps it has some prospects in so far as one might be thinking of some of the State-sponsored bodies on the industrial side, such as Irish Life.  There, I think, is an argument for the creation of a national insurance fund.</P>
    <P>There is too, possibly, an argument for the formation of a State holding in our commercial banks.  That might be useful.  It might be of some benefit in terms of current issues, like the bank strike, but I am not so sure that it would necessarily create new jobs.  We have to bear in mind that the only jobs many of these propositions would create are those for the bureaucrats and, God knows, we have enough of these already.  I hold the view that the last place on earth for an expert here, who might have a flair for smelling out a corner of the international market for a new Irish industrial project, is a national planning office in Merrion Square.  This, I would stress, is not to denigrate the concept of economic and social planning and the mechanics thereof.  It is simply to point out the obvious need to give to manufacturing and State-sponsored bodies the full opportunity to engage in competitive, viable joint interests.  I believe we have been over-careful about, for example, the competitive role in the export field of many of our State-sponsored bodies.  We should be giving them more freedom to engage in commercial activities and indulge in joint ventures in the national interest.  That would be a useful development.  I can see new employment coming from that kind of development and I would certainly <Col N="2240" /> commend such a development to the Government.</P>
    <P>In this context one is compelled to point out that there are those in private enterprise who bitterly resent the role of State-sponsored bodies in commercial undertakings and who decry what might be described as State participation, and these are the people who have no hesitation in demanding taxpayers' money for their own firms from Fóir Teoranta, or AnCO, or the National Manpower Service, or Córas Tráchtála, or from a multiplicity of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point that ours is a mixed economy.  In that context there is every reason why the State-sponsored sector should be given substantial freedom to engage in exports on a competitive basis in the same way as the private enterprise sector of the economy.  That freedom should be given.  There is there an area in which one could have very effective development in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Another proposition that has emerged is that in regard to a national development corporation.  This has been put forward by, for example, Deputy Halligan.  I would draw a parallel with that proposition, which might find favour with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and a State holding. There is merit in that proposition from the point of view of future industrial development because we now have substantial State investment in Cement Roadstone, and so on, and we also have a substantial slice of the taxpayers' money invested by IDA, Fóir Teoranta, Irish Life in the private sector, and there is need in my view for monitoring in the aggregrate by the State to ensure proper co-ordination of investment and policy.  It is quite impossible for either the Department of Finance or the Department of Industry and Commerce to undertake the complex task of public accountability for this evergrowing State investment in the private enterprise sector.  While I do not share the view of my colleague, Deputy Halligan, about a national planning department, one should, I believe, have a national enterprise <Col N="2241" /> board.  There is logic in the concept of a State owning company, and anybody who favours, as I do, a mixed economy could not take exception to that because there is need to protect public money, to protect the substantial investment of public money in the private sector, rather than have a dozen Departments chasing after the Department of Finance and the Committee of Public Accounts trying to account for the money dished out to the private sector.  It would be interesting to hear the views of Government in that regard.  It is a development I certainly would favour.</P>
    <P>We must also give greater scope to the IDA in terms of job creation. Some may not be sympathetically disposed towards the IDA, but I have always been of the opinion that this body has a pivotal role in job creation. Too many gloss over the fact that the scale of investment by the IDA since 1970 exceeded that of the life span of the IDA since its inception by the Coalition Government in 1950. Between 1970 and 1975 the IDA approved industrial proposals from home and overseas with a potential of 95,000 jobs at full production compared with 68,000 in the preceding 20 years.  The IDA in the last five or six years have really done their homework and a great job and they should now get greater encouragement in terms of authority to proceed with even greater investment.</P>
    <P>Having made some very astringent comments which, no doubt, Deputy Gibbons will probably take up, about economic planning and some of the more simplistic concepts that are knocking around, that is not to decry the urgent need there is for a more effective short-and long-term strategy in the management of the economy. I was one of those who first took the Minister for Finance to task some years ago when he had some doubts in that regard, and I think he has now become somewhat more convinced of the need for both economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>I believe it has been a failing of all Ministers for Finance&mdash;we witnessed for example, the sullen hostility of <Col N="2242" /> Deputy Haughey and Deputy Colley to the first, second and third programmes for economic expansion&mdash;to believe that all collective wisdom resides exclusively in the Department of Finance.  I do not share that belief. I take a wider view.  We should keep a sense of perspective about the corrective role of economic planning, the generation of economic growth and economic activity and the expertise required to reach a given investment decision in a particular firm trying to project the cost of an export price 12 months ahead.  All these are very difficult economic decisions.  The day-today industrial relations in any one firm, trying to cope with monetary fluctuations in the sterling area, all these decisions are not easily amenable to the grand planning strategy. Therefore, one must keep a sense of perspective.</P>
    <P>It is too much to expect that we will have detailed answers to all of these problems in a comprehensive tenth programme for economic expansion, to be published at a future date by the Stationery Office, with a joint foreword by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, and Deputy Colley.  The answer will come not from politicians who exhort in platitudinous terms about self-help or the local development of enterprise.  The mere exhortation of politicians who wash their hands of the difficult task of creating an effective economic climate for job creation will be of little consequence.  Certainly, the answer will not come from those conservative business spokesmen&mdash;we have no need to name them because they are well known in the construction area and in chambers of commerce&mdash;who, as an excuse for not having any constructive proposals, talk about the abuses of social welfare. I suggest to some of these spokesmen that they should try to live on £10.90 per week for themselves, with £7.10 per week for a wife and £3.10 for each child in unemployment benefit.  If they did that they would be cured of some of the rightwing reactionary propaganda they put out in the last few months.  They would quickly wonder why some of the textile and construction industry <Col N="2243" /> employers failed to restructure their firms when they had the opportunity to do so in the 1960s.  They put their workers into redundancy in the 1970s having lived on the speculators' fat throughout the 1960s.</P>
    <P>Such spokesmen&mdash;and one in particular in the construction industry&mdash; have a nerve to talk about abuses of social welfare when there was not a murmur out of them when many builders from 1963 to 1973 made a cool profit of £1,000 per house erected.  They did not even pay half of the taxes they should have paid but now they grumble at the National Coalition Government when scarce housing capital is allocated far more productively to local authority housing.  In this sector we get better and cheaper housing contracts and we get better value for money.  Where were these gentlemen when some of the builders' representatives did not even stamp the insurance cards of their workers?  It is time we had some honest talk from the Opposition with regard to such matters.</P>
    <P>Ironically, the recession has had some beneficial side-effects.  For example, it has got rid of a good deal of ugly fat, some of it capitalist fat. We had rampant speculation in land throughout the 1960s and the early 1970s and Fianna Fáil promoted it up to their tonsils.  It is good that the Government in their taxation measures have caught on to some of it.  We had speculation on property and in shares.  The holding companies wined and dined the Fianna Fáil Ministers. There is no need to name them; they are now in trouble and rightly so for some of the blatant speculation they indulged in.  Some of them have gone into liquidation and I shed no tears for this.  They should never have been set up because they were set up on a speculative basis.</P>
    <P>These so called <i>entrepreneurs</i> now denounce the Minister for Finance and the Labour Party but of course, they denounce them at their povertystricken city lunches.  They would have been better when they set up their firms if they had kept to export delivery dates as promised and if they <Col N="2244" /> had raised the level of productivity in the firms they established.  They should have done this rather than try to shift their responsibility on to the Government of the day.  I make that point very strongly.</P>
    <P>I would even make the point about a few trade union officials whom I know.  There is a tremendous contradiction in a trade union official who looks for an increase of £15 per week for his Irish members from an Irish employer while supporting the acceptance by his own union executive in England of £6 per week.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the capitalists and to the socialists of the country that they should unite.  They have nothing to lose and it is about time they united. I have news for some of them.  The real socialists in this country in the last few years have been not so much the Labour Party but rather the Revenue Commissioners.  The current Minister for Finance accepted their advice.  They knew where the loot was going and they collared a good deal of it in the national interest.  The Revenue Commissioners took the Government at their word when we said we favoured taxation reform and they made sure that at least some of those who could well afford to pay their fair share of taxation at long last are obliged to do so.  Those who loudly complain can console themselves because at the next election Fianna Fáil will privately promise the well-off that there will be all forms of tax relief.  Probably the party will vote for the poor at every opportunity but they will assure both sides they will protect one from the other.  Fianna Fáil might get back on that basis but I do not think they will get much respect.</P>
    <P>In Opposition Fianna Fáil have had a smell of political bankruptcy about them in terms of any real economic and social policy.  I have said already that they are the most impoverished Opposition in the history of the State. They have not a thought in their heads except to suggest the abolition of rates at a cost of about £50 million a year. They are going to abolish the wealth tax at a cost of £6 million and the taxation of co-operatives at a cost of <Col N="2245" /> £3 million.  As Deputy Gibbons knows, farmers pay about £100,000 in income tax at the moment and this is just peanuts; farmers pay no income tax worth talking about.  In the by-election campaign Fianna Fáil promised they would give a 10 per cent reduction in personal income tax at a cost of about £45 million.  They have promised to reduce social welfare contributions for employers at a cost of about £10 million and they have promised to abolish income tax on farmers at a total cost of about £3 million.  I suggest that Fianna Fáil are no more than a &ldquo;bring and buy&rdquo; party at this stage. Any night out on the town with Fianna Fáil would cost about £150 million but they have not the faintest suggestion where the money will come from.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should be challenged to spell out in explicit terms how they would reduce public expenditure by £150 million, which is the amount they would need if they were to fulfil all their promises.  For example, would they reduce public service pay by 10 per cent as they suggested at one time?  It is time they came clean on those issues.  They have been celebrating their golden jubilee recently and they owe it to their own party not to soil it with pre-election &ldquo;con&rdquo; jobs, as they tried to do in the recent byelections in order to woo the electorate. To paraphrase the words of their late founder and leader, to do things like that is to bring no credit on their movement and to fool the people.</P>
    <P>However we in the National Coalition might deserve to be criticised, the performance of Fianna Fáil in Dáil Éireann in the past three years has been one of unmitigated mediocrity.  I said before that one would need to be blind and stupid not to be aware of the shortcomings of the Government and it was put into the Fianna Fáil election literature, but I also said that at least we have tried to give some return to the people in the past threeand-a-half years.  Fianna Fáil, instead of acting as a watchdog in Opposition, have looked after their farms, their professions, their jobs.  They have trotted off to Europe, getting the few <Col N="2246" /> quid expenses, instead of looking after their own party, and advancing alternative constructive economic and social policies in Dáil Éireann.  They have not earned the right to return to Government.  I am afraid my esteem for the Opposition is nil.  My regard for the Government has always been one of very critical concern.  I have always had a very critical and open attitude towards the Government but we are streets ahead of Fianna Fáil and I have no hesitation in continuing my support for them for as long as they wish to stay in office.</P>

      <P>It was very interesting to listen to the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Desmond.  The speech he has just delivered was not in any sense spontaneous.  The few of us who remained in the House saw him handing his prepared script to the Press Gallery before he started.  The unique exhibition of vacuous vapidity we have been treated to for the past three quarters of an hour was the result of great research.  I must confess that at times I only perceived what Deputy Desmond was striving at as through a glass darkly.  It was obscured by vague outworn socialist clichés which are only barely comprehensive to the devotees of that particular cult.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond made a prolonged attack both individually and collectively on the members of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, and the bloated capitalists who are said to support us outside.  Through all that plethora of vapidity one could not see any constructive idea at all.  One could not even see a faint recognition of the stark reality of today, that is, that the economic condition of the country, the employment condition, the condition of our agricultural development has never been so bad.  There have never been so many people unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that observation in a minute.  As Deputy Desmond spoke, his obsessions became visible.  He hates an awful lot of things.  He hates farmers.  He hates people to make money.  He hates <Col N="2247" /> people to make profits.  He hates cooperatives. Most of all, of course, he hates Fianna Fáil.  Our very sitting here is an accusation against the National Coalition he supports, an accusation against their appalling collapse and the really serious trouble they have got the country into at present.</P>
      <P>Many people are asking currently: who governs Ireland?  Who is running the country?  Is this a democracy? Look at this House at this moment. Look at the Government benches. We have a junior Parliamentary Secretary sitting all alone, the only representative of the Government in this important adjournment debate.  The Taoiseach has announced his intention to adjourn the Dáil just as a strike breaks upon the country which could very well cripple the agricultural economy for the next 12 months and upset all commerce.  I do not know how commerce is to continue in the absence of a functioning banking system.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has moved in this House that the Dáil will adjourn for about three months.  People who ask who governs the country are well entitled to do so.  If they came in here tonight and looked around them, they would ask: where are the Government now?  Where are the Government Deputies?  There is one solitary Government Deputy in the House. One wonders whether the exercise of democratic power by this sovereign Parliament is not passing from our hands into the hands of unelected, undemocratic people who arrogate to themselves the exercise of the real power, the pressure groups of one kind or another who are strangling the development of the country at present by their own selfishness and their own sectional interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time Members on every side of this House paused for a moment and recalled for themselves the single fact that they should recall and the responsibility which has been conferred upon them by all the adult sufferage of the people of their constituencies. They and they alone in this Parliament, if this is a democracy, make the laws under which this country <Col N="2248" /> ought to be governed.  The Government which we produce from our own ranks in this House ought to exercise the sovereign power of controlling our economy.  To my understanding this is the theory of democracy, but it is not what is happening.  Possibly the Members of this House cannot call themselves blameless in this regard.</P>
    <P>To think that in the Dáil there are three Members out of 144 while this final debate of the session, it would appear, is taking place.  It is time we as Deputies in Dáil Éireann paused and asked ourselves if we are prepared to sit idly by and watch the power which was conferred upon us by the sovereign people pass into the hands of unelected, undemocratic oligarchs who are using this country for their own petty, mean, selfish interests and who derive their authority from nobody.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the very junior representative of the Taoiseach who is in this House that a great many seriousminded people are beginning to ask that question.  They are asking why are these mean, selfish, sectional oligarchs being allowed to strangle the development of the country.  We have just heard Deputy Desmond talking.  He talked about people with enterprise who make profit as if they were public enemies.  He rejoiced in the fact that some of them have gone into liquidation.  He said good riddance to them.  He does not seem to realise it is people with enterprise, people who want to make a profit, who provide the jobs.  If he and his socialist friends and their feeble Fine Gael partners retain control of this feeble little democracy for very much longer, democracy itself will perish. That is my view.</P>
    <P>I want to recall to us three, the survivors of Dáil Éireann at this hour tonight, the rejoicing which was clear in Deputy Desmond's boasts about the achievements of the National Coalition in social welfare.  Surely any enterprising Government with the interests of the country at heart should boast about the smallness of the amount of money they are devoting to social welfare because they should, by their own efforts, by their <Col N="2249" /> own enterprise, reduce the need to have to pay social welfare especially with money that has to be borrowed abroad and to be repaid by the people who are coming after us.  The expedient they are resorting to now is that industry is closing down right left and centre all over the country. The depopulation of rural Ireland is continuing unabated and the number of people who, whether they like it or not, are becoming dependent on social welfare payments is expanding, and low and behold, the National Coalition Government make a boasting point out of it.  They should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>There is the situation in this country that for a great many people who are working in lower paid jobs and who are married and who have some children it would be much more profitable to be out of work and to be drawing social welfare.  Under the National Coalition Government it has become unprofitable for a great many people to work, and it must be plain to anybody with a tittle of sense that that must be the very antithesis of progress. If that spirit gets a hold of the country, as it certainly has a hold of the Coalition Government, how can you except people to work if they get more for being idle?</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond, as far as I know, made no reference at all that I can recall to the appalling situation of boys and girls leaving school, young men and women, who did the leaving certificate within the last couple of years, as well as this year's crop of 50,000 odd.  Where are the jobs for them?  What have we been doing about creating a climate in which jobs can be provided?  Nothing.  We have been borrowing money abroad to pay social welfare benefits with the cost of which the people who come after us will be saddled.  As what would seem to be a diversionary tactic, we have the pseudo-liberals and socialists of the Coalition, such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, starting a subtle campaign against the sanctity of the family.  There is a subtle campaign to delete from the Constitution Article 41 which guarantees the sanctity of <Col N="2250" /> marriage in this country, dismissing totally the reality that the great mass of Irish people, whether they be Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland or Presbyterian, value the institution of marriage.  Then the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is continuing this campaign to introduce contraception, although he must have the sure knowledge by now that the Taoiseach, when he has voted against his own Government already on that subject, is likely to do the same again.</P>
    <P>It is neither divorce nor contraception that should be preoccupying the senior members of the Government at present.  It would be far better if they applied their alleged talents to the increasing number of young people leaving school with no job to go into and going into the demoralising situation of becoming eventually dole drawers, and it is an established social fact that when people are forced into that situation and remain there for a year or two, their will to work and to prosper and their courage to make their own way as free men will have been permanently damaged.  The National Coalition will have a great deal to answer to the young people who have been leaving school since they took up office.  Incidentally, the Parliamentary Secretary that we do have with us is, I believe, charged in some special way with responsibility for young people.  All you need do for young people is to give them work and they will entertain themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the sapping of our self-respect as Irishmen, the creeping shoneenism of the National Coalition Government, the abject readiness to try to earn the praise of the United Kingdom Government in matters of concern to the North of Ireland, the readiness to throw the national language overboard, and to apologies at all time and require apologies from the rest of us that we are Irish and that we are a free and ancient nation.  Indeed, the freedom we boast of may well be endangered by the administration of this National Coalition.</P>
    <P>There is no courage, no enterprise. There is dismay, despondency and disillusion right through the arteries and <Col N="2251" /> veins of this country.  If you were to try to find reasons, surely the first of all reasons is the dismal, appalling lack of leadership.  We saw Deputy Cosgrave, the Taoiseach, this afternoon reading the script prepared for him by the civil service.  When he had read his script he courteously listened to the Leader of the Opposition and then withdrew.  That will not do.  In order to restore the courage of the people, restore their confidence in themselves which has taken such a hiding since the referendum on the EEC, you want a man other than Deputy Cosgrave as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the portion of the Taoiseach's speech which deals with agriculture.  There is an expression used in the theatre called black humour.  I understand it to mean the unfunny and cruel derision that may arise from the mockery of one's own unhappy condition.  I think the Taoiseach's observations on agriculture could be classified fairly accurately as black humour.  In paragraph two of the section on agriculture he says:</P>
    <P>For farmers, 1975 was a good year.  Output rose by no less than 10 per cent, by volume.  The cattle industry recovered from the relatively depressed conditions of 1974 and creamery milk production increased appreciably.</P>
    <P>Listen to this:</P>
    <P>The increase in farmer's income is estimated to have been about 50 per cent which more than fully made up for the setback experienced in 1974 when they suffered a fall of 12 per cent.  This has brought back confidence to the industry about its future growth.</P>
    <P>That does not happen to be true.  In the first place, the Taoiseach seems to have ignored the fact that not for many years have there been so few cattle or sheep in the fields of Ireland, and only in very recent times has the pig herd begun to rise from the lowest nadir that it reached in many many years from the figure of 800,000 pigs in all.  The value of the cattle, as I pointed out here before, that are missing over the past 12 months from the fields of Ireland would be, at a <Col N="2252" /> very conservative estimate, in the area of £120 million.  But the Taoiseach thinks we had a good year.  The Taoiseach continues:</P>
    <P>There is plenty of evidence of this renewed confidence... The decline in the acreage of tillage has been reversed.</P>
    <P>It is true it has been reversed because 76,000 cattle are not there any more and a great many farmers have ploughed up their pastures.  As well as that, up to quite recently, when the price of calves and young cattle jumped to a fairly satisfactory level in the country we were exporting a vast number of calves to Italy, Greece and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Fertiliser usage has shown a very necessary increase following the cutback over the past two years, which, as the Taoiseach said, unfortunately has led to a loss of jobs in the fertiliser industry.  It appears from initial statistics this year that there is a slight upturn in the use of fertilisers. Last year there was a 40 per cent drop in the use of fertilisers and that was a drop on the previous year as well.  The Taoiseach might have told us that the use of phosphates and potash must be about half what it was when the National Coalition Government took over, when the use of phosphates and potash was not nearly half enough but it was rising.  Since that time it has dropped to about half.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach calls that a rise in the use of fertilisers.  There is a slight rise in the use of nitrogenous fertilisers. Thereby hangs a very serious danger because if one uses the stimulus of nitrate fertilisers without the nutrition of phosphates, calcium and potash one can run into very serious and long-term difficulties.  Along with that, in spite of the Taoiseach's attempted sunburstery, there has been active discouragement of farm expansion on the part of the National Coalition Government, the like of which never has been seen in the country before.</P>
    <P>There have been very large and formidable increases in VAT on basic materials like farm machinery and materials used in farm buildings.  Animal <Col N="2253" /> disease for the past couple of years has been at a total standstill.  In spite of the Minister's protestations on the radio, when he seemed to be having a paroxyism, there is no settlement as far as I can see because I have personal experience of it.  I did a TB test at my own expense very recently and the officers of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are unable to tell me what to do with the cattle that reacted to this test.  The Minister said recently on the radio that the scheme is starting immediately but the Department tell me otherwise.  I do not know and I doubt if the Minister knows.</P>
    <P>In regard to the handling of the veterinary dispute, I am not making a case for the veterinary profession because, in my opinion, they have acted in a very thoughtless and ruthless way without any regard for the safety of the Irish cattle herd, which is the greatest national asset we have.  As well as the impositions of VAT we have the impositions of petrol tax and car tax, which have a particularly heavy effect on farmers because those living in the country have to travel greater distances than urban people and they have to transport their goods, such as milk, to creameries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond said that farmers do not pay taxes.  A whole plethora of taxes has been thrown at the farming community without any regard for the reality of the case.  Deputy Desmond seemed to be speaking in ignorance of the fact that only 7 per cent of the farmers in Connacht qualify as development farmers under the farm modernisation scheme and in the country as a whole about 80 per cent are excluded from the development scheme.  It is worth remembering that three-fifths of all the farmers in the country have farms of under 50 acres.  If they are so prosperous as Deputy Desmond, who is a keen advocate of increasing taxation on farmers, says, why have 100,000 left the land in the last ten years and only the old, single and unmarried remain? We have now reached the point where a quarter of all the farmers in the country at the present time are unmarried <Col N="2254" /> and over 45 years of age.  Surely in a prosperous, paying agriculture you would not have that type of social structure?  For Deputy Desmond's information that is the sort of social structure we have.</P>
    <P>We have only one Government Deputy in the House at the moment and I doubt if he will transmit this.  I want to put it on the record that there is a dire need, especially in the west of Ireland, for the immediate introduction on the part of the Government of a pre-development scheme for farmers, something like the old small farm incentive bonus scheme.  That was a Fianna Fáil scheme which was having such very marked success.  It was abandoned by the Coalition and the farmers to whom it should apply were also abandoned by the National Coalition.  The exodus of those people, who well and truly may be called the backbone of the people of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I urge the Parliamentary Secretary not to interrupt. I am quite certain he has nothing helpful to say.  I will say what I have to say without his assistance.  I refrained from interrupting anybody since I came into the House.  I ask him, very sincerely, to keep his nose out of my business.  My time is very limited and I want to finish what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of our party&mdash;we represent more people by far than any other party in the country&mdash;to get people back to work, to make work profitable again because we realise we must sell competitively and profitably on the export market and we must resist the attempts of socialists, Halliganites and people like that to deter the development of the country.  We must, above all, stop pretending to ourselves and others that somebody owes us a living.  I suppose Deputy Desmond has arrived home by now but we heard him suggesting that somebody owes us a living.  We deny this.  We say: &ldquo;We owe you the right to work and we accept the duty of providing work for you&rdquo;.  The nonsense <Col N="2255" /> of talking about giving a living after that has helped to bring the country down.  We must realise now, especially the elected people in the House, that we have been remiss.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton, has been replaced by the Minister for Finance who has come in to take the Adjournment debate, but there is still only one representative of the Government here.  I repeat that the Deputies in this House, especially the Government Deputies because it is their business to govern, are abandoning the duty that devolves upon them to govern this country on behalf of the people who elected them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to detain the Minister or this House one second longer if the Minister would give me simple, basic but vital information in relation to Irish infrastructural projects qualifying for aid from the European Regional Development Fund.  I am simply asking the Minister for the total amount of money involved in each infrastructural project, the amount of national contribution and the amount of contribution from the regional development fund for each project.  This is a simple, straightforward request, not <Col N="2256" /> very involved, and if the Minister will give or even indicate his willingness to give this information I will immediately sit down and not detain the House one second further.</P>
      <P>There is no response from the Minister. He is not accepting my invitation or the simple request which it is my constitutional right to make and it is, I believe, the Minister's right to give this information.  I know that the Irish Government and, strangely enough, the European Commission have consistently failed to supply proper information on regional fund aid to Irish projects both industrial and infrastructural.  This situation has existed since October, 1975, when aid was first granted under the European Development Fund.</P>
      <P>This lack of information refers to the types of project I have mentioned, infrastructural projects, to the amount of national aid given and the amount of aid given from the regional development fund.  This, I submit, should not be a very involved process or procedure but the Minister will not, for his own reasons, give this information.</P>
      <P>I have put down several Dáil questions, written and oral, to the European Commission.  I have raised this very problem in debates in the European Parliament and I have also raised it in the European Parliamentary Committee for Regional Policy but at all times I have been faced with a blank refusal to give all those relevant figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil several of my colleagues have tried to extract similar information from the Minister and from several of his colleagues.  For example, on the 27th November, 1975, Deputy McEllistrim asked the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, the grant that his Department had received from the EEC in respect of the new sewer which was constructed in Tralee, County Kerry, last year.  The Minister for Local Government flatly refused to give this vital information in relation to this project which is being funded partially by the ratepayers of Kerry, a grant from the local loans fund and the contribution from the regional development fund. Still the Minister for Local Government <Col N="2257" /> failed to give this vital information.</P>
    <P>He is not the only one.  Several other Ministers have been guilty of this capital sin.  The consistency of these blank refusals from both Commission and the Government would seem to indicate collusion between the Commission and the Minister to prevent any disclosure to the public or to Members of the Dáil or of the European Parliament on what is happening to taxpayers' money that is being distributed through the regional development fund.</P>
    <P>The taxpayers have a right to know what is happening to public money and Members of the Dáil and all national Parliaments have the right to inquire&mdash;in fact, it is their moral right&mdash;as to how it is being spent. This right of the public to be informed as to how taxpayers' money is being spent and the right of elected public representatives to inquire on their behalf is being openly flouted by the Coalition Government and by the Minister.  Because of this attitude of the Irish Government and through a very strict interpretation of the regional fund regulation the European Commission has been reluctantly forced to act in collusion with the Irish Government in failing to reveal how public money is being spent.</P>
    <P>This is an attack on our democratic principles, traditions and practices and illustrates a lack of credibility <i>vis-á-vis</i> Ireland's membership of the EEC.  I was most embarrassed when last week in an EEC committee we were discussing the Regional Fund on the basis of document PEW4498&mdash;unfortunately earlier I cited it as PEW4478&mdash; a copy of which the Minister must have in his possession.  It contains details of the regional fund allocations to all the nine member states on a regional basis.  It states the number of projects, industries, and the amounts of money being spent in each sub-region with one exception, Ireland. All there is from the Irish Government is the number of projects in each sub-region without any mention of the moneys being allocated or how they are being used.</P>
    <P>If this information can be given <Col N="2258" /> by the other eight states I should like the Minister to tell the House the reasons why this information about Ireland is not contained in this very important document.  On several occasions I have sought to elicit the reasons for this and all I have got are silly excuses.  The Minister told me on one occasion that it was to protect the commercial confidentiality of the projects.  It is my submission that if any person wishes to benefit from public money the public have a right not only to know that the person is receiving it but how much.  There would be some credence in the excuse about commercial confidentiality if it were given about industrial projects, but it has no pertinency in regard to infrastructural projects undertaken by local authorities solely out of taxpayers' and ratepayers' money.</P>
    <P>This information was requested also by Deputy McEllistrim and I am aware that Deputy Calleary requested it in respect of a road being constructed between Ballina in Mayo and the Asahi project and financed out of the regional development fund.  There was a similar question about a project in Clare.  Again, no information was forthcoming from the Minister and Deputy McEllistrim got no information from the Minister for Local Government. It has been an established practice here to state fully and to give wide publicity on a national and regional basis to the sources and the amounts of grants coming from public funds.  If anybody is getting a grant from the IDA, Gaeltarra Éireann, Bord Fáilte or the Road Fund there is full public access to the information. Indeed, the IDA publish an annual list giving extensive details in regard to their grants.</P>
    <P>On these grounds I fail to see the reasons for the Government's policy in this regard.  I cannot see any reason for this secrecy.  Perhaps the explanation is that the regional aid from the EEC is paid directly to the Minister for Finance and that there is partial repayment for the projects in question under what is now notoriously known as the reimbursement clause which has lost so much for the Regional Fund and which will affect its chances <Col N="2259" /> of becoming a vehicle for the correction of imbalances.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's policy of submitting projects in a group and seeking regional aid on a global basis does not allow the European Commission an opportunity to study the amount involved for each project.  In this respect I warned Commissioner Thomson that the presentation of the Irish budget is a very complex operation. However, the operation by the Irish Government and the Minister for Finance of the reimbursement clause increases the possibility for the Government of subsuming through the Exchequer the regional fund allocations and using it for purposes other than those for which they were intended. In any case, the Irish attitude has been heavily criticised both at home and abroad, and the Minister for Finance must bear the responsibility for the position that has occurred.</P>

      <P>I am happy that Deputy Herbert ended on that very outrageous note because it enables me to put on the record that one day I received a phone call from a very cross Commissioner Thomson in Brussels to express his total disagreement with a report which a Fianna Fáil hack had given of a conversation with him.  That report purported to say that the Commission disapproved of Ireland's handling of the regional fund, I quote Commissioner Thomson: &ldquo;I said the very reverse and I wish that other countries would handle the regional fund applications in the manner in which Ireland does.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Commissioner Thomson said and he gave me authority to quote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand Deputy Herbert's motivation.  He has again and again endeavoured to belittle this country at home and abroad in relation to our handling of the regional fund.  He is the only member of the European Parliament who has persisted in this tactic, except for some of his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2260" /> Party who are very close behind him. They are the astonishment of Europe because Ireland gives more information to the EEC in relation to the applications she makes than any other country.  We have been congratulated on doing that.  Ireland is not responsible for publications issued by the European Commission.  They are the responsibility of the Commission itself.</P>

Who has complained about the inadequacy of the information given to the EEC Commission?  Where is the evidence of this inadequacy? None exists and therefore it could not be produced.</P>

I wonder what the people of Limerick might think if Limerick were to be cut out because of Deputy Herbert's zeal to try and embarrass the Irish Government and to belittle and besmirch the reputation of Ireland in the European Community&mdash;a reputation which Mr. George Thomson, a Scotsman, defended against the malicious onslaught of Deputy Herbert and some of his colleagues.  It is high time this tactic was brought to an end.</P>
      <P>Deputy Herbert asked questions in the European Parliament last December, February and the latest one, from which I quoted today.  The Commission gave him an answer he did not like.

      <P>I accept what the Deputy says, but it sounded like that from here.  Article 7.2 (b) from the Official Journal of the European Communities reads:</P>
      <P>In respect of investments in infrastructure, the location of each investment and its character, and its direct link with the development of the activities referred to in Article 4 (1) (a), the predicted total costs and the costs borne by public authorities and the schedule laid down for their payment, the name of the responsible authorities, the total contribution requested from the Fund, and estimates regarding the implementation schedule.</P>
      <P>That obligation has been fulfilled at all times by this country.  If it had not we would not have received assistance from the Commission.  It is because we did it, and were the first to do it properly, that Ireland received aid from the Commission when other countries were still trying to learn how to make proper applications.</P>
      <P>This country must spend 100 per cent of the money on infrastructure before she receives any refund from the European Regional Fund, and then she receives a refund of only 30 per cent.  That means the State will have paid 70 per cent, for which no refund is received.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the public capital programme booklet which was put on the table of this House.  It identified the manner in which Ireland would be using the £12 million which would be obtainable from the regional fund this year.  We said that money would make it possible for this country to increase her overall capital investment in this manner&mdash;and we spelled it out&mdash; Industrial Development Authority, £8.5 million; Gaeltarra Éireann, £1.5 million; SFADCo, £1 million; telephones, £1 million: total, £12 million. We are unique in the Community because we spell out, in our own capital budget at the beginning of the year, the way we propose to apply the money we will receive from the Community. If that money were not coming from the Community, and if we did not qualify for all the projects we detailed to the Community, then our public capital programme would be reduced by that amount.</P>
      <P>Let this be understood: important as it is to Ireland to get this money, it is not the beginning or ending of our public capital programme.  It is only about 2 per cent of our total programme.  It is not a question of having difficulty in producing information for Brussels.  We could snow Brussels under with projects and we qualify under virtually every item for the public capital.  Would Deputy Herbert stop trying to dirty Ireland's name at home and abroad.</P>

A full reply is being given because statistics in respect of the year ended 27/12/75 have become available since the Deputy's question was answered on 15th June, 1976.  It should be noted that figures in respect of (c) are for wages and salaries only, whereas the earlier figure also included employers' superannuation and social welfare contributions.</P>
