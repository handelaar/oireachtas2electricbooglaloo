      <P>The parliamentary draftsman on re-examining the Bill advised that this provision was unnecessary because the only fee payable under the Bill was in respect of an acquisition order under section 32.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 51, to add a new subsections as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) The Board shall not export natural gas unless it has already been liquefied within the jurisdiction of the State or subjected to such other processing as the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall approve in advance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In putting down this amendment we appreciate that it would be most unlikely that we would be exporting natural gas from the present gas supply of Kinsale.  We envisage bigger strikes and, hopefully, more natural gas being available and the day could arrive when we would be exporting natural gas.  Under present technology the only way it can be exported is in liquefied form.  This is the way it is exported from the Middle East and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>We believe it should be liquefied within the jurisdiction of this country. We are not confining such processes to within these shores.  It is feasible that at some time in the not too distant future modern technology will devise a means by which it can be done at sea.  To get the maximum benefit from this activity for this nation, we believe all liquefying and downstream activities should be carried out by this country within our own jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give another example.  It appears that we will be exporting concentrates from the Tara mines thereby losing heavily with regard to employment and so on.  The same thing could happen with natural gas if it is not used properly to the benefit of the <Col N="1431" /> people and creating more employment. We put down this amendment to be prepared for any future situation when we may be exporting natural gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment which may prove to be one of the most important to be put down by either side of the House.  It puts the emphasis on the process of liquefying natural gas at home, thus providing employment.  The gas finds off our southern coasts might well be sent to the bigger cities, Dublin, Waterford, Galway, in liquid form as Britain and most countries are doing at the moment.  There is a great need to establish a liquefying plant in Cork or at sea.  We must move quickly to ensure that the distribution of Kinsale gas will not be hampered by the fact that we have it only in its natural form.  If we had a liquefying plant we could export the gas and also serve our own cities.  This would save the expense of laying mains all over the country.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reject this amendment.  Section 8 subsection (7), reads:</P>
      <P>The board shall not export gas or construct a pipeline, except pursuant to and in accordance with a consent given by the Minister under this subsection and the Minister shall, if he thinks fit, when giving such a consent attach conditions to the consent, and in addition to the foregoing, where the consent relates to the export of gas, the consent shall be given by the Minister only after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection allows, if necessary, for the liquefication of gas.  To write into legislation that any gas exported must be liquefied first might present tremendous problems in the future. For instance, there could be a situation years hence where small gas fields would be found at the edge of the Irish continental shelf.  It might be more advantageous to sell that directly to the British in return for something else.  To insist that such a field off <Col N="1432" /> the east coast of Ireland should first be brought to Ireland, liquefied and then exported would make it unnecessarily expensive.  There is the further point that if very big gas finds off our coast were brought ashore and put into a national grid to serve the country. I would visualise that the pipelines would be extended up the east coast and on to Belfast.  Acceptance of this amendment would mean liquefying the gas at the Border before sending it on whereas the obvious thing to do would be to extend the pipeline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are disappointed that the Minister does not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should bear that last point in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were in that fortunate position we should quickly pass amending legislation.  If there is a large gas find off the south coast there would be tremendous pressure or encouragement to pipe that gas direct to northern France where they are seriously short of natural energy at present.  We do not envisage the likelihood of piping gas to Britain because Britain has ample gas of her own.  Though all the gas finds are in the North Sea, the British gas grid has now extended as far as South Wales, and other places on the west coast of Britain are being supplied through the national grid from the North Sea.  There would be no question of our piping gas to Britain because she does not want it.  We foresee a huge demand for gas in Brittany and Normandy and that there will be encouragement to pipe the gas from our southern waters to the French coast. We would like to avoid a situation in which a large quantity of gas would be pumped in untreated form into France because one of the great benefits of gas or oil finds is the value that can be added at home for our benefit.  To sell the gas in an unprocessed form is not adding the substantial value that could be added.  I appreciate the Minister's point, but we are trying to avoid the piping of gas from our southern waters to France in an unprocessed state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> In addition, there may be major gas finds off the west coast.  The water off the west coast is very deep and the distance from the shore would be considerable. Apparently the most promising places are over 200 miles from the Galway coast.</P>
    <P>There is the danger that the gas will not be brought ashore and will be taken away in an unprocessed form.  I understand that it will be possible in the reasonably foreseeable future to establish a liquefication plant in the sea.  This means it will not be necessary to land the gas from far out at sea.  That, of course, would be within the jurisdiction of this State and would be subject to financial and other controls.  Our concern is that none of our gas leaves our jurisdiction without maximum value being added to it.  The direction in which it is most likely to go is towards France. We feel it should be liquefied on land or at sea and exported in tankers direct to northern France.  It is very disturbing that the number of jobs arising out of this gas find off Kinsale is very small.  The number of permament jobs being created is only 700 and that, unfortunately, is very small.  We are anxious to see that the maximum utilisation would be made of it.  I will not go into the whole question now of usage by the ESB but that is an example of underutilisation.  We want to avoid the situation where if there were further fairly extensive finds in the waters of the southern coast they would be piped direct to France.  We feel that it should be liquefied or processed in some other fashion if appropriate before it would leave our jurisdiction so that the maximum value would be added to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Deputy's fear about direct piping is when the gas must be landed in this country under the terms and conditions and the licences issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It cannot be exported directly by pipeline from a field off the south coast to France because the conditions of the licences issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce say that anything found must <Col N="1434" /> be landed in this country.  If the situation as envisaged by Deputy O'Malley were to come around in 20 years' time, any legislation that was there would then be looked at in the light of what would be most profitable for the economy as a whole.  I subscribe to the point made by Deputy O'Malley that as much value as possible should be added inside this country for the benefit of the Irish people but from the point of view of employment a liquefication plant is very highly capital and quite small in employment.</P>
      <P>There is no fear that except after full debate gas will be piped directly to France because that would mean that the terms of the licences would have to be changed.  The amendment put down in relation to the increase in the capital of the company would diminish the chances of that debate taking place in this House rather than improve them.  I feel that this amendment is unnecessary, that the powers under the licences issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce ensure that all gas must be landed in this country and that the power in this legislation under section 7 means that only with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself can gas be exported in any fashion.  I can attach any conditions I like to that so it is possible under the legislation to attach a conditions that it should be liquefied first.  To add in the extra power saying that all must be liquefied may in certain circumstances be a bit restrictive and not leave all the options open and it is unnecessary because the power to attach conditions is there anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as the reasons that we have given for liquefying the gas the Minister should seriously consider setting this in motion.  If you take the Dublin Gas Company as at present constituted and the prices which they are compelled to charge for gas in this city, we have a situation now where the Dublin Gas Company are paying $160 a ton for naphtha and they will be forced to continue to pay this <i>secula seculorum</i>.  Since the oil crisis it is quite obvious to everyone that the Dublin Gas Company are <Col N="1435" /> in dire straits.  They will continue to be in dire straits.  When you consider that the ESB can at the moment buy fuel oil on the open market at $60 a ton as against approximately $160 that the Dublin Gas Company are paying for naphtha.  Surely if we are to be serious about the Dublin Gas Company, we should make provision for making natural gas available to them.  The Minister on Second Stage said that the cost of piping this gas and setting up the infrastructure is overwhelming and so forth.  We know from what is happening in France and other countries that it is quite feasible and viable to import natural gas and the only way you can import it at the moment is in liquefied form.</P>
      <P>We said last week that we should seriously consider bringing it around the coast in small tankers for the benefit of the Dublin Gas Company.  To do that we would have to liquefy it.  Has anybody in the Department gone into the costing of this whole process?  If we are serious about doing something about the Dublin Gas Company and the rises to which the people were subjected to last week, we have to eliminate the naphtha element which is the only element they have got for the manufacture of gas at the moment. At present it costs nearly three times the cost of fuel oil to the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity here to broaden the whole concept of our natural resources and start on the ground floor by getting the maximum benefit from a gas find such as this. By doing this we are laying the ground work for a further find.  We should not be afraid to get involved in liquefying the natural gas whether modern technology will permit it to be done at sea or on shore.  We would create more employment at the construction stage and surely we would create a number of permanent jobs afterwards when it was in operation. We cannot see any reason why the Minister will not accept our amendment. It sets in motion something that would be worthwhile and it ensures that there will be no further waste and that we will get the maximum benefit from the natural gas not only from <Col N="1436" /> the present strike but from any future strikes.</P>
    <P>The Minister said earlier that he visualised a situation where we would send piped natural gas from a well of ours into Wales or somewhere and they in turn might pipe it from their area into our country.  According to the Minister, you cannot pipe it anywhere unless it is landed on the shore so that argument, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, would never arise because of how plentiful natural gas is in the North Sea and Britain has lots of it. We are ensuring that the greatest use will be made of the present find of natural gas and anything that is found in the future and our proposal is helpful in getting to grips with the present situation with the Dublin Gas Company which otherwise will go on and on and they will continue to be screwed by the multi-national oil companies for naphtha as has been done for the last three years with the result that the gas consumers in Dublin will have to pay the bills.  We could really start doing something about this problem at the moment.  Our amendment is a way of getting this business in motion.  We believe it is a reasonable amendment; it is for the benefit of everyone and it should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect which would create a further demand would be if we had a liquefying process in Cork or at Achill Point.  It is sad to say that Irish Shipping Ltd. have not even one tanker in their whole fleet. I can visualise a situation where if the Minister decided to press ahead with liquefication we could well have Verolme Dockyard building a suitable tanker in order to transport the liquefied gas from Cork or Kinsale all over the country.  The Minister should look at this aspect.  We should start off here on a firm basis for the use of this most precious new source of fuel.  The Government should be imaginative in their approach and decide now to put the emphasis on the liquefication of the gas and the carrying by tanker to the various parts of the country. The Minister will appreciate that Verolme Dockyard is very competent to build a type of tanker we want. <Col N="1437" /> We have something very definite here where we could use ships made in Cork to carry this fuel to other parts of the country.  The Minister should seriously consider the acceptance of this amendment and what it could lead to as regards demand for the construction of even small tankers which could carry the liquefied gas.  People will argue that we might as well use a maid to take the gas all over the country.  In the last world war the allies had PLUTO, a pipeline under the ocean by which they carried petrol from England to France.  That was done in war time; here we have a much different way of doing it.  I want to impress on the Minister the need to take this amendment very seriously.  Apart from what is in it, he should consider the great things it could lead to, even in the shipbuilding line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore and Deputy Barrett have referred to the use of gas inside the State but in fact their amendment refers to the export of natural gas, that it shall not be done without liquefication.  I have a certain amount of sympathy for this idea but as regards any conditions for the export of gas, the Minister in the future, after consulting with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has all the power he wants under subsection (7) to deal with that situation. It may be right, as Deputy Moore and Deputy Barrett say, that the way to serve the Dublin Gas Company is to liquefy the gas and transport it by tanker.  I think Deputy Moore would be wrong in suggesting that the tankers that carry liquefied gas would be the same as the tankers that deal with crude oil.  They are totally different and very much more expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>These tankers are very specialised.  That would be one of the options for the use of further finds of natural gas but, as I said earlier all the options are being examined by Bord Gáis Éireann.  It may or may not prove feasible but the power is in the Bill for the board to liquefy the gas if they wish to do so <Col N="1438" /> and to transport it by pipeline or by other means.</P>
      <P>Here we are only talking about exports of natural gas and if we get to a stage where we have a surplus of natural gas, obviously the Government of the day would like to see as much value added to it inside the country as possible.  If it is considered best to liquefy the gas at that time the powers are there under subsection (7) and conditions can be attached by the Minister.  Therefore, I do not think the amendment is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that potentially this can be done under subsection (7) but we cannot be certain that it will be done.  We feel it should be written into the Bill whether as we suggest, by an additional subsection, or by some amendment or addition to subsection (7).  How it is done does not matter greatly but we would like to ensure that it is done.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that under subsection (7) these conditions could be imposed but we have no guarantee that they would be imposed.  I want to raise a query on one point the Minister spoke of earlier, about it being a conditions of all the licences hitherto issued that gas found under those licences would be landed here. I have not seen individual licences, only the general terms published, and I do not think that is so.  It is not a matter of great concern, but the provision as I recall it is that the Minister can direct what is to be done with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy the wording.  It says that it must be landed except with the Minister's consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point because some of the gas&mdash;hopefully &mdash;will be found in 2,000-2,300 feet of water 200 miles or more west of our west coast and there is no way within the next 12 or 15 years by which that gas can be landed other than by pipeline.  It will have to be brought up into tankers and in order to be put in tankers it must be liquefied there because it is not possible to transport the gas otherwise. A technology of some kind of floating <Col N="1439" /> liquefication plant in deep water will have to be developed; otherwise, we shall not be able to make any use of the gas because it will not be possible to lay a pipeline to land either gas or oil from a point 200 miles west of Slyne Head in 2,300 feet of water. That cannot be done within the next 10 or 12 years unless some appropriate form of submarine technology is developed.  I believe that is being worked on at present but the gas or oil will not be commercially recoverable, if they are discovered, for perhaps 10 or 20 years.  This may be a minor point but it is one that must be borne in mind, that in the immediate future it is only finds of the type made off Kinsale Head where the water is very shallow&mdash;I think it is only 300 feet&mdash;and where the find is very close to the shore as it is there, only 30 miles, I think, off-shore, that commercial recoverability is on at the moment.</P>
      <P>In considering this section, which lays down the powers of the board, as the amendment also seeks to do, we must think a good deal ahead and consider situations we can hardly envisage at present, the most important of which is that, hopefully, the really important gas and oil fields are not the little ones we now know of off the Cork coast but will be huge ones 200 or 250 miles west of Galway and Donegal.  The technology that will be involved is totally and fundamentally different from what is now involved off the Cork coast.  This Bill should look ahead as far as possible at this stage to that sort of situation which will be fundamentally different from that with which we are now dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept largely all that Deputy O'Malley says.  We are really looking into a very misty future in which we cannot see what will happen.  Perhaps he is right.  I do not know if the major finds will be off the west coast but what we are seeking to do here is to retain the control of the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of the Government <Col N="1440" /> over what is done with any finds of oil or gas off our shores.  I agree we cannot see what will happen in the future and therefore, we should not excessively limit Ministers in future as to what will be done.  We must see that the control is within these shores and that the people who discover the gas cannot do as they like with it and under the licensing conditions by the Minister for Industry and Commerce they must land it.  After that, it is the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power, who will decide what is to be done with it.  If they allow exportation, it can only be exported subject to such conditions as are imposed by the Minister for Transport and Power.  That would include perhaps, liquefication or perhaps something else will be developed in the meantime.  We should not at this stage say, in relation to something that will happen in 20 years' time, that it must be done in a particular, confined way. We must leave it as open as possible so long as we ensure that we have the control here over what is being done.  We should not say that in 20 years' time it can only be exported in liquid form when other technology may be developed in the meantime. We should leave it open to the Minister at that time to ensure that it can be exported only subject to the conditions he imposes.  That may mean liquefication but we do not know at this stage.  We should thus ensure that the control is tight for the Minister concerned and not tie his hands too firmly in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister to accept an amendment which would compel the Government to ensure that it can be exported in liquefied form only.  Our amendment is much broader, as can be seen from reading it.  With this amendment we are making absolutely certain that the <Col N="1441" /> best possible use will be made of, and the maximum benefit derived from, natural gas finds whether they be at 200 feet or 2,000 feet.  It may well be that it would be better business from the country's point of view to export some of this gas if it is a few hundred miles out at sea.  It will also be to the benefit of the country to have whatever processing is necessary for its export carried out within this jurisdiction, whether that be at sea or on land.  We must ensure that we reap the maximum benefit from natural gas.  We are making absolutely certain of this.  We are not asking the Minister to accept something which would compel any exporter to have it liquefied. We are leaving it open.</P>

      <P>I do not see the point in the amendment. I do not think it is necessary or that it improves the Bill.  All the powers that the Deputy rightly seeks to have in the hands of an Irish Governemnt are in the Bill already.  What I would be concerned about is that the people who discover the gas should not be the people to decide what should be done with it.  That should be in the hands of an Irish Government, whoever may constitute that Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment on this section has been passed.  This is an important section inasmuch as it sets out in some detail the functions of the board.  There are just a few general observations I should like to make with regard to their functions.  I have read this very <Col N="1443" /> long section as carefully as I could. It seems to me to give power to the board, if it sees fit, to construct a gas grid in this country and to deliver gas to the cities or larger urban areas if it believes it to be economic and so on.  Obviously this will be very costly. If I am not mistaken, the current estimate of that cost is approximately £120 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can pick any figure he likes ranging from £10 million to £200 million, depending on whichever expert he consults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A fairly authoritative figure at present is £120 million. That is not to say it will not be more if and when the grid is built.  But so far as it can reasonably be guessed at present, approximately £120 million is the figure, which is a great deal of money.  There is no question about that.  Unfortunately, the problem with which we are faced is that basically our population is too small; we are dealing with only three million people, when a country like Holland, much smaller in area, has perhaps three or four times as many people to supply and can, much more economically construct a grid of this kind.  We must face the situation that we have a terribly sparse population.  For that reason the economies of a national gas grid are more questionable than they would be in a more compact or thickly populated country such as Britain where it is clearly very economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an alternative method of supplying the domestic market&mdash; Deputy Moore spoke about this already this morning&mdash;that is, the construction here of a liquefication plant and the use of small, purpose-built tankers to go around to cities&mdash;assuming it was built near Cork Harbour&mdash; and deliver the liquefied gas to the municipal undertakings in, say, Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Dundalk and such other cities as would be in a position to take it.  Apart from the construction of a grid and its incidental costs, it would be necessary to adapt existing appliances in existing municipal supply areas, the cost of <Col N="1444" /> which would be fairly hefty.  I do not know what would be the exact figure for that but obviously it would be a significant one.</P>
    <P>What we would have wished to have seen at this stage is a fairly authoritative costing of all possible domestic uses of natural gas put before the House by the Minister and the Government.  That is not an unreasonable request.  The Minister told me a few minutes ago, quite truthfully, that when one tries to estimate the cost of constructing a national gas grid here one can almost pick any figure from £10 million to £200 million, depending on whichever expert one consults.  I am afraid that is basically the situation and it is a pity that that is so.  We would have wished that the Minister would have come in here on a Bill such as this, in a debate on the Estimate for Transport and Power, or on some other suitable occasion, and said: &ldquo;We have had a study carried out on our behalf.  It would cost £X million, at current prices, to build a national gas grid; it would cost £Y million to adapt existing domestic appliances for conversion to natural gas; it would cost £Z million to manufacture a liquefication plant and build two, three or whatever number of tankers would be necessary to deliver it to the various cities, to the existing municipal gas plants.&rdquo;  We would then be in a position to consider these various alternatives so that we might reach a decision as a House and as a country generally as to what would constitute the best value.  Unfortunately, though, we are not in that position. We are at the beck and call of a myriad of experts whose figures vary enormously from one another.  Few, if any of us, is qualified enough to decide which figures are right and which are wrong.  This is a task that should be undertaken by the Department but it should have been undertaken before now.  There is provision in some section of the Bill for the carrying out of an extensive detailed study but it is somewhat late in the day for us to be only starting that study now.  We have known of the commercial availability of gas off our shores for the past three or four years and we are hoping to have some of <Col N="1445" /> that gas ashore within two years.  The gas found up to now is committed but, in the opinion of many of us, not committed as beneficially as it might have been.</P>
    <P>This section is very broad.  It will not tie the board to any great extent but will enable them to adopt either of the alternatives I am talking of in relation to internal domestic supply. However, we should know where we stand in relation to these potential internal uses of gas.  We should know what are the economics of the situation. There is no problem in so far as the technology involved is concerned. This has all been done in other countries. What may be economic in Britain and Holland which are densely populated compared with Ireland may not be economic for us.  These are factors which would have to be studied not only by gas experts but by those concerned with the social aspect of the situation.  It is proposed in the Bill to ask the board to initiate such studies but in discussing the Bill we should have available to us the sort of information which will be available after the study has been completed. We should know, for instance, whether we are to have a gas grid or a liquefication plant and delivery by tanker. Unhappily, we do not even know when that information will be available. This is a great pity.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise to the Minister and, through him, to the future board, that, in performing their function, the board should go out of their way to try to utilise the gas in the way in which there is the minimum wastage and minimum loss of its thermal or calorific value.  Unfortunately, the major use proposed up to now will cause a heavy wastage.  The greatest benefit and the least wastage will result if, as is the case in Britain and Holland, the gas is piped direct into existing gas undertakings and municipal gas plants.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to come down in favour either of a national gas grid or of a liquefication and tanker-delivery system since I do not know the economics involved in either operation and I am afraid that the Minister does not have this information either.  However, <Col N="1446" /> I would urge him that, regardless of whether the task is undertaken by the board or by the Department, a study of the various alternatives should be carried out at the earliest date possible so that we might be in a position to implement as soon as possible whichever is the most beneficial system.</P>
    <P>There is one matter of detail in relation to subsection (5) on which I should like to comment.  Is the provision here not unusual?  I have not seen the same sort of provision in legislation of this sort to date.  I refer to the provision to specify in the accounts of the board any subscriptions made of more than £1,000 or which, in the aggregate, amount to £1,000.  I am inquiring gently as to what exactly this is intended to cover.  Does it refer to political contributions or to the sponsorship of races, for instance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last question first, the Deputy is right in saying that this is the first time for a provision of this kind to appear in legislation. The reason for it is that the Department of Finance are anxious that in any future legislation setting up any body of this kind a provision of this nature would appear so that the Department would be aware of what State bodies are giving money to apart from the normal activities for which they were set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the study the Deputy referred to, perhaps he did not spot the reference to this in my Second Reading speech where I said that I am arranging to have such a study undertaken. This study will be expensive, difficult and may take some time but I agree that both in the House and in the country generally we must take every step to ensure the most beneficial and economic use of any further resources.  Those Deputies who have contributed to the debate commented that the Dublin Gas Company should be given either the existing or some future finds of natural gas.  In this regard let us consider the quantities we are talking of.  Everybody knows that the Kinsale gas find is very small by international standards although it means a lot to us.  Small as it is, only about 10 per cent of it would be utilised <Col N="1447" /> to satisfy the demand for town gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As established at present, but this is because town gas is very dear and also very bad.  Tens of thousands more people would be willing to use natural gas if it were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In England the expansion rate is about 11 per cent per year.  On that basis it would take us approximately six years to increase the proportion of our find from 10 to 20 per cent for domestic use.  This would leave us with a huge quantity for which to find use.  Naturally, it would be our wish to get the benefits to the economy as quickly as possible so in the case of the Kinsale find we were faced with finding quickly big users.  In the event of future finds this section of the Bill is broad enough to allow the board make what they consider to be the best use of the gas but they should not do that without first having a study undertaken as to the economics of the various possible uses to which the gas could be put.  In the event of a liquefication plant, for instance, the cost of the big tankers that would be required would be enormous. We are talking here about natural gas and I am not sure if the technology to liquefy this is available. It is going to be enormously expensive and perhaps would not work out, but every option for the use of natural gas in the future is going to be looked at under the headings I referred to in the Second Reading speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other points referred to, I accept that this must be a matter of concern to everybody in the country, that there should be as much debate as possible over the various uses of natural gas before a decision is taken.  Any option or series or combination of options that might turn up in the future for the use of natural gas are allowed for in the subsection. The Minister and the board in question would then have the right to choose between those various options in the future and hopefully there will be a debate in this House either <Col N="1448" /> on my Estimate or some other form, and legislation on that.</P>
    <P>Section 9, the following section, gives even further power to the Minister in this regard.  In case there is anything omitted in section 8 the Minister under section 9 can take further power and invoke existing power to ensure that all options are broadened further to take account of any further work which may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we leave this most important section of the Bill, we know it takes over the functions, liabilities and so forth of Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta.  We maintain that these examinations should have been initiated about two years ago or whenever it became reasonably certain that we were going to find gas.  It is not such an insurmountable task, in our opinion, to go into the costings with regard to liquefying gas and bringing it from the coast by tanker to make it available to the Dublin Gas Company. There are three main factors involved, namely liquefying, the cost of transport and the adapting of appliances.</P>
      <P>Taking the last one first, how to cost the adapting of appliances, this gas is to be made available in Cork city for domestic uses, so there must be a way of costing what is to be costed under that heading in Cork city. From that costing it should not be impossible to estimate what it is going to cost in Dublin city.  We know Cork is not as big as Dublin, but it is a starting point.</P>
      <P>Number 2 is the transport cost and tanker costs.  This is the easiest of all to find out because they are already in estimates.  I do not know if tankers for the transportation of gas are as plentiful as oil tankers.  If they are only one per cent as plentiful it would pay to take them.  So there is no cost problem where transport is concerned. Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta should have done this long before now.</P>

    <P>With regard to liquefying, again that is not impossible to cost.  If Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta wanted to do if they could have done it.  I have no doubt that liquefication of natural gas is already taking place in other <Col N="1449" /> countries.  In the Middle East gas is being exported in liquefied form into France.  Surely costing is a further process they understand.  To maintain that nobody can estimate it is a lot of codology, in my opinion.  These things are already happening in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>By all these standards Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta, through the Department, should have been able to apply this.  They are in existence for about two years, and the only thing they have done in that time, as far as I can see, under their functions, which are now being taken over by this board, was to throw away 60 per cent of their natural gas to the ESB.  The argument they swallowed was that they should do this in order to create viability out of the wealth they have in order to sell as much as possible and as quickly as possible.  This is the argument put forward for giving this gas to the ESB.  People must not lose sight of the fact that the board by giving this function to the ESB ensured the loss of perhaps up to 75 per cent of the thermal value of that natural gas. That is happening and, whatever is said about viability or about the price, one has to decide between quantity and money, and if you are wasting that percentage of what the ESB gets you cannot be talking of less than about 10 per cent of the total wealth coming into Dublin, possibly between 7 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course it would make it more viable if you are balancing tremendous losses created against tremendous use created in Dublin for the benefit of consumers.  How can anyone be persuaded that it makes the wealth more viable to use as much of it as possible immediately?  Even some of the people writing articles can prove that they are basing their figures on diesel oil.  We have to avoid the tremendous wastage which has been created by the forerunner of this board, which is an inescapable fact. This has happened and should not be permitted to happen, but we will come to that later.</P>
    <P>We come to the costing for the Dublin consumer market and making gas available to the Dublin Gas Company <Col N="1450" /> for liquefication.  I want to ensure it is quite possible and feasible to get those costings and Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta should have had those long before now if they are capable of doing it.  If they are offering it to Cork people it seems they must be able to estimate what the converting of appliances is going to cost. Certainly if we consider countries such as France who are comparable for transport of gas in liquefied form, it should not be difficult to find out this aspect of it.  If this is going to be a long drawn out business my suggestion is that the Minister would consent to send Deputy O'Malley and myself to the Middle East where we can study this aspect.</P>

      <P>I do not know where to start in answering all that.  Most of it is emotional and bears no relation to the land in which the Government has to live.  It may be one in which we would live if the Opposition were in power.  Apparently the Deputy disagreed with the decision to allocate gas to the ESB and he refers frequently to how much study is done in making natural resources available, how much study he is doing, and what alternative, but he has in his think-tank to catch on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta did not decide to allocate gas to the ESB.  The Government made that decision, again on the basis of a report from the Department of Industry and Commerce long before Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta was set up.</P>
      <P>There were other questions besides economic ones.  I do not accept that in the conversion of natural gas to electricity there would be a 75 per cent wastage, according to Deputy Barrett, or even the 60 per cent Deputy O'Malley spoke of.  Even the Fianna Fáil experts cannot agree on what the wastage would be.  It is a difficult complex question and if a person is a gas fan he will say the wastage is very high but if he is an electricity fan he will say there is no wastage at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> This affects not only Dublin.  Cork, Limerick, Waterford and I think Drogheda are affected.  We must remember that we will still be using only 20 per cent of the output of this field and have to find users for the balance.  In three years oil prices have quadrupled, affecting the prices of fertilisers and oil for industrial purposes. It is essential, therefore, in the context of our international payments, that the ESB should be able to use home produced raw materials.  We should do everything possible to make ourselves self-sufficient in fertilisers. We can generate only a limited amount of electricity from hydro and peat sources and would have to depend on imported oil for many years ahead.  In our own interests we should seek to lessen that dependence and to use indigenous sources to an optimum degree.  All things were taken into consideration by the Government and subsequent to their decision An Bord Gáis was set up to come in between the customers to whom gas would be allocated and Marathon, the discoverer of the gas, to handle the contracts and to build pipelines to distribute the gas to the people to whom it would be allocated.  The study made at that time agreed that that was the correct decision.  It might not be correct in regard to a further find at another time but in regard to this one it was correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives me cause for concern.  Perhaps subsection (3) lessens the degree of concern because draft orders have to be passed by each House and therefore the changes cannot be put through on the quiet or without the publicity attached to public debate on them. However, the section is an unusual one.  During the years there have been Bills of this kind setting up State boards and they have a lot in common, the limitations on the boards' functions being pretty well defined. If they want a change or an extension of their functions they must come here for legislation.</P>
      <P>In this section there is a new concept in that the Minister may make an order extending the board's powers, duties or functions.  The order would be made in draft form and would need the approval of both Houses, with which I concur, but in view of the wide range of section 8 it would be preferable if this section were extended so that the Minister would have to come back and legislate again.  I agree that what can be done in subsection (3) is a type of legislation but it is not legislation proper.  I am sure the Minister will produce some old Act from about six years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not opposed to the section but if Deputy de Valera were here he would be very eloquent on it because it proposes the kind of thing that gets under his skin.  This is Parliament giving away to a great extent its functions in relation to an important public matter&mdash;the limitations on the powers of a State board, and this is going to be a very important State board.  It may not be that important when dealing with only a small gas field like that off Kinsale Head but, please God, in five or ten years' time natural gas will be a really significant factor in Irish economic life.  It will probably be more important than the ESB is at the moment.  It will probably be really vital to our economic, social and industrial life for decades to come and one wonders is it right that the Minister should have this kind of omnibus section under which he can confer additional functions on the board.  Even though there is this subsection (3) requiring the approval of both Houses, if you take the analogy of an ordinary company, this would be like forming a company, setting out its powers in the memorandum in the usual way, and then it would be as if the Companies Act contained some sort of provision allowing the directors to extend the powers more or less off their own bat.</P>

      <P>To the shareholders. At the moment there is a way of doing this but it is a very laborious way and properly so.  You have to publicise the changes you propose to make and get the approval of the High Court sitting in public.  I suppose one can draw some kind of analogy here but one wonders if section 9 is necessary when section 8 is so wide ranging. <Col N="1454" /> If it is necessary to change the functions of the board in some significant way because of things we cannot foresee at the moment, like a major find in deep water off the west coast, would it not be better to come back to the House in the ordinary way to amend the Act rather than have the functions changed by way of ministerial order subject to approval?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The analogy the Deputy draws is not quite accurate.  If any change is being made the Houses of the Oireachtas must be consulted and any order made must be laid before both Houses and passed by both before it can take effect.  Section 8 gives the board very wide powers.  It is possible the board might wish in future to become involved in exploration for and exploitation of natural gas and section 9 is designed to cope with that situation and with what is now, perhaps, unforeseen.  Deputy O'Malley says, hopefully, this will be one of the most important boards in the country if there are further finds.  Here we are dealing with something totally new.  We have no practical experience.  Anything we have learned we have had to pick up around the world.  Naturally, there may be something we cannot foresee now which will have to be catered for in the future.  In that eventuality the Minister, if he wants to extend the powers of the board, must come back to this House and to the Seanad and get their agreement, giving his reasons for looking for whatever extra power it is for the board.</P>

In recent years the pricing policy of the ESB has led to a great deal of discussion.  When one reads the debates that took place on the 1927 Act one realises how significant the ESB subsequently became and one wonders why the-powers-that-were did not go into the matter more deeply at that time.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There could.  If the Deputy looks at section 11, it provides:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance give the Board such general directives concerning the pricing policy as to the sale or supply of gas or the financial objectives of the Board as he considers appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visualise the major capital investment made in the early years of the board.  The capital investment for the Kinsale find would be made in the early years and the revenue would accrue over 20 years and so the interest on the capital should be a charge on the revenue over the 20-year period and it would balance in <Col N="1456" /> that sense.  Section 11 makes it looser than the corresponding section in the ESB legislation.  I do not think the Minister has power in that case to give the board directions in financial matters but in this case the Minister for Finance can allow the board to spread its charges over a much longer period than is the case in the ESB. In the latter case I believe they must earn every year what they spend every year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make any great point about it but you could have a situation where they would be forced by the direction of the Minister to repay the capital in three or four years.  My point might be more relevant on the next section but, if they were compelled to do that, the price of gas would be forced up artificially and this is something that gives rise to concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to avoid that these sections are in.  That is what happens in the ESB.  They have to do it every year and this forces up their charges.  They have to repay their capital in a limited period and that forces up the price artificially.  It is to avoid that situation these sections are here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal commercial way the plant for which a company borrowed money would be depreciated over a period of 15 or 20 years.  It would be a longish period <Col N="1457" /> and the capital would be gradually paid into a sinking fund over that period.  My point is that the Minister for Finance, in order to get back his capital, could force the board to repay in four years and the price of gas would be shoved up artificially. One can envisage this happening in bad economic circumstances like the present.  The figure here is £25 million. We believe that will be inadequate but, assuming £25 million is borrowed from the Exchequer and given to Bord Gáis Éireann, the Minister for Finance of the day might be caught for money for capital development and force the board to repay the borrowing in, say, four years, when the normal commercial period would be 15 years and I suggest this would force up the price of gas artificially. Sections 10 and 11 are very broad in their terms of what they will allow.  I suggest they could allow that kind of situation which would be undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will not be borrowing from the Exchequer, even though they could, but on the ordinary commercial market.  They would write into their balance sheet depreciation, I suppose, at the rate at which they got the loan.  If they got a 12-year or a 15-year loan they would write 8 per cent of whatever it is into the balance sheet.  The Minister for Finance would then instruct them to write that off over four years.  He would, in effect, then be borrowing from Bord Gáis Éireann.  The amount between the time he insisted it be repaid and whatever length of time they got the loan for.  That would be of no benefit to any Minister for Finance unless by pure chance the times happened to coincide, in a particular year.  He might develop a policy to do this but it would be one which would only repay him after he got the loans through at the end of whatever period he decided, whether it was a three- or four-year period.  I do not believe this is a very real problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2 b:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> In page 8, subsection (2), line 38, after &ldquo;direction&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided that not more than 25 per cent of such profits in such a year shall be applied for the benefit of the Exchequer other than payment of advances or interest thereon.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of this section says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance direct that the profit of the Board in a year specified in the direction shall be applied in such manner (including application for the benefit of the Exchequer as is specified in the direction.</P>
    <P>We put down this amendment in order to limit what the Minister for Finance could take to 25 per cent.  It is very important, if we are serious about using the gas, that we provide low cost energy, where possible, and where it can be utilised.  In view of past experience with this Minister, the big taxation put on petrol and also the last budget when 2p across the board was put on all oil products, those taxation measures have had a very serious effect on industry and other users of oil.</P>
    <P>Those taxation measures are a far greater burden on industry than anybody anticipated at the time of the budget.  At that time people are usually concerned about how much taxation is put on liquor, tobacco and the other hardy annuals.  This type of budget taxation has had a very serious effect on industry.  It is making industry far less competitive.  It is now estimated that this is costing industry approximately £38 million.</P>
    <P>We are attempting in this amendment to limit any type of action that would be detrimental to gas users in the future.  Low cost energy is a very important asset to any country for employment and everything to do with the gas.  Gas in England at the moment is providing low cost energy.  Now the electricity authority and the coal board over there find they cannot compete against it.  They have been lobbying the Minister concerned to put 20 per cent or 40 per cent taxation on natural gas in order to permit them <Col N="1459" /> to compete.  We believe that is the wrong approach.  The more low cost energy we can provide and can continue to provide, the more beneficial it will be for every one concerned and the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>There have been many hidden measures in recent budgets.  A rake has been taken off fuel.  This has had a dreadful effect on the economy, particularly the industrial sector.  We put down this amendment in order to prevent situations like that getting out of hand.  We want to limit the Minister for Finance to a 25 per cent take because we believe that this is a realistic approach to this problem.  We know from experience in the last two years, where energy taxation is concerned, the effect it has had on the economy.  We are attempting to remedy this situation in the future with particular reference to the use of gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  It would be wrong to limit the Minister for Finance or any Government Department in this way. Deputy Barrett quoted the case in England of the conflict between natural gas, the coal board and the electricity generating stations.  If that happened here it would mean that one section of energy users would get a cheaper supply than another.  I do not believe that is desirable.  It would distort competition among various users. People using electricity as a source of energy would have to pay more than the people using gas, if this amendment were accepted.  That would not be desirable.  It would create a distorted market in gas, that because it was cheaper people would come away from using turf and electricity and try to get natural gas, which would increase the flow from the present and future fields and deplete our resources much faster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has to be a policy in the energy sector where one source of energy is not more advantageous to its users than another source of energy.  The correct way to get the benefits from the use of all energies into the Exchequer is to give the Minister for Finance the power to <Col N="1460" /> take any excess profits in that regard and then use them in other ways for the good of the community, whether it be for social welfare benefits, the establishment of industry or something else.  The correct thing in this case is to give the Minister for Finance the right to cream off those profits and put them back into the economy wherever the need is greatest. Deputy Barrett proposes in this amendment that the benefit of all gas in the economy should go to gas users and not to electricity users, road users, social welfare recipients or anybody else except inasmuch as they would use gas.</P>

      <P>Let us analyse this calmly.  The Minister for Transport and Power is now doing what Mr. Benn has been asked to do and will not do.  A conference is going on in Westminster at the moment between all the various conflicting interests. Mr. Benn is trying to do the best he can to keep them all under control and keep them together.  There is serious conflict in Britain between coal and electricity on the one side and gas on the other.  Gas is substantially and significantly cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a considerable increase in the use of gas since cheap natural gas became available in Britain. The demand for electricity is not increasing at the rate at which it might have and the use of coal in Britain is declining.  There are vast stocks of coal that should have been used, either by the electricity generating stations or domestically, that are not being <Col N="1461" /> used because they are being replaced by an alternative, cheaper and more efficient form of energy in natural gas, of which Britain is fortunate to have an abundance at the moment.  The Minister will have to reflect on all of this.  What he has said has been very important.  He has said he regards it as wrong that one form of energy should be cheaper than another form.</P>

      <P>That is right&mdash;to ensure that it would be kept cheaper. Our amendment certainly sets out to do that, because gas is basically cheaper than electricity.  Some 64 per cent of our electricity is generated from oil and oil is now expensive; it is three or four times more expensive than it was three years ago.  Electricity costs and charges have increased enormously and it is now very dear by European standards.  We have a certain amount of natural gas-not a lot, but enough for certain purposes. For the first time we have a cheap source of efficient native fuel.  We have had turf for many years but it is not the most efficient of fuels.  Our hydroelectric capabilities are limited because we have only a few rivers that are capable of being harnessed and all of them have been harnessed for a long time.</P>
      <P>For the first time we have a new form of native energy.  So far it is available in fairly limited quantities but, hopefully, it will be available in greater quantities.  Clearly it will be much cheaper than electricity or any other form of fuel that may become available.  If properly utilised&mdash;and Deputy Barrett has been making this case over a long period&mdash;it will give certain Irish industries a great chance that they have not had up to now.  It is a benefit that corresponding British, Dutch, Belgian and West German industries are getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the policy that is set out in section 11, and which has been enunciated with greater clarity by the Minister now, is followed, we will have the situation that the Minister for Finance <Col N="1462" /> will give directives to the board regarding the price of gas to be charged to consumers which will raise the price way above its natural and its necessary economic figure.  It will bring it to a figure that will approximate roughly to the price of energy when purchased in the form of electricity or oil.  We believe that is totally wrong.  It is throwing away the advantages that the discovery of gas can give us.</P>
    <P>The reason for our amendment is to prevent the price being forced up artificially or being manipulated in the way the Electricity Generating Board and the National Coal Board in Britain want Mr. Benn to do at the present time.  He has not done this up to now and one assumes he will not do it.  Our amendment, which would limit the percentage of the profits that could be applied for the benefit of the Exchequer to 25 per cent, would prevent the Minister for Finance of the day making a killing on the profits of the board.  The Minister for Finance of the day could use this board as a tax gathering operation.  He could raise huge sums by telling the board they would have to pay him 95 per cent of their profits.  That could be a huge tax gathering operation but it would be at the expense of the Irish economy generally and the benefits of gas would be gone.  We might as well as then be importing oil because it would amount to the same thing.</P>
    <P>We have had two examples of the thinking of the present Minister for Finance in relation to tax gathering on energy sources.  One was the sudden imposition in the House at the end of November, 1974, of an additional tax of 15p on a gallon of petrol.  It was done on the grounds that we were cheaper than Northern Ireland, that that was not right and that there would be a leakage across the Border. The second example of the thinking of the present Minister for Finance in relation to his anxiety to raise taxation out of energy sources was the imposition in the budget introduced on 28th January, 1976, of an increase of 2p per gallon right across the board on all forms of oil and petroleum products that had never been subject to any taxation before.  The oils included those used in factories and in <Col N="1463" /> industry, for central heating purposes and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance believes, in my view totally falsely, that energy sources are fair game for the raising of revenue and that huge increases and the imposition of entirely new taxes, such as the imposition of 2p per gallon last January, are justified even though they drive up costs and prices, fuel inflation in a real sense and create enormous difficulties for industry in particular.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is not accepted, whereby the Minister cannot take out of the board more than 25 per cent of the profits, we will have a situation where the Minister who can control, in the overall, the financial policy of the board, the pricing policy of the board, will seek to make Bord Gáis Éireann maximise their profits in order that he can get more from them for the Exchequer.  In effect, there will be taxation on natural gas and we will be throwing away the benefits which would have accrued to us from this very fortunate discovery and hopefully future discoveries.</P>
    <P>Natural gas will not be the cheap native source of efficient energy we expected it to be.  It will be a form of energy the price of which will be artifically driven up by the directions given under section 11 by the Minister for Finance in order that the Exchequer will benefit to the maximum degree.  While these may be called profits under section 11 of the Gas Act, 1976, as it will be, in effect they are taxation.  It would be the same as if the Minister were to come in here and move a Financial Resolution providing a tax of 10p per therm on natural gas.  I am sure the Minister sees that.  It comes to the same thing. It does not matter to the Exchequer if the £50 million a year which, perhaps, may be made out of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance could not contemplate putting a tax on natural gas to drive up the price but, in effect, he is doing that here.  If he will be able to ask for an unlimited percentage of the profits, 90 per cent or 95 per cent or whatever is left after the various charges have been paid, in effect he is putting a tax on natural gas and he is driving up the price.  The Minister has expressed it in this way but our amendment which would prevent that happening would have the effect of keeping one form of energy cheaper than others. That is precisely the point.  It would.</P>
      <P>It will be a tragedy if, after all this long waiting, we land our natural gas and find it is costing the consumer the same as the ESB's extremely dear electricity, or the Arabs' extremely dear oil.  There is no benefit to the country.  There is benefit to the Exchequer.  There is no benefit to the economy.  It will be totally wrong, in my view and in my party's view, if the Minister for Finance is able to force the board, under these directives, to adopt a pricing policy, a financial policy, which will enable the board to earn very big profits, but those profits will be creamed off by the Exchequer.  This will be the same as if he came in here and moved a financial resolution imposing taxation on natural gas.  I do not think he would do it in that form because there would be an outcry if he sought to do it.  In effect he is doing it here.</P>
      <P>We are seeking to limit what he can take to 25 per cent to try to ensure that the price level of energy will not be fixed by the ESB, or by the Arabs, and that the price level of natural gas at least will be fixed at its natural level.  In other words, the cost the board have to pay for the gas to Marathon, or whoever brings it in, plus the current cost of the equipment and plant which the board have to provide, plus some reasonable figure to cover their overheads and give them some reasonable surplus in order that they will be self-financing in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> They are the factors which should govern the price of natural gas.  A comparison with electricity, and an effort to bring the price of natural gas up to a level approximating that of electricity, is wrong.  It will diminish to an enormous extent the value of this find for us.  It will mean industry will not have the advantages it would have had.  We will, of course, have the advantage of money going into the Exchequer but we will have put ourselves in the situation which the British Government have strenuously resisted over the past number of years.  Up to the present Mr. Benn has continued to resist the urgent request of the electricity generating boards and the Coal Board to do something of the kind being done in section 11, that is, to force up the price of natural gas to an artificially high level in order that electricity and coal could better compete with it.  Mr. Benn and the British Government over the past number of years have resisted that for obvious reasons.  I believe they were right.  We should resist it here too.  It would be disastrous not to resist it.  This is a very fundamental point.  This goes to the root of energy policy.  We should think about it and think out what the long term consequences will be.</P>
    <P>It is pretty evident&mdash;and I want to draw the Minister's attention to it&mdash; that the logic of what he has said is that gas will be as dear as electricity, and electricity and oil will create the price level for energy generally.  The Minister says otherwise we would have a kind of two-tier price system and that gas would be down here and electricity and oil would be up there. That is the whole point in my view. That is what we should have.  That is why we have a public board getting in all the gas, being the only group entitled to buy the gas, buying it on behalf of the Irish nation and saying: &ldquo;We have so many million cubic feet available per day.  In the national interest we will allocate some to A, B, C and D.  We will not allocate it to those who will pay most for it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the point in setting up this public board.  If the gas is to be allocated to A, B, C and D and each is <Col N="1466" /> to be told: &ldquo;You will pay the full economic going price for energy established at the moment by virtue of the price of oil and electricity&rdquo;. that gas will be of very little use to them.  This is extremely important.  I urge that, unless this amendment in Deputy Barrett's name and my name is accepted, that will be the situation and, if that is to be the situation, the whole ball game will be very different from what many people thought it would be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does Deputy O'Malley realise what he is proposing. Does he see the effect of what he is proposing?  We have one gas find.  If we have another and a national grid is established serving Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick, he is saying to any industrialist: &ldquo;Do not go to Mayo or Galway because you cannot get natural gas there and you will be disadvantaged.  You will have to pay a high price for your energy.  If you stick to the already established centres you will get it cheap and you will blow them out&rdquo;.  That would be the end result of what Deputy O'Malley wants. It would be a crazy situation if we were to say the only areas which should develop because they have a cheap source of energy are the areas where natural gas exists.  That is not what we want to do.  We want to get these benefits for the whole economy. The Deputy quoted Mr. Benn.  This argument is going on in England and I do not know what side they will come down on.  The argument is not over here yet.  We must look deeply at this matter.  If we accept the amendment the argument is over.  That is the end of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, yes, but we must look to the future in all this, and we cannot deliberately disadvantage people; indeed we have been encouraging them to set up industries in parts of the country where perhaps there will not be natural gas.  The Deputy is wrong in taking the example of England.  The Netherlands, who have far more natural gas and are far more dependent on it than England, have always maintained a policy of an equivalent price for oil and natural gas.  The Deputy says a future Minister for Finance could use this as a method of raising money for the Exchequer.  A Minister for Finance would not need this for that purpose.  If he wants to put an excise duty on natural gas he can do it.  This merely allows the Minister to take these profits if it is desirable in the future.</P>
      <P>If it is Government policy that oil and gas should have an equivalent price in the economy so as not to distort competition among industrialists, then the Minister can take all the profits, or, alternatively, if it is decided to give out cheap gas, the Minister need not take the profits.  We are open to do either under this section, but under what Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Barrett are suggesting there is no choice.  The gas would be sold cheaply giving a certain competitive advantage to industries who by chance are situated in the line of the proposed grid.  That is not sound policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong of the Minister to say that Deputy O'Malley and myself are saying in effect in relation to this amendment that industry will not go to Mayo or other <Col N="1468" /> such places because of the low cost of gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will not go to places where there is not a natural gas supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, where there is not a natural gas supply.  At Second Stage we said very clearly that natural gas should be made available in places like Limerick, Shannon, the west, Dundalk, Drogheda, as well as Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have not got enough, how can you make it available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>How can you have enough if you are wasting 70 per cent of it?  This is the basis of the whole argument.  You cannot have enough if the Government are throwing it away.  First of all, we said it should be made available in these areas, and the purpose of making it available is to provide low cost energy.  When the oil crisis came about I remember the Minister himself and other Ministers stating in this House that we would never have low cost oil or low cost energy again, that we were in the hands of the multi-nationals, and so we were.  But now we are on the threshold of something that will permit us to have low cost energy, that will enable us to get out of the hands of the multi-nationals.  We are trying to ensure that low cost energy will continue to be made available by what we propose in regard to the usage of natural gas and what we are now proposing in this amendment, limiting the take the Minister for Finance can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned earlier that our proposal would interfere with Bord na Móna turf production and other natural sources of energy.  Let us take Board na Móna.  Even at the previous rate of production and without the increase in production that is envisaged in the immediate future, the life of the bogs in Ireland was only 30 years.  In the 30 years, without an increase in production, employment is being given to approximately 6,000 people, that is at least an expectation <Col N="1469" /> of life employment.  Therefore turf is the commodity that would be hit.</P>
    <P>The ESB have some hydro-electric schemes, a very small section of their activities.  They are mainly dependent on oil.  In England there is the Coal Board, a very powerful lobby, far more powerful than Bord na Móna could possibly be here, and they have not been able to persuade Mr. Benn to put on this taxation in order to bring up the cost of gas.  If the Minister puts on excessive taxation on low cost energy such as natural gas, if properly utilised, then it might have some affect on Bord na Móna.  The people the Minister is really helping are the multi-national oil companies. He is helping them to maintain their prices by keeping up the cost of gas which is now available to him.</P>
    <P>The multi-nationals are the people who really profited from the oil crisis, but we could do nothing about it.  Now we are in a position to do something about it, and in order to ensure that we continue to do something about it we put down this amendment to protect gas users by keeping down the cost of energy from natural gas.  By this means the multi-nationals would be made to compete.  This is a serious matter for the refineries and the multi-nationals because the price of fuel oil is falling. There were instances recently in Britain of a price war because of competition from other continental oil companies within the British market. Is this not something that would make these people who are making massive profits each year bring down the cost of what they are selling?  Is it not a good thing that we can ensure that they will bring down the cost of the energy they are providing from oil?</P>
    <P>I fail to follow the Minister's argument. What is wrong with using this natural gas in areas in the west as against electricity?  What is wrong with providing low cost energy?  Why should it be left open to the Minister for Finance to ensure that the cost of gas would be kept up to the same price as the cost of oil, benefiting nobody more than the multi-national <Col N="1470" /> oil companies.  Britain has refused to impose taxation on natural gas, and this is affecting coal, which is a very big industry.  What are we afraid of affecting?  We are afraid of affecting the oil companies.  That is what it amounts to.  They still have to sell fuel oil to the ESB.  The more low cost energy we provide the more industries we shall have and the more competitive they will be.</P>
    <P>Again I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment, because it ensures low cost energy at last without reference to the multi-national oil companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  It would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill and would mean that if there are no other finds of gas in this country, any industry that ties up the Cork Gas Company has an advantage over an industry anywhere else in the country.  That is not what we are trying to achieve. That is the effect of what the Deputies opposite are proposing.  This section allows the Minister for Finance to take off profits, if necessary. It may be that the national policy will dictate what the Opposition want, that we will say, &ldquo;to hell with everybody else; we have only this one find of gas and we are going to sell that at a cheap price&rdquo;.  That is what has happened and NET and the ESB got the advantage at this cheap price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand Deputy Barrett's allegation that the multi-nationals are going to benefit from this.  The price has been fixed already for the find of gas we have had.  That has been bought and nothing can interfere with that now.  It has been purchased by BGE at a price and if huge profits accrue to BGE they will not find their way back to Marathon or anybody else, they will be halted in BGE and to the advantage of Net and the ESB.  It may be that we will decide if there is a further find of gas off Donegal to pump the whole lot into one industry there and not give the benefit to anybody else; that we will decide for the national benefit that an industry there should have it cheaper because they are not competing inside <Col N="1471" /> the country and they will have no advantage over other industries in Ireland.  It may be that we will decide to give them the gas at a special price so that they can build up their industry but if this amendment is accepted we would be prevented from doing this. The amendment proposes to remove from BGE the power to decide that there should not be unequal competition between industries.  That is not what is desired but would be the effect of the amendment if passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this argument but the matter is very important.  I put it to the Minister that he is putting the situation wrongly.  He postulates the possibility that there will be no further finds of gas.  That is a possibility although we hope it will not happen.  In the event of there being no other finds there would be no question of anybody going to Cork Harbour, as the Minister said, to plug in there to a cheap source of power.  The Kinsale Head field is committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That field is committed, and wrongly committed in our view because the ESB are getting a lot of it.  The ESB are getting about 60 per cent and NET are getting about 40 per cent with a dribble going to the Cork Gas Company.  There is no more available and I do not see what the Ministers' argument is because there is nobody else who can use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the Deputy's argument would be that the Cork Gas Company would be getting a cheaper form of energy than the Dublin Gas Company or the Limerick Gas Company and, therefore, highly intensive industries would see that the gas is cheaper in Cork than in Dublin or Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>An industrialist with a high energy intensive industry would not be able to run that industry on the dribble being made available to the Cork Gas Company.  Presumably, <Col N="1472" /> that is being made available for domestic purposes.  They are supplying domestic consumers at present and, possibly, they may in some small way supply industrial consumers but they would not be able to make any significant additional quantity of energy available to anybody, industrialists or otherwise.  The Minister is taking a kind of situation that cannot arise.  The gas from Kinsale Head is, rightly or wrongly committed. We may not agree with the way it was committed but we must face the fact that it is committed.  If there are no other finds the problem will not arise.</P>
      <P>I should like to come back to the fundamental point here: The Minister for Finance has power under section 11 to give directives as to the pricing and financial policy.  There is an incentive for him to force the board to make huge profits in order that he can take the whole lot. Fianna Fáil think the board should not make huge profits because if they make such profits it will be at the expense of driving up the cost of natural gas to approximate to the cost of other forms of energy.  There is no competition with the existing imported forms of energy because all our oil is imported and 64 per cent of our electricity is imported.  As Deputy Barrett said, the price structure is now basically fixed for oil and, consequently, for electricity by the multi-national oil companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down through the years, particularly since 1973, we have had no chance to break the ring.  We could not do it because our native energy is limited.  We have a very small amount of hydro-electric power and we cannot get any more because all our harnessable rivers are harnessed and they are very small.  Turf is not a great source of power.  It is not a very efficient form of energy and is expensive.  It has only become worth while for Bord na Móna to expand as they are now doing because of the increase in oil prices.  They would not be expanding if there had not been the huge increase at the end of 1973 because turf is not an efficient fuel. For the first time we have something <Col N="1473" /> under our control that will help us bring down energy prices.  We can make our own gas compete with Esso, Texaco, Shell and others.  Instead of saying that we have an efficient source of native Irish fuel which we will sell at a lower cost than imported oil and electricity we are increasing the price of that native efficient fuel to the price level fixed by the multi-nationals.  We are not competing with them and we are throwing away the first and only chance we have had to break the ring that exists.  We will have no competition because we will continue to let them call the tune.  That is wrong and we are throwing away the benefits of this find if we permit the Minister for Finance to drive up the price artificially by directing the board to make huge profits which go into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the profits going into the Exchequer.  Naturally, it is the place where they should go but there should not be an incentive for the Minister to maximise the profits.  The Minister should desire, in the national interest, that BGE should make a moderate profit on the basis of what I have said, that the profit would cover the cost to them of the gas, the cost of plant and installations, capital repayments and day to day running expenses.  The Minister can take some of the moderate profits, if he wishes, but there is an incentive under this section for the Minister to drive up the price and let the multi-nationals call the tune again.  That is wrong because there is no benefit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister to say that by keeping the price of gas down to its natural level we are excluding certain areas from industrial development. The Minister might as well say that because it is not feasible to put supply into certain areas they are being discriminated against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot start a major industry in a remote corner of the country where the cost of putting in the power would be enormous. <Col N="1474" /> People do not start huge energy intensive industries in desperately remote places for that reason, unless they have a local supply of power beside them.  That was always the situation but the Minister is bringing in a red herring.  If we have a national gas grid, and I hope this will ultimately develop, all the major urban centres, and anywhere along the line of that grid, will have natural gas available.  Most parts of the country would be able to develop industry based on natural gas.  There are many industries for which natural gas is not suitable and it would be no advantage to them to have natural gas, even in the cheapest form.  For example, if they use certain types of machines which can only be run by electricity it is obvious that they do not have to be near the grid; they can be anywhere. There are certain types of industry, such as NET, which are intensive users of natural gas and should get it as cheaply as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley put the argument for the adoption of this amendment very well.  We should aim at the establishment of a national gas company which would help to establish industries in various parts of the country.  The Deputy also referred to the fact that there are many industries for which electricity is more suitable than natural gas.  The Minister should raise his sights and plan not just for the find at Kinsale, but for any future finds in any part of the country.  The only way this can be done is by forming a national gas company.  We could then call on the expertise of semi-State and private industries to ensure that the national gas company would bring the benefits derived from finds of natural gas to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support wholeheartedly the watch dog attitude of Deputy O'Malley on this point.  We do not want the benefits accruing from natural gas to become a source of income for the State.  We want natural gas to be used for the benefit of the people.  Deputy O'Malley also mentioned turf, which is not nearly as powerful as natural gas.  The time <Col N="1475" /> has come when the Minister must consider all our natural resources, especially natural gas.  He must ensure that it will not be confined to one small section of the country or to certain industries.  We should hold out the hope to many struggling industries that they will benefit from this discovery. We must also ensure that the organisation set up by the Government is the most appropriate to ensure that the most effective use is made of natural gas.  This is not being done at the moment but the amendment would go a long way towards putting us on the path to full development.</P>

      <P>I have not a great deal more to say.  I agree with Deputy Moore that Deputy O'Malley put his point very well, but I think he had a very bad point.  Section 11 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance give the Board such general directives concerning the pricing policy as to the sale or supply of gas or the financial objectives of the Board as he considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>NET are not using gas as an energy source.  They use it for the manufacture of fertilisers and so on.  In that case, the Minister would give directions for a specific industry to get gas at a specific price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section in the ESB Act which says that no customer can be treated differently from another.  There are separate charges for electricity for domestic use and for industrial use.  This subsection is meant to prevent the Minister saying that, for example.  Mr. O'Malley is to get gas cheaper than anybody else in Limerick. The Minister can and should advise, or direct if necessary, the board as to what price they will charge the industrial sector, providing, of course, that the price he fixes does not prevent the board from meeting their ordinary obligations.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite seem to fear that the Minister for Finance could use this as a means of gathering taxation. If he wants to put an excise duty on gas, he can; he need not depend on this.  What the Deputies are doing will in my view, prevent debate on another gas find as to its use and as to pricing policy in the future and I do not think we should put ourselves in that position. The amendment in effect says that the gas must be sold cheaply in spite of all other considerations.  That is not wise and I recommend that the House should not accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2c:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 47, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>In giving directives under this section the Minister shall seek to ensure that the price of gas shall be kept as low as is feasible having regard to its cost, even if it is significantly lower than the price of other forms of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments we have used in our previous amendment apply to this amendment.  It is imperative that we provide low cost energy and this is our big opportunity to do so, an opportunity that we did not realise we would have at the time of the energy crisis when we were all worried and talking about the high cost of energy and never again having cheap oil or cheap energy. We now have an opportunity to provide low cost energy.  We should avail of it and not be afraid of some of the arguments put forward by the Minister about keeping it up to ESB standards and so on.  The people who would be harmed mainly in the long term or the short term by the provision of this low cost energy are the big multi-national oil companies who did a wonderful job on their own behalf at the time of the oil crisis and continue to do so.  This is an opportunity we should avail of to the full and ensure that it is availed of properly by introducing legislation. Despite very powerful lobbies England is refusing to tax natural gas further in order to make the coal board and the electricity authority more competitive. There is a seminar in progress in England at the moment.  The chairman of the English gas board yesterday in a statement said that the <Col N="1479" /> argument that it is good social policy to do things which bring the price of gas up to the price of electricity for consumers, thereby depriving traditional gas users of a cheap supply of energy is a fallacious argument.  We are talking not only about traditional gas users but about industrialists and others who would like to have access to low cost energy.  By giving access to low cost energy, as against what they now have to accept from the oil companies, we will help our economy in every way.  It will lead to expansion of industry, to more employment, and it will make industries more competitive in the export market, which is very important.</P>
    <P>Many industrialists have suffered badly as a result of the taxation on oil in the last budget of 2p a gallon across the board, which nobody anticipated except possibly the Minister for Finance.  We believe that the subsection which we are seeking to have included in the Bill, is fundamental to any future policy with regard to the utilisation of natural gas.  The Minister refused last week to disclose what it costs but maybe we will find out in the near future.  It is imperative to ensure that natural gas is provided at the lowest price possible, in order to get ourselves out of the grip we have found ourselves in for the last three years&mdash;the grip of the big oil companies.  This is the opportunity to set about doing this, and that is why we have put down the amendment. We believe the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the fact that the Minister for Finance increased the tax on fuel oil by 2p per gallon in the last budget, the ESB must be paying a ferocious amount of taxation every year which they pass on to the consumer.  The price of natural gas must be kept as low as possible because of the rather crazy set up in relation to imported fuel oil. Companies like the ESB must include the tax on that oil in their manufacturing costs and the consumer pays it.  The ESB has been given a very raw deal by the Government.  Being the <Col N="1480" /> biggest importers of this type of oil, they pay the most tax.  In the long run it is the consumer who must pay that penal tax.  Many smaller industries here are suffering considerably from this imposition.  The amendment should be accepted because it makes provision to stop price manipulation which will result in increased charges. This is a very simple requested.  Unless the amendment is accepted we can see the Minister being tempted again to increase the tax on natural gas landed at Cork Harbour.</P>

I do not know whether the Deputy wants to make little of the transfer to Castlebar, but the fact is that in the region of 200 people are taking up employment in Castlebar, people who were not employed there before, and that the annual wage bill in the area will be in the neighbourhood of £500,000 per year and that in addition to those being directly employed other people will be indirectly employed, in the catering, cleaning and other fields.  I think the entire operation is very well worth while and one which is welcome in Castlebar.  It is something in the nature of a pilot effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>About 1,620, with an average waiting period of about 16 months.  It is hoped to attend to about 500 of these by the end of this year and most of the balance next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in certain cases, the delay is much more than 16 months?  Might I ask, in the majority of cases referred to where there are long delays, what is the reason?  Has his Department any proposals for expediting the installation of telephones for these applicants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The average waiting time for County Galway is, unfortunately, somewhat higher than for the country as a whole.  The reason for this is attributable mainly to a high proportion of extensive line work applications with a consequential relatively slow rate of clearance, this being, I am afraid, inherent in the nature of the terrain of part of the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he has himself admitted that there seems to be a longer waiting period in County Galway than in any other county?  He has given a reason. I would ask him to remedy that situation and give some telephones to County Galway.  I said before, he is a very decent man about answering letters but telephones are required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the installation of telephones is more important than answering letters.  But I should like to draw his attention to the fact that the number of connections in the county in 1972 was 850 and in 1975, 1,650&mdash;that is in Galway.  That is to say, the rate of connection has almost doubled.  On the whole that is a fairly satisfactory improvement over the position as it was when this Government took Office.</P>

      <P>The Department has been seeking suitable accommodation in Galway for some time.  A number of buildings have been ininspected but, for various reasons, it has not been possible to date, I am sorry to say, to conclude a letting.  The most recent negotiation concerned a building in which accommodation is already rented by this Department for the Engineering Branch and also by other Government Departments.  The position there is that the agents concerned have invited further inspection of part of the premises where adaptation works have now been carried out for another tenant.  The Office of Public Works has been requested to arrange inspection by an architect and to report whether adaptation of the available accommodation to meet the Department's requirements would be feasible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of the question there is no change from the position as set out in my reply to a similar question by the Deputy on the 16th December, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the St. Assam's district is concerned, I understand that there has been an abnormally high incidence of breakdown on the cable system serving this area during the last few months and that sections of the trunk cable route which have been particularly subject to damage by third parties are being recabled and rerouted to reduce the risk of damage. During the month of June frequent interruptions in service during the daytime arose from the intensive maintenance, realignment and recabling programme which is being carried out by the cable company concerned but the interruptions have been confined so far as possible to the forenoon.  I am informed that this programme has already substantially improved the quality and <Col N="1490" /> reliability of the system, and that it is likely to be completed in about two weeks time.</P>

Some of the firms concerned are oriented solely towards the export market and, apart from the quality of employment and the bringing to the country of technological know-how, there has been a significant contribution to invisible earnings.  I cannot give more detail than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if there has recently been a change in IDA policy in relation to industrial grants which puts Dublin on a par with the western seaboard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1975, because of the high rate of job loss in industry <Col N="1493" /> in the Dublin area, the Industrial Development Authority have, with my approval, extended their small industry programme to the Dublin area for certain selected sectors of industry and are promoting Dublin freely as a location for new largescale industrial projects.  There has been no change in the statutory level of industrial grants.  The maximum is still 60 per cent of fixed assets in the designated areas, including the western seaboard, as against 45 per cent elsewhere, including Dublin.  It is not proposed to make any change in the differentials in grants approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this policy may mitigate against the west in that industrialists will not bother to set up there if they can receive similar grants on the eastern seaboard?  Can the Minister explain why this change in policy was not publicised?  Was it done in some sort of esoteric way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in regard to the effect of this policy, the Deputy is aware from his personal knowledge of this area that the statutory limits are attained only very seldom by the IDA who, quite correctly, enter into individual negotiation and package and secure the given industry for as little money as they can spend. Secondly, it is evident from the figures that were emerging in the first part of 1975 that the opposite to what the Deputy suggests is true.  For example, to take the western area there was an increase in jobs of 2,147 between 1973 and 1975 while at the same time there was a diminution in the east of 3,825 jobs.  The figures reveal that, taken area by area, the east and the north east were the areas suffering most.  The Deputy will be aware, too, that it is correct for the IDA, within the discretionary limits of the legislation, to target their efforts to where the need is greatest. There were counties such as Mayo, for example, which were disadvantaged severely previously but in respect of which the opposite is now the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of Donegal, in the period when there had been a drop in the <Col N="1494" /> east of 3,800 and in the north-east of 1,500, there was a net gain in Donegal of 77.  Therefore, it is correct to say that the IDA push their efforts in the areas where there is need.  I was not aware of any lack of publicity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the increase of 77 is purely fictitious because of some factories being set up in the Gweedore estate. He should be aware that unemployment in the county has risen by a much higher percentage than in any other county.  He cannot deny this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do deny it.  The figures for employment are not identical.  The figures are comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that when we brought in the 1945 Undeveloped Areas Act, which was administered by An Foras Tionscail, our sole purpose was to create an incentive to establish industries in the west?  The Minister is surely aware that industrialists will not go to the west unless they can get a considerable incentive over and above the east coast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now giving grants to people in a way which is tantamount to providing that there will be no new employment in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is doing the maximum malicious damage possible. The figures I have given indicate that in the period 1973-1975 there were increases in Donegal, in the north-west, in the west, in the south-east and in the midlands, and decreases in the mid-west and in the south-west, and a very serious decrease in the east and in the north-east.  The necessary thing to do with public money is to aim at where the need is greatest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply.  Is he aware that the increase in the eastern seaboard area is due to the slackness in the construction industry, not in manufacturing industry?  Nowadays when there is no employment across <Col N="1495" /> the Channel people from the west come to Dublin to look for work, so that giving employment in the east is only attracting people from the west&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is this not a complete change from the policy of the previous Government in regard to the decentralising of industry and its siting in handicapped areas?  I did not know about this change.

      <P>Apart from referring to these statements as of a semi-paranoid kind, from the figures, the Deputy will see that certain areas in the west have been doing better in recent times. There has been absolutely no change in policy.  Had there been a change in policy there would have been a change in legislation.  There is a change in emphasis within the legislation, of a perfectly proper kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his Department will give special attention to the town grouping Ballygar, Dunmore, Glenamaddy, Mountbellew and Tuam, County Galway in which there has been a net loss of 118 jobs from 1973 to 1975; and the steps that will be taken to create employment in these towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they are conscious of the need for further industrial employment in the town groupings to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The authority are giving priority to Tuam, the largest town in the group, in their industrial promotional activities and in the recent past have brought five industrialists to the town on industrial itineraries.  In all of the towns in the group, with the exception of Mountbellew, the authority have industrial sites which they will continue to promote for suitable industrial projects.  The authority are of course ready to support any suitable project proposed for these towns by local or incoming industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's reply, the fact is that there was approximately a 30 per cent job loss in the town grouping to which I have referred from 1973 to 1975.  Is the Minister aware that there is a considerable number of people, including school leavers, who are most anxious to get employment in the area but from what the Minister has told me it does not look as if they will get work in that part of north Galway? Can the Department do anything to create employment there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The factual position is that this is the town grouping which has fared worst in the western region in terms of net job gains in manufacturing <Col N="1497" /> employment since 1973. While the total job approvals have matched up well to the targets in the regional industrial plan, the job losses have continued to outstrip the gains since 1973, so that the net job losses in the region are unrelated. That affirmation that this is the grouping which has fared worst in the guidelines of the Department and of the IDA indicates that it is the grouping which calls for and which receives the greatest effort.  The existence of the sites that I have mentioned and of a very strong promotion by the IDA for Tuam is evidence of our concern.  I understand that the job losses have been because of the reduction in employment in Erin Foods and the Irish Sugar Company which in turn is the consequence of a fall in supplies of sugar beet.  The need of the area is undoubted and I understand from the IDA that it is being given the maximum possible priority for solution through all of the mechanisms at the disposal of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is giving priority to Tuam and I would ask him to give special attention also to the other towns in the area.  The people are not interested in job approvals.  What they want are jobs.</P>

    <Title>Gas Bill, 1976: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>2C.  In page 8, after line 47, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) In giving directives under this section the Minister shall seek to ensure that the price of gas shall be kept as low as is feasible having regard to its cost, even if it is significantly lower than the price of other forms of energy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Barrett.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment that could safeguard persons using natural gas for manufacturing purposes.  The Minister by direction may change the price of the gas.  In an article I have with me there is a suggested charge of 5p per therm and one can readily see that the Minister might be tempted to put a further punitive tax on this product, as the Minister for Finance put on fuel oil in the last budget whereby manufacturing costs were increased which were passed on to the consumer. This does not make for good economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should try to maintain the price of gas at its low rate rather than attempting to obtain revenue <Col N="1513" /> from it or penalise industry.  All that our amendment seeks to do is to keep down the price of gas.  Because of the decision of the Government to use gas as it will be used, there will be an enormous loss each year.  While one Department decide that gas should be used to generate electricity with consequent great wastage, other Departments are publishing advertisements urging people to conserve energy.  It is all very contradictory. We could have a loss on this kind of operation of about £3.9 million and could waste much of our natural wealth.  I would ask the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment which will give worth-while protection to the consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The same answer applies to this as to the previous amendment in the names of Deputies Barrett and O'Malley.  This would tie the hands of a future Government and future Minister and would be unnecessarily restrictive.  If the Minister wants to do this at a future date the power to do so is in the Bill.  To write it in would restrict the freedom of a Minister or Government or the Gas Board at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which is of fundamental importance. As the Minister has said, the arguments in favour of it are the same as those in favour of the previous amendment and the arguments against it are those given already.  For that reason I do not propose to prolong discussion on this matter.  It goes to the kernel of what our energy policy will be, whether we want to avail of the first efficient, cheap, native fuel we have or whether we want to allow the prices to be fixed by the multi-nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I should like to refer to two brief reports of one of the speeches delivered yesterday at Mr. Wedgwood Benn's energy conference at Church House, Westminister. I should like to quote from two brief reports of parts of the speech of Lord Ryder, chairman of the National Enterprise Board and a member of the British Gas Corporation. <Col N="1514" /> I am quoting from <i>The Times</i> of today's date:</P>
    <P>He said that when there was talk of raising gas prices to help the competitive position of gas's rivals, &ldquo;I have to pinch myself to confirm that I am still living in the real world and not at a 1976 version of the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for the Government to allow gas prices to rise so that it formed &ldquo;a wretched cartel with electricity and coal&rdquo;, Lord Ryder added.</P>
    <P>That is the point Deputy Barrett and I were making this morning, except that in the case of Ireland it is not with coal, it is with electricity and oil that the wretched cartel would be formed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>And turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Turf is so weak that, unfortunately for us, it does not count.  It is not competitively strong enough to form the price level mechanism.</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to another part of Lord Ryder's speech at the same conference as reported in today's <i>Financial Times</i>.  The report says:</P>
      <P>Lord Ryder, chairman of the National Enterprise Board, came out in support of the British Gas Corporation in its contention that there are no grounds for increasing the price of natural gas.</P>
      <P>He told the conference: &ldquo;One of the things that has become a major factor in industry's prime cost structure is energy.  Often we cannot place our industries at an advantage over other countries in the cost of raw materials, but in the case of gas we can give a tremendous boost to Britain's industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For this reason it was most important, at a time when the Government was doing its utmost to encourage more investment and general industrial reorganisation, not to take on extra costs in the shape of higher fuel prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lord Ryder said that the social implications of an increase in gas <Col N="1515" /> prices could have serious consequences for the lower-paid income groups&mdash;a point which was taken up and emphasised by several subsequent speakers, particularly those representing organisations like Child Poverty Action Group, Help the Aged and Age Concern.</P>
    <P>The points made in that speech yesterday are essentially the points made here this morning by Deputy Barrett and myself.  They are valid in Britain.  I do not think that is denied. They are equally valid here.</P>
    <P>This is the decision Mr. Benn has been asked to make over the past six months, or so, since he became Secretary of State for Energy in Britain. He has refused to take the decision which has attempted to be foisted on to him by the electricity interests and the coal interests, each of whom are very strong in Britain.  Here we have the attitude of the ESB in pricing electricity at a very high level, partly through no fault of their own, and partly through their own fault.  To a considerable extent they have generated capacity, for which the consumer is now being asked to pay, with money borrowed abroad over the past number of years and which it is costing an extraordinarily high amount of money to service now because of the decline in the value of sterling.  We have considerable excess capacity and, in the context of gas coming in and being utilised, excess capacity in electricity generation is likely to continue unfortunately.  By refusing to take the decision which the electricity and coal boards are endeavouring to force on Mr. Benn he is, in fact, deciding to keep down the price of gas.  That now appears to be the policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power here is doing the opposite.  In this section he is creating a situation in which the Minister for Finance can fix the price level of gas.  The Minister for Transport and Power said it would be wrong to have different forms of energy at seriously different price levels.  The Minister for Finance has a built-in incentive to keep up the price of gas, to increase the profits of BGE because, acting on behalf <Col N="1516" /> of the Exchequer, he will get those profits.  They will be a form of taxation on natural gas.  They will put up the price considerably and they will do away with the advantages which the discovery of natural gas has brought to this country and could bring if it were allowed to be sold at a price which I would describe as its own economic level, the price at which it can be economically sold.</P>
    <P>It should not be tied to electricity prices which, in the last resort, are fixed by a cartel.  Lord Ryder referred in the British context to a wretched cartel of electricity and coal.  Here it is an equally wretched cartel of electricity and oil, with the oil multi-nationals calling the tune.  We are now refusing to avail of the first opportunity we have ever had as a nation to break that ring and to smash that cartel and, by competition, to bring down the price of energy with enormous benefit to our nation and particularly to industry.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that at this very time industry is at a serious disadvantage because of wage unit costs being so high and with the price of imported raw materials frequently being so high because of the depreciation in the value of sterling as against non-sterling currencies.  We have an opportunity, as it were, to equalise our costs and to do away with the disadvantage which our industry is labouring under at present and to give ourselves a major advantage with this God-given gift of gas.  Instead of availing of that God-given advantage, if this amendment is not accepted section 11 will have the effect I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am not putting this in any political way.  I am very seriously concerned that if the Minister for Finance follows the policies set out in section 11 as enunciated by the Minister for Transport and Power this morning, the value to the country of that natural gas will be dissipated to a very great extent.  The only benefit it will serve is as another form of tax gathering revenue.  The tragedy is that, while there may be some argument for heavy taxation on imported fuels, there is no argument whatever from any point of view for <Col N="1517" /> taxation on cheap native fuel.  There could not be, and it would be mad to contemplate that there should be.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously think turf or hydro-electricity should be taxed in some way?  If he were to suggest that he would be laughed out of the House.  Basically gas is no different.  It is just that it is more efficient and of more value than hydro-electricity or turf.  Unfortunately hydro-power is very limited here due to the small number of our harnessable rivers.  Turf is inefficient but it is better than nothing.  It is not very good.  We have to acknowledge that.  Gas is valuable.  It is a tremendous asset to us and, in effect, under section 11, if this amendment is not accepted, we will tax it in order to keep its price up.  We will encourage the board to make big profits to enable the Minister for Finance to take them.  In effect that is taxation.</P>
    <P>It is the same as if the Minister brought in a Financial Resolution imposing excise duty on a therm or a cubic foot of natural gas.  He could not do it in that way, but he can do it in an indirect way.  He may do it with some benefit to the Exchequer&mdash; obviously there will be&mdash;but with enormous disadvantage to our industry, to our employment prospects, and to the economy generally.  The benefit to the nation of what we have been fortunate enough to find will be dissipated and whittled away.  I would ask the Minister in all sincerity to have a look at this amendment again, to have a look at the whole policy as contained in this section and as enunciated by him this morning, and to agree with us that another way of approaching it is the better way and that great damage can and will be done, unfortunately, by following a policy of dear native energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>All these arguments were made by Deputy O'Malley this morning.  They are not real arguments because he knows very well that section 11 allows the Minister for Transport and Power, after conferring with the Minister for Finance, to fix the price of gas.  That need not necessarily be higher than the price <Col N="1518" /> of electricity.  It could be lower or the same.  The Deputy quoted from a conference which took place in London yesterday, many years after natural gas was discovered in England, and many years after a grid was set up. That type of conference could not take place here in years to come if we accepted the amendment, because we would have prejudged the whole issue.  That would be an intolerable position to put us into.</P>
      <P>The Deputy quoted Lord Ryder as saying he could not accept this.  I have no doubt that if there are other finds of natural gas in years to come the then chairman of BGE will make exactly the same arguments, for exactly the same reasons, in exactly the same context to a conference but, by accepting the amendment, no conference will be held because there will be no point in holding a conference on the uses of energy because we will have prejudged the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be written into legislation this amendment in the names of Deputies O'Malley and Barrett to the effect that &ldquo;the price of gas shall be kept as low as feasible having regard to its cost, even if it is significantly lower than the price of other forms of energy&rdquo;.  This will be the price of gas for all time.  I do not think BGE or the ESB or Bord na Móna should have rights like that.  These rights are properly vested in the Minister and the Government and they should be in a position to avail of any options that present themselves after the study to which I referred earlier this morning has taken place.  All avenues should be open to them as regards pricing, as regards the people who would get the gas and whether it should be distributed by grid or, as Deputy Barrett suggested, by tanker and so on.  These are matters on which there should be a political decision and not something which should be covered by a statute to give Bord Gáis Éireann an inside track, as it were, for all time in relation to all natural gas that was found anywhere in the country and for any use.  This is obviously not what the people would want.  It should not be what this House would want, and it is <Col N="1519" /> certainly not something I want.  I cannot accept this amendment because it would tie the hands of any Government in the future.  It might be a Fianna Fáil Government that would be here and their hands should not be tied as to how and at what price this gas should be used in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not tying anyone's hands to the extent the Minister has said.  Our amendment says the price of gas shall be kept as low as is feasible having regard to its cost.  That gives a certain amount of flexibility. The Minister said last week and again today&mdash;and there is provision for it in this Bill&mdash;that the question of setting up a gas grid would be examined in the immediate future.  We believe it should have been examined in the past, but it has not been examined.</P>
      <P>Assume that we find more gas, about which we can be reasonably hopeful. Surely by accepting our amendment a gas grid is made more viable and attractive.  Lower cost energy will mean more users of gas in the future. Whether gas is supplied to Dublin by tanker or pipeline, something will have to be done about the Dublin Gas Company.  At present they are paying 132 dollars per ton for naphtha and the ESB are paying 60 dollars a ton for heavy fuel oil.  Dublin gas users have been suffering as a result of the prices being charged for gas and a further increase of 11 per cent was announced last Friday or Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our aim is to lay the foundations for the proper utilisation of natural gas, with a view to further finds.  If all came to all and no more was found, Britain has found so much that there is a surplus and we would be able to import gas if the grid was set up and being used.  On the basis established by Britain of providing low cost energy, it will be far cheaper for us to import gas from the North Sea if we have to do it than to have to import naphtha at 132 dollars a ton or at whatever price the multi-nationals say, and they say what the price will be; the Dublin Gas Company have no choice in the matter, as <Col N="1520" /> they learned at the beginning of the oil crisis.  They were told: &ldquo;Take it at our price, despite a previous contract, or you do not get it.&rdquo;  It was an emergency forced on the Dublin Gas Company.</P>
    <P>We should try to benefit from our experience since the oil crisis.  One of the main aims of the amendment is to break the stranglehold the multinational oil companies had and still have on our energy situation.  We are subject to the UK outer zone system of prices.  We do not have a choice in the price of oil products, as has been proved in the last three years.  By accepting this amendment the Minister is being provided with an opportunity to break this stranglehold.  We have been through most of the arguments already, and again we would ask the Minister to accept the amendment which is realistic and, we believe, in the interest of the economy and of better usage of natural gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Barrett said, we have been over all this ground before.  He argued that one of the main aims of the amendment was to break the stranglehold of the multi-nationals on the energy market of this country, and also that we were part of the UK outer zone price system for oil.  Then Deputy O'Malley says the United Kingdom is more efficient in this because Mr. Benn will refuse to allow the price of gas to go up.  The Deputies are contradicting each other there.  If we are controlled by what happens with oil in England and if what they are proposing would break the power of the multi-nationals, why has it not done so in England?  Why has the lower price for gas there not broken the power of the multi-nationals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They also referred to the price of electricity and natural <Col N="1521" /> gas in England and said in regard to coal and electricity that this gas would break the cartel to which Lord Ryder referred.  In fact, as regards comparable areas in England and Ireland, the price of electricity here is cheaper.  I accept the sincerity of what the Deputies opposite are trying to do, but if they think about it long enough they will see that their amendment would have exactly the opposite effect, and in 20 years' time some Minister would have to answer for Bord Gáis Éireann and the freedom they have to run their business as I have to do now for the ESB or as other Ministers for Transport and Power have had to do in relation to the ESB, and you know the emotional fury that is engendered by the very mention of the ESB.  Last week I thought Deputy Brennan would take off he became so irate at even the thought of the ESB.  If the Deputies' amendment is written into this Bill, exactly the same thing would happen in 20 years' time as regards Bord Gáis Éireann.  The decisions on policy and pricing must be kept in the Minister's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>And I hope they will continue to do better because of the type of fuel they use and its being plentiful.  We are not contradictory at all in this.  Because of their access to natural gas Britain are now doing what we propose should be done in regard to the price structure of oil. While we do not believe that we should do everything Britain does, we are proposing in our amendment that we should take the first step towards ensuring the breaking of this stranglehold about which we have been talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that the acceptance of this amendment will tie future Government's hands as to the price of gas. There seems to be some retreat from the position enunciated by the Minister <Col N="1522" /> this morning because the Minister is now talking about flexibility, but if what the Minister said this morning about the necessity of pitching the price of gas at approximately the same level as the price of other forms of energy represents Government policy, and if that is what they are proposing to do, they are in fact tying everybody's hands for so long as they are there.  We will have comparatively dear natural gas.</P>
      <P>This is a policy decision which I presume can be reversed.  But one of the difficulties about a future Government reversing policy of that kind is that investment has been channelled in a particular direction over a number of years because of the pricing policy of the Government of the day, in relation to a particular form of energy, such as gas in this case.  If a subsequent Government come in and disagree with that policy and wish to change it, the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that Government will immediately be assailed by a lot of irate industrialists who will say that they have gone to terrible trouble and expense to invest in a particular way, in a particular place in a particular plant and that they cannot get out of it, that if they had known that natural gas would be sold in this country at its economic price they would not have done all that.</P>
      <P>It is not right for the Minister not to tie future Government's hands.  In practice what happens is that, once a line of policy is decided upon and put into effect over a period of even a year or two in relation to a matter such as this, it takes years to unscramble that egg.  By adopting the policy that the Minister enunciated this morning the Minister will in fact channel industrial investment and industrial thinking over the next five, six or seven years, in a particular direction and once they start moving in that direction they cannot reverse out of it because they will have invested too much that they will not be able to recover.  They will have to see through the decisions that were made on the basis of that being the particular policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the policy which would be the logical consequence of what the Minister said this morning is put into practice and if an effort is made after the passing of this Bill to pitch the price of natural gas at or about the sort of level that has been fixed by oil and electricity prices for energy, industrial investment in this country over the short term future will tend to go in a certain way.  If we were to be in Government in two years' time and if we wanted to implement what we are talking about now and allow the price of natural gas to fall to its natural or economic level, I do not think we could do it without being grossly unfair to a lot of people who would have committed assets and capital to a particular line.</P>
      <P>There are many times when on a change of Government the incoming Government might well feel that they do not agree with various aspects of various policies that were pursued by their predecessor, but in the long term they cannot do anything about it because they will be unfair to too many people who have set themselves on particular courses and in particular lines of investment that they cannot back out of.  If the policy is to be changed from the top, much if not all of what they may have invested in a particular line would be irretrievably lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister tells us that the likelihood is that the policy of the present Government in relation to the price of natural gas is to have it at approximately the same level as other forms of energy, there will be very long term consequences for industry in particular and also to some extent for domestic consumers of gas.  If that will be the policy there would not seem to be much point in thinking <Col N="1524" /> about a national grid, because there would be no attraction to incur the heavy capital expenditure of the grid and the further heavy capital expenditure in cities like Dublin, Limerick and Waterford on conversion of appliances.  There would be no huge increase, as there was in Britain over the last six or seven years, in consumers applying to get on to gas and to use it as their main domestic fuel.</P>
    <P>Over the last 20 years there has been virtually no new consumers of gas joined up to the municipal plant. The corporation did make gas available in some of the corporation housing schemes which they built over the last 20 years, but there have not been many additional consumers; indeed there probably has been a net loss of consumers because a lot of people gave it up when it became too expensive. There will be no incentive to build a grid if natural gas is to be sold at the same price level that municipal or town gas is now being sold at.  We have the figures that the Dublin Gas Company are paying for naphtha at the moment, and we have had an increase of 10 per cent by the Dublin Gas Company in the price of gas to their consumers only last week.  It will not be worth while going to the expense of bringing natural gas either from Cork harbour or somewhere in the west coast up to Dublin if it will not be sold at a sufficiently low price to make it worth while incurring this capital expenditure and the further expenditure of the adaptation of the appliances.</P>
    <P>One wonders about the long term viability of all the municipal gas companies in this country if natural gas is to be sold at the same rate as town or municipal gas at the moment.  The only long term safe future prospects of survival or economic success is for all those municipal gas companies in five or ten years' time to have natural gas rather than have to make gas out of naphtha and other very expensive imported fuels.  If they are not to get natural gas at its natural price level I do not think there is any future for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> I wonder what future there is for the Dublin or Limerick gas companies if they have to continue to manufacture municipal gas from very expensive imported raw materials and if they will not have the advantage which they assumed up to today that they would have and which their counterparts in Britain have had for the past eight or nine years, that is, natural gas being available at a fraction of the cost of town gas.  For these reasons the refusal of this amendment designed to keep the price of natural gas down to its natural or economic level will be a decision by the Government to fix a higher ceiling or pricing structure for natural gas which will have long-term consequences.  The Minister suggests that it is allowing flexibility, that it can be high or low and it is not necessarily either.  When the Minister spoke first on the previous amendment he argued that it would not be fair to have one form of energy significantly cheaper than other forms and that they would all have to come up to approximately the same level.  That is not so in Britain and has not been so over the past eight or nine years when natural gas has been available on a fairly wide scale.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding various pressures to have it that way, successive British Governments&mdash;not just the present one and not just the present Energy Secretary in Britain&mdash;have refused to do so and have resisted that pressure. The circumstances are very similar here.  Their judgement is that it is in Britain's national interest, as it would be in ours, to have a cheap, native form of energy, the first one we have ever had, efficient and reasonably widespread.  In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister not to refuse this amendment and put us in a position in which, in our view, considerable damage will be done to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment is not accepted a Government in the future will have to amend the legislation to insert some similar provision. A few miles away at present they are tapping for gas off Kish Bank in Dublin Bay.  Suppose they found natural gas there, with the heavy concentration of industry on the east <Col N="1526" /> coast you would have to sell the gas to many of these industrialists who would have tremendous conversion costs if they were to use it.  It would be essential, therefore, to guarantee to these firms that they would have cheap natural gas, as suggested in the amendment.  Otherwise it might be difficult to sell it to them.  We hope there will be a big find there.  There are many fairly heavy industries in the area but they could only take natural gas at a certain price.  If it can be guaranteed that the price will be kept low you will sell it to them.  You must compensate them somehow for the colossal conversion costs.  In the UK they found conversion costs very high but because industrialists were guaranteed a supply of cheap natural gas they could afford to take it.</P>
      <P>We are in the same position and in order to create that confidence in these firms along the east coast the Minister should accept the amendment that would be a guarantee to those who will avail of this new form of energy. They must get it at a price that will compensate them for the expensive conversion required to change from their present source of energy to the natural gas.  It is much easier to accept the amendment now than for some future Government to have to change the legislation in order to ensure a ready market for any gas found along the east coast or in the Celtic Sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing I have heard leads me to change my mind as regards what I said this morning.  I said that acceptance of the previous amendment&mdash;and the thinking behind both is the same&mdash;would prevent any decision being taken subsequently by a Government as to how and at what price this gas should be sold.  We are dealing with a Bill to set up a Gas Board initially to handle the Kinsale gas field in a case where we know where the gas is going and the price it will go at.  But we must also look into the future and try to see what may happen.  There may be other finds in different places and circumstances and to confine that board to selling gas without any ministerial direction at, as the amendment says, the lowest <Col N="1527" /> feasible price, having regard to its cost, even if it is significantly lower than the price of other forms of energy, would involve huge policy implications that would be bound to act detrimentally on the Government and perhaps on the people who would <Col N="1528" /> supply the natural gas to the Gas Board.  I think that a policy of selling a product at a particular price and virtually writing this price into legislation would be unacceptable in any democracy and would certainly be unacceptable to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2 d:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 47, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Board shall disclose publicly the price it pays for and receives for natural gas in each contract it enters into.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment purports to add a very brief subsection.  I referred to this matter on Second Stage and the Minister in his reply&mdash;I have not got the context here, but it is my recollection &mdash;was not at all in favour of the price being disclosed.  Indeed, he made a bit of a laugh of it on the basis that it would be foolish of the board to do this because if oil companies and other such people involved in exploration knew what the price was in a previous find that would make it very difficult for the board to negotiate in future.  I cannot see that this argument holds up at all.  So far there is only one small find here.  We understand the price is five pence a therm and, whether that is right or wrong, it is believed it is right and, from the way the Minister is looking, I believe it is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In Britain all the prices have been disclosed.  They are all well known right from the very first find.  The first large field was the Echo Fisk discovered by Phillips. That was away back in the 1960s.  The price per therm is 1½ pence.  That was the price agreed at that time and all the way along since it has been known what the prices are.  The oil companies know and so does everyone else.  I do not know what the Minister thinks he is achieving by trying to keep this quiet because it will come out anyway. One of the ways it has to come out is that an Irish publicly quoted company has bought its way into a share of Marathon's operation off Kinsale and it has to publish accounts for the benefit of its shareholders.  It has to account for its income, its source of income and the payments by BGE to Marathon.  Petroleum (Ireland) Ltd., is part of the company's income and under the Companies Act and under <Col N="1530" /> Stock Exchange regulations it must disclose details of its income and it will have to disclose sufficient details to enable anybody by a simple mathematical calculation to work out and prove conclusively what precisely the payment per therm for gas is.</P>
      <P>There is really nothing achieved by this ostensible secrecy.  It is nothing more than that.  It is a facade of secrecy when everyone knows the answer.  For the Minister or a Statesponsored board to keep up this facade of secrecy, without either justification or success, engenders in the minds of the public some inevitable disquiet. Why should anyone try to keep it secret?  Are they giving the gas away? Are they paying too high a price for it?  Are they selling it at an exorbitantly high profit?  All these questions inevitably arise, questions which need not arise, and people begin to speculate. Possibly much of the speculation is off the mark but, nonetheless, there is speculation and it is the kind of speculation that can very often be damaging.</P>
      <P>This is a publicly owned body.  There is no private interest involved here. The Irish taxpayer owns Bord Gáis Éireann <i>in toto</i> and the Irish taxpayer is entitled to know what he is paying for the gas.  He is entitled to know what he is getting for the gas sold to industries such as NET and the ESB and the Minister cannot argue he is not entitled to know.  If I want to know what the ESB are paying for oil, I can telephone and ask and they will tell me what they paid last week and the week before.  It is only right and proper that they should.  The Dublin Gas Company had a contract with Esso which was formulated in 1966.  It was supposed to last for ten or 12 years. It was a very favourable contract.  Deputy Barrett referred to it earlier.  In 1973 Esso told the Gas Company they were not going to honour the contract any longer.  In a sense the Dublin Gas Company, though publicly quoted, is private because there is no great State investment in it but the company is prepared to publish what it pays for oil and they have to publish the price at which they sell gas to their consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> In this case there are only two or, at the most, three customers of BGE but the public are still entitled to know and by these rather futile efforts to cover up the Minister is, I think, bringing the board into a position where allegations will be made against it, allegations which will have no foundation, but allegations, nevertheless, which would not be made at all if simple information of no value to competitors, because there are no competitors, were disclosed.  It would be a different matter if there were a number of gas buying agencies, but there are not.  Under this Bill we are establishing BGE as the only gas buying agency and any gas found within our jurisdiction on land or under the sea has to be offered to BGE at a reasonable price.  That is all set out in section 37.  If agreement cannot be reached one can go to arbitration under the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>There is no question of competition because there is no competitor to BGE. It is a State monopoly.  Arguments that might hold up if there were competition do not hold up in this case because it is a monopoly.  It is a wholly owned State enterprise.  The public are the owners in the last resort and the public are entitled to the information.  They should not be deprived of it.  They will get it anyway because it has to be published in the accounts of Petroleum (Ireland) Ltd., and the Minister is achieving nothing by this facade of secrecy which he knows, as well as I do, is unrealistic and has no meaning in the context of this whole situation. For that reason this amendment should be accepted and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Deputy's desire to have the price of the gas revealed in public.  There is no kind of philosophic concept behind my refusal to disclose the price. Deputy O'Malley says that BGE are the only purchasing agent, that they have only three customers and that the prices should be revealed.  They are the only purchasing agents but, hopefully, they will be purchasing from a number of sources.  It is to conceal from A the price given to B <Col N="1532" /> that an endeavour is being made to keep the price secret.  The Deputy may be quite right that this may not work out, that by getting the accounts of BGE, the accounts of Royalties (Ireland) and of Marathon a person may be able to arrive at the price of the gas.  It is only commercial prudence that if you have to buy from two different people you do not let one know what you are paying the other if you hope to get a cheaper price from one than from the other.</P>
      <P>What Deputy O'Malley said is true, that originally British Gas published the price they were paying but they have ceased to do so for the reasons I have stated.  For the last four or five years they have not disclosed the price they were paying.  The present Minister for Energy in Britain refused in the House of Commons a few months ago, to disclose the price they were paying.  The energy correspondent of the <i>Financial Times,</i> writing on 13th February last, said that pinpointing the exact price of offshore gas is always a hazardous business as neither British Gas nor its suppliers will give even a hint about the level of individual agreements.  It is ordinary commercial prudence when you are buying from A at X price that you do not let B know what that price is hoping that you will be able to buy from B at X &mdash; 1 or X - 2.  It is ordinary common sense that we should, if possible, keep this price secret for that reason.</P>

      <P>They buy from different customers, as they have been doing, and it has not affected them. They set one against the other.  As Deputy O'Malley said BGE are a public body and they have a 20-year contract.  It seems impossible that the price structure will be kept secret for 20 years.  Deputy O'Malley pointed out how it will come out in the accounts of a public company and will be disclosed.  Why can the Minister not disclose to the country now what we are paying for it?  If it is a good deal it will be of benefit in the future so there is no reason not to disclose it. If the price is right in this instance and if it is to have any effect on a future deal with another customer who has found gas surely it will be helpful to bring down his price to the level which will work in our favour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's point is not valid.  If BGE were in competition with someone else there might be something to be said for this but they are not.  They are a State monopoly.  Everything has to be offered to them.  BGE are in a very strong position because they are the only buyers.  They can dig in their heels more easily than the suppliers of the gas can.  The suppliers have to get rid of the gas because they have sunk tens of millions of pounds into finding it and recovering it.</P>
      <P>The suppliers are in a very weak position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the State because the State, by virtue of this Bill, has established a State monopoly, a single buying board.  Nobody is in competition. It is no skin off BGE's nose if the price is disclosed.  The only way it could be any skin off their nose, as is stated, is if they did not get a good deal <i>vis-á-vis</i> Marathon.  The Minister assured us they got an excellent deal. I assume by that they must have bought at about 2p a term.  I could well imagine if BGE paid a high price like 5p a therm that they might not want to disclose it because the public would then realise they did not do so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister assured the House today and on another day when Deputy Barrett and I had questions down about it, that they got a very good deal.  We assume from that that it was about 2p a therm.  Therefore, if it is around 2p a therm and if BGE got a good deal that should be disclosed and it would keep down future costs. If they paid a lot for it, like 5p a <Col N="1535" /> therm, I could see the Minister and the board being reticent about disclosing it.  I am sure they did not pay such a high price because the Minister told us they got a good deal.</P>
    <P>Section 37 deals with arbitration. Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>If any dispute arises as to the reasonableness of terms on which natural gas is offered for sale to the Board, pursuant to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, such dispute shall be determined by arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>An arbitrator will sit under that Act. The first question he will have to ask is: &ldquo;Are there any other deals akin to this, analogous to it or similar to it in any way?&rdquo; BGE will have to go into the arbitration, which in the ordinary way will be in public, unless there is some special provision made for holding it in private.  The first evidence that will have to be given to him will be the price BGE paid Marathon for the Kinsale Head field.  There might be arbitration within a year or two depending on whether a find is made this season.  If there is not agreement, presumably it will be arbitrated on next year or the year after.  In the normal way that arbitration will be in public.  Even if the hearing is not in public the arbitrator's decision, which will have to contain the grounds for his findings, will have to be made public.  The principal ground for his findings&mdash;it is the primary criterion&mdash; is the price already paid for natural gas on the Irish Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be realistic about the matter.  The arbitrator has to be told, he has to give a public judgment and the parties concerned will have to publish it also. If we are lucky, if there are gas finds in the next few years, which all of us hope will happen, there will be an arbitration under section 37 which will take place in the next few years.  It will be held in public.  In those circumstances it is just not on for the Minister not to publish the figures.  For that reason I am asking him to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> If Deputy Barrett or I considered that any commercial damage was being done to BGE we would not have put down the amendment. There can be no such damage because they are in a monopoly situation. In the event of some very unusual circumstances, if some independent oil company who made a find did not know&mdash;all of them know about it; they tell one another immediately because the whole thing is a ring&mdash;all such a company need ask when they start negotiations with the board is what the other companies got for their gas.  Obviously that is a factor that would be relevant to the price of the gas in their sector, taking into account that some years had elapsed, that costs had risen, that more pipes were required and so on. Nevertheless, as a starting point, the price already paid is the primary criterion and this is very much the case so far as an arbitrator under the 1954 Act is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to be achieved by what the Minister is seeking to do now.  No harm whatever will be done but a great deal of good will be achieved.  There is now, and will continue to be, speculation.  This will be damaging to the board and to the public interest.  The speculation will be that if the board have nothing to hide they would disclose the facts and the fact that they have not done so may mean they have paid an abnormally high price to Marathon or any other company.  The board will be in a very difficult position.  If they do not deny it, it will be accepted as being true; on the other hand, if they deny it, there is a partial disclosure and they are forced into that situation.  There should be none of this quasi-secrecy about such public affairs, about public property in dealings between public companies.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy O'Malley is living in the real world if he thinks that information regarding commercial companies is available to the public in all circumstances. That is not the position.  It is true that BGE will be a monopoly buyer of gas; but, hopefully, they will be buying from a number of different <Col N="1537" /> sources.  Naturally they will want to play one supplier off against the other in an effort to get a lower price.  As Deputy O'Malley has said, when the British Gas Corporation was set up the prices were revealed but since they got more extensive finds dealing with different companies they have refused to reveal the prices they pay.  The argument that a kind of bush telegraph operates between the major oil companies with regard to telling each other about prices is not right.  They combine and help one another a great deal, but I do not think they divulge their sources and the prices they pay.  It may be that in the next 20 years this price will be told for one reason or another, but to write it into legislation and to appear to force the hands of the board in their dealings in future finds would not be wise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We might also ask if they have set up an arbitration system to determine the price of gas in the future where a dispute will arise.  The kind of arbitration most of us know about here concerns local government compulsory orders where the purchase of property is concerned.  I am sure that Deputy O'Malley in his capacity as a solicitor has experience of such hearings.  My experience has been in my capacity as a valuer and I have attended quite a number of such hearings. The guideline adopted by the arbitrator is the comparison with prevailing market values or the nearest market value.  I cannot visualise any other way where an arbitration hearing could decide on the price of gas other than by comparison with prices in other areas or from people who sold gas, whether to our board or to the British board.  This is the only way an arbitrator can decide on an equitable price for gas if a dispute arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our amendment is not accepted <Col N="1538" /> the whole exercise of setting up an arbitration board will be futile and a waste of time.  If the Minister will not ask the board in any circumstances to disclose the price, surely he will adopt the same attitude when it comes to an arbitration hearing? An arbitrator cannot do his work unless he knows the price of gas in the last deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The arbitrator in this case would be the last appeal when they could not reach agreement.  The British Gas Board buy all the gas and the arbitrator in their case is the Minister.  Obviously, if you are to compel everybody who discovers gas and brings it ashore in Ireland to sell it to BGE, in justice you must give them some court of appeal if they are dissatisfied with the price, or if they cannot reach agreement with the board on the price.  That is only ordinary justice.  The intention would be that the number of cases which would go to arbitration would be absolutely minimal, and agreement would be reached on a fair basis between the supplier and BGE without going to arbitration. I would hope the arbitration board would never be used and agreement could be reached between the supplier and BGE.  The fact that the price they are paying to the existing suppliers would be known would influence discussions with future suppliers.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably the most important section in the Bill, because what is done under it will give rise to very serious long-term consequences, particularly in the industrial sector, for many years to come.  The section is in a sense neutral.  For that reason, we cannot oppose it as such.  It allows the Minister for Transport and Power, with or without the consent of the Minister for Finance, to deal with the general financial policy of the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated one approach which might be taken or is likely to be taken.  Deputy Barrett, Deputy Moore and I have indicated a different approach, which we think proper.  There is quite a divergency. It boils down to whether there should be a dear gas policy in this country or a cheap gas policy, whether gas should be sold at its economic or natural level or whether it should be sold at a level that would put it more or less on a par with other sources of energy, of which the two principal ones are oil and electricity. These are both costly at the moment.  By comparison, gas, even though we have not been given the exact figures for it, is likely to be quite cheap.  We think it should stay quite cheap.</P>
      <P>The main danger that we see in this section is the unfettered ability of the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance to</P>
      <P>... direct that the profits of the Board in a year specified in the direction shall be applied in such manner (including application for the benefit of the Exchequer) as is specified in the direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with having that power.  What is wrong is proposing to exercise it in the manner in which the Minister indicated this morning it might be exercised.  If there were encouragement to the board to maximise its profits, to put up and keep up the price of gas to industrial consumers principally, the <Col N="1543" /> advantages which the discovery of natural gas gives to this country will be lost to the economy.  The only gain, and it will be a short term gain in every sense, will be to the Exchequer, because it will in effect be a levy on profit&mdash;first of all, a direction to make substantial profit, which is not necessary for the board, and a subsequent direction to remit that profit to the Exchequer will in effect be an excise duty on natural gas.</P>
    <P>It is unthinkable that we should have a duty in any form on our own native sources of energy.  When the Minister for Finance followed a policy of vast increases in duty on oil and petrol in recent years his argument was that because these were expensive, because they were all imported, he was trying to reduce consumption, although the Minister knew that consumption could not really come down because petrol and fuel oil are vital, and almost any price within reason will have to be paid.  The Minister's argument was that they were imports and therefore the price should be kept up.  It now appears that the Minister will use the same argument in relation to natural gas even though it is not an import, that the price should be kept up not just to the level of oil prices as fixed by the Arabs, but to the artifically high level of prices as fixed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Not alone is there crucifying taxation on petrol but there is now, for the first time in the history of this State, taxation on non-petroleum oil products, principally heavy fuel oil used in industry.  The figure of increased costs because of this rather silly 2p a gallon introduced this year is £5½ million for the ESB alone.  That was not imposed by the Arabs but by the Minister for Finance.  The same Minister, while he has grossly inflated the price of petrol and oil products generally, is now apparently taking power under this section to force up the price of gas, not to the level fixed by the Arabs or the multi-national companies but to the level fixed by the Minister after the multi-nationals have done their worst.  That, to my mind, is unacceptable and if that policy <Col N="1544" /> is to be followed in the future it will certainly be opposed by this party because it is clearly a policy that is not in the interests of this country.  It is not in the interests of industrial development or the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>The section is an enabling one, it does not compel this to happen.  It will only happen if the Minister chooses to have it that way.  For that reason we will not oppose the section but we would like it clearly understood that, in our view, if this policy is to be followed we think it is wrong, and that it is clearly in the interests of this country to keep the price of gas as low as possible.  The principal factor in the price that will have to be charged by Bord Gáis Éireann is what they pay to the producer, plus the cost of writing off their capital investment and their day-to-day running costs. These will be comparatively small, and the price charged should not be more than about 10 or 15 per cent above what they are paying to the producer for landing the gas and supplying it to the board.  On this section I would like an acceptance by the Minister that in general terms that would be the sort of policy that will be followed in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated this section with the amendments since about 12 o'clock today and on a number of occasions I said, and I repeat, that if the amendments proposed by the Opposition were accepted they would remove the policy decisions from the Government or the Minister of the day.  Under this section the Minister for Transport and Power with the consent of the Minister for Finance can dictate the general direction</P>
      <P>... concerning the pricing policy as to the sale or supply of gas or the financial objectives of the Board he considers appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage to tie the hands of any future Minister for Finance as regards formulating policy or even changing existing policy, if that was thought necessary in the future, by writing into the statute anything of this nature would be extremely silly.  I do not move away at all from my view in <Col N="1545" /> that regard.  Dáil Éireann and a Government must be free to make policy decisions within the conditions prevailing at that time.  This is an enabling section and this allows the Minister for Transport and Power of the time that freedom which is so necessary, particularly when we do not know what we will be dealing with in the future.  It is very necessary that we should have as much freedom as possible to investigate all the options open to us in the use of natural gas and all policies, commercial and economic, should be left open until a future date and a decision then taken by the Minister of the day in regard to any future finds.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that the Bill would not be flexible enough if it were amended.  We can only learn from experience and our experience where energy has been concerned in the last two or three years has been that it has been left wide open for taxation, not only the 15p on petrol but also the 2p across the board on oils in the last budget.  This has had the effect of adding £38 million to the cost.  This is a very serious blow to industry at this particular time because of economic trends and costs of labour and so on and the fact that it is difficult to compete in the export market.  We believe that this was a section whereby we could have established a real foundation for a low cost energy policy for this country.  That is why we pursued it so long.  We still believe in everything we said, and that it is and opportunity lost as far as we are concerned that this section was not amended.</P>

Deputy Barrett says that all we can learn from is experience.  We have no experience of natural gas in this country except for one find which is not yet ashore.  We must learn from our experience in dealing with the problems that we encounter in that, and that experience must be available to a future Minister so that he can base future policy on the experience gained here.  To tie his hands in any way in regard to that would not be correct.</P>

Legally, I suppose the board could not enter into a contract.  That is a layman's opinion and probably the Deputy would know better than I do.  The section says that a member must disclose an interest and if a contract were signed by the board with that member present without his having disclosed it and it was subsequently discovered that he had this interest, I would think that the contract was void because it could not be entered into by the board under this legislation, because section 13 is in it. I think that would be the position.  I am told there are two other Acts containing <Col N="1547" /> the same provisions in exactly that form, the ESB Act and the Nuclear Energy Act.  In a small country like this I think a provision of this kind is necessary.</P>

We fail to see this, considering that they will embark on studies which will cost a lot of money.  Last week we passed an order raising the capital of the Dublin Gas Company to £18 million, and £25 million for this board appeared to us an inadequate amount if they are to embark on any operations of the scale they should embark <Col N="1553" /> on not only in the light of the present find but of future discoveries to which we are all looking forward.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett is correct in saying there is no precedent for this.  This is new.  A ceiling was always put in the case of other bodies and on their freedom to spend money, as Deputy Coughlan has pointed out. The idea was that the responsible Minister would come back here if it was necessary to raise the ceiling and justify the actions of the board and be amenable to the House instead of giving large sums of money without any possibility of some form of control over the expenditure of that money.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Barrett's point that the operations of these bodies can be debated on the appropriate Estimate, that is so but there are many aspects to an Estimate and the same microscopic attention could not be given as would be given were the Minister to come back specifically to raise the borrowing limits.

      <P>This amendment does not impose a potential charge on the revenue.  It deals with the limit of the borrowing powers.  The argument is essentially the same as the argument made on the previous section.  If the board were to decide to construct a grid, this figure of £25 million would not cover the expenditure involved.  The Minister may say that, in that eventuality, he will come back but he will recall that under section 9 additional functions can be conferred on the board without further legislation.  It seems strange that that can be done without legislation while the building of a grid, one of the more obvious functions, would need legislation.  To me, that is not logical.  I am told the minimum estimate for a liquefaction plant would be about £50 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A grid and a liquefaction plant are two obvious functions of the board, assuming they are found to be economic.  I would hope the liquefaction plant would be economic. It is not necessary at the moment because the find is small but, <Col N="1556" /> if there are further finds, such a plant will be absolutely essential.  I take the Minister's point that he can come back but, if there is no objection to coming back for each development the board may undertake, there should be no objection to coming back for the conferral of additional functions on the board under section 9.  That would seem logical.  The £25 million is not a great deal of money in the context of the kind of things the board should be undertaking.  It is very small, indeed, in that context. It will pay for the pipelines from where the gas is landed on the southeastern shore of Cork Harbour up along the eastern shore to the ESB, to NET and to the city.  It will not cover very much more than that.  In the circumstances, would the Minister not consider a more adequate figure for capital borrowings because presumably what will happen in the first couple of years will be all borrowed until such time as the board are in a position to build up a revenue of their own or reserves of their own?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The £25 million involved here is sufficient for the board to do what they have now been told to do, bring the existing gas find through the route named by Deputy O'Malley.  If they want to do anything beyond that and if the argument tots up that there is only one small find and it is an argument or a choice as a result of studies undertaken by the board, there is sufficient money there for that.  In relation to whether it should be a liquefaction or a national grid, the board or the Minister concerned cannot take that decision without coming into the Dáil and justifying it.  That is a good thing.  It is very possible, in relation to the grid spoken about by Deputy O'Malley and the necessity for it, that the extra £75 million he speaks of on top of the £25 million might not be sufficient if you had a grid big enough. If the find was big enough and the grid was extensive enough, £75 million might not be enough.</P>

      <P>Perhaps not.  I do not know why the Opposition are doing this.  It is a good thing that the Minister should come back here. As regards the functions referred to in section 9 of the Bill, it is correct that the Minister can designate further functions to the board.  If those functions should raise their borrowing limit over £25 million&mdash;one is talking about fairly major functions at that stage&mdash; the Minister must come back again to allow them to increase our borrowing limit over £25 million so the Dáil has a chance to debate those further functions that are designated to the Minister by the board.  Under section 9 (2) it has to be approved by both the Dáil and the Seanad.  I believe that £25 million is sufficient to deal with the find that is there.  Any further finds and their use should be debated in the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4c:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (4), line 8, to delete &ldquo;time of the borrowing&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;date of each annual balance sheet of the Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that in the annual accounts of the board a realistic figure will be shown for borrowing, particularly foreign borrowing.  We have had a number of examples recently from two semi-State bodies which have run into a lot of trouble with foreign borrowing, which has gone wrong on them. I refer to the ESB and the ACC.  The ACC have shown a substantial loss in their last account as a result of heavy capital losses on foreign borrowing. The ESB have, equally, a lot of trouble with foreign borrowing when they have lost very heavily on it.  They have not disclosed this in the same way.  They have shown in their account the foreign borrowing as converted into sterling at the time they borrowed it but that bears no relation now to reality.  It is only putting off the evil day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB will have, annually, to make provision against it and the borrowing figures will have to be shown fully in their accounts in the years in <Col N="1558" /> which the various loans fall due for repayment.  It is misleading to have it otherwise than the way I suggest here. For example, if £5 million was borrowed by one of those boards in 1971, that is equivalent to £7 million.  They owe £7 million today if they borrowed £5 million in 1971, as well as the interest and all the rest of it they have been paying in the meantime and will have to continue to pay.  This puts a sense of realism into the figure which is shown.  It is clearly misleading to give the sterling balance as it was on the date it was borrowed in the kind of financial situation we find ourselves in now.</P>
    <P>This point will arise again on section 25.  In this particular section the effect could be that where there was nominal borrowing of £23 million the real borrowing would be £26 million. The amount owed would be £26 million and it would be necessary to come back during the currency of the loan, without having obtained a new loan, to get sanction for the higher figure. Perhaps the point I am making here is less important in this particular context than it is in the context of section 25 where it is a question of State guarantee of borrowings by the board for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>The main point I want to make as regards this section and section 25 is that if boards, such as this, persist in the policy they have adopted over the past few years of not showing their actual liabilities but showing the liabilities as they were on the date they borrowed them they were misleading the public and they are only putting a gloss on their accounts for the time being.  It would be better if the actual loan were updated in terms of sterling each year rather than continuing to show the figure as it was on the date it was borrowed.</P>

      <P>This subsection and the other subsections start off by saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of calculating the amount of borrowings by reference to the limit on principal in subsection (2) of this section the equivalent in the currency of the State of borrowings in a foreign currency shall be calculated at the <Col N="1559" /> exchange rate prevailing at the time of the borrowing.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, one could have a situation where a board at this time of the year had £24 million at their last date of valuation and if the £ was devalued and the Dáil were not sitting and they went over, by a revalued set of currencies, the £25 million the Minister concerned could not come back into the Dáil and get the £25 million raised to take it.  The company would have only one option, repay a sufficient amount of the loan they borrowed to bring them below the £25 million they borrowed.</P>
    <P>It is clearly undesirable that the company should be put in that position at a time when the Dáil is not sitting or, indeed, at any time.  It would create some questioning in the minds of foreign borrowers if this figure kept on switching and changing in every balance sheet.  It is purely for the purpose of calculating the amount of the borrowings by reference to the limit and the principal on some kind of a continuing basis from year to year that this formula is used. If the Dáil was not in session, it would have to be specially recalled to get, perhaps, £250,000 extra borrowing power for the company involved or the company would have to repay that loan more quickly than had been contracted for in order to get their borrowing limit below the £25 million. The other gives a much clearer and much more consistent form of calculation over the life of the loan or over the life of the company.  The same provision applies in the Agricultural Credit Act, 1972 and several of the more recent Acts.</P>

The wayleave is combined in this authority to being able to use that right alongside the public highway.  He is prevented from crossing land except by agreement. The ESB have more exhaustive powers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a bit disturbed to hear the Minister saying it is the same as the ESB's powers.  Without wishing to be more critical than one has to be of the ESB, anybody who knows farmers, or who lives in the country and has seen the ESB laying these big high transmission or high tension cables or pylons, knows the ESB act in a most arrogant and highhanded fashion.  This is a pretty universal experience throughout the country. They have considerable power under their Acts.  They act without much regard for the rights of the owner of the property.  I know one farmer near Limerick who has no less than four different sets of these wretched lines in a large field and about 20 acres of his land is valueless now because the ESB saw fit to run four of these wretched lines into one field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB, in my experience, usually pay no compensation for putting in these wires.  They pay if they acquire land but, if they just fix their high tension poles or pylons, they do not pay anything.  They serve some sort of notice on you with a map with a red line drawn across it.  They tell you they are coming in in a week to put them in, and then a horde of them descend and dig up the farm and in many cases they render the land useless. The local authority will not allow banding within a fixed distance from these high tension lines&mdash;I forget the <Col N="1565" /> figure, it varies depending on the voltage in the wires.  In the case of some of the big ones I think it can be as much as 100 yards.  In the case of the lower tension ones it is 50 feet or something like that.  This means that, to a great extent, the land is locked up.  Is it proposed here that where gaspipes are being laid across agricultural land the board will acquire the land, or is it envisaged that they will simply acquire a wayleave across it and a right to lay their pipes?  If it is a wayleave, will they act like the ESB or will they pay compensation to the farmers concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a wayleave and they will pay compensation.  I would direct the attention of the House to subsection (9), which says:</P>
      <P>In case the Board constructs a pipeline the Board shall take all reasonable measures to protect the natural environment and to avoid injuring the amenities of the area and, in particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Board shall while constructing the pipeline take all reasonable steps to prevent injury to any building, site, flora, fauna, feature or other thing which is of particular architectural, historic, archaeological, geological or natural interest, and when selecting the route for the pipeline the Board shall consult the Commission and in addition shall have regard to any representations made to the Board as regards the route of such pipeline by any local authority within whose functional area a proposed route, or any part of such a route would, if the pipeline were constructed, be situate, or any of the following on, in or over whose land such route or part would in such circumstances be situate...</P>
      <P>There is a tremendous amount of protection there which was not in previous Acts for people whose land is being crossed and in relation to any damage which might be done on the route of the proposed pipes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree it is desirable that BGE should have these powers so that they will not be <Col N="1566" /> frustrated in their attempts to bring natural gas to whatever parts of the country the Government decide.  The powers of the board in this Bill are much more restrictive than the powers the ESB have.  A practical example of this is: at the moment the board are negotiating with the IFA.  While those negotiations are not yet concluded I think they are proceeding in an amicable and understanding way.  I hope the IFA are satisfied with the attitude adopted by the board and that, without going to arbitration and without the board using their powers under this Bill, agreement can be reached with that body of farmers.</P>
    <P>For the negotiations with the IFA, BGE have employed one officer with an agricultural and technological background in this field.  He has had experience in another country of such negotiations.</P>

      <P>Compensation under this section covers wayleaves.  I understand there is a great deal of controversy or dissatisfaction in the Cork area because of the compensation being offered for these wayleaves at present, and that it is claimed that it is not comparable with what is being paid in England by wayleaves by the British Gas Board.

      <P>These discussions are going on at the moment.  The board are trying to devise a formula with the IFA that will apply to wayleaves over the land where the pipe is carried. If agreement can be reached on this, that formula will be applied to all the land where the pipe will run.  There may be individuals in the route of the pipe who are not members of the IFA, and they will have to be negotiated with separately, or maybe there will be individual members of the IFA who will not accept this formula as being a basis for compensation, so they will have to be negotiated with separately.  However, my understanding is that the discussions are going well and that there is a very good chance that an agreement with them as a body will be reached.

      <P>The Deputy should let me finish.  I do not think it should necessarily follow that the same compensation should be paid here as is paid in Britain.  If the price paid in Britain was, say, £30, would he say that is all that should be got here in <Col N="1570" /> certain instances and that it should not be £40?  There is no uniformity, and it is not necessary that there should be uniformity.  If Bord Gáis Éireann can reach agreement with the IFA on this matter, I think that would be generally acceptable to 99 per cent of the farmers involved in the compensation, and if they do not, then some other formula will have to be devised which will prove acceptable to the farmers' body.  However, I think BGE are approaching it in the right way in trying to get an acceptable formula on the presumption that the IFA would speak for the vast majority of farmers.</P>

If a formula can be devised and if that can be agreed by the IFA that is a major step forward and will ease considerably the problems of BGE in acquiring land and will also reduce considerably the number of cases that go to arbitration.  I do not think that this is a simple thing that can be agreed after one night's sitting.  This has been going on for a good while and I would see it going on for another few months and even at that stage it might not prove acceptable but the attitude is right and the machinery for devising it is correct and BGE are right to try to reach an agreement with the body rather than go from farmer to farmer.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (6), line 29, after &ldquo;accordingly&rdquo; to add &ldquo;save and except that any contract already entered into between the Company and the E.S.B. shall not be enforceable against the Board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This comes back to the kernel of the whole thing.  The manner in which the gas was allocated by Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta and the fact that the ESB were allocated 60 per cent of this <Col N="1573" /> gas is something that we have disagreed with and will continue to disagree with.  While Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta were not responsible for making the actual decision, they were the body through which the decision was executed. The 60 per cent of the first gas find in our history will be wasted on a scale that should not be tolerated.  We put forward last week and have mentioned again today ways in which it could be utilised for the greater benefit of the economy and everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>We maintain that the question of a gas grid should have been considered two years ago, not now after this Bill is passed.  The loss of 70 to 75 per cent of this gas by generating electricity is a waste of natural resources. It was undoubtedly allocated to the ESB as a matter of expediency.  We do not agree with this.  It should not have been got rid of in a hurry in a way where three-quarters of the allocation is wasted.  It should be fed into Dublin and the densely populated areas on the way.  Looking to the future we should be thinking of making it available in places like Shannon, Ennis, the West of Ireland, Dundalk and Drogheda.  We should think along these lines.  By having low cost energy available particularly in the West of Ireland we would undoubtedly tempt and encourage industrialists to go to the West of Ireland in order to utilise this low cost energy.  If what we propose is adopted this is what would happen.  Instead of that there is this colossal waste of our natural gas.</P>
    <P>Last week we mentioned that it is contrary to EEC policy to utilise natural gas to generate electricity.  The Minister gave instances where it was used in some of the EEC countries, but it was put to this use some years before the EEC came out with this particular line of thought on the utilisation of natural gas.  Since then as far as we are aware nobody has contravened EEC policy in this matter.  We are only a short time in the world of natural gas and our Government made this decision and the fact that Bord Gáis is taking over the liabilities and all contracts and so on of Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta should not mean <Col N="1574" /> that we should perpetuate a wrong decision. I have not read any article or magazine that agrees with this decision to make it available to the ESB and the experts in the EEC countries who have had natural gas for some years, do not agree with what we have done in this country, and we feel that the decision can still be reversed.  Admittedly the ESB have gone ahead with their plans for building a generating station in Cork, but they say that this station is designed in such a manner that it can be changed to oil from gas at very short notice.  So, in the event of our finding our own oil or the ESB wanting to continue with this, they can still get heavy fuel oil at reasonable prices under present market conditions.  If action is not taken now to reverse this decision by acceptance of our amendment one of the greatest mistakes made in many years will be perpetuated.  Natural gas, which we did not dream we would have at the time of the oil crisis a few years ago will be wasted.  We did not know we were going to have it. We would have loved to have had it. Now we find ourselves with sufficient natural gas to enable us to produce a low cost energy policy.</P>
    <P>We are well aware of what we suffered in the last three years as a result of the oil crisis.  We know what happened in all sectors of the economy because of the oil crisis and our dependence on oil.  Now, we could get away from this terrible dependence on oil; natural gas, together with turf and hydro-electric schemes would certainly give us reasonable independence should another oil crisis occur and we cannot be sure it will not.</P>
    <P>We put down this amendment to undo a very wrong decision in our opinion.  We are backed up by the opinion of the EEC Energy Committee. Now, there is an opportunity to undo that wrong decision&mdash;it is not too late&mdash;and to utilise the natural gas for the benefit of the country and help to break the stranglehold in which we have been for the past three years as a result of the oil crisis and the attitude of the multi-national oil companies in charging us for energy on which we were dependent.</P>
    <Col N="1575" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the Deputy's final point about the EEC directive, that directive does not prohibit use in member states of natural gas for electricity generation but it sets out the circumstances in which the use of natural gas for the generation of electricity may be authorised by a national Administration.  That directive is dated 13th March, 1975, and so it could only apply to decisions taken since that date.  The Government decision to give the natural gas to the ESB was taken in March, 1974, 12 months earlier.</P>
      <P>In any case, the EEC directive provides that while the supply of natural gas for electricity generation is to be on an interruptible basis, it may be authorised if the use of the gas proves necessary for technical reasons or if the gas cannot be put to a more profitable use.  On both these counts I think the decision of the Government to allocate the gas to the ESB is acceptable in EEC circles.  It is an interruptible supply.  If we should at some future date decide that we had a better technical use for this gas we could, because of the fact that the generating station being built at Whitegate, County Cork, is capable of being switched to oil operation, have the option of taking away the gas from the ESB.  The amendment of Deputy Barrett and Deputy O'Malley would make BGE and the State&mdash;the ESB being the victim&mdash;go back on a contract already entered into.  That is not a very desirable standard for a State body to set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is argued that the use of natural gas for electricity generation is wasteful and I think Deputy Barrett used the figure of 75 per cent waste.  The ESB say that with them the conversion rate for electricity is about 40 per cent on a year-round basis, taking into account stopping and starting and everything else.  At the user's end, the actual point of use, electricity is the most efficient of all, much more efficient than gas, coal or turf or oil. It has the highest thermal efficiency at the users' end.  It appears that the conversion is less efficient than in the case of gas or oil but is much more efficient at the user's end.  You cannot <Col N="1576" /> argue that because it is not as efficient at one stage you should not use it even though you get a better result with the end use of the natural gas. Conversion of any fuel is wasteful, varying in degree from 10 per cent to 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett talks of using natural gas in Ennis and Shannon and Clare but the fact is that the only energy distribution system we have on a national basis where a grid already exists is in the case of electricity. Deputy O'Malley referred to an energy conference held in London last week.  An energy conference on the use of natural gas was held here about two months ago and some very fine papers were produced.  Both sides of the argument were put with spokesmen from the electricity generating bodies arguing that because a grid exists, even though the conversion rate in converting natural gas to electricity was wasteful, the capital costs were very much less and we had the benefit of that.  You could get a higher conversion rate by using natural gas all over the country by building a new grid.  You must balance one calculation with the other, whether it would be more beneficial to the economy to build a grid and get a higher efficiency rate from the natural gas or get a lower efficiency and use the existing national grid which at present feeds every part of Ireland from north Donegal to the south of Cork. There are two points of view about this.  Frequently, Deputy O'Brien makes pleas here for district heating. If the ESB can develop district heating from the waste heat at their power station there will be still greater efficiency in the use of natural gas to generate electricity.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I fully subscribe to the Government's decision which was absolutely right at the time to allocate the gas to the ESB because they had the plans.  The benefits of this natural gas are, to a large extent, being distributed over the whole country because 50 per cent of this find is going to the ESB who are feeding the whole country with an energy source.  It was the right decision <Col N="1577" /> at the time because we had to have big users.  The argument has been made about shipping it to Dublin but the use of existing gas in Dublin at that time was less than 10 per cent of the total gas find.  Given that, and given our overdependence on imported oil, we should seek to lessen that dependence as far as possible and make ourselves as independent as possible in regard to energy for industrial and domestic use.</P>
    <P>The decision at that stage to make us independent in fertilisers for farmers and go some way, even though not nearly far enough, towards making us less dependent on imported oil was the correct decision.  For me to accept an amendment that would ask BGE to go back on a contract already signed is something I cannot do.  In regard to any further decisions taken in respect of using any further finds of gas, because of the defeat of the Opposition's amendment to raise the £25 million to £100 million this evening, they will have a chance to say what use should be made of these future finds.  After two years I cannot now accept that BGE should go back on a contract with the ESB or should ask the ESB at this stage to reverse engines and change their whole buying policy.  That policy is tied up with the amount of peat they can get from Bord na Móna.  I cannot ask the board to go back on that contract or any future contracts for usage of natural gas.  In that event we would have to come back here looking for more money for BGE and we would have another chance of exchanging views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be very little point in expressing views on the amount of our natural gas that will have gone up in smoke or in vapour by that time.  The question of going back on contracts is a different matter.  I would not subscribe to it, but this is a matter of major importance and merits serious consideration because of the wastage involved.  There were contracts for the supply of oil and when the price went up the suppliers did not mind going back on their contracts and mulcting us.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks about the ESB having an established grid.  Why should we not establish a gas grid?  Whatever happens about the price of oil, the ESB costs seem to keep going up.  Even now when heavy fuel oil has come down in price there is no question of domestic users paying less, and I presume the same applies to other users.  We propose, and we will continue to do so, that this gas should be used to the maximum benefit of the country and we should set about doing this from the start. By the time other strikes have been made we will have wasted a high percentage. If the ESB are so far advanced with their generating station they can turn over to fuel oil, which is not so expensive now.  The sky will not fall down if we insist that they do this.  We think the case we have made this week and last week cannot be denied.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can give any further answers.  As the Deputy has said, the matter has been debated for quite a long time.  Even if in the future it is decided that the ESB would not be allowed further use, this can be done under existing <Col N="1579" /> legislation rather than asking us now to break a contract with the ESB.  It need not be written into legislation in the way suggested in the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC directive states that it is wasteful and they tell members not to generate electricity from natural gas.  Apparently this contract was signed only in June, 1976. For all we know it may have been signed yesterday, 15 months after the EEC directive, long after the directive was brought to the Government's attention.  I will quote again from Mr. Bunyan's article in <i>Energy Ireland:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB will use 270 million therms p.a. from the Kinsale field. As a rule of thumb, for every three units of natural gas available one unit is lost in pipeline and appliance losses, while two units are lost in <Col N="1580" /> electricity generation transmission and appliance losses.  Thus, the decision to use the gas to generate electricity is a net loss to the country of 90 million therms p.a. which if sold as a direct substitute for diesel oil at the current price of 15 pence/therm would generate a revenue of £13.5 million p.a. for 20 years&mdash;more than enough to pay for the investment of £113 million for the proposed pipelines.</P>
    <P>Let us take diesel at 15p per therm. There are other more expensive and some less expensive forms of oil for the generation of energy.  That amounts to £13.5 million per annum lost for 20 years, a total loss of £270 million.  In other words, the acceptance of this amendment would save us £270 million.  Not alone would it double the gas grid but it would show a vast profit and he sets out at length &mdash;it is all graphs and statistics&mdash;how the gas grid would pay for itself.  It would be optimum use.  That is not denied.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to which he refers is worthy of the attention of the House:</P>
    <P>However, the use of natural gas exclusively as a feedstock may not constitute the best use in economic and national terms.  The fertiliser and the chemical industries have been subject to cycles of under and over supply.  An investment decision, taken in a time of high demand, may turn out to be the wrong decision if demand falls.  If the export market declines, we could find ourselves having to sell our finished product at a loss, as we have found many times in the past with our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>We have committed ourselves 40 per cent to NET and 60 per cent to the ESB.  This natural gas is suitable for the establishment of various kinds of petro-chemical industry and that usage would be optimum usage and very economic.  That unfortunately does not seem to have been taken into account at all.  The two things picked were fertiliser and electricity. In the past week we have seen what can happen to the fertiliser industry. <Col N="1581" /> Gouldings, a long established firm, is closing down and firing 365 men.  I know the type of fertiliser they were making is different from the type that will be made in Cork by NET, but what has happened to Gouldings shows the problems the industry can face.  Fertiliser sales over the past two or three years have been away down. We are now committing a large proportion of this to one business which, as Mr. Bunyan says, is cyclic.  We have a tragic example of how cyclic it is.  I am not seriously objecting to NET using this, though there is a certain element of risk involved, but it is a risk we have to take.</P>
    <P>The major objection is to the ESB and the arrangement made, an arrangement finalised in contractual form only this very month after notice had been given to the Government about the reservations of just about everyone involved, apart from the ESB and those in the electricity lobby.  They are the only people who have no reservations or doubts.  On Mr. Bunyan's figures, which are not disputed, I think, there will be a loss of £270 million arising out of what was decided by the Government two years ago and signed in the form of a contract probably as recently as yesterday.  We know it was this month anyway.</P>
    <P>These are serious matters and this is perhaps the last opportunity we will get to pull back on a major contract, one of very great importance to us, and save ourselves from wasting 60 per cent.  That is something we should do now.  The Minister fails to take into account the fact that the ESB have now a surplus generating capacity. The growth in electricity demand and sales is zero and has been for the past two years.  I am not certain that what is being proposed is wise remembering the existing surplus capacity apart altogether from the national waste involved in using a very valuable source of energy in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has raised two very interesting points, particularly that with regard to the date of the contract.  Despite the Minister's statement that they gave these contracts to the bodies they did because they had the organisation, Deputy <Col N="1582" /> O'Malley has pointed out there will still be this waste of a very valuable natural asset.  It is the Opposition's duty to show we are not satisfied.  We believe there will be colossal waste and the country will not reap the benefit it should.  Deputy O'Malley also referred to the closure of Gouldings.  We all know the fertiliser market fluctuates and the possibility is&mdash;we hope it will not be the evolution&mdash;the market will fluctuate again.  If NET are not able to use all the allocation, what will happen?  You cannot just turn natural gas off and on as you would your domestic gas cooker.  I am not at all satisfied at the way things are being done and there will be great uneasiness for some years to come watching how this will work out.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Government acted in the best interests.  I am sure they did but they did not act in the best interests of the economic use of natural gas.  The Minister implied the use of waste gas was peculiar to the ESB.  That is not true.  Any industrial undertaking which generates heat to any great extent will have waste heat. The waste coming off the first boiler cannot be trapped and used for other purposes.  I would hope the ESB would be successful in harnessing this waste heat.  We are starting a fairly large housing development in close proximity to two very big ESB stations and we suggested the ESB should be given the contract to heat and light these houses by using waste heat but we were told by the National Building Agency this is not possible.  If it is not possible in a densely populated area what hope is there of using such waste in remote areas where houses are thin on the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The formal signing of the contract has not yet been completed. The agreement is there but it has not been signed formally by the boards of the two companies.  Deputy O'Malley raised the point about the EEC directive.  He said somebody is working to the detriment of the Irish people.  The EEC directive referred to decisions taken by national administrations. The Government of this country took the decision to use this <Col N="1583" /> gas in this manner 12 months prior to the EEC directive.  They had to decide at that stage, which was approximately six months after the discovery of the field and less than 12 months after we came into office, and there were no feasibility studies as to the value or otherwise to the economy of a national grid when we came into office.  The Government had to decide the quickest way to get the gas ashore and used in the interests of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett speaks about building a grid but this was not possible in the circumstances.  It has taken over two years to get as far as this with a very small gas find involved, less than 13 miles.  The feasibility of building a grid, the cost of building it, were just not on.  Numerous figures have been quoted for the cost of a grid in the country.  Any one of them may or may not be right.  The only thing I can do is give the cost of an existing pipeline from Inch Strand to the Marino electricity works in Cork.  You can multiply that by the appropriate amount of 30.  You might be right or you might not.  The terrain might be different and there might be more or fewer river crossings.  It would not be possible to take this gas.  It was essential to get the contract price for the gas at the right level, to take it off fast, because the people who are selling the gas had made large capital investments to discover this gas and subsequently, as they are doing now, to exploit the gas.</P>
      <P>The longer the gas was left in the ground the dearer the gas would get because those people would have their money out that much longer.  A quick take off was necessary if we were to get a price for the gas.  It was also necessary from the point of view of the economy of this country and, as I said earlier, the dependence on imported oil.  The oil crisis is still fresh in our minds so we were anxious to lower our dependence as quickly as possible on imported oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about petro-chemical industries.  There is a fairly small market in the country available to petro-chemical industries <Col N="1584" /> so any market we had would have to be an export market which makes slow growth.  I am not taking a figure out of my head but it might take 25 years, certainly a great number of years, to build an export market to take off a find of this limited size, so we had to find large users quickly. The ESB were 63 per cent dependent on imported oil.  An obvious option was to lower their dependence on imported oil and give them a chance to be less in the hands of the oil producers.</P>
    <P>We have a big internal market for fertilisers.  Even though there will be a surplus for export we would not be dependent on export markets to take what we would produce off our hands because we have a large internal market.  Therefore, NET was the second alternative.  Those are the two people who got it.  It was strategically and commercially the correct decision to take.  If at some future date we want to switch that oil or gas from the ESB, the station at Whitegate in Cork has been so designed that that can be done.  The correct decision was taken at the time.  It is one I stand over and I certainly would not have BGE break their contract at this stage without warning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood the Minister correctly no contract can be broken at the present time because no contract is signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In my capacity as an auctioneer I often have many understandings with people who are buying property but those are not legal until one has the lolly in one's hand and the contract is signed.  I do not go for understandings.  We are now in the position that there is no contract between BGE and the ESB.  We only have a decision made two years ago, the Minister says, to give the gas to the ESB without any contractual arrangements whatsoever.  This makes it still easier for us to utilise the natural gas in the best possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> The question of getting it out fast and making it viable is not on because Marathon Oil Company might persuade the Government that it is important to maintain pressure at the well head in order to make the whole find viable.  The viability of any undertaking comes from the revenue you make from that undertaking.  If 45 per cent of the total gas out there is sheer wastage, surely the viability of it must be looked at again?  We have proposed feeding it into the premium gas market, the consumer market.  This would help to make it more viable.  The building of a pipeline to the denser sections of population would make it possible to use it far quicker than the ESB will possibly get around to doing it.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long it will take, but surely it will cost £60 million to £70 million to build this generating station.  I presume this building is under way now, but no contract whatsoever has been signed for gas.  We have spoken a lot about this but we have now made a very important discovery that there is no contract signed and there is only an understanding. Now is the time to reverse the decision made by the Government at that time in the light of expert opinion with regard to the proper use of natural gas and EEC opinion as well.  It is not too late to do this and to use it for the maximum benefit of everyone in the country.  This is our first find of natural gas and we should start the ball rolling in the right way by the proper utilisation of it.  It makes this easier still because we have no contract signed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has certainly thrown up a very significant fact now that we were not aware of before, that is that there is not contract. Therefore, there can be no question of breaking a contract.  Government decisions have been known to change from time to time.  This Government <Col N="1586" /> made a decision in 1974 to grant equal pay to women.  At the end of 1975 they made a decision not to grant equal pay to women.  Then, in 1976, they made another decision that they would probably have to give equal pay to women but they would put it off as long as they could.  Understandings were allowed to arise in the minds of many people as a result of those decisions but that did not stop the understandings being rudely changed because the decisions were rudely changed.  We now have a position that nobody is breaking a contract with anybody because we discovered there is not a contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Chair has not ruled our amendment out of order because it refers to a contract already entered into.  Could we amend that now to say: &ldquo;or to be entered into&rdquo; so that we keep within the rules of order?  We are flabbergasted, as I suppose everybody must be, to discover that at this stage there is no contract with the ESB.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a glorious opportunity not to go ahead with what is regarded by common consent of everybody outside the ESB lobby as being an unfortunate arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw an analogy with what is being done now in relation to our gas which I think is not too farfetched.  If the ESB found themselves in a position that they did not have surplus generating capacity&mdash;unlike their present position&mdash; and if they were trying to generate electricity from a native source, if they came to an arrangement or understanding with the Department of Lands to buy State forests and if they chopped down the trees in order to make electricity from logs, that would be patently a wasteful use of a national asset and there would be an outcry.  What is being done now in relation to natural gas is equally wasteful and there is an outcry from those who are qualified to comment. Perhaps the general public does not see it as clearly because we do not know a great deal about gas.  If the <Col N="1587" /> ESB were to suggest generating electricity from burning wood from State forests, I suppose it would be feasible but it would be a dreadful waste of timber.  The timber is much more valuable than it would be on conversion into electricity.  It has been proved beyond doubt that gas is far more valuable if it is not converted into electricity.</P>
    <P>The problem the Minister cited originally, of an existing contract being there and that it would be wrong to ask the parties to break the contract, does not arise.  The contract does not exist.</P>

      <P>My amendment and that of Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Barrett say virtually the same thing. However, the problem there might be that if gas was found and it was not of commercial quality and did not merit exploitation, it would still have to be offered to the gas board, whereas the word &ldquo;got&rdquo; covers the situation that if it is found and can be exploited, then the Gas Board must get it.  There is not much difference between the two amendments and if the Opposition wish I can accept theirs.  However, I think the word &ldquo;got&rdquo; covers the situation just as well.</P>

      <P>There may have been an error in typing amendment No. 5a, because what I wrote, as far as I can remember, is: &ldquo;all natural gas discovered within the jurisdiction of the State&rdquo;.  The point I would make to the Minister in relation <Col N="1591" /> to his amendment and to our 5a as it appears there is that it is only gas got in the State.  Gas got outside the State but within the jurisdiction of the State is not covered.  What I mean by that is that the State consists of the land of Ireland and three miles beyond it, but the jurisdiction of the State so far as gas and hydrocarbons generally are concerned extends to the edge of the Continental Shelf or as defined in these various orders.  That is not covered.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (1), line 49, to delete &ldquo;, for consumption therein,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the gas board control over all gas landed or got within the jurisdiction <Col N="1593" /> of the State regardless of whether it was for consumption within the State or, being optimistic, in the event of our finding more gas, or whether the gas board were involved in the export of gas landed or got within the jurisdiction of the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take them separately.  The reason for amendment No. 5b is to give the board control over gas, landed or got within the jurisdiction of the State, and that even if some of that gas is not for consumption in the State the board would have control over the export of that gas.  It says very definitely &ldquo;for consumption therein&rdquo; meaning the State.  The licensee in this case shall offer the gas for sale to the board at reasonable terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some difficulty here.  I see what is intended by the amendment but there would be some interference in another Minister's Department if I accepted this amendment, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the licensing authority and he sets down the conditions under which a field will be exploited, admittedly in consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power.  It is conceivable that at some future time, when all our energy needs in this country are met, that that Minister could say: &ldquo;This field may be exploited.  You have permission to export directly without bringing it into this jurisdiction&rdquo;.  If I were to agree to that I might be to some extent dictating that it will not be possible to issue licences under these conditions in that regard.  I would be interfering with the issue of licences and the conditions attached to them, which are the responsibility of a separate Department.  Section 36 covers that end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point that the amendment is trying to <Col N="1594" /> meet, that there will be, I hope, a situation where quantities of gas will be landed which could not be for consumption within the State.  What we are trying to achieve is that they would be landed anyway even if they were not to be consumed within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite possible within the confines of this Bill but the Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to issue licences for exportation and attach to them such conditions as he thinks fit.  One of the conditions in 50 years' time if we were overflowing with gas or energy could conceivably be that a person could develop a field and export the proceeds without landing it in this country.  It could create difficulties. The licence, and the conditions attached to it, which the Minister would issue for the development of any field would be issued after consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power.  Therefore that Minister would have a say in the conditions.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5c:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 24, lines 4 to 13, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>The Chair was right in saying that the last two amendments were related.  I am sorry for saying that they were not.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to try not to give an out from the obligations imposed by subsection (1) for people who have licences, where the gas has to be offered to someone other than the board.  I presume that in the existing licences there is no such provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce says the gas must be landed in Ireland and does not say to whom it has to be offered.  This legislation says it must be offered to the Gas Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that we would prefer to see that the Gas Board would be offered all the <Col N="1595" /> gas that was going, anyway, if that is feasible.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the general principle behind the legislation, that the Gas Board should get all the gas that is offered; but there are situations which can be visualised where it might not be desirable to do this.  An example which I gave was that supposing we had one or two more finds and we established a grid which extended roughly from Galway down east and south, and that is all the gas we have.  But supposing at some later stage there is a very small field of gas found off the north coast of Donegal, and at the same time, coincidentally, we get a huge industry here which wants a large supply of natural gas and would be willing to take the total find out of this field, it would seem unreasonable to put a third party between that industry and the gas field and to let the Gas Board direct the find to that industry on a separate contract basis.  It is one of these things that might never arise but which we feel we should bow towards it in case it does happen.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5d:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (3), line 17, after &ldquo;1954&rdquo; to add &ldquo;In any such arbitration the arbitrator shall not take into account expenditure by any party negotiating with the Board other than expenditure on the Block in which natural gas concerned shall have been found.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that in any arbitration hearing, the company concerned, which in all probability will be a multi-national or part of a multi-national, will not be able to set off losses incurred in another oil field far removed from the particular block in which they are now negotiating, which is the subject of arbitration, that no losses other than losses incurred in expenditure on the block in which the natural gas concerned shall be found will be taken <Col N="1596" /> into consideration at any arbitration hearing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle that only relevant and appropriate expenditure should be taken into account is entirely acceptable.  It is not clear that the very explicit restriction provided for in the amendment would be satisfactory in all cases and therefore it is felt that in relation to all other matters relevant to possible arbitration proceedings the elements to be taken into account should be left for settlement by the arbitrators in the light of the arguments of the parties involved.  I have no doubt that the arbitrators will not allow the situation as envisaged by Deputy Barrett, where a company with a licence in Donegal and another one in Cork would be allowed to charge off the Donegal explorations against the find in Cork in determining the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of our principal reasons for putting down this amendment is because of the structure of multi-national companies.  They have been known to set off expenditure in Timbuktu against expenditure somewhere in the North Sea.  It is because of the structure of multi-nationals that they can and do get away with this.  It should not be left to the arbitrator to decide this because multi-nationals are so adept in setting off expenditure that I do not think an Irish arbitrator would be able to counteract them.  It has not been possible for years to counteract them throughout the world because of the structure of different companies under the parent company.  The Minister should accept this amendment and not leave the matter for decision by the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very much in our interest as a country and specifically in the interests of the board that they should go in because it will serve to keep down the price which the board will be called on to pay as a result of the arbitrator's finding.  This happens everywhere exploration is going on: the principal objective of the multi-national companies is to ensure that they write off the maximum <Col N="1597" /> amount of expenditure against a single find.  Since they have been doing it in the North Sea not just in relation to different fields in the North Sea but in relation to different countries altogether, they will certainly do it here.  Not only will you have a sort of situation that the Minister said he was sure would not arise, that if they drill off Cork and drill off Donegal and find nothing off Cork they will try to set off their Cork expenditure against their Donegal find&mdash;they will certainly do that, but they will also probably set off their Nigerian expenditure.  Unless the arbitrator is given power to say: &ldquo;I am not interested in your accounts with everything fiddled around and mixed up so as to confuse; I want the dockets to show what you spent in block 407, 70 miles west of Donegal and nothing else.  You cannot put down £3 million that you have spent off Lagos last year or £5 million that you spent off Cork&rdquo;.  If the arbitrator has not that power he will not be able to stop them putting in their Cork expenditure against their Donegal find.  This has been shown to be the case in other countries.  They could not stop this practice and we will not be able to stop it unless we have a specific power here.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that it is very much in our interests because what is being arbitrated is the price the board will pay to the discovering company which must at least be partially a multi-national, in a consortium. It is very much to the national advantage that the arbitrator should have power to disregard what we would call irrelevant expenditure. otherwise, the price will be pushed up considerably by setting off expenditure on other blocks.  It will mean that if there is one successful find by a company they will set off all their expenditure against that.  This will drive up the price of the gas.  Without this power the arbitrator will have no option but to award a very much higher price because he has to take into account that they spent £50 million whereas in fact they may have spent £5 million on that particular block.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the purpose of the amendment and I have a lot of sympathy with its object, to keep the price of gas as low as possible, but we might be doing ourselves harm if we allow this amendment through.  Take the situation where there are adjoining blocks and a company drills four holes in, say, block 72 and the final hole in block 73 is the one that strikes oil.  Even though it is all in the one series of drillings, just because of a line on a map they would not be allowed to include the cost of the other four drillings in the price charged for the gas in the adjoining block.  If the five holes had all been drilled in the one block and the fifth one was oil-bearing, according to this amendment they would be allowed to charge all five drillings against the cost of the find.  The amendment might be seen as restrictive and might discourage in some way applications for blocks and licences and generally discourage exploration which we want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to correction, I am pretty certain that some adjoining blocks off the Fastnet are in one group.  It could present a problem in that regard.  A company that did all the drilling within one block could charge it all against one find whereas if they happened to go into the adjoining block they would not be allowed to charge for the wells they had already drilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arbitrator is not as tied as Deputy O'Malley seems to think as regards the documents he can demand. Because there is this provision I think he can ask for any papers he wants <Col N="1599" /> and can ensure that they are the papers that will give him the true facts regarding costings in exploring and exploiting a find of gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past when blocks in the North Sea were auctioned there was an instance where the Shell Oil Company paid £23 million for one block and another company paid about £500,000 or some small sum for an adjoining block.  The Shell Oil Company found nothing and the other company were successful in the adjoining block.  I do not think the £23 million should be written off against a gas find on the south coast or the west coast if something similar occurred here.  We should be ahead of this situation.  Because of the multi-national structure these companies are capable of making such a situation arise.  This has happened and they have got away with it.  We want to ensure that they do not get away with it at our expense and we should not leave it for a decision by the arbitrator in the final analysis.  We should have provision in the legislation to ensure that this practice will not be continued here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5e:</P>
      <P>In page 26, Article 5, line 31, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This opens up an entirely new field and the Minister would have difficulty in finding people to serve on this board who know anything about the natural gas industry.  In the event of the Minister appointing a board and discovering after a year that the members have no proper knowledge of the activities that should be discussed at board level, we consider that five years is too long for service on the board and our amendment proposes three years, which we regard as sufficient. It makes it more flexible for the Minister to take action if board members were not pulling their weight in discussing matters in this new field. This is the case in other State boards.</P>

      <P>I can appoint for three years or for five years and I would probably adopt that attitude.  It is undesirable that a board should be changed entirely after a stated period and the Minister can appoint members for five years or for two, three or four years.  I would not agree to the suggested change.  Five years applies to most State boards.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 14, to delete the words &ldquo;with just cause&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Its purpose is to ensure that the issue of whether a wife is in desertion&mdash;in which case her consent will not be required&mdash;is to be determined by the court under section 4 (3).  If the words &ldquo;with just cause&rdquo; remained, a husband could sell a home when his wife had left it and seek to argue subsequently that it was not a family home for the purposes of the Act.  The question whether the wife was entitled to leave and thus was not in desertion is one that ought to be resolved before the sale.  This is the clear policy of the Bill.  I mentioned in my Second Stage speech that I would be proposing an amendment on these lines.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where a spouse, without the prior consent in writing of the other spouse, purports to convey any interest in the family home to any person except the other spouse, then, subject to subsections (2) and (3) and section 4, the purported conveyance shall be void.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a conveyance if it is made by a spouse in pursuance of an enforceable agreement made before the marriage of the spouses.</P>
    <P>(3)  No conveyance shall be void by reason only of subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if it is made to a purchaser for full value.</P>
    <P>(b)  if it is made, by a person other than the spouse making the purported conveyance referred to in subsection (1), to a purchaser for value, or</P>
    <P>(c)  if its validity depends on the validity of a conveyance in respect of which any of the conditions mentioned in subsection (2)  or paragraph (a) or (b) is satisfied.</P>
    <P>(4)  If any question arises in any proceedings as to whether a conveyance is valid by reason of subsection (2) or (3), the burden of proving that validity shall be on the person alleging it.</P>
    <P>(5)  In subsection (3), &lsquo;full value&rsquo; means such value as amounts or approximates to the value of that for which it is given.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section, &lsquo;purchaser&rsquo; means a grantee, lessee, assignee, mortgagee, chargeant or other person who in good faith acquires an estate or interest in property.</P>
    <P>(7)  For the purposes of this section, section 3 of the Conveyancing Act, 1882, shall be read as if the words &lsquo;as such&rsquo; wherever they appear in paragraph (ii) of subsection (1) of that section were omitted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is, as I indicated during the debate on <Col N="1603" /> the Second Stage, to delete the existing section 3 and insert a new section.  I indicated after listening to the Second Stage debate that I had a worry about subsequent purchasers.  This amendment is to protect purchasers for value who acquire the home from the original purchaser from a spouse where for example, the consent of the other spouse was not obtained.  The amendment makes it clear that they will be protected if they are in good faith and provide value.  This is the same criterion as that which applies to the original purchaser from the spouse except that in the latter case full value as defined by the section must have been given.  The substance of the requirements regarding notice is the same in the amendment as in the original section, although expressed in different terms.</P>
    <P>What I am doing here is incorporating section 3 of the Conveyancing Act, 1882.  The conveyancing obligation in that section will apply to all purchasers under this proposed section.  I will give an example.  Supposing H, the husband, sells the family home to A without the consent of his wife and for what is clearly much less than its value.  A, who gets no title, then sells to B.  If B is a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, he will obtain a good title.  However, if B, being a husband, subsequently sells to C who is a purchaser in good faith for value, but not full value, C will get no title although C, being a single man, may give a good title to D if D is a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration. This is a technical provision <Col N="1604" /> designed to ensure that a conveyancing defect will not go on and on along the line.</P>
