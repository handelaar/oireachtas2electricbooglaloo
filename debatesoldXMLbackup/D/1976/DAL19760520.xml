    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We established last night that since March, 1973, the price of the pint had more than doubled, increased by 20p.  The Minister vindicated his efforts to avoid responsibility in this regard last night when he said that the increases in taxation were imposed by the Dáil, the increases that were authorised by those engaged in the trade had been recommended by the National Prices Commission and a proportion, he said, was due to publicans who had applied increases to which they were not legally entitled.</P>
      <P>The fact is that this Government came to power complaining about the increase in prices of various commodities, including the pint and said &mdash;I am not even talking about their claim that they would reduce prices&mdash; that they would stabilise prices and introduce price control.  A good example of their efforts in that regard is provided in the price of the pint which as I say, since March, 1973, since this Government came into office, has more than doubled. The efforts, if one can call them efforts, of the Government in regard to prices are shown very clearly when we look at what has happened to the price of the pint.</P>
      <P>I do not know the various excuses that might be advanced by the Government in regard to this matter, but I would ask him, before they give any further excuses, to think about what they were saying to the people prior to the last general election in regard to prices and to apply the yardstick of their criticism at that time to their own performance now and to their own excuses now.  It could be, I would hope, a salutary matter in the politics of this country if we were to get a little honest self-appraisal of that kind even if it was not done publicly, if there was a more realistic approach to problems of this kind, that in the longer term could be of benefit to all our people even though the cost of the lesson, literally and figuratively, would clearly have been extremely high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 20p increase in the price of beer since March, 1973, only 8p has accrued to the Exchequer.  The remaining <Col N="1699" /> 12p has accrued to private interests, to brewers and vintners.  Of that 8p accruing to the Exchequer by way of tax every penny has gone back to the public, so that the net increase is 12p and none of that has been received by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that legal difficulties arose in relation to the control of the price of beer.  These are at present a matter of litigation and also of very careful study by me and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who will, I understand, shortly be bringing forward proposals which will have the effect of controlling liquor prices.  The Finance Bill is not a suitable occasion on which to discuss the difficulties which arose in relation to the price control of alcoholic liquor. However, I think it is common knowledge that amongst other things the nature and description of premises in which alcoholic liquor is sold also arose and none of this could have been reasonably foreseen in 1972 or 1973 when we had expectations that we would be able to effect more control than seemed possible.  Understandably there is disappointment about the price of this very popular drink, which can do people good&mdash;I mean the drink, not the discontent&mdash;and it is proper on this occasion when discussing the financial aspect that the position should be made clear so that people will realise the State is responsible for the smaller part of the increases which have occurred and this realisation may help in some way to assuage their anger or disappointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, as the Minister said, that of the 20p increase only 8p represents tax increase, and that tax increase goes back, of course, to the people in Government expenditure. The Minister referred to the efforts made by the Government to control prices.  When one looks at a range of tax increases one finds an automatic effect on prices.  If tax is increased, as it was in the second last budget, on ordinary consumer popular goods, as the Minister described them, then inevitably prices will increase and so will the cost of living.  The Minister talked about <Col N="1700" /> areas of choice in regard to tax increases. Most people who take a drink regard the pint as an essential commodity and an increase in tax on the pint creates a demand inevitably for increased wages.  Therefore there is a direct effect as a result of the Minister's policy.  Another criticism is that the rate of tax on the pint is far in excess of the British rate.  This must have an indirect effect on tourism and, when tackling taxation policy, the Minister should bear in mind the tremendous benefits that flow in terms of jobs and from the point of view of our balance of payments as a result of expenditure on the part of those who come here.  The numbers must be affected to some degree, though perhaps not very significantly, because of the price of an ordinary item most people like to enjoy, especially on holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just point out one interesting little statistic?  Between 1969 and 1973 the duty content as a proportion of the retail price was higher than it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I comment on that interesting statistic from the Minister?  All it proves is that the promise of the Coalition to stabilise prices has been so badly kept that the increase in the price of the pint has shot up but the proportion the Exchequer takes is now relatively smaller.  This is highlighted when one recalls that we are asked in this Bill to confirm permanently an increase in duty or tax on the pint which is in excess of 6p.  That illustrates just how appalling the lack of control of prices has been.  Not alone has there been an increase of over 100 per cent in the price of the pint since this Government took office but in this Bill alone there is provision for more than 6p increase in tax on the price of the pint.  Overall there has been an increase of 10p in the price of the pint in the early months of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the effects mentioned by Deputy Brugha, that is also indicative of the savage increase which has taken place and which we are asked to implement in this Bill, an increase which is having a serious consequence on the consumer price index, with all <Col N="1701" /> the consequences that flow from that, consequences of which the Minister is only too well aware.  The pint may not be the area in which the consequences of the increases are at their most serious but this is all part of an overall package embarked on by the Government in the budget.  There is a most serious consequence in regard to wage claims and in the negotiation of a national pay agreement and all these increases were allowed to happen not inadvertantly but in the full knowledge that they would happen, it having been pointed out to the Minister what the consequences of what he was doing would be.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to widen the scope of the discussion but it is proper that these things should be pointed out.  I believe the Minister is being naive when he talks about the amount of the increase of more than 100 per cent under this Government which has gone to the Exchequer as distinct from the amount that has gone to the brewers and the publicans.  The Minister must realise that the consumer is concerned with the price he has to pay.  That is his primary concern.  If he realises the portion of the increase he has to pay is going to the Exchequer he cannot console himself with the happy thought that it is going in a good cause, not when he sees the way the Exchequer is being handled or mishandled and realises that perhaps a great deal of what he is paying is going to pay off the servicing of the excessive borrowing that the Minister has engaged in.  All of this arises out of consideration of the enormous increase that has been imposed and allowed to occur by this Government in the price of the pint.</P>
    <P>However, I do not wish to prolong the discussion on this unduly.  The verdict of the people on the performance of the Government in regard to prices generally, and in particular in regard to the price of the pint, will be delivered fairly soon and in delivering it the people will take into account what was said by the Minister and by all of his colleagues when they sought their votes in the general election.</P>

      <P>There is little comfort for anybody who takes the popular pint, as it has been called, to know that a small portion goes to the Exchequer. I further point out that there is a big discrepancy between the price the person pays for the popular pint in different areas of the country, particularly in the Dublin area compared to rural areas.  We have heard from the Minister this morning that the small portion goes to the Exchequer, but could he do anything about the fact with his colleagues, or could this Government do anything about the fact that there is such a discrepancy in the price of the pint all over the country?</P>

      <P>I was explaining earlier that there is a whole field of litigation affecting the price of beer at present.  It is going on for over two years despite the present efforts of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bring it to a conclusion.  I understand the matter may again be before the court on 27th of this month, but until this matter is resolved the non-fiscal element of the price of beer is extremely difficult to control.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 36 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this section is to increase the main rate of excise duty on spirits by the equivalent of 4.68p on a glass of spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate the increase that arises from <Col N="1703" /> the budget and is being implemented in this Bill, taking account of the excise duty and value-added tax which was imposed later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Adding both the value-added tax which was attracted by the increase in January and the adjustment in value-added tax on 1st March, the total increase would be 7p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate the increase in the price of a glass of spirits between March, 1973 and the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of 31p and of that only 11.7p came to the Exchequer as duty and the duty content as a percentage of retail price is now 41.9 per cent as against 49 per cent in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the percentage content?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what was the price of the glass in March, 1973?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>37p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>So again it would be true to say that in the case of the glass of spirits under this Government the price of the pint has more than doubled and the price of the glass of spirits has almost doubled. Would that be a fair statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I would use the words &ldquo;under the Government&rdquo;.  I would say &ldquo;during that period in which the Government were responsible for only 11.7p duty in the increase&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister presumably appreciates that he and his colleagues prior to March, 1973, had a very different tune to play in regard to increases in prices of different commodities, in particular the glass of spirits, whether they were occurring as a result of increased taxation or not.  I presume the Minister has some recollection of what he said at that time.  If he has, does it not strike him as irrelevant, to say the least, to tell us now what proportion of the <Col N="1704" /> almost doubling in the price of a glass of spirits has gone to the Exchequer and what has gone to the distillers or publicans?  Is it not a fact that as far as the consumer is concerned, during the period of office of the Coalition the price for the glass of spirits has increased by 31p which is almost double the price it was when they came into office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made orders under powers bestowed upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the previous Administration.  These orders have been challenged in court.  Until that issue is resolved, and until we know whether these orders are valid&mdash;and this is a matter which has to be determined by the court&mdash;all prosecutions against publicans in respect of excess charges are frustrated, pending the court decision on what has now become known as the Dundalk publicans' case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I understand the Deputy will naturally succumb to the temptation to make the most out of the increases that have occurred, I emphasise that a lot of those increases are, as far as the Government are concerned, not valid increases.  However, the Government are frustrated in their efforts to effect control over the prices of these commodities because orders have been challenged.  It is proper to draw attenion to the fact that the smaller part of the increase is attributable to tax because those who have increased prices without valid authority have endeavoured to create the impression that the increases are attributable to taxation, whereas the main impact has been attributable to other causes.  This Government notified the country last year what the overall financial position was. No Government had ever given such detailed statements of the financial position, the cost of running the country, of the Estimates presented, the massive cuts made in those Estimates, the reductions in expenditure effected and the fact that notwithstanding those reductions increases in taxation will be necessary.  We said the choice was not between having very popular and attractive reductions <Col N="1705" /> in taxation but rather, how the taxation would be paid.  We made a decision which we entirely defend and which nobody has yet attacked in favour of putting the increases in taxation on less essential items, so that we collected the revenue by indirect taxation rather than by increasing the rates of income tax.  Those who object to this increase on beer and spirits should say where they propose to collect the alternative revenue.  The only real alternative would be by increasing the rates of income tax.  It is argued that the effect of these increases on beer and spirits is to generate a demand for increased wages.  For the last few years I have been asserting and I again assert that it is hypocritical for people to demand more and more Government expenditure and more services and decline to provide the money to pay for them. For people to demand more money for welfare and say that if you extract the money to pay for that welfare we will demand income increases is to make a hypocritical plea.</P>
    <P>The vast mass of our people would prefer to pay their taxes on items which are at least avoidable, if they do not want to pay the taxes, rather than be obliged to pay them by way of income tax.  All day yesterday was spent arguing against imposing income tax on a business with a turnover of £750 milion. Some Deputies opposite lost their reason as they laid their anger before the House and before the people, primarily for the benefit of the provincial Press because £3 million was going to be collected by way of tax from a business that could carry it without harm.  That is, perhaps an indication of the resistance which people have to income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be an indication of something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It could be an indication of political opportunism or worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Or something else.  It might be an indication of concern for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not ask me to describe what it could be or I might embarrass some people opposite.  Is it <Col N="1706" /> better that tax be collected on alcohol consumption or in income tax?  I make no apology for saying that our preference in Government is to collect it from alcoholic drinks rather than impose it on income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already imposed it on income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spelt out exactly what it costs to run the country. The people know that taxes must be paid to meet these costs.  The Government's other alternative was to slash Government expenditure and to increase unemployment still further.  I notice that many of the critics today are silent about the fact that they endorsed Government expenditure in 1973, 1974 and 1975.  They endorsed the decision of the Government to provide money to replace expenditures which the private sector would have engaged in if the recession had not come upon us.  They said we were right to keep the economy ticking over by increasing the size of the deficit during the recession.  They are silent today about that and they also failed to point out that every time we produced budgets increasing the size of public expenditure I recited on every occasion the need to reduce the deficit and to reduce Government expenditure when the country would be pulling out of the recession.  That is understandable; nobody likes to be reminded of the fact that they agreed on previous occasions with a Minister they are now attacking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that we were right to tax beer and spirits.  The amount of tax which we imposed was the correct <Col N="1707" /> amount.  We regret that other interests decided at the same time to increase their prices and it was unfortunate from their own point of view that some of them decided to add on their increases, some of which were unauthorised, two days before the commencement of Lent.  That undoubtedly had an impact on sales. That was a consequence not of taxation but of ill-timed increases and increases of which almost 50 per cent were unauthorised by the National Prices Commission or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The increase in prices by brewers was approved by the National Prices Commission.  In one case a brewery decided not to impose the increase until June.  The consequence on the sales of competing breweries are common knowledge.</P>

      <P>The Minister is getting a bit touchy about criticism. Surely the Minister should come into the House expecting criticism from the Opposition.  That is why the Opposition is here.  We have no intention of suddenly becoming dumb. Is the Minister trying to get us to say that tax on drinks should be reduced and income tax increased?  We have not that view at all.  Income tax is already too high.  From the point of view of the economy we believe it to be at a disincentive level.  For the <Col N="1708" /> first time a glass of whiskey is cheaper than a pint.

      <P>Everything that can be taxed at the moment is taxed, it does not matter whether it is beer or income.  The Minister can go no further.  Nobody here would suggest that tax should be taken off spirits and put on to income tax.  Is there a danger that the Minister may not get all he expects in this way because of a decrease in consumption?  This raises, too, the important question of employment.  One must have regard to possible redundancies in the trade as a result of this situation.  The Minister has asked us to state where we think there are alternative sources of revenue but before the last general election we were asking them where they planned to get the money for the policies they were putting before the people.  We told them then that we would spend everything we got from the EEC and, consequently, save on social welfare but we pointed out that in the context of our membership of the Community, there would have to be price increases.  The then Opposition told us that it would be possible to control prices.  Apart from the price increases that resulted from the oil crisis, the price of every commodity has soared with the result that the situation is now totally out of control. All along the line we have pointed out that spending must be related to the amount of money available. <Col N="1709" /> The man who must pay the extra money for his drink is not interested in knowing whether it is the Exchequer that is reaping the benefit. The point is that he is the one who is paying.</P>

      <P>I share the same desire as Deputy Callanan for more effective control of prices but there are problems in this regard.  For instance, the ingredients of the two commodities under discussion, beer and whiskey, are grown in Ireland to a large extent.  I am glad that growers have been receiving better prices for their barley in recent years and, of course, the workers in the plants concerned have qualified for increases in wages and salaries.  Increases in productivity have reduced costs to some extent but a certain amount of the cost increases were unavoidable.  However, we should not spend too much time on that aspect since this is a Finance Bill and there remains a good deal to be discussed between now and 5 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I never cease to be amazed at the capacity of the Minister for Finance for self-deception.  I confess, though, that in his early days as Minister I thought his attitude was an attempt at deceiving other people and the public in general but since then I have reached the conclusion that he suffers from self-deception.  We have had different examples of this condition during the course of this debate and no later than a few moments ago when he talked about the fact that the Government have let the public know the extent of the cuts that had to be made in the Estimates.  I wonder whether the Minister has thought about what he said.  Does he not know that ever year, regardless of which Government are in power, there are Estimates from every Department which are much greater than what can be accepted, that there are cuts made in those Estimates and whether these cuts are 100 per cent, 50 per cent or 5 per cent is irrelevant so far as the public are concerned. A cut may be based on the fact that a Department with an ambitious and hopeful Secretary or Minister were trying to get away with something. That is of no relevance to the public. What counts is the final figure agreed by the Government to be allocated to each Department and the manner in which the amount is to be financed. The rest is an internal matter with no relevance to the action or inaction of the Government in managing the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister even at this late stage to stop talking about that irrelevant matter.  The Government ought not to be telling the people about their internal arguments.  Such arguments are not confined to this Government.  They apply to every Government in this area of reducing the estimate for each Department. As Deputy Callanan has pointed out, the responsibility of the Minister is to relate expenditure to the money available but it is a confession of failure on his part to tell us that the Government made these various cuts and then found that, committed to a certain figure, they were faced with the question of where to find the money.  It is the duty of the Government <Col N="1711" /> to decide how much money and for what purposes it is to be spent.  It is their duty also to decide how the money is to be raised.  It is not part of their duty, privilege or responsibility to decide on a certain figure and then to tell the Opposition and those critics in other areas of whom the Minister is becoming conscious that they should tell the Government where the money is to come from or, else, stop talking about it.  Most of the criticism directed against the Minister and his colleagues is the fact that they have allowed expenditure to reach the present level.  That is inherent in criticism of the taxes imposed, such as this one.</P>
    <P>Many people other than those who have a very special vested interest would agree that where additional taxation has been imposed it is preferable that it be imposed on an item such as spirits rather than income tax, and we would not quarrel with the Minister on that.  But he conveniently overlooked the fact that he has already imposed a surcharge on income tax.  If he thought he could have got more money out of income tax he would have increased it too, so he need not claim any credit for not having increased income tax again this year.</P>
    <P>The increase in the price of a glass of spirits, which the Minister has told us has almost doubled since he came to office, is again indicative of the total and abject failure of the Government even to attempt to operate the kind of price control they promised.  Various factors come into this, but the important thing is that the Government promised the public in the general election of 1973 that they would stabilise prices and introduce price controls, but here we have a situation in which since that election the price of a glass of spirits has almost doubled.  The facts speak for themselves, and when the public to whom the promises were addressed get the opportunity in a general election to express their opinion of the Government's performance in this respect they will express it in no uncertain terms.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley will recall that one of his predecessors, Deputy Haughey, said that these items, when taxed, always come up smiling.  It is very interesting to see that notwithstanding increases in prices, consumption has arisen very substantially in the intervening period. The number of proof gallons of spirits has risen from 1.969 million gallons in 1972 to 2.457 million gallons in 1975.

      <P>This section is to raise the excise duty on tobacco by the equivalent of 2.81p per packet of 20 standard size plain cigarettes.  This increase attracted an additional payment of 0.19p in value-added tax at the time of the January budget which makes a total increase of 3p.  In the case of pipe tobacco the increase in the excise duty is in the range of 3.2p to 3.7p per oz, depending, of course, on the type of tobacco.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will be aware that this is one of the few areas if not the only area in which people were expecting the Minister to impose higher increases <Col N="1713" /> than he did.  I received some information&mdash;it is quite unofficial and it may be true or untrue&mdash;suggesting that the manufacturers were geared for and expected a considerably larger increase than that imposed in the budget.  Indeed, they had calculated that a considerably larger increase would not produce a reduction in consumption. Would the Minister care to comment on that?  I am sure he has heard it in different quarters: it certainly was commonly said that of all the increases imposed in the budget this was the most surprising not only because of the amount of revenue that might have been collected and was not, but also because the public and the health policies would indicate that even if an increase in duty would have brought about a reduction in consumption, this could well have been regarded as a desirable development. For these reasons it seems difficult to understand why, as compared with the other items on which increases were imposed, the increase here was relatively small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tobacco is more sensitive to price increases than the other commodities&mdash;past experience has shown that.  For instance, in 1970 there was a decline in consumption of 3.6 per cent compared with the previous year and in 1971 there was a further decrease of 1.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are two factors which have to be borne in mind which are of concern to the Minister for Finance when he is preparing the budget.  One is the question of ensuring additional revenue arising out of the increases, and sometimes you can by a smaller increase in tax get a larger amount of revenue and also you can, by putting on a larger increase, depress consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that the decrease he referred to in 1970 and 1971 could have been due to factors other than duty, in particular to the medical propaganda in regard to tobacco at that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I do not know all the factors which could have led to the reduction.  There was no increase in duty in 1971.  I am not in <Col N="1714" /> a position at the moment to answer specifically what the Deputy asked. However, past experience has shown that tobacco is sensitive to tax increases. The consumption of tobacco is still increasing overall, notwithstanding increases in prices.  In 1972 the amount consumed was 12.876 million lbs and in 1975 it was 14.013 million lbs.</P>

These increases attracted an additional payment of value-added tax and raised the total tax content of a bottle of wine, following the January budget increase, by amounts varying between 10p and 20p per bottle.

      <P>The effect of this section is to increase the excise duty on petrol by 9.36p per gallon.  This increase also attracted an additional payment of 0.64p in value-added tax at the time of the January budget, making the then total tax increase 10p.  It also has the effect of charging an excise duty of 2p per gallon on certain hydrocarbon oils&mdash;on oils other than diesel oils used in road motor vehicles and petrol&mdash;which, by reason of various exemptions, reliefs or rebates, have hitherto not borne excise duty.  The rate of excise duty on diesel oil used in road motor vehicles is not affected by the present section.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to raise on this section is the Minister's <Col N="1716" /> estimate of what will be the revenue from it.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister's estimate of revenue from the additional duty and the value-added tax was £17.5 million for the year 1976.  I have been furnished with figures which suggest that that is an underestimate by approximately £4 million.  I do not know if any such submission has been made to the Minister but I should be interested to know whether he accepts that his estimate of £17.5 million was an underestimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we believe the figure is a realistic one and there is no reason to believe that it should be any more.  That figure of £17.5 million is made up of the increases in the excise duty in the January budget and the VAT income increase related to the January increase.  The increase in VAT on 1st March from 6.75 per cent to 10 per cent would bring in additional revenue which is believed to be about £4 million.  No doubt these are the figures which the Deputy may have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A fall is not anticipated. Indications are that there is a slight increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might tell the Minister, if he has not got it already, how the calculation is arrived at which suggests that his estimate is £4 million too little.  It is based on the sale of petrol in 1975. Assuming the same sale of petrol in 1976, and no increase, it is 238 million gallons at £.0936 per gallon for 11 months from February to December. That works out, I think, at a yield of £20.4 million.  The additional VAT at £.0164 for eight months, on <Col N="1717" /> the basis that the VAT on November/ December sales would not be received until January, is 238 million gallons multiplied by eight, multiplied by the VAT rate, and that seems to give £1 million.  That is a total of £21.4 million whereas the Minister's estimate was £17.5 million.  That is why it would appear that his estimate in this regard is an underestimate of £4 million.  If that is so, one would like to know how it occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My first point of difference is with the figure the Deputy has for 1975.  It may be right but the figure which I have before me is 235.37 million gallons, whereas I think he gave a figure of 238 million gallons.  I think also, in Deputy Colley's calculations, he may have anticipated that a change in duty would have no impact on sales in 1976.  Experience has shown that an increase in duty will have an impact on sales.  It may simply stop growth or could cause a decline.  The growth one may have&mdash;and which seems to be emerging this year&mdash;may possibly be less than it would have been had the additional duty not gone on. These are all very difficult orders of magnitude to assess but the Revenue Commissioners have been fairly good at making assessments in the past about the impact of duty and I do not think they will be significantly out of line with the estimates they have made already for this year.  If there is more buoyancy than anticipated, then certainly more revenue will be produced. As the Deputy knows, the size of the deficit is so large that such would be a very welcome bonus indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if his calculations were based on the assumption of an increase or a decrease in consumption or its remaining the same.  The calculations I gave him were based on its remaining the same but I am not quite sure what he said his calculations were based on. He indicated that consumption is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was answering the Deputy's question and I think I did but maybe I better <Col N="1718" /> approach it in a different way.  Consumption is unlikely to have remained at 235 million gallons if the duty had remained the same.  There would probably have been a growth of up to 250 million gallons.  The impact of the duty would probably have the consequences of bringing the consumption down to something like the 240 million gallon mark rather than the 250 million gallons. It is the difference between those figures which might have lead Deputy Colley to anticipate that there would have been a greater revenue than, in fact, there may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not anticipate in these calculations an increase in consumption. The calculations were based on the same consumption as last year. The Minister has given a figure of 240 million gallons which is a little over the figure for last year.  How does he arrive at £17½ million on 240 million gallons?</P>

      <P>If at the old rate we had this additional consumption, then my revenue would have risen as well but it would have risen to a higher figure.

      <P>What was the price of a gallon of petrol in March 1973?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 36p but there was an oil crisis in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was but the Minister will notice that a gallon of petrol in March 1973 cost 36p, including all costs, such as duty.  The increase in the price of a gallon of petrol attributable solely to duty and tax under his regime has been 28.8p, almost 29p.  I have not done the percentage calculation but, clearly, 90 per cent or thereabouts in the price of a gallon of petrol has been attributable directly to duty and tax.  As far as the consumer is concerned, he is principally troubled by the fact that the price of a gallon of petrol has increased from 36p to 88p during the term of office of this Government.</P>
      <P>I know we have had an oil crisis but it seems pretty clear from these figures that the Minister for Finance has got a great deal more out of that oil crisis than the Arabs have.  It is also pretty clear that on the calculations the Minister has given us that of all the items he has gone after nothing has been so savagely hit as the price of a gallon of petrol.  When he came into office the price of a gallon of petrol was 36p.  The increase since then is 52p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister on occasions tried to justify some of the savage increases he has imposed in this area by saying that he was trying to produce a reduction in the consumption of petrol and thereby assist our balance of payments. However, he has just told us that consumption is increasing.  I suggest he calculated that it would increase and if there was a fall in the consumption of petrol the Minister for Finance would be extremely concerned and that what he has been doing is raising revenue on petrol at <Col N="1720" /> a savage rate.  He has done this possibly in the belief, although it is difficult to understand how anybody in this country in 1976 could believe it, that petrol is a luxury item.</P>
    <P>Anybody who examines the position will find it is clearly established that the great bulk of cars are used for essential purposes or at the very least purposes connected with employment. This is true even in an area like Dublin city but it is much more obvious in many areas of the country. There are substantial areas in the country where there is virtually no public transport.  In those areas the car or the motor cycle is essential. Every increase in the price of a gallon of petrol is a direct increase in the cost of an essential item of living.</P>
    <P>In many cases there are people who could not get to work, hold a job or earn any money if they did not have the use of a car or motor cycle.  For such people an increase of this magnitude in the price of a gallon of petrol is intolerable.  I do not think the Minister has grasped just how intolerable it has become.  Of course when it is combined with other increases we will be dealing with under other sections it has really got out of hand.  This is having a most serious effect on various aspects of our economy and is contributing to the demands for more and more income to try to keep pace with the cost of living.  We are involved in a vicious circle to which the Minister is deliberately adding in almost every budget he brings in.  Indeed he and his colleagues have been doing it outside of formal budgets too.  Then they wonder why people are so uncooperative, why they will not agree to a pay freeze.  With this kind of thing going on, that is quite unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The effect of this kind of increase on tourism is obvious.  Most of all the Minister ought to face up to what he has done and what he is proposing to continue in this section to those whose employment depend on the use of petrol.  There is no justification whatever for running away from this issue, which must be faced and cannot be swept under the carpet.  I should like to hear the Minister's attitude explained in imposing this kind of increase <Col N="1721" /> on persons for whom the car or motor cycle is essential if they are to maintain their employment.  How does he think those people will operate?  He talks at considerable length about equity, particularly in the taxation system.  How much equity is there in a taxation system which allows an increase of 52p a gallon on a basic price of 36p to people who are dependent on a gallon of petrol?  What about the treatment of people who are so dependent as against those who are not dependent?  Would the Minister care to tell us the equity he sees in that?  What steps, if any, has he taken to try to rectify the gross inequity brought about as a result of the increases he has imposed on the price of a gallon of petrol?  I am not talking about the increases imposed by the producers or anybody else; I am talking specifically about the increases imposed by the Minister himself.  How does he propose to remedy this inequity?</P>

They always say: &ldquo;Collect it from somebody else.  Let me off.&rdquo;  That is the usual notion of tax reform.  We had a perfect example of the Fianna Fáil approach to tax reform yesterday: &ldquo;Do not impose tax on those who were exempt before and let the greater load be carried by those who are already within the net.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual result of increases in the price of petrol arising from the quadrupling of the increase charged by the oil producers, <Col N="1722" /> other increases imposed by the distributors and increases in tax have to a large extent stopped the growth in oil consumption, and that means in imports.  Therefore it has helped to stabilise the balance of payments problem which could have been exceedingly serious if we had not done as every country other than the oil producers had done and that is, increased the tax on petrol significantly. Even with our taxes petrol prices here are still lower than they are in certain European countries.</P>
      <P>We were increasing our consumption in petrol at an annual rate of about 8 per cent before 1973.  In 1973, our consumption was 233.72 million gallons, in 1974 it was 236.14 million gallons and in 1975 it was 235.37 million gallons.  Those figures clearly indicate that the impact of the increased prices has been beneficial in that it has cooled the growth in consumption of petrol and made a very significant contribution towards correcting our balance of payments problem.  Last year we would have been in a very attractive position in relation to our balance of payments had it not been for this quadrupling in the price of oil.  Even as it was we ended up with a balance of payments deficit of an historically small size of £15 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the wrong reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as against £288 million in the previous year. That figure would not have been as low if we had allowed our petrol consumption to increase at the rate at which it had been increasing.  We were therefore fully justified from the point of view of overall management of the economy and correction of our balance of payments problems in increasing the price of petrol by way of tax increases.  Last year, 1975, was but one year, but this year the economy is picking up.  There is a considerable growth in imports. Our balance of payments problem would become exceedingly serious within a few years if we did not take continuing steps to ensure that we do not have a return to the rates of <Col N="1723" /> growth in consumption of oil which were the pattern for the ten or 15 years leading up to 1973.</P>
      <P>Like all other indirect taxes the tax on petrol is imposed because it is a form of expenditure which people regularly engage in.  The increased duties at all times, not merely the last three years but long before that, indicated that notwithstanding the increased taxes, people were still disposed to engage in these expenditures. As the purpose of tax is to ensure revenue, which must be collected to pay for services which people want, then the sensible thing to do is to impose taxes which people are willing to pay even though they may grumble about it. The most stupid thing of all would be to impose taxes on orchids or something like that which people do not buy.  That would be a useless form of tax.  If a tax is to have any sense it must be on items people use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is supposed to be concerned about conditions in this country.  He has frequently had it put to him&mdash;I have put it just now&mdash;that what he has done is to impose gross inequity in the treatment of citizens of this country. I specifically asked him what he had to say to or about those citizens who are dependent on petrol to get to their employment.  There are many such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his reply the Minister referred to yesterday's discussion and his version of equity.  I invited him to tell us if he thought it equitable to impose increases of this level on the <Col N="1724" /> gallon of petrol in relation to those who are totally dependent on petrol to get to their employment and I am not extending it beyond that.  The Minister studiously avoided giving me an answer and I repeat my question now.  If the Minister thinks it is not equitable, what does he propose to do to relieve the burden on those people? Does he recognise that if he fails to do anything about it he should stop talking about equity in taxation?  In this case taxation is being imposed in a manner that clearly is inequitable. Will the Minister tell us how he proposes to achieve equity under this form of taxation?  If he does not do so he should stop prating about equity which, I suspect, he does not believe in except when it suits him for the purpose of getting in revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I can say and it is this.  The Government will not be a party to introducing rationing on petrol which apparently is the way Deputy Colley believes we would get paper equity.  No country in the world has introduced rationing in peace time to deal with problems regarding petrol.  It is very interesting to hear this is one of the great plans of Fianna Fáil.  Probably it is because they are so preoccupied with their last 50 years that they have produced such a restrictive approach to the problems of our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the red herring the Minister is following.  I have asked him twice and I will ask him a third time and if he fails to answer the question this time everyone can get the message loud and clear.  What does the Minister propose to do, if anything, to attempt to achieve equity in the imposition of this taxation on petrol in relation to those for whom the use of petrol is essential in their employment or to have any employment? That is a straightforward question.  It is a crucial question for <Col N="1725" /> many people who will be interested to hear the Minister's answer, if he has any answer to give.  I am giving him a third opportunity to express his view on that equity of which he has been so loud in praise in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can keep asking all the questions he wants to ask but he avoids those I put to him.  Does he endorse rationing?  It appears that is the course he considers to be the appropriate way to achieve the paper equity which he considers desirable so that he can prove on paper that he is treating all people equally.  The Deputy knows well that there are a multitude of factors governing where people live and work and the way in which they travel.  There are various ways in which people can add to or minimise their costs or make their own choices. By leaving the free market to operate, which we and the whole world consider the right way to handle the question, people are free to make their own decisions.  There are a multitude of other factors from mental and physical handicaps, from accidents of birth, location and movement of employment, none of which the State tries to control.  If one wants a centralised system with the Government governing everything from birth to death one can achieve the kind of theoretical equity that Deputy Colley has produced.  It is a wonderful debating point but this is not a chamber to debate issues for the entertainment of the audience.  This Chamber is supposed to make laws for the better running of the country, laws that not only help the people but leave them the maximum amount of choice which any free society should leave to them.</P>

      <P>Apparently the Minister thinks there is only one possible way to discourage the use of petrol, namely, to keep on increasing the price.  Of course the Minister is pitching it to a level that will not reduce consumption but will allow consumption.  If he really means that this was the only way to do it and if he meant to reduce it, he should have increased the tax much more.  However he had no notion of doing that.  I said there were other ways to deal with this matter besides rationing. I told the Minister before, although he does not remember, of a rational approach to this whole problem.  It is only one; there are others if a person devoted his attention to the matter. Would it ever occur to the Minister to say &ldquo;Let us give real incentives to the use of small cars that will use less petrol&rdquo;?  Is it beyond the Minister's capacity to devise such a way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are others but I am not going to continue telling the Minister how to do his job.  When the Minister was finally forced into it, all the waffle we heard from him amounted to this: if people choose to live in parts of the country in which there is no public transport provided by the State, that is their hard luck; the Minister will continue to impose more penalties on them particularly with regard to increased taxes on petrol.  This petrol is essential for them to get to their place of employment but if they do not like what the Minister proposes they have a choice.  They can move out of the area. This is the Minister's answer to this question.  For God's sake, let him stop telling us about equity if that is his approach.</P>

      <P>In the course of his remarks Deputy Colley spoke about a multitude of factors and choices.  We told the Minister two years ago when he imposed an increase in the price of petrol that the person who must travel to work a distance of up to ten miles has no choice if there is no public transport serving his area.  To work he must use a car or get up at 5 a.m. and walk.  There is not much point in talking about choices in such cases. During the three years of office of the National Coalition the price of petrol has increased by more than 140 per cent.  The tax has increased by almost 29p on a petrol price in 1973 of 36p. The tax nearly equals what the price of a gallon was in that year.  The recent increase of 10p, on top of the previous increases, means that history is being made again but this time it is being made by the Government and not by the licensed vintners.  I should like to add that the price of a small one is now cheaper than the price of a pint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are making history due to the fact that the price of petrol is dearer here than it is in the North or Great Britain.  That is the first time that has happened in my memory.  The level of increase here is socially damaging since cars are largely an essential in many areas.  The level of increase has involved a significant increase in the real cost of living, upwards <Col N="1728" /> of £20 million in the more recent increase based on the calculations discussed a short time ago by the Minister and Deputy Colley.  This is the policy of the Government, and the Minister for Finance, a policy that is significantly affecting the cost of living and, thereby, all factors.  This is affecting a multitude of factors in life here.  It is worth emphasising that the price of petrol is almost level with that on the Continent and that is no encouragement to tourists who contribute such a big amount to our economy.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Deputy Colley put our case explicitly.  I cannot follow the Minister's reasoning in increasing the price of petrol in an effort to reduce consumption, because that can be taken too far.  It is important that we look at the full implications if we proceed along the lines of deliberately trying to reduce consumption.  We are now in a completely retracted and reduced economy.  The Minister told us of 8 per cent increases before 1973-74 and pointed out that the recent increase in price had produced results.  We would want to be very careful about this.  While it is a good thing to reduce consumption of petrol we want to ensure that a reduction in consumption does not also mean a reduction in the expansion of the economy.  Undoubtedly this will happen if we proceed along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> I am conscious of the fact that it will create a balance of payments problem, but if we continue to tax only for the purpose of reducing consumption there is no hope of expanding the economy as we would like to. If we want our economy to expand at the rate of 3 per cent to 4 per cent a year we will have to take into consideration that an additional consumption of petrol is required.  That cannot be avoided if we are to expand. It is everybody's wish that we expand the tourist industry but it has declined over the past five or six years.  That was not solely due to the price of petrol; it was due to other factors, including the problems in Northern Ireland. However, some of the reduction in consumption which the Minister spoke of was achieved by a decrease in the number of tourists from the Continent, America, England and Great Britain.  It is bad policy to continue to increase prices with the intention of reducing consumption.  If that is to be our policy with regard to tourism there is little hope for our hoteliers and those engaged in that industry.</P>
    <P>I would tackle the problem in a different way.  I would not be too concerned about the consumption of petrol if I could expand the economy and make up the difference with increased exports.  The Minister is following a line of retraction and our economy is not expanding.  If this is pursued to its logical conclusion the tourist industry will not expand.  The increases will also affect manufacturing industry.  The Minister will achieve his objective of reducing consumption, but at what expense?  He will achieve it at the expense of more people being out of work.  I would live with increased consumption if I was sure that the tourist industry was expanding.  By doing that I would be in a position to offset the imbalance created by the increased consumption of petrol.  We should not compare our economy with advanced European countries because those countries do not depend to the same degree on tourism.  We are completely underdeveloped in comparison with those countries and we must create a different type of economic climate.  While <Col N="1730" /> the guidelines laid down by some of the European countries are correct for them, I doubt if we can go with them because their economies are expanding at a rate of 3-4 per cent at present.</P>
    <P>They started ahead of us.  We have only begun to expand tourism and industry here in the past ten or 15 years whereas they have been doing so for a century.  They may suggest guidelines for us but we must have continuing expansion in industry and tourism.  The Minister put forward two reasons for his proposals: one, to reduce consumption and, two, to raise revenue.  Revenue must be obtained&mdash;although I object to the particular increase the Minister has imposed&mdash;but we must seriously consider whether it is advisable to continue a policy of taxing to reduce consumption.  This can only lead to further unemployment and it will affect not only tourism but also manufacturing costs.  I know that other types of oil are used in heavy manufacturing but petrol figures to a large extent in the average large business that must use cars to take stock or travellers around the country.  This will affect the unit costs of these companies.</P>
    <P>We can see how the British have arranged their fiscal policies in their recent budget and the response from the trade unions generally.  It is obvious that by next autumn we shall be at a tremendous disadvantage.  The House should not be deceived by present export figures here.  Some time ago the Minister pointed out that our balance of payments deficit was down to about £15 million, but it was down because imports of plant and machinery which should be taking place in the past three years were not taking place.  I believe our exports have done reasonably well but this will be short lived because expansion is not taking place in the manufacturing sector and plant and machinery are not being imported to expand the economy.  That is why the deficit has been reduced.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the petrol increase will affect our unit costs. Leading industrialists have stated that <Col N="1731" /> they are deeply concerned about their competitiveness in regard to the UK and other EEC countries.  They have said that we will be from 8 per cent to 10 per cent on the wrong side in regard to unit costs by the end of the year.  If the agreement now emerging in Britian is concluded and affects the mainstream of production, next autumn or early next year their unit costs will be reduced by 5 per cent or 6 per cent compared with Ireland.  Anybody can see that is happening and the Minister could have made some concession in regard to tourism and industry, as both these vital sectors will be affected by the astronomic rise in petrol.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he did not expect any reduction in consumption as a result of this increase during 1976. I do not know how he reaches that conclusion, because he also said that the tax policy over the past three years did produce some reduction in consumption.  That seems contradictory. Even if there was only a small decline in consumption in the past three years, the taxation will be far more effective in 1976 for obvious reasons.  In 1974-75 we can see the purchasing power that went into the economy and we can compare that with what we hope will be the increased purchasing power going into the economy in 1976.  Wages in the private sector in 1974 increased by about 30 per cent and that figure was equalled, if not exceeded, in the public sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister said there would be no reduction but did not <Col N="1732" /> give a reason.  We must see the purchasing power of the community to decide whether his statement is true or false.  My argument is that in 1974 there was a 30 per cent increase in salaries going into the economy and, if we accept the Minister's statement, there was a small decline in the consumption of petrol.  In 1975 the increase in the private sector was between 25 per cent and 30 per cent and in the public sector it was in the region of 40 per cent.  This was the increased purchasing power put into the economy.  Yet the Minister states the tax served its purpose because there was a reduction in petrol consumption.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that if those figures of increases in salaries were repeated the country would be in a sad state.  If the salary increases envisaged will go into the private sector there will be a reduction of money in the private sector in the region of 10 per cent.  If we accept the Minister's pleading as regards public service pay and take this into consideration we know there will be less money put into the economy this year than in the past two years. Therefore there will be a reduction of purchasing power in both public and private sectors and that will affect petrol as well as every other commodity. If anybody says that you can increase prices by 25 per cent or 30 per cent with no additional money going into the economy to purchase that commodity and that there will be no drop in sales, I cannot understand his reasoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that there will not be a drop in the consumption of petrol but I maintain there will.  Common sense tells me that if you have not the money you cannot buy it.  Ask any housewife about the economics of housekeeping and she will tell you that a drop in her housekeeping allowance means a reduction in purchases, and that is going to happen this year as regards petrol.  It would not concern me if the householder with two cars had to reduce his consumption of petrol, or if the person who can use public transport had to do so.  That would not be a loss to the economy.  I am concerned with <Col N="1733" /> the deliberate attempt to make the price of petrol prohibitive for the section of the community that could help to expand the economy and create jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to this is a negative one.  The gain will close the balance of payments but the Exchequer will have to pay more unemployment benefit.  We have got over balance of payments difficulties in the past by expanding the economy.  It is all right to put import duty on a non-essential product, but fuel must be used to expand our economy.  I cannot agree with the policy to reduce the consumption of petrol by a section of the community that could help to expand the economy and create employment.  A lot of money has been invested in tourism.  Indeed tourism is one industry we should concentrate on if we are to create more jobs. Tourism is the one industry which <Col N="1734" /> does not use imported raw material. The food and drink provided by the tourist industry is produced here.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to this matter is a negative one.  It is quite obvious that the increase of 28p over the past three years will achieve the desired effect.  The consumer can only go to a certain limit.  We must also consider the effect this measure will have on the car assembly industry, an industry which has a high labour content. This industry is contracting at present.  You cannot expect expansion in an industry which is hit by road tax and petrol tax.  Car assemblers have already changed their projections for this year by 20 per cent.  The Minister's approach will add to inflation and increase the manufacturer's unit cost which, in turn, will make it difficult for him to export.</P>

      <P>This section imposes excise duty at the rate of 2p per gallon on gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form.  In effect, these are predominantly butane and propane gases. The section is also necessary for technical and legal reasons for the imposition of the 10p per gallon on gaseous hydrocarbons used for combustion in the engine of a motor vehicle.  This duty does not come into effect until the commencement of section 41.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This 2p is really the counterpart of the 2p on hydrocarbon oil.  The 2p here is on gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form and such will be charged at a rate of 10p per gallon.  A rebate will then be given in respect of gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form which are not used in motor vehicles.  The rebate will be 8p per gallon.</P>

Section 41 is the one which actually deals with motor vehicles but, for administrative and technical reasons, we are in section 40 putting 10p on all gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form, then giving a rebate of 8p if they are not used in vehicles, and then section 41 is the one that will deal effectively with the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the section is to introduce a duty rate of 10p a gallon imposed by section 40 on gaseous hydrocarbon in liquid form intended to be used for combustion in the engine of a motor vehicle.  It also applies to the legal and administrative framework necessary to implement the duty and it will come into operation on a date to be appointed by order.  It will be recalled that I referred to this matter in my budget statement when I said I had become concerned about the extent to which motorists had begun to convert their cars to run on liquified peroleum gas in order to evade payment of petrol duty.  I could not countenance a loss to the Exchequer which a widespread application of this practice would produce and I therefore proposed to introduce a provision in the Finance Bill to render gas used in motor vehicles liable to duty.  The statement followed developments over a period of time when the growth in the use of liquid petroleum gas as a motor fuel was kept under observation.  The use of LPG as a motor fuel has now become a potentially significant threat to the fiscal revenue from hydrocarbon oils.  As I mentioned previously something over 3,000 vehicles are now converted to run on LPG. If these vehicles, many of which have a high annual mileage, were using petrol as a fuel the benefit to the Exchequer could approach £1 million per annum.  If they were diesel engines the Exchequer could receive some £350,000 in duty annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the budget announcement that the proposed duty would be at a rate which, when differing efficiencies were taken into account, was comparable to that charged on petrol, various trade representations have put forward the case that the rate should <Col N="1739" /> be related to the diesel duty rate.  The representations have been based on the considerations that the usage of LPG in motor vehicles is basically commercial and that in the absence of LPG the alternative fuel would be diesel.  However it is not accepted that all use of LPG as an automotive fuel is diesel substitution.  There is a considerable level of LPG usage as a commercial motor fuel.  For this reason therefore the duty level has been set at 10p per gallon, a rate which, when differing efficiencies are taken into account, is comparable to that charged on automotive diesel fuel.</P>
    <P>Various methods of collecting duty on automotive LPG have been considered by the Revenue Commissioners. The system considered most effective is a rebate system based on the system currently in use for hydrocarbon oil of other sorts when it is used as an automotive diesel.  Under a rebate system all liquid petroleum gas would be charged, at least notionally, at the automotive rate of 10p per gallon.  This charge would be rebated down to 2p per gallon for gas which has been shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be intended for use otherwise than as automotive fuel.  With the operation of duty-free warehousing facilities, which allows for revenue control from the point of production or importation to the point of sale by the LPG companies, no actual payment of duty at the automotive rate need arise until the LPG companies involved actually deliver the gas to an automotive retail outlet or some other authorised automotive storage tank.  At current level of usage the annual yield of the duty of 10p per gallon on automotive LPG is estimated to be of the order of £350,000, which the House will recollect would be the equivalent to what the revenue would be if the fuel used in these vehicles were diesel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the effects would be very slight, because the actual outlet of LPG from the refinery is very small.  It would virtually all have to be imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably if the market were changing in that way the local refinery would change its production schedule also?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if our own refinery were working at full capacity it could not produce sufficient for the market here if we had a significant changeover to LPG.  If energy matters change significantly for this country&mdash;I refer of course to the possibility of producing energy of our own from this or related sources&mdash;then obviously one would be taking a fresh look at the situation or considering whether there should be adjustments made in rates of duty to encourage the use of one form of energy rather than another. At the moment there would be no advantage in switching our consumption to LPG rather than petrol as far as the balance of payments is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would appear from the Minister's reply to be based on the present situation in Whitegate. Leaving aside the question of the production at Whitegate at the moment, can the Minister say whether the use of liquid petroleum gas would be on a comparable measurement of&mdash;I am not sure what the unit would be&mdash; with petrol or whether it would be felt in a smaller import value of crude, unrefined oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not purporting to be talking <i>ex cathedra</i> in a field which is not my speciality, but I understand that, first of all, there is a limit to the capacity of our refinery. If it is refining from crude oil, the cost of crude is less than the cost of importing the refined gas.  Of course if one is producing LPG from crude one is producing other products as well which we would be obviously using, although of course we could re-export them, but they would be used because of the fact that we have a need to use their other oil products as well.  The alternative now would be to import <Col N="1741" /> the liquid gas itself from overseas refineries such as Milford Haven.  The cost of that would be much higher because it is refined and it would therefore be higher than the cost of the crude which we ourselves refine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clear enough: that the cost of the importation of the actual refined gas would be greater than the cost of the crude. But I presume the Minister understands what I am really coming at. The Minister, if he wants to protect the balance of payments situation, presumably has examined the likely effects of, on the one hand, discouraging the use of petrol and, on the other, encouraging the use of liquid petroleum gas.  He said that one of his objectives was to increase the tax on petrol so substantially so as to protect our balance of payments position.  Is it not reasonable to assume that he has examined the possibility of protecting that balance of payments which was still found to be encouraging the use of liquid petroleum gas?  This is what I am trying to ascertain.  Has he considered it and, if so, what is the result of his consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an irrelevant matter at present.  It is not a very significant item in total energy consumption here but, as I have emphasised, we are limited in our own capacity to produce LPG here.  At present it is related to the capacity of Whitegate and the capability of Whitegate to sell the other products which arise along with the production of LPG.  We would probably be paying a lot more for imports of LPG than for petrol if everybody was to switch from petrol to LPG.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am talking about the capacity of the country and the consumption of the country now, but this is something which obviously will be looked at from time to time. If the Department of Industry and Commerce have any problems in this field which could be helped by an adjustment of the fiscal aspect of <Col N="1742" /> energy I am sure that any Minister for Finance would sympathetically look at that aspect.</P>

      <P>I am moving an amendment to delete section 42.  The validity of the provisions of the section have been questioned having regard to the Money Bill requirement of Article 22 sub-article 1 of the Constitution in so far as the provisions of the section would apply to matters not related to taxation. The Money Bill character of the Finance Bill would consequently be questioned.  It is accepted that some of the prominent uses of export entry are not directly related to taxation or other aspects of Article 22, sub-article 1.  For example, export entry is used to regulate export prohibitions and compilation of export statistics. The export entry is used in a taxation context for the purpose of establishing entitlement to repayment and remission of duty where such is dependent on proof of export.  In view of the doubt which has arisen it is considered that this section should be deleted, otherwise the status of the Finance Bill as a money Bill might be called into question.</P>

      <P>Apart from increasing the level of the penalty the section also contains a provision setting out the circumstances in which the offending vehicle may be seized.  Motor vehicles using marked oil are at present seized as forfeited under the authority of the Inland Revenue Regulation Act, 1890, but the Revenue Commissioners invoke this power only where the offence involved is not a first offence or where a vehicle contains a concealed tank or similar device.  I consider it desirable that a specific provision should be made for forfeiture in the instances mentioned.  The section consequently provides that the illegal use of marked hydrocarbon oil shall include forfeiture of a vehicle in respect of which the offence is a second offence or where there is a concealed tank or similar device because clearly on both occasions the offences are deliberate.</P>

      <P>The effect of section 45 is to make specific provision for customs entry of imported dutiable aircraft, ships and so on and for payment of the appropriate duties thereon. It also provides penalties for noncompliance with these requirements. The law relating to the customs declaration of dutiable goods on Import Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, section 55, requires the importer of goods liable to duty to enter them on a prescribed form.  Recently doubt has arisen about the application of the provision to import ships and aircraft. The purpose of this section is to make it clear that they must be declared on the standard form of customs entry.  A period of seven days is provided under this section for compliance of formalities.  The provision for forfeiture in the case of non-compliance is in line with the general provisions relating to failure to comply <Col N="1745" /> with entry provisions.  The amount of the penalty proposed for conviction on an offence is £500.  It is considered appropriate in view of the value of the goods concerned and the present day value of money.</P>

      <P>In pages 36 and 37, to delete subsection (2) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Subsection (5) of section 49 and the proviso to subsection (4) of section 50 of the Finance Act, 1969, <Col N="1746" /> are hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;6 years&rsquo; for &lsquo;two years&rsquo;, and the said subsection (5) and the said proviso, as so amended, are set out in the Table to this subsection.</P>
    <P>This amendment is purely technical. The section of the Bill is as initiated. We reproduced the whole of subsection (4) of section 50 of the Finance Act, 1969 as it would stand after the passing of the Bill.  Paragraph (a) of subsection (4) refers to a duty of 10 per cent on office blocks, and reproduction in the whole subsection of the 1976 Act might cause confusion since the rate of duty tax was raised to 15 per cent in the Dublin area in 1973.

      <P>The purpose of this section is two-fold.  First, it provides exemption from stamp duty for new houses which would have qualified for exemption by reason of their receiving grants under the local government arrangements in force up to December 31st, 1975, although those grants may no longer be payable.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the section limits the exemption from stamp duty contained in section 49, subsection (3) of the Finance Act, 1969, to the disposition of houses by local authorities under the Housing Act, 1966.  This is designed to withdraw the exemption from transfers of large undeveloped sites from local authorities to property developers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first part of this section, that is, that dealt with in the new subsection (2), what administrative procedure will be followed in order to determine whether a house is entitled to exemption from stamp duty having regard to the fact that presumably no application will be made for grants to the Department of Local Government since the grants are not available? In the interval since the Minister for Local Government announced the abolition of those grants how have these transactions been treated by the commissioners for the purposes of stamp duty?  Have they been exempted and, if so, under what authority?  But if they have not been exempted what is to happen in regard to those persons who have paid duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there has been payment of duty by mistake there would be a right to a refund.  The six-year limit would apply to such cases.  I understand that administratively what is proposed is the same procedure as operated in the past: the deed would be referred to the Department of Local Government from where a certificate would be issued to the effect that the house was one which qualified for exemption from stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the situation from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, but how <Col N="1748" /> are the Department of Local Government to be in a position to issue such certificates?  Will they have to receive applications from persons who before the abolition of the grant would have been entitled to such grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that statement on the basis of what my own experience was in the past, but it is some time since I have handled deeds. It used to be the practice that one referred a deed to the Department of Local Government and had impressed on it a stamp certifying that a house was one in respect of which a grant arose.  On the face of it that was the certificate which granted the exemption. In practice what will happen now is that application will be made to the Department of Local Government for a certificate of reasonable value or for a certificate to the effect that the house is one in respect of which a grant would have been issued.  I am not sure what particulars have to be furnished in that connection but presumably they will be similar to those which were furnished previously in order to obtain a certificate, the difference being that one does not get a grant but gets a certificate to say that the house is one in which a grant would have applied in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore am I right in assuming that the Department of Local Government will have to continue to operate the whole paraphernalia which has applied up to now, including inspectors going out to examine foundations and so on, but that the only difference will be the non-payment of a grant?  Will all this information be directed towards furnishing a certificate of reasonable value and a certificate indicating that exemption from stamp duty should apply?</P>

However I should have preferred that the legal position was regularised quickly&mdash;if necessary by the passage of a short measure through the House or perhaps there is some procedure that would have been available on certain orders.  I shall not query the matter and would merely remark that it is right to ensure that the people involved would at least have the benefit of exemption from stamp duty.</P>

      <P>Up to now, due mainly to an oversight, the Housing Act, 1966, could operate in such a way that transfers of large underdeveloped sites from local authorities to property developers escaped stamp duty.  The intention of that Act was to grant such exemption in respect of houses being disposed of by local authorities.  The purpose of the amendment now is to put such sales of underdeveloped sites to property developers on the same footing whether they are coming from private developers or from local authorities.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about transfers by local authorities to property developers, but I do not think there is any reference in the section to property developers.  Is it reasonable, therefore, to assume that this can apply to a wider spectrum than the Minister mentioned?  The <Col N="1750" /> purpose he mentioned may well be the reason for this change, but will it go further than that and apply to any transfer by any local authority of any property to any other party except the transfer or lease of a house under the provisions of the Housing Act, 1966?</P>

      <P>Local authorities are not known for disposing of property. Of course, there could be cases and if there are it is not inappropriate that the purchaser should pay duty. There is no doubt the 1966 Act was intended to grant exemption in respect of houses being sold by local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise hares on this but it strikes me that it is possible that a local authority might acquire property compulsorily with a view to development for housing and in times like the present, where the availability of funds is extremely limited, they might decide, and, indeed, in some cases should decide, in my opinion, to unscramble the CPO which would leave the property completely tied up for many years: in such a case the local authority might decide to retransfer the property they had acquired compulsorily. It would seem to me that the effect of this amendment would be to apply stamp duty in such a case.  Obviously, if it is applied it will end up as a charge on the local authority. This amendment of the law may be going a good deal further than the situation outlined by the Minister and I would recommend that it be looked at to see whether it is going too far.</P>

      <P>One never knows to what extent prices are determined by other outlays which have to be met by the purchaser, but I would consider that other outlays would not be relevant.  The 1969 Finance Act was clearly intended to deal with the provisions of the Housing Act, 1966, but the omission of the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; led to a situation in which some quite significant transfers and sales of property took place without stamp duty being paid by developers.  I am sure that was not the intention of the Act, but I will bear in mind what Deputy Colley has said and if an amendment is necessary which the House considers to be deserving of attention, then an amendment will be put forward.</P>

      <P>Before leaving this Part of the Bill I should like to mention <Col N="1752" /> two minor errors.  One is a printing error and the other a drafting one, which has come to light.  The first is in paragraph (c), line 51 on page 38: brackets were inadvertently put around &ldquo;14&rdquo;.  There is, of course, no subsection (14) in section 8 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.  The reference is to section 14 of that Act. That printing error does not require a formal amendment because it will be corrected in the next print of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The second error appears in Part II of the Fifth Schedule to the Bill, and it requires an amendment.  In the repeal provision concerning section 26 of the 1972 Act, which is on page 62 of this Bill, the word &ldquo;other&rdquo; should read &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;, and I will be bringing in an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.</P>

Together with section 63, providing for transitional relief for motor cars and motor cycles, the latter provision is necessary to provide for administrative authority for the relief which operated as from 1st March, that is, dealing with cars that were in stock under a different VAT rate.  The other provisions in Part IV will have effect from the passing of the Bill.  They are mainly provisions for clarifying and tidying up aspects of VAT law.

      <P>There is one matter I wish to raise on this.  It is the situation of a trader who accounts for VAT on a cash receipt basis while making his sales on a credit basis.  I know this is not a new problem but in some cases it is becoming acute as a result of the increased VAT rates provided for in this Bill.  Persons in that position may well suffer fairly heavily as a result of there being no provisions in the <Col N="1753" /> Bill for relief of such persons.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider devising some method of giving relief. I do not think this is a new problem, it has arisen in the past, but is becoming much more acute because of the level of value-added tax rates now in force.</P>

      <P>Of course, such people have opted for a cash basis. I can agree that certain disadvantage can arise in the kind of situation Deputy Colley mentions but I cannot see that we could devise a system to avoid the situation he describes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not exactly analogous but bears some resemblance to the situation to which the Minister adverted a moment ago when speaking about cars and motor cycles and the relief necessary in respect of those in stock.  I know it is not exactly comparable but I suggest there is a certain comparability and apparently a solution was found in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case that Deputy Colley mentions the parallel he tries to draw is erroneous in that there is no element of option.  While he is right in describing a cost situation which arises where rates of VAT are increased, the opposite can happen when rates of VAT are reduced, as happened, for instance, last July in respect of clothing, footwear and fuel, and arose also in 1973 in respect of foodstuffs.  Therefore, we can only hope that it is a question of what one loses on the swings one picks up on the roundabouts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, they are not the same people on the swings as on the roundabouts.  There are people who have not got the benefit of any of those transactions, who are suffering very heavily at present because of the change.  While it is true to say that people can opt for the cash receipts basis, it is also true to say that they took that option when the situation was rather different from what it is now.  But they are not now suddenly allowed to opt back in order to avoid the worst results of the increased rates of tax.</P>

      <P>This section redefines and clarifies the circumstances in which a trader becomes liable to tax on a &ldquo;self-delivery&rdquo; of goods in accordance with section 3 (1) (e) of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972. First of all, it ensures that a trader will become liable on a self-delivery only in those cases where the tax payable on the self-delivery cannot be deducted in full in the normal way from the tax payable on his sales of goods or other taxable transactions. In other words, self-delivery will be ignored where the treatment of the tax relating to it would be merely a matter of bookkeeping.  Secondly, the <Col N="1755" /> definition is widened so that the provision can now be applied to a trader or a professional person who is engaged exclusively in exempted trading activities.  Previously it applied only where a trader had some taxable activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>If, for example, a bank or insurance company decided to manufacture their own requirements of stationery, they would have borne tax on the purchase of the machinery and raw materials and escaped tax on the manufacturing costs.  Equity would seem to require that they should pay tax on the same basis as an independent supplier.  The new text will ensure that that is so. Otherwise there would be a distortion, a situation in which people would start to undertake new activities of this kind in order to avoid tax.  There is no reason why a bank or insurance company should not manufacture <Col N="1756" /> their own stationery but they should not have an incentive to do so of a tax avoidance character.</P>

      <P>The taxable amount on a sale of goods within the State is normally the actual price paid.  When dutiable goods, such as wines and spirits, are sold while stored in a bonded warehouse and before the duty falls due&mdash;which is on delivery from the warehouse&mdash;value-added tax is charged, at present, by reference to the actual sale price which does not include the duty.  This can lead to a distortion of competition and, in the case of a sale to an unregistered person, loss of tax on the duty element. The section provides that in future the taxable amounts of value-added tax on sales of goods in bond will, in all cases, include the duty payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate what effect this is likely to have? The most obvious areas to be affected would be those of spirits and tobacco. Is the effect of this section likely to be to increase the cash requirements of publicans and tobacconists and, if so, to what extent?  Would the Minister be able to give an idea of what would be the percentage increase involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. Before checking whether I am right in that, I should explain that what has been happening in the past has been that in respect of sales in bond&mdash; usually sales of fairly large quantities by importers to spirit and wine dealers &mdash;they paid duty on release of the goods from the warehouse to meet orders in the trade from individual customers, and value-added tax was paid on the full selling price.  But, in recent years, some dealers have adopted the practice of selling small quantities, often single cases, in bond before the duty is due.  If this is sold to an unregistered person, it would mean a loss of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> We should be clear on this.  It is designed to restore equity where equity is undermined when some, by buying single cases in that way, could be avoiding an element of duty and getting an unfair advantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> other retailers buying their goods in the ordinary way and paying tax. Obviously, for those concerned, they are paying more than they have been by this avoidance, if you like, arrangement that exists now.  But it does not increase the cash requirement or the cost to retailers purchasing their goods in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Value-added tax is paid on the price exclusive of duty at present.  Where somebody buys a case in bond, value-added tax is then paid on the price, exclusive of duty, and subsequently&mdash;often within a few days&mdash;the dealer, acting ostensibly as agent of the new owner, arranges for the release of the goods from the warehouse and pays the duty.  He then invoices the duty to the consumer as a separate agency transaction not forming part of the sale of goods and not liable to VAT.  This application of VAT only to what is called the short price gives the dealer competitive advantage over another dealer who is selling from duty paid stocks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a couple of things to say in regard to the section but I might, first of all, deal with the question of duty on motor cycles. I have received representations in regard to this and I believe the Minister for Finance has also received representations.  The main point of the representations is that because of the high rate of VAT on motor cycles the production and sale of motor cycles is going steadily down-wards with a consequent loss of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the VAT rates were fixed in the first instance and I was Minister for Finance representations were made to me that the rate was being fixed at too high a level and would have this effect.  I wrote to the people concerned at the time indicating that it was my intention to keep the situation, as indicated by the yearly statistics, under review and if it turned out that what they were saying was correct, that the level of the rate involved would be reconsidered. I understand that representations have been made to the Minister for Finance but that he either has <Col N="1759" /> not responded at all or has not responded favourably to them.  The statistics seems to show that motor cycle sales were as follows: 1972, 7,806, 1973, 6,669, 1974, 6,384 and 1975, 5,187.  If these figures are correct, it certainly seems that there is a continuing downward trend.</P>
    <P>I must confess that on a purely personal basis I have no great love for motor cycles.  I have never been on one and I do not intend to be on one.  Nevertheless, the question of employment is involved here.  If it can be shown that the rate of VAT applicable is having a considerably detrimental effect on employment then it behoves the Minister and the Government to consider the position.  I, therefore, strongly urge, in the light of the situation revealed by the representations, that the rate applicable to motor cycles be reduced in order to preserve, and possibly create, employment in the industry dealing with the sale and possibly the assembly of motor cycles. I am not certain if motor cycles are assembled here but I believe some limited assembly takes place here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Assembly takes place here on quite a small scale. It does not appear on the figures available to me that there is a decline in the sale of motor cycles&mdash;although there has been some decline in the last couple of years&mdash;commensurate with that of motor cars, or indicating in any way that motor cycles are more hard hit, or that there has been a definite pattern.  I have not got the 1972 figure for motor cars so I will just stick to the years 1973 to 1975 for comparison for the moment.  The Deputy mentioned motor cycle sales figures as being 6,669 in 1973, 6,384 in 1974, and 5,187 in 1975.  That is a drop over the two years, 1973 to 1975, of about 1,480 or about 22 per cent. In the same period car sales fell from 74,789 to 52,432, that is a drop of 22,357 or about 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I cannot swear what the comparison would be if one went back to the Deputy's base year of 1972, certainly over the two years 1973 to 1975 the decline in the sale of motor <Col N="1760" /> cycles has been less than in the case of motor cars.  The Deputy's case on that basis does not seem very strong. As I understand it, there is no net change in the taxation imposed here. The adjustments being made here relate to increases taking place in the lower levels of VAT and are necessary in order to more or less contain the present position.  I hope I have understood that correctly.  The same rate applies to motor cars and motor cycles.  There is no evidence of motor cycle sales declining more rapidly than motor car sales so it does not seem that there is any very strong case.  One would have some hesitation in doing anything which would be an incentive to greater sales of motor cycles in view of the greater danger associated with them than in the case of cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the adjustment being made here in the rate of VAT on motor cycles is simply maintaining the present position.  What is sought is that the rate be reduced, which is what was sought when I introduced the rate originally, as I said. Unfortunately, the figures quoted by the Minister are misleading, as he will appreciate, because what he was calculating was the drop in the sales between 1973 and 1975 and was comparing that with what happened in the case of cars.  That is the period in which the energy crisis was presumably making its major impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for the previous year which the Minister does not have in the case of cars, would be more relevant.  I am also informed that in the late 1960s the sales were as high as 12,000 units per year so it appears that the graph is one of continuing fall to less than half of that in 1975.  The comparison between 1973 and 1975 is misleading for the reason I have mentioned but if one takes a longer period one finds that there is a steady fall.  I freely admit that there may be factors involved in that fall other than the rate of VAT.  I urge, since the case that was made at the time of the introduction of VAT appears to have been borne out <i>prima <Col N="1761" /> facie,</i> there is a strong case for a reduction in the rate unless it can be shown that the fall in sales is not due to the VAT rate.</P>
      <P>I assume, even if the case were overwhelming, that it will not be conceded across the floor of the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I do not expect that but I strongly urge that serious consideration be given solely on the grounds of the employment involved.  There is no other reason why I am urging this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really convinced.  My recollection of work done in another incarnation is that the sales of motor cycles rose sharply and reached a peak somewhere around the end of the fifties.  Since then, there has been a decline which was to be expected because with growing economic prosperity there is a long term trend to shift over from the motor cycle, which, apart from its attraction for some young people, is obviously a poor man's motor car, to cars.  There is no evidence of anything different from that happening since VAT was introduced.  I have not the complete figures here and would have to trace back to the exact point when VAT came in and the different level of tax, but I do not think there is any evidence in any of the figures I have here or that I can recall for a change in the trend which would indicate that VAT is having a particular effect.  In the first three months of this year, sales of motor cycles have risen by about 7 per cent. This I have to admit is significantly less than the increase in the sale of cars.  They are still losing ground to cars but there has been a recovery in sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very hesitant to accept the proposition that anything should be done designed to give an incentive to the sale of motor cycles because of the danger element involved.  Like the Deputy, I have never been a motor cyclist although I once got on one and made it go for a short period&mdash;I am sure quite illegally&mdash;but was sufficiently petrified by the experience never to want to do it again. In the light of the absence of an adequate <Col N="1762" /> case statistically for what the Deputy is saying and the aspect of the relevant danger, I would be reluctant to make any change here, even if this were my own departmental responsibility and I were not standing in for the Minister in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to do this problem to death, but I will take issue with the Minister on the question of there being an absence of an adequate statistical case for the case I have made.  In so far as there is an absence, it is in the Minister's brief. He does not have the information which would enable him adequately to judge the statistical case made.  I would urge that the Department of Finance examine the case as adequately as possible.  If it would appear that there is even a <i>prima facie</i> case, they should contact the people making the representations to them and discuss it with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pass that on to the Minister.  It is not possible to get complete figures at this moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising the Minister for that.  The effect of this section is to increase the rates of value-added tax on most items across the board, except those which have been totally exempt or effectively in the case of motor cars and motor cycles, the rate is not being changed.  On virtually everything else VAT is being increased. I do not want to get into the argument as to why the Government need so much additional revenue, but if I have to I will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disturbed at the failure of the Government to recognise the consequences of what is involved in this section and this is merely symptomatic of what the Government have done on a number of occasions since they came into office.  They have applied taxes in such a way as to cause a significant increase in the consumer price index, to be followed within a reasonably short time by negotiations for a national pay agreement, with the consequences of the national pay agreement being negotiated based on the consumer price index, heavily influenced by the Government's taxation.  This <Col N="1763" /> in turn leads to a settlement at a level very much higher than would have been fixed if the Government had not applied such taxation.  Such a settlement is then carried right through the whole economy, in particular applied in the public service, but it is applied outside the public service too.  The whole consequence is an enormous increase to our economy far out of proportion to the amount of revenue the Government recover as a result of these impositions.  We get ourselves into this vicious circle situation in which the Government then find it necessary to impose further taxation to meet the result of that increase in the public sector pay and so we start the circle again.</P>
    <P>While this is affecting the private sector our industry is becoming less and less competitive.  When this is happening at a time when our competitors are getting their inflation under control, the consequences are even more serious.  It may seem that I am going far from what is in this section, but I submit that I am not. The most significant consequence of this section is what I have been describing.</P>
    <P>It is not an answer to say that the Government have to find the money somewhere to meet their enormous bill because the size of the Government bill is not, as they would have us believe, virtually entirely outside their control.  In most cases, the size of the bill is the result of conscious decisions by the Government to embark on certain expenditure.  One frequently gets the impression that the Government, having made such decisions, and having got the maximum credit they can extract from such decisions, try to convey the impression that they have no responsibility for the unfortunate and unpopular measures necessary to raise something even remotely approaching the necessary revenue.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this section seems to me to involve increases across a very wide spectrum of commodities, with considerable ill-effects for those engaged in the production of those commodities, particularly where the profitability <Col N="1764" /> is marginal.  It has caused the loss of a number of jobs, it is increasing the cost of living for everybody and is having the most significant economic consequences for the reasons I have outlined.  This section seems to go much further than a simple increase of rates of VAT in order to achieve a greater degree of revenue for the Government.  It has much more serious implications and this is the occasion for us to say so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue the Deputy too far because we could get back to a Second Reading debate quite easily.  It is the case that one of the significant sources of additional revenue in the budget was the increase from 6.75 per cent to 10 per cent in VAT rates.  For the rest the difference was negligible or nil. The increase came at that particular level and the Government were faced with the problem of the appropriate balance between expenditure cuts and borrowing and increased taxation. The Government had to arrive at the best balance.</P>
      <P>On the expenditure cuts side, the Deputy will be aware of the very considerable cuts on the non-pay side. As the Deputy has commented, the pay side is a separate issue.</P>

    <P>To have gone beyond that and to have cut the non-pay side more than that under any heading would have involved cuts adversely affecting employment. At other times and in other places the Deputy has commented unfavourably on the level of borrowing. and he seems to share the Government's view that it should not go any higher.  In those circumstances the choice is between further expenditure <Col N="1765" /> cuts which would have had to be in areas directly affecting employment or an increase in VAT rates involving some increase in the cost of living. Quite rightly, the Government made the latter choice.</P>
    <P>The effect of the VAT increases&mdash; the rate of 10 per cent is the one that bears the brunt&mdash;was 1.6 per cent on the cost of living.  If possible it was something to be avoided but the alternatives of bigger expenditure cuts, more borrowing or more direct taxation were even less desirable.  When we came to look for this marginal additional sum this seemed to be the optimum way of doing it.</P>
    <P>We could have proceeded by abandoning zero rates but it has been our policy in Government to maintain zero rates for necessities.  I am convinced that is the right policy and I wish some of our EEC partners would see the social wisdom of it.  In view of the general sharp decline in the sale of consumer durables and goods of that kind&mdash;items such as cars which have been referred to earlier in the debate on this section&mdash;further increases there would have had significant employment effects.  Therefore, the rate of VAT that seemed most fitting to bear an increase was the 6.75 per cent rate.  This rate is basically for goods that are neither necessities nor luxuries but which fall between the two categories.</P>
    <P>I would easily stand over the position that this was the best way to get this sum of money despite the fact that obviously if one can avoid it it is not desirable to increase tax of this kind in a way that inevitably has an effect on the cost of living.  It was the least undesirable course of action open in the situation which the Government faced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think our EEC partners might see greater social wisdom in zero rating of certain essential commodities if we were paying our way. What we are doing is borrowing a great deal of the money that we are using to run our affairs.  In those circumstances, the level of borrowing in which we are engaging would tend to make our EEC partners less than sympathetic to the kind of argument <Col N="1766" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs has put forward.</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient to suggest that what is involved here is marginal. I should like to remind the House that the last recorded quarterly increase in our cost of living was the second largest we have had.  According to the OECD, so far this year we have had a higher rate of inflation than any other developed country in the world.  In those circumstances one cannot be dismissive of a 1.6 per cent increase in the consumer price index which the Minister says is the consequence of the VAT rate increases.  I am not sure he is not underestimating it when he gives a figure of 1.6 per cent but for the moment let us assume it is correct.</P>
      <P>These VAT increases were not included in the last quarterly increase to which I have referred because that was based on a survey carried out on 17th February and the increases operated from 1st March.  The increases are coming on top of the second highest increase recorded.  I suggest that the situation in which the Government have found themselves is one that is very difficult to get out of but it is not one that is adequately answered by pointing out that we have this expenditure and asking where we are to find the money.  It is not good enough for the Government to ask whether they are to borrow the money or the increase taxation.  We cannot ignore the situation that has arisen and how it has arisen.  We cannot assume it arose in the last 12 months.  It did not.  It was a gradual course on which the Government embarked, not without warnings that that is where they were heading.  Having followed that course it is not good enough to say to us: &ldquo;What do you want us to do?  Do you want us to borrow more money or to increase taxation?&rdquo;.  In order to get an adequate and fair answer we must look at what has happened since the Government took over and see how they got to the stage where such enormous expenditure was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Government were unaware of the consequences of what they were doing.  In particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was <Col N="1767" /> not unaware of the consequences of this and other proposals in the budget. He must have known very clearly what was going to happen to the consumer price index, what the likely effect would be on the national pay agreement negotiations and, in particular, what would be the likely effect on the Exchequer and its expenditure.</P>
    <P>This kind of situation into which the Government have got themselves and the rest of us is symptomatic of the approach that we have repeatedly warned against and cannot support. The attitude that is involved and which has produced this situation is exemplified in this section.  For that reason we cannot support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to be dismissive of a tax increase of the order of 1.6 per cent increase in the cost of living.  Indeed, on the contrary, I drew attention to the fact that this was the effect of it.  I did not refer to it as a marginal increase.  I said that when one comes to take a decision at the margin between a number of different choices one has to choose that which is least undesirable. I did not use the adjective &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; and certainly I was not wishing to diminish the significance of what is involved here.  There is no doubt but that this is a significant increase in taxation and it has to be faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Deputy says that it is not good enough to pose a dilemma that faces a Government and ask what course of action should be pursued in those circumstances, one must look back and see how one got into the situation.  Frankly, that is not good enough unless the Deputy is a bit more specific.  If the Deputy thinks we are in a situation we should not be in because the Government incurred additional expenditure which he disapproves of he has the opportunity, briefly, on this section to elucidate which expenditure he thinks we should not have incurred and what he thinks should be cut.  He should tell us what cuts in expenditure should be made now to remove increases that were incurred earlier.  He should tell us <Col N="1768" /> what cuts would be advocated by his party.  He has been conspicuously silent on this.  One of the advisers to his party suggested social welfare as a possible solution, but it is one we reject.</P>
    <P>Any other cuts beyond which the Government undertook in pruning its non-pay expenditure this year would inevitably impinge directly on employment, about which the Deputy and his party are properly concerned at present.  It is not good enough to dodge the dilemma and say this situation should not have arisen if the Deputy is not willing to indicate what parts of the Government's programme he feels should not have been undertaken and should now be pruned and cut out regardless of the effects on the living standards of those in the social welfare categories or on those whose employment would be affected if further significant cuts were made in non-pay expenditure.  I must rebut the Deputy's position and reiterate that the Government were faced with a choice and the choice they made in this instance was the least undesirable choice and one which I, therefore, have no hesitation in defending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to spread this debate too far but I must avail of the Minister's invitation to explain on this section what I think should have been done.  I am singularly unimpressed, as I told the Minister for Finance earlier, with public waving or reductions in Estimates by various Departments. That happens every year.  It means nothing.  What counts is what is published, what is decided by the Government as the Estimates to be met and how they meet them.  The accumulation of expenditure which the Government have had over the past three years is what we are talking about and we talked about it as it was occurring.  There is no way any Government can avoid responsibility for the level of expenditure which they decide on.  That is their responsibility and the finding of money to meet it is their responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything I am about to say is not to be taken as in any way subscribing <Col N="1769" /> to the proposition that any Government can saddle anybody else, Opposition, trade unions or employers, with the responsibility which clearly rests on the shoulders of the Government in power.  I shall now give the Minister an example of the kind of expenditure the Government should not have to be financing.  In the budget of January, 1975, the Government introduced taxation which caused an increase of approximately 4 percentage points in the cost of living immediately before national pay negotiations. That was taken into account in the national pay negotiations and carried through into the public sector pay.  Subsequently, of course, the Government did what we had been urging them to do before the budget, they introduced subsidies of different kinds. Had they done that the expenditure the Government would have had to <Col N="1770" /> undertake in regard to public sector pay would have been much lower and the Government would not have had to find and still have to find the expenditure necessary to meet that part of public sector pay.  That is only one example.  I could develop it but I am not entitled to on this section.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 54 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this section is to limit to 10 per cent the amount of input tax deductible in respect of Fourth Schedule goods in the two new cases, that is, (1) where the goods are obtained by self-delivery and charged as such to value-added tax, and (2) acquired by the manufacturer or assembler of such goods for use otherwise than as stock-in-trade.  The third case mentioned in the section, namely, goods acquired by a person other than a manufacturer or assembler of such goods was already covered by the provision which is being replaced. Fourth Schedule goods comprise motor cars at 35 per cent, motor cycles at 35 per cent, and television sets, radio sets, gramophones and records at 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>The tax on Fourth Schedule goods is imposed at two levels, 35 per cent and 40 per cent, as the case may be, and is imposed at the manufacture or import stage.  At these rates only 10 per cent may be deducted as input tax by dealers who are not themselves manufacturers.  On the other hand, when those dealers re-sell their stocks they are chargeable at the rate of 10 per cent only.  At present the restriction on the deduction of input tax does not apply to the manufacturers of these goods because, as all sales by manufacturers are liable to the higher rate, it was assumed that the tax would always be collected at a later stage.  However, cases have now come to notice in which manufacturers are directly involved in the hiring out of Fourth Schedule goods which are liable to tax at the 10 per cent rate only.  In these and similar cases tax at the higher rate is being deliberately avoided.  Accordingly, the proviso to section 12, subsection (1), of the VAT Act, which limits input tax deduction to 10 per cent, is being extended so as to apply to Fourth Schedule goods used by a manufacturer for any purpose other than as stock-in-trade.  The provision will also apply to Fourth Schedule goods purchased by the manufacturer as well as to those purchased by him and treated as self-delivered under section 3 of the VAT Act as amended by section 51 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): This section seems to be confined to manufacturers only.  As an instance, let us consider an assembler of cars who has a car hire service, a manufacturer operating on a rental basis.  This is a new practice that has developed to a large extent whereby companies do not buy cars anymore. There are motor manufacturers who are also hirers of cars in another section of another company, but I thought that they would have to pay the VAT when they were transferring the vehicle to another company. Evidently this is not so.  I did not realise they were operating within their own company of assemblers. This can apply also where television sets are concerned.  I could see the possibility of assemblers of television sets branching out into the rental service, and this section provides that they would be liable to VAT.  If they were renting the television sets or motor cars, there would not be any sale as such in the company.  The company would still hold the car, radio and the various other things <Col N="1775" /> that are mentioned here in the Fourth Schedule.</P>
      <P>What I want to satisfy myself about is that this provision does not include any of the articles at present exempt where retailers are concerned, that they can claim VAT for a particular type of goods that are not for resale but are needed in the course of their business.  Are there any of these articles that can be caught and that are already exempt?</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): I thought that in the Finance Act last year that loophole was closed.  I can see what the Minister has in mind.  However, if a company contracts 12 months in advance with another company when this Bill becomes law they will be liable to 30 per cent VAT.  Having made an agreement for 12 months in advance, it may not be possible to pass on that charge.  They may contract for anything in the region of 1,000 cars&mdash; there is nothing unusual about that&mdash; and a rate has been quoted before the passing of this Finance Bill, and does not take this additional tax into consideration?  Therefore, a reasonable time should be given to companies that find themselves in this situation to ensure that they do not incur what could be a substantial loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I want to ask the Minister at what stage will the car <Col N="1776" /> be caught.  Will secondhand cars be caught or is it only the new car that is leaving the factory as and from now when this Finance Bill is enacted that will be caught or will it apply to other cars which the company has rented out, which, as I have already mentioned, could involve 500 to 1,000 cars?  That is a point that would want to be clarified in respect of these companies. I do not mind provision being made in relation to cars leaving the factory when this Bill passes through the House, but if it goes back and catches the cars I have mentioned, I think it will cause a problem.</P>

      <P>The effect of this section is to update the provisions of section 15 (4) (a) of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, dealing with the valuation of imported goods for the purposes of the tax.  The new wording takes account of various developments of European Community law as applied here.</P>
      <P>First, the valuation of goods for customs purposes, which is also used as a starting point for VAT purposes, is now governed by Regulation 14 of the European Communities (Customs) Regulations, 1972, and a reference to this regulation is substituted for the reference to the Finance Act, 1952.  This will have no practical effect on present procedures.  Secondly, the import duties which are to be included in the valuation are expressed in general terms with a view to obviating further amendments arising out of changes in customs laws.  The text refers to &ldquo;any duty, levy or other tax (excluding value-added tax) payable in relation to importation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before 1st January, 1976, only customs duties were mentioned in the provision.  As from that date, the provision was amended by the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975, to include the excise duties imposed by that order in lieu of revenue customs duties which were abolished as a result of EEC commitments.  A further extension became necessary to cover the special excise duty on liquid petroleum gas as from 29th January, 1976.  This <Col N="1778" /> amendment is dealt with in section 40 (8) of the Bill.  The amendment will apply up to the date of the passing of the Bill, on which date the text of the present section will displace it.  It is not intended that the present application of the provision shall be affected in any way.  Should new taxes be imposed on imports in the future the provision would, of course, automatically extend thereto.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Perhaps the Minister would clarify a point for me on this section. We know value-added tax is not imposed on the importation of certain goods.  Furniture manufacturers and other manufacturers are concerned about this and I am sure they have put their case quite forcibly to the Minister.  They have to pay value-added tax on their raw materials here and therefore imported furniture has an advantage.  There is a certain anomaly and that is giving outside manufacturers an advantage over home manufacturers because they have to pay value-added tax on the raw material long in advance of selling the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been frequently raised and it is difficult to explain the position but we have looked into it very carefully.  First of all, we cannot impose value-added tax on imports because EEC rules prevent us doing so and we are, therefore, legally constrained.  There is, too, a certain amount of misunderstanding. If a trader purchases from an Irish manufacturer he may obtain credit for value-added tax in respect of the goods purchased even before the supplier of the goods has paid.  The credit would arise when he makes his value-added tax returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  He would be entitled to set off against what he would pay to the Revenue Commissioners the value-added tax he has to pay to his supplier. Depending on the terms of the credit he could, in fact, get the use of quite an amount of money, as it were, before actually paying the value-added tax to his supplier.  That credit cannot arise in respect of <Col N="1779" /> imported goods because there is no liability to pay value-added tax at the point of importation and so no credit can be claimed against the Revenue Commissioners in that case.  If anything, traders gain by buying from Irish manufacturers.  They would get less benefit by purchasing from abroad. I am quite anxious to encourage purchases from Irish manufacturers.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am not sure the people engaged in furniture manufacturing would accept the Minister's argument. The Minister says that those who buy home manufactured products can claim credit for value-added tax but the fact is value-added tax must be paid on the raw material.  The credit may be only two months but value-added tax must be paid well in advance of the purchaser receiving his credit back from the Revenue Commissioners. I see the Minister's point of view.  I am wondering how the Minister carried out his research and came to this conclusion because those working in this sensitive manufacturing area are working on very tight margins and they have a different view from that held by the Minister.  They have to pay value-added tax and there is no value-added tax charged on imports. They tell me they are at a disadvantage and I can only take their word for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 56 advances the date from which interest on unpaid value-added tax begins to run, in cases where an unofficial estimate is made under section 23 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.  In the normal case an interest rate of 1½ per cent per month is charged on unpaid tax as from 19th day of the month following the end of the two-month taxable period.  Where for enforcement purposes tax is included in an estimate under section 23 of the Principal Act, interest does not begin to run until after the expiration of the period&mdash;14 days&mdash;allowed for lodging an appeal or the final determination of the appeal should one be lodged.  As a consequence of this arrangement defaulters can postpone the operation of the interest provision by a substantial period simply by lodging an appeal against an estimate even when no other grounds for an appeal exist.  The present section substitutes a new paragraph for paragraph (b) of section 21 (2) of the Principal Act.  It provides that interest will in the case of tax included in an estimate under section 23 be calculated as from the 19th day following the taxable period included in the estimate or the last such taxable period, if there is more than one.</P>

      <P>No, from the date of an assessment there are 14 days within which an appeal can be lodged. Unless you make this change it means that until such time as such an appeal is determined the interest cannot be charged.  There have been cases when appeals have been lodged simply for the purpose of getting an extended period for the payment of the tax without interest.  All we are creating now is a provision whereby that facility cannot be availed of in future and that interest on whatever is found ultimately to be due will be payable as and from the 19th day after the conclusion of a two-month period, in the same way as would apply if the person had not made an appeal.</P>

It can take nights to try to make up the VAT.

      <P>It appears arising from the introduction of the section, and from what the Minister has explained, that if for any surreptitious reason a trader appeals and the appeal is not genuine, this section is closing a gap obviously for the reason that some people have been making use of this loophole.  I take it that in the normal course the ordinary small trader is expected to send in his value-added tax by the 19th of the following month.  Normally, he does not get notice.  The situation is that he gets his form, he puts down the amount and sends it in.  Arising from that the Revenue Commissioners might write to him and say he has not paid enough.  I presume that this is technically an appeal situation, where the trader writes in and says that he has paid enough.  I presume that letter is taken as being a type of appeal.  In the normal course, basically, the trader is not getting a straightforward assessment.  There is a provision built into section 56 which says: &ldquo;...whether a notice of appeal under that section is received or not ...&rdquo; The explanatory memorandum says:</P>
      <P>Section 56 advances the date as from which interest may be calculated in relation to unpaid VAT covered by an official estimate. The new date will, as nearly as possible, be the same as that which would apply if no estimate had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about an estimate from the Revenue Commissioners and if no estimate is received there is no appeal.  As I see it this is not tax avoidance.  It is a question of a trader having collected tax on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners by way of VAT and not having sent it in. That is, I suppose, a tax paying avoidance, rather than a tax avoidance as such.  What if a trader were to write in religiously every month saying that he was in disagreement with the Minister, that under existing legislation he could accrue a debt to the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1786" /> but that under the previous Finance Acts he was not liable to pay interest on that debt?  I would like to get that confirmed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically, yes. That could be the position provided he lodged an appeal.  An appeal is not simply a dispute with the collector, but it is the lodging of the appeal to an appeal commissioner.  The normal case where this would arise would be where on an audit the Revenue Commissioners were satisfied that an adequate return of VAT had not been made.  Then an estimate for a greater amount than that returned would be made and presented and an appeal would arise from that.

      <P>This section deals with the forms of certain evidence to be presented before a court.  It is provided that a certificate signed by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners certifying a number of factual matters will be accepted as evidence, until the contrary is proved, or the matters so certified.  This certificate is similar to that which we have already provided in some other matters of tax administration. The matters which can be certified are that the defendant was during a stated period an accountable person, that the defendant was during a stated period a registered person and that a person was not during a stated period a registered person.  This procedure is in line with that already prescribed in section 26 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 for the certification of other matters, and they included that stated particulars, or stated deterrents were not furnished, that a stated document was duly sent to the defendant, that a stated notice was not issued to the defendant.  It has the advantage of enabling these matters to be proved without requiring the quite expensive and unnecessary attendance of personnel at the <Col N="1787" /> Revenue Commissioners and at the same time the defendant is at no disadvantage because the matters so certified will obviously have to be proved.</P>

      <P>This section extends the powers to the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations in the area of income tax deductions.  Regulations in this provision may provide for the adjustment of any such deduction made by an accountable person where within five years of the original deduction a change has occurred in the factors by reference to which the original deduction was made.

      <P>The effect of this section is to remove a doubt as to whether goods held for self-delivery are to be excluded in assessing stock-in-trade. It will be recalled that the new proviso to section 12 of the principal Act, as inserted by section 54 of the Bill places a 10 per cent ceiling on the amount of input tax deductible in respect of &ldquo;Fourth Schedule&rdquo; goods purchased by the manufacturer of such goods and applied by him otherwise than as stock-in-trade, and that the new definition of self-delivery which is inserted by section 51 of the Bill applies to cases in which the tax chargeable on goods would not, if the goods had been purchased subject to tax, be wholly deductible and thus extends the goods covered by the proviso.  The purpose of the section is to avoid the danger of circularity of definition in relation to goods covered by the proviso.</P>

      <P>This section serves three main purposes.  The first is to consolidate and re-enact the First, Second, Third and Fourth Schedules to the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.  These Schedules deal with the tax classification of goods and services and have been amended substantially since 1972. Consolidation should be of considerable assistance to trade generally and to the legal and accountancy professions. The second purpose is to carry into the law the changes in the tax on certain goods and services as announced in the budget.  These are: removal of exemption for short-term car hire and the application of 10 per cent; secondly, removal of fur clothing from the zero rating and the application of the 20 per cent rate and, thirdly, the application of a 10 per cent rate to dances which formerly were liable to the 11.11 per cent rate.  The third purpose of the section is to avail of the opportunity of the consolidation of the Schedules in order to effect a small number of drafting corrections in the text.  These changes will not affect the present liability of goods and services. In addition, the Fourth Schedule has been split into two parts as a result of the specification of two rates&mdash;35 per cent and 40 per cent&mdash;in lieu of the <Col N="1789" /> 36.75 per cent rate.  The section comes into effect as and from 1st March, 1976, to conform with the relevant budget resolutions.</P>

      <P>The consolidation of the Schedules is a useful exercise. There have been changes from time to time and it will be helpful to have them altogether in this way.</P>
      <P>There is one matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  This is in regard to the Second Schedule, which provides for goods and services chargeable at the rate of zero per cent.  So far as I am aware that Schedule includes firelighters but I understand that candles, nightlights and matches are charged at the 10 per cent rate.  These are major sources of lighting especially in emergencies such as when gas and electricity fail. Indeed, they are of every day use both for the poorer sections of the community who cannot afford all the electricity they need and for those living in parts of the country where electricity is not available.  My point is that if it is correct to treat firelighters with the zero rating, it should be correct also to treat these other commodities in the same way.  There may be a case for treating them more favourably than firelighters which, although useful, are in the luxury category, whereas candles, matches and to some extent nightlights are not in that category.  Therefore I ask the Minister to agree to make the necessary changes so as to ensure that these commodities too would be zero rated.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide transitional relief in respect of new motor cars and motor cycles held in stock by dealers immediately before 1st March, 1976, the date when the relevant tax rate was changed from 36.75 per cent to 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that the 36.75 per cent rate was effectively chargeable at two levels&mdash;30 per cent at the manufacturer or import stage and 6.75 per cent at the retail stage, and that the equivalent tranches of the new rate are 25 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.  In the generality of cases, the new rates were not expected to increase the burden of VAT on motor cars.  However, it was represented that the application of the 10 per cent rate to retail sales of vehicles which had already borne the 30 per cent tranche at an earlier level would constitute a hardship for dealers who would not be in a position to recover the extra tax by way of higher prices.  Accordingly, it was decided to provide a measure of relief designed to ensure that the 6.75 per cent rate would remain in force, up to the end of April, as regards resales of new vehicles which had already borne the 30 per cent tranche.  It is expected that this moratorium will provide ample time for the disposal of existing stocks.</P>

      <P>This section provides for interpretation and commencement of this part of the Bill.  Subsection (1) comprises definitions necessary for the purposes of this part of the Bill.  They are largely self-explanatory.  The following, however, call for special mention:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;General licence&rdquo; as stated in the definitions means a licence issued under section 9 of the Roads Act, 1920.  It is commonly known as a trade licence.  Under the provisions of section 15 of the Finance Act, 1922, two types of trade licence can be issued by licensing authorities, viz. &ldquo;general trade licences&rdquo; and &ldquo;limited trade licences&rdquo;.  As may be inferred from the title, the issue of both types of trade licence is confined to &ldquo;motor dealers&rdquo;; a motor dealer is also defined &ldquo;as a person who carries on the business of manufacturing, repairing or selling vehicles&rdquo;.  Such licences do not attach to a particular vehicle and may be switched from one vehicle to another by the motor dealer in the course of his business. The conditions attaching to the use, and so forth, of general and limited trade licences are set out in articles 23 and 24 respectively of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations, 1958 (S.I. No. 13 of 1958).</P>
      <P>The essential difference between the two types of trade licence is that in the case of the limited trade licence separate records must be kept of each journey undertaken by a vehicle using such a licence.  It will be clear that due to the fact that trade licences are transferable from one vehicle to another to suit the dealer's business, it would not be practicable to apply the continuous liability provisions&mdash; section 70 of the Bill&mdash;to such licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the numbers and types of trade licences are strictly controlled by licensing authorities and are renewable annually.  Appeals against issue and/or renewal of trade licences lie with the Minister for Local Government whose decisions in such cases are final; it is necessary to retain such controls to prevent abuses in the use of the licences and it will <Col N="1794" /> be apparent that exercise of such controls would conflict with the continuous liability principle.  It is recognised that some abuse of trade licences does exist and it is intended to review the whole question in the near future in consultation with the motor trade. In the short term, however, it is vitally important to try to maintain goodwill and co-operation with the motor trade for various purposes connected with the operation of the new provisions and also in connection with the implementation of EEC directive on infrastructure taxes on goods vehicles. The numbers of trade licences current at 30th September, 1975&mdash;latest available date&mdash;are: general trade licences, 1,675; limited trade licences, 1,494.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Public place&rdquo;: under the existing code, liability for vehicle excise duty&mdash;motor tax&mdash;only arises when the vehicle is used on public roads. This has given rise to difficulties in taking proceedings in cases where untaxed vehicles are found parked in public places which are not public roads e.g. public car parks or car parks of shopping centres, etc. Vehicles which are brought under continuous liability will be liable to tax whether they are used or not, but other vehicles will, as a result of section 78 of the Bill, be liable for tax if they are used in &ldquo;any public place&rdquo;. A definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is accordingly necessary.  The definition is the same as that adopted in the road traffic code.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Relevant person&rdquo;: ideally, liability for road tax in respect of a vehicle should rest with the legal owner of that vehicle.  However, the person registered as the owner of a vehicle with the relevant licensing authority is not necessarily the legal owner of the vehicle and may not necessarily be the person who ordinarily keeps and uses the vehicle.  For example, vehicles owned by business firms are sometimes registered in the name of the employees who keep and use them.  There are also difficulties associated with defining &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; in relation to a vehicle because of such factors as hire-purchase, hiredrive and leasing agreements, and so forth.  For the purposes of this Part of the Bill, therefore, it is proposed <Col N="1795" /> that the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; shall be the &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; i.e., the person whose name is last registered with the relevant licensing authority as the keeper of the vehicle.  It should be noted that the draftsman did not favour the continuation of the strategy developed in the existing motor tax code up to now whereby &ldquo;owner&rdquo; was defined&mdash; Article I of the 1958 Registration and Licensing Regulations&mdash;as &ldquo;the person by whom the vehicle is kept&rdquo; and that the word &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; was to be construed accordingly.  The &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; is defined under Article 18 of the 1958 Regulations as follows:</P>
    <P>18.  For the purpose of any enactment referring to the registered owner of a vehicle, the registered owner shall be:</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a vehicle used under a trade licence&mdash;the holder of such licence;</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a vehicle in respect of which a declaration (in the Form R.F. 6) in respect of more than six vehicles of uniform type in the same ownership, is current the person shown on the declaration made in respect of such vehicles as the owner thereof;</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of a Stateowned vehicle&mdash;(not being a military vehicle) the Department of State referred to in the declaration made in respect of such vehicle under sub-paragraph (2) of article 22 of these Regulations;</P>
    <P>(cc)  in the case of a military vehicle&mdash;the Department of Defence;</P>
    <P>(d)  in any other case&mdash;the person shown as the current owner in the registration book issued in respect of the vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, this section has to be read in conjunction with section 70.  It introduces the concept of continuous liability in respect of motor vehicles.  The justification for this given by the Minister is to assist in the collection of tax on motor vehicles but there are various other provisions in this Bill designed to improve the collection of tax.  There are other methods open, which are not in the Bill at all, which might be adopted to improve the collection of tax.  However, I would suggest that is grossly unfair and is applying the sledgehammer approach which is not uncommon with the Minister. What the Minister is providing, in effect, is that if one has a motor car &mdash;whether one uses it or not; whether one lays it up on blocks or not&mdash; one is liable to road tax on it.  In order to avoid that liability in the normal way one really has to prove that that vehicle cannot be made to move, cannot be used and, in most cases, that is impossible.  There are many people who cannot afford to tax a car all the year round, particularly with the new and increased rates of tax.  Older people, retired people especially, find themselves in that position and people whose health is bad will not undertake driving in the winter months.  Heretofore they have <Col N="1797" /> been able to lay up their cars, and, once the car was actually laid up and not in use, they were not liable to tax. Under this provision they will be so liable.  I believe it is wrong, unnecessary and that the Minister is mistaken in providing in this way.</P>
      <P>Another area in which problems will arise&mdash;and I think the Minister's attention has been drawn to this&mdash;is in the case of those who have antique cars as a hobby.  Apparently, they also will be liable for substantial road tax, because many of those cars are of heavy horse-power but are not used. I hope it will be possible to find a solution to that.</P>
      <P>I know that the provision is that the Minister has to make an order in regard to a particular class of vehicle to which this would apply and that he has indicated that private vehicles would be the ones he would have in mind.  In that connection I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that there is no intention of making an order in regard to any other class of vehicle, for instance, there are such things as luxury coaches used during the tourist season but not used for the rest of the year.  The House would appreciate an assurance that there is no intention whatever of making an order in repect of such coaches which would have the effect of rendering them liable to road tax during the period when they are laid up, the off-peak season of the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a number of interesting points which the Government will take into account and the Minister for Local Government in particular when he is making the appropriate regulations. The actual number of car owners who use their cars for a limited period of the year is very few.  It may well be that there are cars taxed for only three or six months.  That does not necessarily mean they are not used during any other part of the year.  The need for this legislation has arisen out of the very large numbers of cars which are on the roads untaxed, which is unfair to the majority of motorists who tax their cars and who, by reason of the default of others, <Col N="1798" /> have to pay a higher tax.  We hear a lot about TV spongers.  There are road spongers too, car spongers, and this section is necessary in order to bring to an end the very wide scale sponging which is going on on the part of quite a number of motorists.</P>
      <P>It will be possible to exempt certain categories from continuous liability. Deputy Colley mentioned one.  At this stage I do not want to anticipate what form the regulation might ultimately take.  For instance, it could be provided that a car that was 25 years of age or over could be treated as a vintage car and be taxable for a limited period of the year when it would be on the road, or something of that nature.  Obviously, it is not beyond the ability of the Minister, public servants or draftsmen to draft regulations which would deal with cases of genuine non-users of cars.  Certainly at the outset, we would not visualise that vehicles like commercial vehicles or buses would be involved in continuous liability.  The number of such is fewer and they are easily policed.  As Deputies will see, the section provides that continuous liability may be revoked when a licensing authority are satisfied that the vehicle has become permanently incapable of being used, by being broken up, destroyed or exported. We have deliberately provided in the legislation for the making of regulations so that they can be attuned to the needs of the situation when those needs have been adequately and properly identified.</P>
      <P>Of course, it will operate also to relieve the Garda Síochána of a considerable amount of work in which they now have to engage.  It is estimated that up to one-third of Garda time is involved in operating the Road Traffic Acts and movement of traffic on the roads, which is a very high cost indeed and perhaps not the best use of the great skills which the Garda Síochána could bring to bear for the betterment of the community. That is why we consider it very advantageous to enable local authorities to sue for road tax in the same manner as they can sue for an ordinary debt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be recalled that this point was <Col N="1800" /> raised on Committee Stage and I agreed to bring in this amendment.  It means that persons who are authorised by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of section 3, that is, the power to require the production of books and accounts, must be authorised in writing by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not consider that to be reasonable, and I am satisfied the courts would not consider such notice reasonable either.  I do not want to mention any particular case but there was a famous one recently affecting a State body, not the Revenue Commissioners, where the courts held that notice given to do a certain thing was not reasonable, although I think the notice was as much as seven days, and that seven days covered a Bank Holiday weekend.  The Revenue Commissioners would not attempt to act upon the basis of such short notice.</P>

I do not think it would strengthen it in any way if you put in the words &ldquo;shall give reasonable notice&rdquo;, because notice, if unreasonable, would not be tolerated.</P>

    <P>(c)  for repayments in cases where the total of the tax deducted from payments received by a sub-contractor and not repaid to him exceeds the aggregate of&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a)  the issue, recall or cancellation of certificates of authorisation and the surrender of the certificates;</P>
    <P>(b)  the keeping by principals of such records as may be specified in the regulations, the keeping by principals of construction payments cards and the entry thereon of such particulars as may be specified in the regulations, the keeping by principals of cards (in this section referred to as &ldquo;construction tax deduction cards&rdquo;) in such form as may be prescribed by the regulations and containing particulars of any deductions under subsection (2) and the entry thereon of such other particulars as may be specified in the regulations, the making to the Revenue Commissioners of such returns relating to payments made by principals as may be specified in the regulations and the inspection of the said records (including the said cards);</P>
    <P>(c)  the keeping by sub-contractors of such records as may be specified in the regulations containing particulars of payments received by them, and the inspection of the said records;</P>
    <P>(d)  the completion by principals of certificates of tax deducted from payments made to sub-contractors:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> (e)  the sending to sub-contractors, in cases where tax was deducted under subsection (2) from payments made to them, of statements containing particulars of their liability (if any) to tax for a year of assessment.</P>
    <P>(6)  The provisions of every enactment and of the Income Tax (Construction Contracts) Regulations, 1971, which apply to the recovery of any amount of tax which a principal of the kind referred to in subsection (2) is liable under this section and the said Regulations to pay to the Collector shall apply to the recovery of any amount of interest payable on that tax as if the said amount of interest were a part of that tax.</P>

    <P>(III)  requests to supply to an inspector accounts of, or other information about, any business carried on by the said individual, partnership or company, as the case may be,</P>
    <P>(v)  that there is good reason to expect that the said person, partnership or company will comply with the obligations referred to in subparagraph (iii) in relation to periods ending after the date of termination of the qualifying period.</P>
    <P>(b)  A person in respect of whom the Revenue Commissioners are not satisfied in relation to any one or more of the matters specified in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of paragraph (a) shall nevertheless, for the purposes of the issue of a certificate of authorisation, be treated as a person in respect of whom they are so satisfied if the Revenue Commissioners are of the opinion that, in all the circumstances, his failure ought to be disregarded for those purposes.</P>
    <P>(c)  In this subsection &ldquo;the Acts relating to corporation profits tax&rdquo; means Part V of the Finance Act, 1920, and the enactments amending or extending that Part.</P>
    <P>(8) (a)  Where a sub-contractor to whom a certificate of authorisation has been issued produces it to a principal, the principal shall apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a card (in this section referred to as &ldquo;a construction payments card&rdquo;) in respect of the sub-contractor.</P>
    <P>(b)  If, on such application, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that a construction payments card in respect of the sub-contractor aforesaid ought to be issued, to the principal aforesaid, they shall issue such a card to such principal who, upon receiving the card, shall, subject <Col N="1809" /> to the provisions of subsection (9), be entitled during the income tax year (or the unexpired portion thereof) to which the sub-contractor's certificate of authorisation relates to make payments to the sub-contractor named in the card without deduction of tax.</P>
    <P>(9)  (a)  Where it appears to the Revenue Commissioners that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a certificate of authorisation was issued on the basis of false or misleading information,</P>
    <P>(ii)  a certificate of authorisation would not have been issued if information, obtained subsequent to its issue, had been available at the date of its issue,</P>
    <P>(iii)  a person to whom a certificate of authorisation was issued has permitted it to be misused,</P>
    <P>(iv)  a person to whom a certificate of authorisation was issued has failed to comply with any of the obligations imposed on him by the Tax Acts or by any regulations made thereunder, or</P>
    <P>(v)  the business of carrying out construction contracts in relation to which the certificate of authorisation was issued has ceased to be carried on by the person to whom the certificate was issued,</P>
    <P>they may, at any time, cancel the certificate and give notice in writing to that effect to any principal.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where a principal receives a notice under paragraph (a), he shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  deduct tax, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2), from any payments made to the person to whom the notice relates on or after the date of receipt of the notice, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  return to the Revenue Commissioners any construction <Col N="1810" /> payments cards issued to him in relation to the person aforesaid and any construction tax deduction card kept by him in relation to such person.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Revenue Commissioners shall advise a person in relation to whom a notice under paragraph (a) was issued of the issue of such notice and shall require him to return to them forthwith the certificate of authorisation issued to him.</P>
    <P>(10)  (a)  Where any person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  for the purpose of obtaining a certificate of authorisation makes any false statement or furnishes any document which is false in a material particular,</P>
    <P>(ii)  disposes of a certificate of authorisation otherwise than by the return of the said certificate to the Revenue Commissioners,</P>
    <P>(iii)  fails to return a certificate of authorisation to the Revenue Commissioners when required to do so pursuant to subsection (9) (c),</P>
    <P>(iv)  is in possession of a certificate of authorisation that was not issued to him by the Revenue Commissioners, or</P>
    <P>(v)  produces to a principal a certificate of authorisation after he has been advised by the Revenue Commissioners of the issue of a notice under subsection (9) (c),</P>
    <P>he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(b)  Any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the obtaining of a certificate of authorisation by means of a false statement,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the use by any person, other than the person to whom <Col N="1811" /> it was issued by the Revenue Commissioners, of a certificate of authorisation, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  the production to a principal of a document that is not a certificate of authorisation but purports to be such a certificate,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(c)  Any person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  who fails to enter on a construction payment card or construction tax deduction card such particulars as are required to be entered thereon by virtue of this section and any regulations made thereunder,</P>
    <P>(ii)  who fails to return to the Revenue Commissioners the said construction payments card or construction tax deduction card pursuant to subsection (9) (b),</P>
    <P>(iii)  who returns to the Revenue Commissioners any such card on which are entered particulars which are incorrect in any material particular, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  who fails to comply with any provision of regulations made under this section requiring him to keep or produce any records or documents,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of £500.</P>
    <P>(11)  Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before Dáil Éireann as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by Dáil Éireann within the next twenty-one days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> (12)  A person carrying on a business shall not be deemed to be a person of a kind specified in subsection (2) (b) by reason only of the fact that, in the course of that business, he erects buildings for the use or occupation of himself or employees of his.</P>
    <P>(13)  In relation to a case where a sub-contractor is chargeable to corporation tax, unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to tax shall include references to corporation tax and references to a year of assessment shall include references to an accounting period.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As indicated on Committee Stage this amendment substitutes a consolidated version of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, for that section as now amended by section 21 of the Bill.  As a result, all the legislation governing payments to sub-contractors as from the 6th December, 1976, is being made available in readily accessible form.  The consolidated version of section 17 differs in a number of very minor respects from the section as amended on Committee Stage.  These are drafting amendments only.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) the reference to 7s. Od., which is obsolete, has also been deleted.  In subsection (5) (b) a reference to &ldquo;construction payment cards&rdquo; has been amended to &ldquo;construction payments cards&rdquo; to conform with the definition in subsection (1). In subsection (6) what was formerly subsection (6) has been deleted and replaced by the former subsection (6) (c).  The old subsection (6) gave the Revenue priority in relation to sub-contractors tax in cases of bankruptcy. This right is now provided for in section 14 of the Bill and the old subsection (6) is now unnecessary.  It will be noted that although, in general, the subsections are numbered consecutively, two subsections retain their former numbers&mdash;(6A) and (6B).  This is because there are references to these subsections and to subsection (7) in other Finance Acts, section 35 of the Finance Act, 1973, and section 28 of the Finance Act, 1975, and retention of these numbers <Col N="1813" /> is required.  The succeeding subsections which were formerly numbered subsections (7A) to (11), inclusive, are now renumbered (8) to (13).</P>

    <P>This amendment inserts two new subsections in section 30 which take account of two points raised by the accountancy bodies in relation to the <Col N="1814" /> new arrangements for payments on account in appeal cases, and it will be recalled that I referred to these on Committee Stage.  The cases are: (1) that it may not be possible for a taxpayer to estimate with any degree of accuracy what 80 per cent of the tax ultimately found to be due is likely to be, in cases where a substantial part of his income is taxed income, the amount of which will not be known until after the end of the year in question; and (2) the time limit of 21 days for appeals is too short, now that the taxpayer has to estimate the tax ultimately payable and will be depending on his tax agent for advice. The amendment meets these points, first, by giving taxpayers the option of taking the taxed income and charges of the preceding year instead of those of the current year for purposes of the 80 per cent calculation; and, secondly, extending to 30 days the period within which the appeal may be made.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (6) will facilitate taxpayers with taxed income who appeal against an assessment and who then have to calculate the amount which will be not less than 80 per cent of their ultimate liability.</P>
    <P>Income tax appeals are normally against assessments under Schedule D where the basis of assessment is the income of the preceding year.  Where that is the only income involved, it is possible for the taxpayer to estimate reasonably accurately the total tax liability which will be chargeable on determination of the appeal.  By ensuring that the specified amount will be at least 80 per cent of that final liability and by complying with the other requirements the taxpayer can avoid the interest charge on late payment of the tax.</P>
    <P>Since 1974, under the unified system of personal taxation, taxed income, which is chargeable to tax on an actual basis, is charged to tax under Case IV of Schedule D for purposes of the higher rates of income tax and credit is given for the tax suffered by deduction.  A taxpayer whose income consists of or includes taxed income the amount of which may not be known until after or <Col N="1815" /> shortly before the end of the year of assessment may be in a difficult position in calculating&mdash;at the time he receives notice of assessment&mdash;80 per cent of his final liability, which he has to do to avoid the charge to interest on late payments.</P>
    <P>The amendment puts such a taxpayer on the same footing as other taxpayers in that he may elect at the time of determination of the appeal that the charge to interest will not apply if the specified amount is not less than 80 per cent of the tax which would be chargeable if the taxed income to be included in the assessment was in the same amount as the taxed income of the preceding year.  The net result is that the taxpayer with taxed income will be in as favourable a position for specifying a sufficient amount at the time of his appeal as the taxpayer whose assessment is based solely on income of the preceding year.  The new subsection (7) extends from 21 to 30 days the period within which a person must give notice of appeal against an assessment.</P>

      <P>This amendment goes some of the way to meet some of the objections raised on this section.  The Minister should not imagine that it meets all the legitimate points raised. It is an improvement on the section as originally drafted.  One has only to consider the situation in which in a contracting economic world an individual taxpayer or a trading company finds that their profits are considerably reduced from the previous year in order to see that the option of calculating the 80 per cent necessary on the basis of the previous year's income is not a real option.  If your choice is either to pay 80 per cent based on the previous year's income or, knowing that your income is considerably reduced in the current year but not knowing precisely how much it is because of the dates on which you do this and the ending of the <Col N="1816" /> financial year of accounting, choosing to pay what is clearly too much or engaging in what I describe as the Russian roulette required under this section, that is not a real option. While this amendment is an improvement it does not meet anything like all the legitimate complaints made about the section as drafted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to reiterate what Deputy Colley said.  This is an improvement but I cannot see any reason why this section was ever introduced. As I stated on Committee Stage, the payment of accounts as regulated between the Revenue Commissioners and the client worked satisfactorily.  The Minister is now looking for 80 per cent of last year's profits.  It can happen in public and private businesses that profits have declined by 55 per cent and 60 per cent.  We have seen a company make a profit of £500,000 in one year and the next year it is reduced to zero.  A company may not have its accounts finalised and will not be able to put the case to the commissioners that profits have declined by 50 to 60 per cent.  In that case would the commissioners still be justified in saying: &ldquo;This was your profit last year and we are taking 80 per cent of your profits.&rdquo;  In such a situation that could create a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily acknowledge that this is not a perfect solution which will cover all eventualities. I do not think we could devise such a provision but we are giving a number of options.  If the performance of a company is so dramatically worsened as described by Deputy Colley and Deputy Fitzpatrick, I am sure the taxpayer will take that into account when making a reasonable calculation. They are being given 20 per cent to play around with as a margin of error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We obviously had to stop the system which people were abusing to get extended credit for themselves without paying interest.  On Committee Stage, in relation to other sections, there appeared to be no serious disagreement on that point.  It is simply a question of what machinery should <Col N="1817" /> be provided to prevent a person being unfairly charged to interest.  However we must bear in mind that there are two sides to every coin.  On the other side, if a person is assessed at too high a figure and appeals against it he will get a refund of the excess plus interest at 18 per cent, not subject to tax.  That is not a bad investment.</P>

It makes us simply a rubber stamp.  It is assumed we have done all our business and passed it.

While I acknowledge the Deputy's right to speak as he did I do not think an outburst of that kind contributes to the sensible working of this House.  It has to involve a certain amount of give and take and an understanding of the tremendous pressures that exist.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera has referred to the magnificent performance in producing so quickly the Bill as amended in Committee.  Unfortunately, it was not possible for him to congratulate the Minister on the speed with which the Bill was produced originally.  While it is legitimate for the Minister to refer to the statutory constraints which apply to us in regard to the passing of this Bill and to the difficulties we face, nevertheless it is not giving the complete picture if reference is not made to the fact that there was an inordinate delay in producing this Bill in the first instance.  I was obliged on a few occasions to raise the question in this House and to advert to the dangers of having to rush it through at the end, as we have had to do in the past in the case of Finance Bills, or when we had to sit all night and still were not able to deal adequately with it because it was not produced in time.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, last year the statutory provisions were changed and extra time was given during which the Finance Bill might be passed.  If that had not been done, if we had been operating this year on the statutory provisions under which we have operated for many years, then we would have been two days late for the passing of the Second Stage on the date on which this Bill was produced.  There were other delays subsequently.  Let us keep in perspective what was the cause of this pressure on us in dealing with the Bill.  I submit the major cause of the pressure is delay in producing the Bill and in producing the amendments the Minister announced he was going to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there were important <Col N="1820" /> aspects of the Bill we did not get the opportunity to discuss.  In particular, I should like to refer to the increase in what is commonly called the road tax on motor vehicles.  This has been savage and unjust, particularly as it has been applied to cars already owned.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of it, but in many cases following the Minister's announcement in the budget many people have care that overnight were reduced in value by something in the region of £1,000.  I do not think this was either justified or necessary.  If the increase in rates of duty which the Minister announced were necessary&mdash; and many people would question this &mdash;there is no reason why they should not have been applied to newly registered cars.  If that had been done, at least one could say that if a person chose a car subject to that duty he was doing it with his eyes open and he knew what he was letting himself in for.  However if a rate of duty is introduced which has the effect overnight of reducing cars in value perhaps by £1,000 as happened in many cases, the Minister has an obligation to look again at what he is doing and to see if it is necessary and justified. I submit that in that case it was neither necessary nor justified.</P>
    <P>Another matter we did not get an opportunity of discussing was the proposal incorporated in this Bill now as part of the law to take away from farmers the refund of 1 per cent to which they had heretofore been entitled as compensation for the value-added tax they paid out on their inputs into farming.  I can recall when introducing VAT originally that this figure was higher.  Speaking from recollection, I think it was 3 per cent because the VAT was being applied to a wider range of the farmers' inputs than was decided eventually.  We managed to avoid that on certain items and thereby to reduce the figure to 1 per cent.  It is very important that what is involved here is understood.</P>
    <P>Farmers are engaged in business but, because of the nature of their business and their sales, it is extremely difficult to treat them in the same way as other businesses and allow them to recover the value-added <Col N="1821" /> tax they pay on their raw materials the business inputs they have.  In any other business the trader is entitled to recover the value-added tax he has paid out so that ultimately it is the consumer who pays the net VAT. There is a difficulty in the case of the farmer but this was met reasonably well by working out an average figure that would apply to the average farmer.  It worked out at 1 per cent and the farmer was getting this refund.</P>
    <P>In addition to the various other things the Minister has been doing some of which have been quite damaging to agriculture, we have this proposal which we did not get an opportunity of discussing of taking away this 1 per cent refund.  Whatever reasons might be advanced on a practical level for doing this&mdash;I am not aware of them but there may be some &mdash;one thing there cannot be any dispute about is that it is wrong in principle under VAT to take this away. What it is doing, in effect, is that it is treating the farmer as the ultimate consumer in the same way as the person who buys in a shop from the retailer is the consumer.  It is treating him that way in regard to the items he is using as part of his raw material in the whole process of farming. Whatever reasons may be advanced on a practical level for doing this there is no justification whatever in principle.  If this is justified in principle under VAT then there are all sorts of other steps which may be justified in future but which will totally defeat the whole principle of VAT and return us to a form of sales tax.  That can have serious consequences for the Revenue and for our contributions and assessments of what we receive from the EEC.  I have not time to develop that but I am concerned at this departure from the basic principle of VAT which is also damaging to farmers and which is taking away something which was worked out when we introduced VAT as a fair method of recompensing to farmers the VAT they were paying out on their raw materials.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with the other aspects of the Bill as well as we could in the <Col N="1822" /> time available&mdash;the various income tax provisions and, of course, the pretty savage impositions in regard to beer, spirits and petrol.  We have extracted from the Minister the information that the increases in all these items have been in the region of or well beyond 100 per cent since the Government took office.  The increases would be extremely serious at the best of times but they have added to them the ignominy of occurring under the regime of a Government who came into power pledged to halt price rises and stabilise prices.</P>
    <P>The VAT increases across the board were serious in their own import but more serious in so far as they have contributed this year to the highest rate of inflation in the world of any developed country with the consequent serious repercussions on national pay agreements negotiations. That in turn has serious repercussions on the Government's need for further money to finance the ordinary running of the State which will bring the Government back here squeezing even more any possible area of revenue and stifling even further any chances of growth and entrepreneurial skill that may still be left here. The approach which says: &ldquo;There is a loophole there; we will close it by affecting everybody,&rdquo; is very common from this Minister and is well exemplified in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We touched on one aspect of that a short time ago in relation to the introduction of the concept of continuous liability for tax on motor vehicles, whether one is using them or not, whether they are laid up or not. This is the same approach.  We have seen and discussed at considerable length the implications of the abolition of exemption from taxation of the activities of agriculture and fishery co-operatives in so far as they are exempt at present.  Of course, many of their activities are not exempt at all.  In so far as many of their activities were obtaining exemption and, in the Minister's view, should not have been, the right approach of the Minister would have been to bring in proposals for extending their liability to tax in respect of those activities.  The <Col N="1823" /> Minister adopted his usual method of the blunt instrument ignoring the consequences for employment, particularly, the key question here today. The net effect of that proposal, and other proposals in the Bill, will be to reduce employment where the Minister should be straining every nerve to increase employment in any way possible.  The creation of one job should be vital to the Minister for Finance today whereas it is a question of these measures causing the disappearance of thousands of jobs if one takes all of the provisions and their effect on our economy together.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this country at this time should be subjected to the blind and ignorant, in the economic sense, ministrations of this Government. The alternative to that is to assume they are malevolent.  I am not prepared to make that assumption. One can only assume that such steps and such results come from sheer economic ignorance.  It is sad that this country at this crucial time should have to go through this ordeal with this kind of economic ignorance predominating. However, it will not be for long.</P>
    <P>There is a very difficult task ahead of the next Government but it is not insuperable.  It can be done and it will be done.  This country will be got moving and we will get growth back into our economy.  We will get the kind of economy in which it will be possible to achieve real equity, not paper equity in taxation by reducing the level all round but real equity and real equity involves the opportunity for people to get a job.  A situation in which people cannot get a job is not equitable.  This Bill will not contribute to the creation of a situation in which people can get a job.  On the contrary, it will clearly contribute to the situation in which more and more people are losing their employment.  I can only hope that in the near future the opportunity will be given to the people to express their verdict on what is in this Bill and on the general performance of the Government.  I have no doubt about the result of that verdict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill goes very much further than the implementation of the budget with some amendments.  It has become a complex mass of financial legislation in itself as witness its size and the size of the amendments.  It is also to be seen against the background of the history of financial legislation, capital and otherwise, in the past two years under the present Minister.</P>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Colley has said: if there is to be that recovery this House and the Government must function as a democratic institution. We have now reached the stage, largely by putting the pressure of time on us, when the House has become a futility.  The machine's weight is now being used&mdash;I want this on the record as a warning in addition to other warnings I gave yesterday&mdash;to crush and defeat any intelligent effort to control the business of the State in this House.  The Government have abdicated and the Minister is a rubber stamp to a large extent, although perhaps he does not know it.  The regiment of feet that will follow the Minister into the lobby represents rubber stamps.  We have not been able to consider and deal effectively here with the financial business that has come before us.</P>
      <P>One may talk of procedure but it is quite clear that the Committee system in this House has been reduced to a farce.  The Corporation Tax Bill Committee was a scandal.  I agree with the Minister that it may have been done with the best of intentions; and, I sympathise and I appreciate the efficiency of the staff and the efforts that were made.  But it does not get away from the fact that introducing this Bill as passed in Committee before it was passed in Committee implies that it did not matter what happened in Committee, that whatever was presented would be put through.  How could the Minister consider amendments? The Bill was already printed and ready and what is said on Report Stage will hardly matter because the Report Stage amendments were small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pointing this out as an objective fact, while at the same time accepting and endorsing what the <Col N="1825" /> Minister said about the efficiency, devotion and support the staffs are giving.  It is the lead being given to the staffs, the attitude and the abdication in many ways of ministerial function that I am criticising.  In passing the Bill in this way the machine's weight is being used to defeat any intelligent effort to control the business of the State in this House.  The House and the Government are the foundation and support of the machinery and if the House and Government collapse into futility the machinery will be destroyed in the rubble and the consequences are fearsome.</P>
    <P>I return to what Deputy Colley said: it is not too late to mend.  Due to the situation new under this Government and this Minister we are passing what is in this Bill with incomplete consideration.  Obviously, the Minister did not care what was said on this side of the House; he had his Bill printed before the arguments were heard.  That is the state we are now in.  I want to finish by protesting most strongly and objectively, while appreciating all the other things of which Deputy Colley has expressed appreciation and joining with the Minister in his thanks and acknowledgment of the devoted service that he and the House have got from those who prepared and arranged this very complex legislation &mdash;I do all that with a whole heart&mdash; against the procedure adopted here.  I feel that at this stage somebody must point out the facts of the situation and the background of all we have had in this financial legislation.  Having done that, the most that a Deputy on this side of the House can do is to register his protest as strongly as he can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the sincerity of the protest but I want to point out that there was no amendment from the Opposition since Deputy Colley's last amendment, which was to section 32.  Therefore, we had no cause to anticipate that there would be amendments from the Opposition.  It was reasonable for the Government to assume that since we have the undivided loyalty of Government supporters, Government amendments would be carried.  We acted very properly <Col N="1826" /> on that assumption and our amendments were carried.  We knew that our amendments, by and large, would be acceptable to the Opposition so that, in fact, we did not do anything atrocious.  I think what we did was defensible and desirable and we assisted the House in what we did. Deputy de Valera is correct in that it did involve a certain amount of assumption.  The Executive have no right to assume that the Legislature will do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>On the other hand, that is not the way in which government in this or any other democracy can work having regard to the time, stress and other pressures upon it.  I had hoped that, notwithstanding the short time for which the House had the Finance Bill as amended in Committee before it, Deputies would have noticed what is, I think, a significant and, I trust, a helpful departure.  I promised that I would bring in descriptions in the Bill that would help Deputies to read the Bill.  Instead of setting out in the contents section as has always been the practice in the past amendment to section so-and-so of such-and-such a Bill.  I have now put in words describing the impact of the original sections.  For instance with &ldquo;Amendment to section 142 of the Income Tax Act, 1967&rdquo; I have inserted the words &ldquo;dependent relative&rdquo; which obviously alerts the attention of any person concerned with dependent relatives but is not a tax expert.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The work in doing that is ongoing work.  Behind the scenes, apart from what we do here in Parliament, the Parliamentary Draftsman, experts of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance and other Departments concerned such as Local Government&mdash;they are primarily concerned with motor taxation&mdash;continue to study draft legislation as it is introduced <Col N="1827" /> and from time to time they submit to Ministers suggestions for further amendments.  It is open to the Ministers to accept or reject them. Ministers ultimately may bring in further amendments.  That is all part of the process of democracy but ultimately the decisions lie here and nowhere else.  The Government have not for a moment suggested that the decisions lie or ought to lie anywhere else.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the Government, and myself in particular, are not prepared to listen to criticisms and observations of the Opposition.  We have had a good, hard-hitting, healthy but reasonably polite debate, and as regards such uncomplimentary things as were said I accept the right of people to utter them and I accept that if I were in the shoes of the utterers I might even be less complimentary to the person doing my job.  That is the way in which the process of democracy works.</P>
      <P>We still have another House, a House which cannot make amendments to a Finance Bill but which may make recommendations.  If any suggestions were made here which the House considered desirable for implementation, the other House could make recommendations and come back to us, even within the severe restraints which are ahead of us.  Naturally there is play about the delay in the introduction of a Finance Bill.  I am sure I am speaking for all my predecessors when I say that my great desire would be to bring in the Finance Bill the day after the budget.  Again, for technical and administrative reasons it is impossible to do that.  By the time you translate a simple, clear idea into legislative form many weeks pass as the drafts are looked at by a series of technical experts and then referred to the Minister concerned who must then explain them to the Government and have them passed.  They are then referred back again for further and more detailed preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for all these delays is the ingenuity of man, the ingenuity of people who have a disinclination to pay tax, which is a perfectly healthy <Col N="1828" /> instinct, but it makes the tax code a complex one and necessitates the preparation of most complex formulae in order to prevent avoidance.  This is the reason that any Finance Bill I have had anything to do with was not introduced earlier than it was.  It was not at any time due to any political difficulty, because the decisions in the Finance Bill have already been taken and exposed to the nation in the original budget debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are some other ones which are of less consequence. The only reason they are not revealed on budget day is that an appeal is invariably made that proceedings on budget day are too long and that the budget speech ought to be abbreviated rather than extended. Extending it to cover all 183 sections of the Finance Bill would create an intolerable burden on those listening to the address and the main impact of the budget message would be lost in a mass of detail which is understandable only to the experts.</P>
      <P>As far as this House is concerned, this Bill is now over and done with, unless some recommendations come back from the Seanad.  It is not the last time the Finance Act of 1976 will be before the House because there was never a Finance Bill passed in this or any other country that did not have to be referred to in subsequent legislation.  It is all a package which continues to grow.  I know this causes Deputy de Valera and others to have sleepless nights and upset days, but there is no other way in which the affairs of a country can be run. Every now and then we could have a measure of consolidation like the consolidation of Income Tax Acts of 1967.  Those who did that work did a marvellous piece of work, but maybe 1967 was more leisurely than 1976. As a Member of the House at that time I feel it was more leisurely then, and I do not think that my views have been affected by the addition of my ministerial duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time it is necessary to have consolidation measures to get rid of deadwood.  We did a great deal of that in the income tax code in <Col N="1829" /> recent years.  We now have a new package of capital taxes, a new baseline from which to look at our whole financial code.  We now need a period of stability in which we can make improvements and adjustments as the circumstances of our time may require. In a decade or two we may have occasion to have a new look at our tax code, but three years of the most fundamental work has now come to a conclusion.  This Bill is part of it because it tidies up the loose ends which were left after passing the Corporation Profits Tax Act.  It also does other things which were not particularly popular this year, or in any other year, but which will correct some of the undesirable trends in our public finances.  I hope it is in that spirit that people will bid it adieu in this House.</P>

We were not able to deal with this Bill as we should have.  My protest <Col N="1830" /> and my warning is no principle, not as a political attack on the Minister or anyone else.  It is meant to be a warning against the consequences of a drift in the direction in which we are now not only drifting but being swept along.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's desire.  I am not blaming or excusing myself or anybody else.  We had the Bill for a month or more before the debate in the House.  We are under certain constraints.  Perhaps we should extend the period within which we have to pass the Finance Bill.  I certainly did not want to have any tight constraints.  We have had a lengthy debate on the Bill and some sections were debated a little longer than was absolutely necessary.  As long as we have freedom of debate we will always differ on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I believe the State as an employer should set an example, particularly when an employee falls ill.  This is a letter received by the individual from the National Monuments Branch, Office of Public Works, Trim, County Meath:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to hear of your illness. I enclose your insurance cards as you require them for social welfare pay-related benefit due to the long period you may be absent from work.  When you are fit for work again you should re-apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This man is ill and does not therefore require his social welfare cards for disability benefit and pay-related benefit because it is his 1974 stamps which are paying his benefit.  No employer would send these cards back in such circumstances and so this is a very feeble excuse.  Then the reference to re-applying: we know that anybody <Col N="1835" /> who applies for a job with the Board of Works at the moment has to wait for anything up to a year, or perhaps longer, before he is taken on.  This man has spent six weeks in hospital and within a week of coming out of hospital he gets this letter telling him his cards are being sent to him and he knows immediately his job is gone. He is told he may reapply.  That is all very fine, but how long will it be before he is re-employed?  This certainly will not help his recovery if he is worrying about his job.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had said yesterday that it is normal to send out the cards after nine weeks but that, when the man re-applies, there will be a position for him everybody would have been satisfied.  This man is married with six children.  This action by the Board of Works will scarcely help his recovery.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this course should have been taken.  This is something no good employer would do.  If this man stayed out sick for years and his employer went out of business he would be entitled to claim redundancy payment and there would be no such thing as nine weeks, or anything like that, because under the social welfare code the State maintains he is still employed.  I am puzzled that any State agency would do what the Board of Works did in this case.  I know the man will be out for a couple of months more.  That shows the seriousness of his illness.  On the other hand, we all know how difficult it is to get employment at the moment and the State should be setting a headline in a case like this.  A temporary man has been taken on.  Possibly what has been done is in compliance with the Minister's ruling that no new jobs will be created or no new personnel taken on. It is a sad commentary if that is the case.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says he has not been dismissed and he will be eligible for re-employment.  This sounds fine but it does not help the man who is handed his cards and knows what that means.  It means he is dismissed and that it is the way he takes it.  Reapplying is very like the <Col N="1836" /> firm looking for an employee which interviews applicants and tells each applicant it is quite pleased with the person interviewed and will let him know in a few days.  The outcome generally is that the firm is sorry there is no vacancy.  That is the way this man feels about what has happened to him.  This sort of thing creates a bad impression.</P>
    <P>The Board of Works have been good employers and have done good work in County Meath since 1969. Very worthwhile employment has been provided.  The pay has been good. There have been bonuses.  Men have been trained and promoted to gangers, supervisors, drivers and so on.  Many a young fellow has become skilled as a result of working with the Board of Works.  As I say, a Government agency should set a headline as a good employer.  Any good employer would never think of handing back the cards to an employee when he has been out sick.  I realise that after nine weeks one does not pay any more sickness benefit.  This is the benefit that makes up the difference between social welfare and his ordinary pay.</P>
    <P>There is one of the few firms that do it in County Meath and it is a credit to them.  When the illness is over there is no reason why he cannot stay on. I have seen people who have been out sick for much longer than this man, for over a year.  They never got back their cards and they were taken back when they re-applied.  I know of one man in my own area who had been out sick for a year and he was taken back.  He was working for quite a long time afterwards until he became permanently disabled.</P>
    <P>On that score I feel that all the Parliamentary Secretary has to say is that for this man, who is a good, hard-working, family man with six children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

His complaint became quite serious after the operation.  To get this <Col N="1837" /> within a week or so of his coming home was very disturbing, even though he sent in a certificate saying it would be at least two more months. It is only fair to point out that he did give that indication that it would be at least two more months before he could come back to work.  His doctor felt he would take that time to recover.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will see that when this man is fit again and reapplies there will be a job there for him.</P>
