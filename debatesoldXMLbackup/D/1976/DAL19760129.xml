      <P>As instruments for reducing inflation and increasing employment, the last three budgets of the Minister for Finance were absolute failures, and it gives me no joy to predict that this budget will be the worst of all four.</P>
      <P>There are a number of ways in which one can approach examination of any budget.  I propose to concertrate my remarks on two aspects: one, the role of the budget as a record of the Government's housekeeping; and two, the role which the Government play in regulating and managing the economy as a whole and the consequences of that management, whether it improves or depresses the standard of living, whether it relieves the tensions of inflation and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday was in some respects the moment of truth for the Minister for Finance and the Government.  For <Col N="794" /> exactly three years they have asked the people of the country to wait further for delivery of their promises, for the turn in our economic affairs that would bring these promises to fruition.  They created the illusion that they had some kind of magic formula which made normal economic analyses no longer relevant.  The magic formula was an illusion, and the promises can now be said to have been broken, even without a promise of hope to sustain our people who have been so bitterly misled in the past three years.</P>
    <P>I referred to the role of the budget as a record of the Government's housekeeping.  On this issue, the problem overhanging the Government's management, or mismanagement, has been the disastrous increase of reliance on borrowing.  In the past three years we have seen the reckless spending spree leading to the position where the deficit in the current budget has risen from a negligible figure of £5 million in 1972-73, our last year in office, to £92 million in 1974, £259 million in 1975 and £327 million for 1976, the current financial year.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of last year, as we all know to our cost, the Minister budgeted for a £120 million deficit. He was no less than 100 per cent out in that forecast.  Let us hope the £327 million now expected to be the deficit in 1976 will not be exceeded again by 100 per cent.  The enormous level of borrowing to pay for, or more accurately to postpone paying for, day to day expenses is quite unprecedented in the history of this State and totally unjustified on any financial or economic grounds.  From time to time the Coalition have made half-hearted attempts to justify their dependence on borrowing by pleading that borrowing was a necessary exercise because of the problems created by the oil crisis of 1973, but there are a number of factors which give the lie to this argument.</P>
    <P>The first and most obvious is that Ireland was not the only country to suffer from higher oil prices and the subsequent economic recession, but Ireland is the only country in the EEC and indeed in the western world generally <Col N="795" /> which has borrowed at this colossal figure.  Last year total public borrowing by the Government and other official agencies, such as local authorities and State companies, was more than £700 million, equivalent to 20 per cent of our GNP.  We know now that the borrowing this year will be more than £900 million, equivalent to more than 22 per cent of our GNP.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast these figures with the borrowings of other European countries, borrowings which lie in the range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent of GNP and which, even in the cases of the heaviest borrowers, such as Britain and Italy, do not exceed 10 per cent of GNP.  As manager of the nation's purse the Minister for Finance is pursuing a disastrous spendthrift course, borrowing more and more at higher and higher interest rates, reaching the ultimate in this classic &ldquo;skid row&rdquo; behaviour.  He is now borrowing to service borrowing.  The stark figures of the national debt establish that not only has there been an increase in the absolute amount but that the rate of progress has accelerated at a frightening pace.  I will just give a few figures. On March 31st, 1973, the national debt was £1,298 million.  On March 31st, 1974, it was £1,464 million. Then our financial year changed and on December 31st, 1974, it was £1,766 million.  On December 31st, 1975, it was £2,376 million and at the end of this year on 31st December, 1976, it is estimated that the national debt will be £3,200 million.  In three years the Minister for Finance has been able to create a national debt one-and-a-half times greater than what it stood at after 50 years of the coming into being of this State.</P>
    <P>If these borrowings were, as claimed, intended to maintain employment and output then we have to ask ourselves: Where is the evidence that they have succeeded?  The answer is, of course, that there is no such evidence.  We know only too well that unemployment has risen as rapidly, indeed more rapidly, in Ireland than in other EEC countries and output in industry has fallen as heavily here as elsewhere.  The one unwelcome result <Col N="796" /> we appear to have obtained from this debt finance spending has been the dangerously high level of inflation. Two days ago the <i>Irish Independent</i> in its second leader under the heading &ldquo;What Policy?&rdquo; had this to say:</P>
    <P>We are now in a far more serious position than most other countries.</P>
    <P>That, I suggest, is almost an understatement.</P>
    <P>Inflation, unemployment and borrowing are out of line here by international standards.  It will no longer suffice for the Government to look simply for an upturn in the world economy to push us out of our difficulties.  We have got to move as a matter of urgency to put our own house in order, to recognise that the world does not owe us a living and that the imbalances which we have referred to must be eradicated.</P>
    <P>This budget is a very poor effort indeed, to eradicate these imbalances. Certainly it gives no indication that the urgency pressed upon the Minister by the <i>Irish Independent</i> has been realised by him.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Coalition's spending spree does not, of course, surprise us.  Since they came into office we have consistently warned that they were embarking on a budgetary policy totally devoid of any financial justification and totally divorced from the economic needs of our country, based as it was on solely short-term and narrow political considerations.  This is the second pointer which gives the lie to the argument that the steps taken were designed to create employment and to reduce inflation.  I might remark here that they embarked on that policy of deficit budgeting even before the oil crisis.  In their very first budget in May, 1973, they had committed themselves to the prodigal son's approach.</P>
    <P>The third argument working against the Coalition's approach in the past three years is that they are now, perhaps grudgingly, proposing to abandon it.  We have had enough speeches from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other Government spokesmen in recent months warning us that <Col N="797" /> public spending could not rise indefinitely and that sooner or later there must be a halt to the rapid growth in spending in recent years, and so indeed there must.  But the depressing thing is that, while yesterday's budget may in some sense be regarded as a step back towards realism and the beginning of the end of the Cloud-Cuckoo-Land approach, it still has done virtually nothing to halt the growth in public spending.</P>
    <P>There has been much emphasis by Government speakers on the way in which the economic recession had raised Government spending and depressed tax revenue, thus causing some, but not by any means all, of the deficit. When we look at the figures, however, there is very little evidence that tax revenues are down, but there is a great deal of evidence that spending has rocketed.  Let us look at the suggestion that tax revenue has decreased. In 1972-73 total tax receipts and other revenue amounted to about 33 per cent of gross national product.  In 1975 they accounted for about 35 per cent, so that, despite the recession, the Government had managed to acquire a larger share of the national cake.  Even prior to yesterday's changes the pre-budget estimates for 1976 were that receipts were likely to remain at about 35 per cent of gross national product. That establishes that it is not any major shortfall on the tax side which has caused the financial headache for the Government.</P>
    <P>The real problems arise on the spending side.  Let us look now at both current and capital spending.  In 1972-73 the Government's total spending on current and capital account amounted to just over 42 per cent of gross national product.  By 1975 this figure had risen to over 54 per cent and, even prior to yesterday's budget, the estimated 1976 figure was over 58 per cent.  It is this fantastically rapid and quite inconsistent rate of growth in spending which is at the heart of the Government's budgetary problem. The changes announced yesterday suggest that there is still no commitment or policy on the Government's part towards curbing this spending spiral. In so far as any attempt was made to <Col N="798" /> close the gap between income and spending it took the form of further tax increases to sustain the higher level of public spending, and this despite the Taoiseach's publicly proclaimed view that it is the spending growth which must be halted.</P>
    <P>If spending were to go on rising at the same rate as in the past three years, then in little more than ten years of Coalition Government, the public sector would absorb 100 per cent of gross national product and all debate about the future of private enterprise in agriculture, industry or commerce would be futile since all would have been devoured by the public spending monster.</P>
    <P>There must be some welcome for the reluctant acceptance by the Coalition that they must pay for their day to day spending by taxation.  There can be no support or acceptance from this side of the House for any policy of persistent increases in the Government's share of total spending and total national resources.  This, I suggest, is a drift towards extreme socialism which is causing grave apprehension among the public generally, among traditional Fine Gael supporters and, I might add, some non-doctrinaire supporters of the Labour Party.  I used the words &ldquo;drift towards socialism&rdquo; because there is no visible evidence of any conscious plan or policy on the part of the Minister to go in that direction.  The more likely explanation is that the Minister is being forced to go on this course of accepting creeping socialism because of the confused policies he has adopted or has been forced to adopt.  There may very well be some elements in this Coalition which would welcome this trend, which could, perhaps, explain why there is so little effort being made to choke off this rapid growth in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are not opposed to temporary increases in deficits whether by way of higher spending or lower taxation, if this borrowed money is being effectively used to overcome the effects of an economic recession and to boost employment. We are opposed to persistent <Col N="799" /> increases in the Government's share of the national cake which has never been justified as any part of an overall policy.  Despite the Coalition's attempts to obscure this issue, much of this borrowing is not the result of temporary factors and will not disappear with the ending of the recession. It is instead the consequence of the Coalition attempting to have their cake and eat it because, on the one hand, they introduced new spending on social welfare, on their disastrous policy to deal with local rates in other areas, but they did not introduce the extra taxation to pay for these spending plans.  That is the issue from which they have run away over the past three years and which they are only now beginning to face.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the budget of June last&mdash;six months ago.  This was an additional emergency budget introduced to deal with what we regarded as a serious emergency situation.  People were prepared then to face up to the realities and to a definite policy, hard though it might have been in some respects.  Once again the Minister and the Government took fright and ran away from the policies they should have introduced, not only just then, but at least six months earlier.  As a result the Minister's problem is now all the graver and all the more difficult of solution.  Let us be clear yesterday's raid on the taxpayers' purse is only a tiny fraction of what is needed to restore balance in the current account. Despite the £107 million extra taxation the Minister forecast, their current deficit still rose from last year's level of £259 million to £327 million, a rise of about 26 per cent, which is still away above the inflation increase.  Their borrowing to pay for the day to day running of the Government is still rising. Even yet they have not succeeded in halting the rising tide, much less in even attempting to reverse that trend. This means that we still do not know what policy the Government are going to adopt to cope with this deficit.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked of removing that deficit in three years.  That means he must raise his tax receipts by that amount, an incredible 8 per cent of <Col N="800" /> GNP on to the existing level of 34 or 35 per cent, or he must cut spending. May the explanation be that the Minister has rejected the ultimate cure so far in advance that he anticipates, I might even say hopes, that an incoming Fianna Fáil Government will have to take up the problem again and do his work for him?</P>
    <P>This postponing of the evil day is a gloomy and depressing prospect, enough perhaps to explain why yesterday's budget should have been obsessed with the pressing financial problems of the Exchequer rather than with the real economic problems and difficulties which face our country.  The Minister and the Coalition have nobody but themselves to blame for the financial monster they have created.  For three years they ignored our warnings and attempts to put them on the right economic road.  For three years they persisted in their foolish belief that they could spend their way out of any economic problem and that adding to the fuel of inflation would help in some way to maintain employment. When they finally started coming to their senses and listening to sensible advice both from this side of the House and from outside, they still could not bring themselves to operate that advice properly and efficiently. Here again I refer to the debacle of last June's budget.</P>
    <P>Having ignored our earlier suggestions for food subsidies, for example, as a first step towards breaking the inflation spiral, they eventually accepted a similar proposal when it came from the National Economic and Social Council, an independent advisory body which they had already established, and whose views therefore they could hardly ignore.  The one interesting, though little publicised feature, of the NESC report on our economic prospects for 1976 was the comparison they made between the effects of their proposals for last June and the actual measures introduced at that time.  They indicated that their proposals were not accepted by the Minister because he was afraid to face up to the issue.  The most revealing statistics from that comparison is this: the estimate of the NESC was <Col N="801" /> that there would be 8,000 fewer people unemployed this coming summer had their advice been followed.</P>
    <P>In June the Minister was claiming that the dominant consideration in framing his budget was to protect employment and curb inflation.  We know how little success he had with employment, while his only success in lowering prices was the application of the Fianna Fáil proposal, that is for food subsidies, which he had originally spurned.  Yesterday he seemed to have abandoned all pretence of being interested in the economy as a whole.  Certainly, that is the only way in which this budget can be understood.  Despite the fact that unemployment is at an all-time record level and that inflation is still dangerously high, the Minister brought in a budget which will not relieve, not arrest, but will aggravate both of these problems, the problems of unemployment and inflation.  I propose to demonstrate this to some extent.</P>
    <P>The tax increases which he introduced must have the effect of raising prices by up to 5 per cent.  That figure seems to have been generally accepted by all independent commentators since the budget was introduced.  As a result of that 5 per cent, the Minister's pre-budget estimate of a much lower inflation rate this year is now in need of drastic revision.  Taking the projection of perhaps an 11 per cent to 12 per cent rate of inflation this year, the effect of this added 5 per cent will be to bring up the rate of inflation, allowing for some possible decreases as a result of factors for which the Minister would not be responsible and could not claim credit.</P>
    <P>It would now seem that in 1976 prices will rise by at least 15 per cent.  This is hardly the sort of performance which will inspire confidence either in our own businessmen and workers or in any prospective overseas investors.  I sincerely hope for and support the pay pause the Government are seeking but adding to inflation in the way I have described must also raise serious question marks about the Government's <Col N="802" /> ability to secure a pay pause.  With prices rising at this rate, the real spending power of workers and consumers will be significantly reduced. Unfortunately, this is bound to intensify the pressure for higher pay rises.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to have recognised the problem which he created himself in this way with his proposal to introduce a price index which would include tax increases. That has received very adverse comment in at least one leading article in today's newspapers.  While there might be some case to be made for incomes not to rise in line with tax induced price increases in a period of economic difficulty, it would be totally unacceptable to allow any Government the apparent freedom to increase their share of the national cake in this way.  Such a power would mean that there would virtually be no limit on the extent to which the Government could increase their income, while reducing the amount of money remaining in the hands of the public. If the Minister and the Government want to secure a pay pause, they will have to do something other than engage in this form of statistical playacting. I believe no trade union could be expected to agree to give the Government the power they seem to seek by this device.</P>
    <P>The Government must produce some clear indication of the way in which the fruits of any restraint and sacrifice of living standards will be used to get the unemployed back to work.  This was the purpose of this budget, the stated purpose in advance. This is one crucial area in which this budget has failed more than any other.  The only way in which dole queues can be expected to change on the basis of yesterday's budget is that they will grow longer rather than shorter.  Some estimates suggest that the overall deflation resulting from the budget could add up to&mdash;I heard this in an economic comment on the radio this morning&mdash;20,000 more people in the ranks of the unemployed. I hope this is an upper figure which will not materialise.  Even if the increase were to be half that <Col N="803" /> amount, it would still mean a terrible addition to the misery and depression created in our society during the past two years.</P>
    <P>There was and still is an overwhelming duty on the Government to take action which will help the unemployment position.  Even modest amounts of public money, if used selectively, would have the effect of guaranteeing work for thousands. The Confederation of Irish Industry, and my colleague, Deputy Colley, in his pre-budget article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, suggested one way, that is, a limited relief of social insurance contributions by employers.  Far from giving any limited relief in this way, the Minister seems to have added to the burdens of our home-based industries.</P>
    <P>One could list many other means, in limited ways, of boosting employment at home.  One could list the ways in which the Government have neglected that opportunity: for example, the shameful lack of progress in constructing a smelter, or the shameful way in which orders for ships and furniture and Government printing have been allowed to provide jobs in other parts of the world, and not at home here where they are so desperately needed.  There are other ways in which efforts could be made to create jobs.  There is the case of housing.  Sooner or later the bluff of the Minister for Local Government will and must be called in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In a brash way he has been defending figures of housing output over the past three years of which, I repeat, he can claim little if any credit.  I want to refer back to my speech on the adjournment debate last December which he misquoted in reference to this problem. I said that in the late 1960s we had introduced an ordered housing construction programme which would produce 25,000 houses by 1973.  The Minister and his Coalition colleagues, in advance of the formation of the Coalition, said a crash programme <Col N="804" /> would be needed to reach that target. There was no such thing as a crash programme and, in fact, the output of 25,000 houses was reached as we had predicted it would.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately it went in the wrong direction.  Home ownership was depressed and the emphasis switched to local authority houses.  I commented on that at the time and said it was an undesirable trend.  I do not want to repeat what I said here yesterday.  I still believe it is an undesirable trend and that there is an inherent desire, an inherent ambition, an inherent aspiration in our people to own their own homes which this Government are deliberately depressing, and creating monster landlords in the form of local authorities.  It is not enough to say that the Minister has introduced a better system of house purchase by local authority tenants, welcome though it is.  Young married people who have the opportunity and the capacity for home ownership are being denied that prospect deliberately by the policy of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>May I revert again to the claim in regard to an output of 25,000 houses and repeat what I said?  If it takes a minimum of three years from the time the finances are arranged, the sites acquired, and the planning and other preliminaries completed, before the house is ultimately ready for occupation, last year the Minister for Local Government could claim no credit whatever for the 25,000 houses built in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they have abandoned the idea of raising the grants to a realistic level, there are perhaps other ways in which they could give young people, first-time owners or seekers of houses, the opportunity or doing so.  There is a compelling case for giving grants to first-time buyers of houses, because they are typically young married couples who have the greatest difficulty in raising the huge cash deposits which are now needed. However, these grants should be accompanied by an easier system of loan repayment.  If these grants were <Col N="805" /> accompanied, say, by a scheme of inflation-linked mortgages which would have the effect of keeping down the size of cash repayments in earlier years, the overall result would be to enable many thousands of people who cannot afford to buy homes at present to do so.  This would mean a very substantial boost to the construction industry which has been so depressed for the last couple of years, and especially in the past year, and in which so many people are at work.</P>
    <P>One other area in which the total absence of any action is both depressing and irresponsible is that of unemployed school leavers.  The Minister referred to the need for providing 30,000 new jobs between now and 1980.  But apart from increasing somewhat the amount of money available to the Industrial Development Authority, he has made no single tangible, immediate effort that would even put a dint in that huge total of 30,000 people annually looking for jobs.</P>
    <P>There are surely many forms of community service and many projects for community improvements in which young people could be engaged productively. Even a modest sum of £5 million would be sufficient to put some thousands of young people at work and would hold out some prospect that they could make a useful contribution to society.  As a practical illustration of what I have in mind, all over the country there is a crying need for community services, for community halls.  Many people are prepared to give their services voluntarily.  If young people were supplied with the materials and paid a modest weekly sum in providing these halls, not only would encouragement be given to young people, not only would the confidence be given to them that they were contributing to the community, but they would, on the way, provide a very essential need for which so many people are calling out. Above all, such action would demonstrate that the rest of the community were concerned for the young people's welfare and were willing to do something about it.</P>
    <P>While referring to young people, it may perhaps be relevant at this point <Col N="806" /> to note one of the disappointing omissions from yesterday's budget.  No increase whatever was made in the level of university grants.  Therefore students from lower income families already faced with difficulty in finding employment now find it still more difficult to gain entry to universities.</P>
    <P>There is also a disappointing and, I might say, frightening lack of concern in this budget for the future development of industry.  Investment in industry has been falling over the past two years, and the pre-budget forecasts were for a further fall this year.  This is a dangerous downward trend that must be reversed if the growth of the economy is not to be imperilled.  At present there is little incentive to invest in additional capacity since most firms are suffering from the problem of spare capacity.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one of our most important export industries and is yet another area which is bound to be hit by this budget. The combination of higher petrol, tobacco and alcohol prices will make the task of attracting more visitors, particularly from Britatin and the Continent, that much more difficult.  It could pay the touring visitor to go to the North first and stock up with the items he might need for the rest of his holiday which he might be disposed to spend in the South.  Here again positive proposals were put forward from this side of the House in this respect, perhaps not novel but at least put forward as a genuine effort and a genuine contribution to help this vital area in our economy.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was really serious in his claim to boost exports, then he could take action by boosting invisible exports through tourism.  It would be relatively simple, for example, to introduce some form of duty-free sales on cross-Channel sea and air services.  Another method of encouraging the car tourist would be to give coupons for a tax rebate, say, up to 50 gallons for every foreign registered car arriving at our ports.  Such a scheme, I suggest, would cost the Exchequer little if anything.  In fact, it would be quite possible for the total tax yield from tourists to increase, because in the absence of <Col N="807" /> attractions such as I have mentioned, the total number of visitors could unfortunately fall off substantially.</P>
    <P>The list could be added to, but the examples I have given and many others which my colleague, Deputy Colley, gave, and which have been given from time to time from this side of the House, are more than enough to demonstrate the total absence of any thought or planning to deal with the twin problems of inflation and unemployment.  In the Minister's budget last year, under the heading &ldquo;Medium-term outlook&rdquo; at column 1968, Volume 282, of the Official Report of 26th June, 1975, he said:</P>
    <P>In particular, we do not regard the taxation, subsidisation or employment premium measures as being needed&mdash;or, indeed, sustainable&mdash;for more than a very limited period of time.  There is the danger, however, that the solution they produce could be short-lived unless supported by policies over the medium term ahead aimed at maintaining the confidence restored, the stability regained and the renewed growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>Six months have elapsed.  What has become of the medium-term policy? What has become of the &ldquo;renewed growth, the confidence restored, and the stability regained&rdquo;?  Indeed, I might ask him specifically what has become of or what are the results of the employment premium which was announced with such a flourish here by the Minister and followed up by his colleague, the Minister for Labour?  There was not one reference to it in yesterday's budget.  Has it been a failure?  We supported and welcomed it.  We thought it was imaginative, but obviously the depression that has been created by the Government has offset whatever advantages this scheme otherwise might have had.  The only contribution to these hopes and promises was the sorry contribution we had yesterday, the total abdication of the Government when the Minister referred to the long-term economic plan.</P>
    <P>This has had a long history, even in <Col N="808" /> the short life of this Government.  The programmes introduced by Fianna Fáil in the late fifties and during the sixties were decried by the Opposition as being not imaginative or radical enough.  They were indeed modest, but they worked by and large, and these plans could be said to have laid the foundation for the extraordinary and, I might say by reference to the past, spectacular economic growth that was maintained through the sixties and early seventies.  We pressed on the Minister, almost since he came to office, the need for another economic programme. He scorned our suggestions and persistently said that in the climate then obtaining, which incidentally was much more positive and identifiable in its ingredients than those that now obtains, it was impossible to put forward any realistic plan.</P>
    <P>By last autumn he had a change of mind and announced the introduction of a programme before the end of the year, that was before 31st December, 1975.  We are now told that a Green Paper, a discussion paper, is to be published some time in the future.  This is another way of telling us that yet again this Coalition either does not know or cannot agree on the policies which ought to be pursued in the years ahead.  Therefore, instead of a Government plan you have to have a discussion paper, a paper of options which will, perhaps, invite open competition between trade unions, employers' organisations, farming bodies and others, to put forward plans, come to the Government's rescue by declaring a sound programme, and providing some policy for this bankrupt Coalition, bankrupt not only in the narrow financial sense, but also bankrupt of any ideas, or to a limited extent, ideals. At the rate this Government are drifting towards the kind of socialism to which I referred, there may be hidden somewhere in the background some kind of ideals in that direction.</P>
    <P>There are some commendable things about this budget, but commendable perhaps only because the Minister was driven to adopt them.  At least some attempt was made to pay the bills, to meet, to a very infinitesimal degree, current expenditure.  Little attempt was <Col N="809" /> made to pursue this magnificent social programme, which of course would be implemented by the Coalition.  No attempt was made to in some way save face in the light of débácle over equal pay.  On the contary, with the limited reliefs given by way of taxation, no tax relief whatever was given for married women.</P>
    <P>Some attempt was made to regularise unemployment assistance to some people who could afford to do without it.  That is commendable. However, these are short-term, hit and miss, little efforts being made by this Government, but again there will be no overall plan, no overall hope, nothing to restore the confidence of our people and our country in our economy.  With all this evidence of their total inability to provide the leadership which is needed, the only sensible course open to them is to resign before they are run out of office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I had intended dealing with other points in the budget, the failure to increase certain social welfare benefits, the maintenance allowance, the huge impost on car owners which will have so many repercussions not only on the owners themselves but on the motor industry as a whole. These matters I believe will be adequately dealt with by subsequent speakers from our side of the House. Overall, this budget, like its three predecessors, has been an abject failure and is something that this Government should be totally ashamed of and something which this country will not forgive them for a long long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary for me to go again into the same range of detail covered yesterday by the Minister for Finance in his comprehensive review in introducing the budget.  However, I should like to deal with a few of the salient features.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> The budget deals with Government expenditure of over £2,100 million on current and capital account.  Even this figure, massive as it is, does not reflect the full extent of public expenditure in its widest definition since it excludes expenditure financed by local authorities and the expenditure from the social insurance fund and from other sources.  However, it is the figure with which we are primarily concerned in this budget.</P>
    <P>In 1976 the gross national product is estimated by the ESRI at approximately £2,100 million before the changes which the budget proposes are taken into account.  Even, therefore, taking the budget figures as they are, the size of the influence it must exercise on the economy will be apparent.  It can swing the direction from growth to decline, or <i>vice versa.</i>  The Government have tried in what they have done to ensure that the effect of the budget will be to change the growth rate from the 1 per cent which it would have been without the budget changes to 2 per cent in 1976.  This of itself seems a modest aim.  On the other hand, when account is taken of the fact that the gross national product declined last year by 3 per cent in line with world conditions this swing would represent a significant turnabout in our fortunes.</P>
    <P>In considering, therefore, the effect which the budget will have on the economy there are, of course, many uncertainties largely indeed uncertainties similar to those which this country and most other countries experienced last year.  It depends on the speed and the strength of the upturn in the world economy which now at last seems to be under way, certainly in a number of countries, the evolution and pattern of incomes and the degree to which people will feel sufficiently confident to spend rather than to save. In assessing, therefore, the impact it is necessary to look at the total picture &mdash;the total amount of expenditure, current and capital, and its composition, and the way in which the total is financed through different forms of borrowing and through taxation.  It is not enough simply to focus attention on <Col N="811" /> the tax and expenditure changes as some commentators have done.  The Minister has given an estimate of the likely growth rate following the budget and subject to all the uncertainties that I have mentioned which, of course, last year proved completely incapable of precise or predictable assessment.  I think, however, we can be more confident this year than last year that the tentative rate will be attained.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been loud in their criticism of the level of borrowing over the last two years.  They have suggested that employment and output would be maintained if we had much lower levels of borrowing.  I want to put this straight to the House and to the country: there is no way in which employment could have been maintained at its existing level if the Government had not borrowed or had not provided the money from borrowing or from taxation.  It is accepted that we could not have taxed more heavily without adverse results, and it is recognised that we had gone as far as was reasonably possible in the extent to which we borrowed.  It is therefore not possible for the Opposition to have it both ways.  Indeed, I think they have overlooked the effect of the deflationary impact of external influences and the greatly increased cost of our imports and the international recession in demand.  On this subject, the OECD Survey of Ireland issued last November states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is clear that measures to expand domestic demand could not completely offset the powerful external recessionary influences.</P>
    <P>If this be true&mdash;and this is a survey by an outside organisation&mdash;what would have been the situation if we had failed to take the action we did, if we had opted for the unemployment-creating policy advocated by the Opposition? The Opposition have repeatedly stated, again in this House yesterday and again by the Leader of the Opposition in the House today, that we should not borrow, but immediately after these sentences are used they suggest spending more on a variety of projects.  I will come to those in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> There are only certain resources from which money can be got by the Exchequer.  It can be raised by taxation and it can be raised by borrowing, whether the borrowing is on the domestic market or on the foreign market.  The only other alternative which Fianna Fáil did not say but which is implied by their criticism, is that the Government should print the money.  We reject that policy.  We reject any attempt to water down the value of our currency.  Our policy has been to avoid imposing hardships which might well be unnecessary.  Regrettably, the expectations of an international recovery which we shared with so many distinguished authorities, because we accepted the experts in these international organisations who commented on the economies of different countries last year, proved premature. At the same time the pattern of wages and salaries was not in accordance with the requirements of the national interest.</P>
    <P>We recognise that an international recovery will go far to eliminate the need for so substantial a fiscal stimulus while also helping, in itself, to restore a more normal and acceptable pattern of public finance.  Incomes restraint would also, of course, help to this end both directly and by helping to restore the confidence of consumers, the weakness of which depressed revenue receipts last year.  This sluggishness in consumer demand also contributed to the shortfall from the economic growth target of last year's budget.</P>
    <P>The Opposition yesterday and for some considerable time have endeavoured to have it both ways.  They have criticised borrowing and at the same time have advocated additional expenditure. They have also opposed the increases in taxation which were proposed yesterday by the Minister for Finance and which were designed specifically to keep the borrowing requirement from reaching an unacceptable level.  It is interesting that yesterday in a pre-budget comment in an article in a newspaper Deputy Colley referred to the reduction in the opening current deficit and suggested in that article that the range of reduction <Col N="813" /> which would be acceptable was within that on which the budget was finally framed. although yesterday in the afternoon he changed his approach to this, and this morning the Leader of the Opposition critised borrowing but in the course of his speech&mdash;and this is typical of the Opposition&mdash;month after month, week after week, day after day, on Dáil questions and in debates, on motions put down by the Opposition&mdash;suggested extra money for everything. The Opposition lead the demands which so many other sections of the community express, that the Government should spend more on this, more on that and provide more money for different projects, some of them ill thought out, some of them worthy projects, but at the same time the Government are neither to borrow more nor to raise the money by taxation. They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>This morning here the Leader of the Opposition suggested&mdash;I have taken a short note of them&mdash;a sum of £5 million for employment for school leavers, an undefined sum for housing grants and a loan scheme, an undefined sum for university grants, an unspecified sum for the relief of industry from social welfare payments, and an unspecified sum for industrial incentives. These are all in addition to the expenditure already enshrined in the budget. It cannot be done.  The Opposition must recognise that the only source the Government has&mdash;and this is what the Government have tried to get across&mdash;is to raise the money either by taxation or by borrowing.  If we are criticised on one hand for the level of borrowing and opposed on the other hand when we try to raise the money by taxation, how is the money to be got?  That applies to the Opposition's queries and it also applies to the demands from different groups throughout the country.  It is not possible in our circumstances at the present time to meet the demands, however laudable many of them are, however desirable from every point of view some of them may be.  The proposals made here this morning by the Opposition, if accepted, would mean that our taxation would have to be three or four times the level proposed in yesterday's budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> The policy which the Government are operating is one designed to deal with the important problems affecting the country.  Our programme is designed to generate maximum public expenditure in order to help in particular the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We have approached the unemployment problem from two angles.  We have increased public expenditure to produce the type of expansion of demand in our economy which would help the unemployed, and for those unfortunate enough to lose their work we have increased unemployment payments to a degree which shelters the individual from the worst monetary effects of his misfortune.  The present budget continues that policy and develops that strategy.  The reality, however, is that in a period of world recession such as we now have what any one country can do to ameliorate unemployment is limited.  With this country it is more limited than with many others.  In normal times our imports and exports are equivalent in value to more than 90 per cent of all we produce.  This means that we are more vulnerable to external influences than any economy in western Europe. If export markets are bad because of a general recession, our ability to export &mdash;affecting almost 40 per cent of gross national product&mdash;comes into question. If the recession is bad, other countries keeping costs down can sell their goods here at prices which, without unfair practices, complete strongly with what we produce at home for our own markets.  Both of these factors must bear strongly on what any Government &mdash;or indeed the community as a whole here&mdash;can do about unemployment.</P>
    <P>However, despite these disabilities and acknowledging the heavy and regrettable toll that unemployment is exacting, I think it would be useful to put on record, for comparison purposes, some account of what is happening elsewhere.  I should like to give some comparisons to the House regarding conditions in other countries, the extent to which unemployment has risen in other countries, and the effect that rise has had on the economies of the western world, and far beyond it. Between December, 1973, and December, 1975, unemployment in <Col N="815" /> France rose by 71 per cent; in Germany, the strongest single economy in the western world, it rose by 181 per cent; in the United Kingdom it went up by 134 per cent while in Denmark it rose by 457 per cent.  Here the corresponding figure was an increase of 64 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are many qualifications to be made in comparing figures like this. The method of counting unemployment, and the method by which figures are compiled, are different in all countries.  The composition of the labour force is different, the structure of the economies is different.  In particular, the coverage of the figures is different.  We started from a high base &mdash;in that the percentage of our labour force unemployed in 1973 was already comparatively high by international standards.  But this was a problem which the Government inherited: we did not make it.  The figures I have quoted make the point, and make it forcibly, that bad and all as our unemployment is&mdash;and I make no effort to extenuate it or to suggest that it is not serious&mdash;it is by no means an isolated phenomenon.  Compared with countries with much greater resources and stronger economies than ours, such as France and Germany, we have fared better.</P>
    <P>We can get our unemployment down if we invest in methods, machinery and infrastructure that make our goods competitive.  We are doing this on a massive scale.  It is part of the basic strategy of the budget to shift resources into areas which can create self-sustaining employment.  I will come later to the money we have put into the construction industry.  In the budget we have provided a substantial increase for industrial training through AnCO. It will be increased from £6 million in 1975 to over £10 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for an investment in the development of our mineral resources which will yield, it is hoped, a handsome return over the years and help to ensure the exploitation of these resources in the best interests of the country.  The allocation for industry in the public capital programme has been <Col N="816" /> increased by 71 per cent and this year accounts for almost 26 per cent of the total programme, as compared with about 19 per cent last year.  The capital provision for industrial promotion by the IDA, SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann is being increased by one-third. A substantial provision of £37 million is being made towards the building of NET's fertiliser plant in Cork Harbour which will ensure self-sufficiency in our nitrogen requirements until well into the eighties and will make a significant contribution towards reducing our adverse balance of payments.  This plant will, as Deputies know, use natural gas from the Kinsale Head field as feedstock.  In this way, processing of our natural resources will give rise to considerable employment and other economic benefits.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties of the past few years, the number of new industrial jobs inherent in grant approvals of the Industrial Development Authority has been of the order of 20,000 or more annually.  In 1975 alone, the IDA activity resulted in projects with a job potential of about 17,000, with planned investment in new industrial projects both from private and public sources of the order of £300 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley suggested yesterday that there was some doubt about the continuance of the tax-free concession on exports.  I do not know how he embarked on that but it is appropriate to deal with it now.  It is possible that his reason for the comment was because the Minister for Finance referred to it in his budget speech.  I should like to make it absolutely clear that there is no intention of withdrawing export tax reliefs or interfering with them in any way. The legislation to provide the export tax relief was originally introduced by a Government of which I was a member.  At the time it was described by a Government of which I was a member.  At the time it was described by an independent commentator, Professor Carter, the Jevons Professor of political economy at Queen's University, as the biggest single factor in getting this country into the export market.  The fact that it was introduced by a Government of which I was a member 20 years ago confirms us in our belief that it was a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> In that connection I should like to add that the other major contributing factor to industrial expansion was the establishment, by a Government with which I was also associated, of the Industrial Development Authority. These two statutory measures, the establishment of the IDA and the tax-free concessions on exports, have, between them, provided, with other assistance, the major incentives and contributions towards industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>We live in a world in which population is rising rapidly.  Food production is failing to keep pace.  While many of those living in developing countries currently lack the means to buy food in the market, the future is likely to be bright for countries which are able to produce and market high quality food at competitive prices.  In this country, we enjoy many climatic and other advantages for agricultural production.  We now have the benefits of assured markets and remunerative prices under the common agricultural policy, properly managed.  If we are to raise our growth rate, we will have to make the best of these assets and exploit the potential for development that lies in our agriculture. The potential returns on investment by efficient farmers are high and it is primarily a matter for farmers themselves to seize the opportunities open to them.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to give them every encouragement.  Our commitment in this regard is shown by the substantial increases in the provisions for agriculture in this budget which show increases of 20 per cent on the current side and 25 per cent on the capital programme. We have, of course, taken certain steps which will affect the incomes received by some farmers as supplements to their incomes from farming. These steps, we believe, should not affect production.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in that regard that for many years there was criticism of the manner in which this assistance or these payments were made&mdash;criticism, but no action taken to deal with it.  Deputies will recall that some years ago when Deputy Brennan was Minister <Col N="818" /> for Social Welfare he introduced a proposal to deal with it and there was a mini-revolt in Fianna Fáil.  One member left the party and another made a speech in which he made it plain that he would not vote for the change.  It was abandoned.  Yesterday for the first time we took steps to deal with what, in some respects, is an unjustified extension of the scheme as originally contemplated.  There were a few comments across the floor to the effect that we had not said this in the recent West-Mayo by-election.  Fianna Fáil are always selective in what they say to their audiences, selective in the comments they make.  When they are talking to business people or shopkeepers, of course they criticise these benefits, but when they were in Ballycroy, Achill, Belmullet or Bangor Erris, they were all for them.</P>
    <P>What we have done does not interfere with the legitimate entitlement of people in Ballycroy or Achill or Erris or any other part of the country: we have stopped the abuse Fianna Fáil had not the courage to deal with.  These changes are in line with the Government's policy of ensuring that money is spent in the right direction to supplement and assist and to provide the incentive to farmers who wish to increase production.</P>
    <P>This scheme will assist farm investment by helping to promote and assist farmers who live on uneconomic holdings and who need a supplement to expand investment.  As a result of the measures we have taken we are reinforcing the increase in farm investment during 1976 which should be still further stimulated by the sharp recovery in farm incomes and the current and prospective prices for farm produce.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that a number of the problems facing us are more difficult than at any period in our history.  In addition to the worldwide recession through which we are going and the troubled and continuously disturbed state of Northern Ireland, there are demographic factors built into our society which make our present stage of transition from an agricultural community to one based largely on industry and services a period of unparalleled difficulty. <Col N="819" /> I do not want to imply by what I have said that these developments in industry and agriculture are sufficient to get us over these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Both industry and agriculture and indeed development generally need much more than the mere payment of grants and loans from the State.  It hardly needs emphasis that of the £300 million of new industrial investment which I mentioned just now, the State will be providing only some £65 million in grants.  The remainder must be raised, by the promoters, from various sources, including company funds, private investors and State or bank loan finance.  These other sources of finance&mdash;indeed the very will to expand investment&mdash;can exist only if conditions for investment are right: by this I mean only if there is a full appreciation in the community of the necessity for investment and the environment in which it can flourish if employment is to be sustained and the prosperity we all seek attained.</P>
    <P>This means different things at different times, but obviously now it means that above everything else the demand for the goods and services to be produced as a result of investment must be there.  In times such as the present when recession is deep and world-wide, consumers are highly selective as to the price and design of articles they are being pressed to buy: and countries or companies or traders which do not complete on these criteria simply go out of business.</P>
    <P>How have we fared in the past year in our selling efforts abroad? In 1975, the markets in which we sell are estimated to have declined by just under 8 per cent in volume.  This is a significant fall, and if it had been translated into our exports they too would have fallen by a like amount.  But though they did drop in volume the fall was a great deal smaller than the decline in the markets in which we were selling. In other words despite what was one of the most difficult years ever faced by workers and manufacturers in this country we more than maintained our relative position.  Part of this is <Col N="820" /> due of course to the very substantial increase in agricultural exports, but even if we isolate industrial goods they too show up comparatively favourably.</P>
    <P>If this is so it may well be asked why the Government are seeking a pause in the rise in incomes, as part of their strategy of which this budget is part.  The answer is twofold.</P>
    <P>First, we have up to now been protected from the full effects of the growth in incomes here by the depreciation in the value of sterling to which our pound is linked, and by a rise in costs in the United Kingdom which has been of the same order of magnitude as the rise here.  We can no longer rely on these ephemeral and extraneous forms of protection.</P>
    <P>Second, over the past year in particular, pay has risen here by a great deal more than in most of the countries with which we trade.  This is a significant and most important aspect of our whole approach to our request for a pay pause to the social parties.  Hourly earnings in manufacturing in 1975 are estimated to have gone up by more than three times the percentages by which they rose in Germany and the United States.  At the same time, industrial output is estimated to have fallen by 7 per cent.  There could hardly be two sets of statistics more indicative of a need to get output more into line with earnings.  If we take these two statistics together, there could hardly be any more convincing evidence of the need to get output in line with earnings.</P>
    <P>That is why, basically, the budget introduced by the Minister aims at a strategy of increasing growth from the 1 per cent which it would have been if no change had been made, to the 2 per cent it will be if the strategy is successful.  The budget has a large distributive element&mdash; in that it attempts to protect from the worst effects of inflation those most in need of protection.  It has also, as I have tried to emphasise in what I have been saying, a heavy concentration on forms of investment in industry and agriculture, which can <Col N="821" /> only be of benefit to the future growth of our economy.  However, the budget itself is part only of the strategy necessary for us to pull out of our present difficulties.  The rest must come from the community itself.</P>
    <P>Let me say now that if those in receipt of incomes try to compensate themselves for changes in taxation made in the budget, our efforts to achieve our objectives of growth and redistribution will be frustrated. But over and above this consideration, which is serious enough, there is the overriding consideration that, as surely as the sun rises, persons now at work will lose their jobs and the already intolerable level of unemployment in our country will increase even further.  I do not think that any individual would wish this consequence on himself.  I think it would be even more short-sighted for any organisation devoted to the interests of the workers to take on itself responsibility for decisions which can only have the consequences I mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is evidence&mdash;I think it is accepted by all who look at the thing calmly&mdash;that the benefits of moderation are clearly recognised by the people.  Recently there was a public opinion survey carried out, after I and my colleagues met the Congress of Trade Unions and the other groups in the social partners, and that survey showed that six out of ten persons interviewed favoured the Government's proposal that those in jobs should not press for any further increase in pay until the end of this year, apart from the payment of the final instalment of the current national wage agreement, and those with non-pay incomes should accept a similar restraint.  From the same survey it was found that two out of every three full-time employees interviewed were willing to accept a pay pause provided all those concerned accept a similar pause.  That, of course, is what we have proposed.</P>
    <P>It is true that this will involve a small reduction for a relatively short period in the incomes of those who <Col N="822" /> receive increases under the national pay agreement.  It is no harm to point out that those who received these increases have fared well from the point of view of their living standards. This is shown by the average earnings of those working in mining and manufacturing which includes and is biassed downwards, to some extent, by those workers whose employers were unable to pay the various instalments under the terms of the national pay agreement.  If we look at the purchasing power of these earnings, that is the amount earnings rose above the CPI we see that between March, 1973, and June, 1975, purchasing power rose in that period by 16 per cent.  A pause now, therefore, will help their fellow workers who are either unemployed or who did not get these increases, and such a pause will leave room for these to get the standard increases.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the proposals we have included in the budget are designed to stimulate production.  A number of comments have been made here criticising certain aspects of public expenditure.  I want to make it clear that we have framed our expenditure in what are considered the most advantageous areas from the point of view of providing employment. There was implied this morning in the speech by the Leader of the Opposition a suggestion that we should not have built as many houses as we have built and that the money should have been invested elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that.  There is now a tenant purchase scheme so that people can own their own homes.  I do not think there is any conflict on the desirability of providing houses.  I believe everyone is in favour of home ownership, but it is quite obvious that a great many people who go to building societies or other financial institutions are outside the range of those who are catered for by local authorities.  Let me give now some facts about our achievement in respect of houses because this is, I believe, one of the areas in which the policy of the Government has been particularly successful.</P>
      <P>In addition to the private housing funds flowing to the building societies, insurance companies and banks, and invested by them in the housing programme, we have for the past three years in succession maintained conditions in which the output of houses could continue at a high level.  The final figures for last year are not yet available, but all the indications are that the figure will be over 25,000 houses.  In other words, for the three-year period ending 31st December last we will have seen more houses built than in any corresponding period since the foundation of the State, representing in that short period more than 75 per cent of the total number of houses built in the ten years between 1960 and 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme, as I said, represents a massive investment in the basic social infrastructure in providing homes and accommodation for our people.  The point was made&mdash;it was mentioned a short time ago&mdash;that we should somehow adapt the provisions of the house purchase scheme operated by local authorities.  This is an area in which the State can play a role in furthering investment. The public capital programme exists because it is needed not to supplant but to support private investment in certain areas.  The housing drive has been going at an unprecedented rate and has been assisted by an unprecedented flow of funds into those organisations making loans available for house purchase.  In 1974 the building societies had a net increase in <Col N="824" /> the amount deposited with them in shares and so on of a sum just short of £30 million, and most of this money was available to them for issue in house purchase loans.  In 1975 the corresponding figure at approximately £70 million is more than twice as high.  It is obvious that where there is a flow of capital like this there is not the same pressure on the State, which is already hard-pressed to provide capital to invest in other projects, to supplement the market&mdash;individuals themselves through their own resources, whether through the banks, the building societies or insurance companies, are providing a massive increase in resources for private housing investment without actual State intervention.</P>
    <P>It is essential in considering a budget that we should look at the inescapable obligations on the State which were referred to yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  One such obligation is in the area of security.  The total State expenditure on security for the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice in this current year is over £158 million.  The Minister for Finance referred yesterday to the waste, and indeed worse, resulting from the violence in Northern Ireland and to the necessity here to counter the efforts of violent men in the campaign for which they are responsible.  The strain this is imposing on our society can be gauged to some extent from the fact that the combined total of the Defence and Justice Votes in 1976 is greater than the proposed State investment both on current and capital account in housing.  It is true, I think, that patriotism has long since ceased to have any meaning when those professing it can produce distortions like this.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the story does not end there.  The consequential effect of violence in purely economic terms, in loss of life and damage to person and property, in loss of tourism, investment and business, is even more serious than the figures I have quoted. I have quoted these figures merely to indicate to the House the extent of voted expenditure on security to show the Government's determination to pursue relentlessly and campaign against <Col N="825" /> those guilty of political violence in our society wherever they come from or whatever their motives.</P>
    <P>The amount of money they may spend on this or that Department is not necessarily a criterion of the extent to which the Government attaches a particular importance to a certain sphere.  The very substantial increase in the provision for a particular purpose is naturally a good thing in itself, but the extra finances add to the total pool of public expenditure.  As I said, some of this expenditure might possibly be encouraged by a Department in other directions rather than by direct State or Exchequer subvention. From a national point of view the money may be better left in private hands than spent by the State.  While this is expressed as a general view by columnists and commentators, the fact is that when we take each group in the community and put them all together, each section is demanding more and more from the State. These are the people who are very often strongest in their condemnation of Government borrowing or the level of taxation.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear in the course of this debate that neither the Opposition nor any group in the community can have it both ways. The amount of money needed can only be raised in a very limited area, by either borrowing or taxation, if increased demands are to be made for this or that service.  As the Minister for Finance said yesterday, there is no free service available; somebody must pay.  It is important to get our priorities right.  One aspect of this which has been welcomed and which has been supported in different parts of the House is the extra money being provided for education&mdash;about one-quarter.  Much of this will go on public service pay. Education is, above all, a labour intensive service.  It is obvious from the demands being made from many quarters, including the Leader of the Opposition, that the large increase of £1 million extra per week is not regarded as sufficient.</P>
    <P>The same comment could be made for many other services.  Allocations <Col N="826" /> of public money are governed now more than ever by the limit of the resources available to us.  This is the point I have been emphasising. The State cannot, without grave damage to the economy, continue to absorb more of its total resources through borrowings, charges for services or taxation.  In a year in which the consumer price index is estimated to rise by a considerably smaller proportion, an increase of approximately 25 per cent in the provision for education represents a significant increase in resources devoted to this most essential service.</P>
    <P>Since 1972-1973, the total provision for the health and social welfare votes and payments from the social insurance fund, taking into account the further improvements now proposed, will have increased by almost 280 per cent.  Individual rates of benefit for old age pensions, unemployment and disability payments again taking into account the improvements proposed in the budget, will have increased by various amounts, generally in the range of 95 to 100 per cent, although there are percentage increases above and below these limits.</P>
    <P>During the same period the increase in the cost of living has been approximately 60 per cent.  Some of the extra expenditure is due, of course, to the assumption by the Exchequer of certain health charges from local authorities. It is well to emphasise this.  The House will recall that in December, 1972, the then Government published a White Paper on rates and said that after an assessment had been made of this, and as far as the Government could see ahead, rates would continue to be a major source of revenue for local authorities.  Subsequently there was a belated promise in the course of the general election in February, 1973, that there had been a change of mind. One has to assess the carefully prepared and documented White Paper and compare it with a promise made in the heat of the election.  As a result of the decisions taken by this Government in the last three years, rates are now £4.50 in the £less than if we had not transferred the health and <Col N="827" /> housing charges from the rates to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Part of the increase in respect of social welfare and health charges is due to certain anomalies and abuses to which the Minister for Finance referred yesterday.  In that connection, we announced that action would be taken to deal with the fact that some payments combined with redundancy, pay-related and social welfare payments gave certain recipients more than they would have if they were employed. In the course of his remarks on this, Deputy Colley referred to the application of the proposed 85 per cent limit on unemployment benefit and to the fact that 100 per cent of these payments would be counted by local authorities in assessing differential rents.  He seemed to consider that this would discriminate against lower paid workers.  I find it hard to follow the logic of this because there are already built into the schemes many provisions designed to help those in need.  Taking those provisions into account, there is no reason either in logic or in equity why income derived in one form as against another should not be counted in the same way.  It is obvious that £1 received in pay-related benefit will buy precisely the same amount of goods as £1 received in pay.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been expressed on the extent of the tax increases in petrol and cars.  The first and most obvious reason for this is the need for balancing the Exchequer income and expenditure, and the second lies with the need to encourage economy in the use of petrol and petroleum products.  It is significant to note that petroleum improts have increased from £67 million in 1973 to about £200 million in 1975, despite the depressed state of the economy.  So far as the car tax is concerned, Deputies will notice that the increase in the consumer price index since the tax was last increased has been more than 50 per cent, in other words, the tax because the rate was fixed was falling in real terms. This is not necessarily a reason for increasing the burden in any particular case, but the present conditions leave the Government with little option so far as this tax is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> As I have said, we have framed this budget on the basis that it is designed to meet our present needs. No really creditable alternative has been proposed against it.  I mentioned earlier the fact that not merely the Opposition but also many sections of the community demand more for this or that purpose.  Indeed, suggestions were made again this morning by the Leader of the Opposition, without specifying how much money they would cost or where the money was to come from.  The proposals amounted to this: &ldquo;Spend more, but do not borrow, do not tax, print the money.&rdquo; We reject that philosophy.  Our aim is to enable this country to face up to the problems which effect it in this year, a very critical time on our history.</P>
    <P>We have been faced with a recession of unparalleled severity and magnitude.  We have individually, for reasons which I need not go into, been slow to adapt ourselves psychologically to the effect of this recession, but the effects are there for everyone to see.  Our unemployment has risen.  Many firms have gone out of business.  The entire country has suffered a deeper and more prolonged onslaught from economic and, indeed, quasi-political forces, than at any time in our generation.  But we have kept the rate of investment in industrial and other forms of infrastructure reasonably high and we have a good base of modern well-equipped industry. Our agriculture is relatively buoyant.  In a world where population growth is increasing pressure on resources of food, we, as a major food producer, must prosper.  We have begun to see some of the fruits of the development of our minerals and natural gas.</P>
    <P>These are the prospects for our future, but in the one vital area of industrial and service costs, we can do ourselves grievous harm by seeking to continue to pay ourselves too much for what we produce.  The choice is ours.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said yesterday, no one will provide us with a living.  No one else will make the choice for us. We must make it ourselves.  We can <Col N="829" /> go ahead, as we have been doing, paying ourselves too much in income increases unrelated to reality, and see unemployment increase to an even more critical level.  Or we can, for a reasonable period, exercise moderation in income increases both as individuals and as a nation.</P>
    <P>The Government will see that sacrifices are equitably shared as between the different sections of the community and conditions in which investment and employment can increase will be encouraged.  This is what the budget is about.  This is what it is designed to do.  I do not think any reasonable individual, faced with the choices I have mentioned, would hesitate to adopt and support the course we have adopted.  The budget is based on the assumption that the course of restraint will be chosen and that the perception and good sense of the Irish people will lead them to accept a temporary moderation in the present standards in the interests of future prosperity.</P>
    <P>There is no alternative to these proposals. No sound alternative has been proposed.  Of course there has been criticism.  Every section which is affected inevitably will criticise.  The criticism has been fanned and led and induced in every way possible by the Opposition.  There is no alternative of any kind that can get the country out of the situation in which it is.  Nobody has any confidence in the Opposition, but there is ample evidence that there is massive confidence in the capacity, the determination and the leadership of the Government to bring this country out of its present problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget can be described as a tragedy for the people who must face the taxation and deprivation imposed by it.  The Taoiseach tried to excuse the high rate of unemployment by referring to the growth of unemployment in some of the EEC countries.  He admitted that we started off with rather a high rate.  That, surely, is the understatement of the year.  He referred to outside influences and said the problem was not their fault because they inherited it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will not face the fact that they have bungled.  During <Col N="830" /> the past three years they went on a rake's progress and today we have a doomsday situation here.  The Taoiseach and the Government should admit they have blundered and thump their breast and say <i>mea culpa.</i> They will not do that.  Outside influences will be blamed and, of course, there are outside influences.  The Fianna Fáil Opposition will also be blamed.  Everybody will be blamed except the Government, who are almost solely to blame for the fact that since 1973 they have been without any definite policy.  They seem to make up a policy as they go along.  At the end of this year the cost of servicing our national debt will be no less than £300 million. When we think that, we realise the mess we are in.</P>
    <P>The budget has had various effects on people this morning and the general effect was depression and hopelessness. To paraphrase Goldsmith's poem &ldquo;The Deserted Village&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey, where debt accumulates and men decay&rdquo;. Men are decaying.  Recently I saw scenes in the city reminiscent of the 1930s, with men standing at the corners because there are no jobs for them.  Consider the disappointment of young boys and girls leaving school who know almost certainly that they will not be able to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>Three years ago at the time of the presidential election which they sought so hard to win, we warned the Government that they were giving out largesse without making any attempt to produce growth in the national economy.  They pretended that they could spend as they liked and they would not have to account for it. Today the people have to pay for their reckless pursuit of popularity.  The Government have lost their battle to develop the economy, and they have also lost in the popularity stakes.  If by some good fortune an election were to be held now, the Government know they would be swept out of office.  I suppose it would be too much good fortune to ask that the Government would hold an election.  An election may be forced on the Government by a revolt amongst some of their members which has been brewing for some time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> While I do not worry about the downfall of the Government, I worry these days about the credibility of politicians because of the attitude of members of the Fine Gael and Labour parties on some fundamental issues. Only a year ago members of the Labour Party stood on public platforms and praised the Government on their attitude to the emancipation or liberation of women&mdash;an over-used phraseology.  They praised the Government's stand on their commitment to advance the rights of women.  They blew trumpets about equal pay, and now the Government find themselves in such a mess that they cannot honour their commitment.  These same politicians can say on television, on the radio and in the newspapers: &ldquo;Under no circumstances will I vote for any Government measure which will deprive women of equal pay for equal work,&rdquo; and after a day or two they can say: &ldquo;If a suitable amendment is put down in the House here I will vote for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when the Government introduced legislation which affects the Six Counties, such as the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, and when Deputies can come into this House and oppose it and then vote for it, we are reaching an all-time low in political integrity.  This is having a dire effect on our people, who are losing their faith in politicians, not because they have failed as economists or because they have failed to carry out their 14 promises as laid down in their election manifesto three years ago but because they have rated the intelligence of the people so low that people will not accept that they are politically honest any more.</P>
    <P>In looking at the country and at this budget debate here, we think of the woman who appeared in the advertisement, who visits her son who is in prison and says: &ldquo;Son, where did you go wrong?&rdquo;  We can ask the same of the Minister for Finance this morning: &ldquo;Where did he go wrong?&rdquo;  The Minister knows, as do the Taoiseach and the entire Fine Gael and Labour Parties, that they have taken the wrong path.  It will take another Government <Col N="832" /> to clear up the mess we are in and to relieve the burdens placed on people who cannot bear them any more.  This Government know in their hearts and souls that they have made mistakes.  They have no policy for a national recovery and therefore we are going to drift on and on until perhaps the end of their political term, and the Government that comes in then will have to start on the road back to sanity which this Government have left over the last three years.</P>
    <P>Take industrial relations or human relations, if you like to call them that. The Government are now suggesting a pay pause.  I remember the abuse which would spew from the Labour Party benches if Fianna Fáil even mentioned a pay pause in their day, how they screeched and tried to get the trade unions to revolt.  I say &ldquo;tried&rdquo;, because the Labour Party influence with the trade unions is far from high.  It will be far lower when the Government try to enforce a pay pause, and they will have to try to enforce it because they have fallen back on what they considered the easiest way to correct the imbalance in trade, unemployment, and so on by saying: &ldquo;Cut the workers' wages. Let us have cheap labour and then we will have cheap products.&rdquo;  This new concept is all they can think of, and they have the audacity to compare our situation with that of our EEC colleagues when what we want is not a cutback on wages but an injection of capital to ensure that production goes up.  It is not what a man is paid that counts.  With production properly geared, wages will be a secondary consideration.</P>
    <P>That is the secret of the success of our EEC neighbours and the fact that they have such a high standard of living, and that their wages are far higher than ours.  When visiting Strasbourg a few years ago I marvelled at the people in France, in neighbouring Germany, in Italy and Switzerland when I saw the standard of living they had compared with ours.  It was an object lesson in good management. Those Governments had their problems, too, but the people had the will to work hard and overcome their difficulties. <Col N="833" /> They are grappling with their problems and reducing their rate of inflation, which we are not doing.  The fabric of their economic structure is not being damaged as ours is being damaged.  They have industrial problems but not industrial relations problems as we have.</P>
    <P>On industrial relations, the Taoiseach must face problems with his Minister in regard to a voluntary pay pause.  His first action should be to declare the Department of Labour a disaster area and to make the necessary changes there, whether political or merely administrative.  The Government are facing an enormous problem if they are going to try to force through a pay pause.</P>
    <P>One can see in the change in the pay-related benefits scheme the start of a cutback on social services.  I do not want to be a Jonah or a prophet of doom, but I warn the Government that if they continue on this path for a pay pause and a cutback in social welfare payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister very patiently yesterday evening. I did not laugh at the Minister or with him.  The situation is much too serious for that now.  I say to both Ministers in the House that they are imposing on the working force, the people who still have jobs, the onus of paying for the 120,000 who are out <Col N="835" /> of jobs and the Ministers are doing nothing to increase the working force. Therefore the burden becomes greater all the time, and the Government have the audacity to suggest a pay pause. The Minister should be a realist and recognise this is just not on.  I do not believe that he is so gullible as to believe that he can convince the Trade Union Congress that this budget will be conducive to people accepting a voluntary pay pause nor indeed will the Trade Union Congress be gullible.  We know that the Trade Union Congress will act responsibly. I have sufficient faith in them to do that.  How can the Minister glibly talk about a pay pause in the present circumstances without any inducement to people to increase production?  The real source of their trouble is lack of production and not the high wages that are paid.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister boasted this morning about progress in the construction industry, particularly as regards houses.  The Minister said that in the last three years more houses were built than ever before. The people in the heavy construction industry have repeatedly challenged the Minister for Local Government on the figures he gives for housing output, but I am going to accept them to this extent, that if more houses are being built, that is good.  However, how can more houses be built when there are over 22,000 construction building workers unemployed?  In this city alone there are about 8,000 people in that trade unemployed.  The number of houses built is a prime factor, but I suggest that the number of people on the housing waiting list is the real test of the success of any housing drive.  I talk about the city because I represent an area of it.  The figures are not falling to any great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a fortnight ago the Minister for Local Government had the audacity to remove the State grants on new houses, and he said yesterday the Government saved £750,000 on that.  What about the young couples who are trying to buy their own houses, where the maximum <Col N="836" /> loan is £4,500 and the minimum price of a house £7,000, and if a man earns more than £2,300 a year he will not be given a grant?  Yet we hear the boast here this morning of the success of the Government's plans in the housing drive.  It is a mockery of good Government and this situation is getting worse all the time.</P>
    <P>There are old people in the city, and I am sure in other large urban areas, who are living in frightful conditions and who apply with all hope to a local authority for a house or a flat.  The local representatives, including the Ministers, will do their best by making representations to have these people housed, and yet we know in our hearts and souls that many of them will never be properly housed because they will have passed on before we can provide a sufficiency of accommodation for them and so they remain in the garrets, or in the cellers, for that matter.  Do the Government realise their tremendous need?  If one takes the withdrawal of State grants it is a strange, tragic way of trying to produce greater production in the housing drive.  If the Government will state now how much money Dublin Corporation will be giving for housing this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but he will appreciate that going into detail on matters appertaining to local government would not be appropriate in this budget debate which deals with taxation and economic policy.  Details in respect of local government are for another occasion, presumably the Estimate on Local Government proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but I thing I am right in what I am saying.  However if we take the national housing problem, the same tale can be told.  The Government have continued in this airy fairy cavalier fashion.  The whole tragedy of this Government is that they will not listen.  They pride themselves on being the Government of all talent but the figure of 120,000 unemployed explodes that myth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, what do we tell the <Col N="837" /> young people leaving school?  Our educational grants are insufficient. After the sacrifices made by parents to educate young people, what hope is there for them?  Yet it does not take great imagination to think of what could be done for these young people.  The State could introduce a scheme to give these young people extra education and to give their parents some allowance for them, even to the extent of giving them children's allowances until such time as they get work.  Young people are full of goodwill and eager to work.  Yet we have to tell them nothing can be done for them.  The opening of new centres by AnCO is all to the good, but the number of people in training will not top the 5,000 mark.  Fifty thousand school leavers are looking for some hope, but there is no leadership from the Government.  Every Government has problems today.  This Government's biggest problem is that they cannot see themselves as a very inept and inefficient Government.  We have the lofty posterings and the speeches of the Minister but no action.  Every week the total of unemployment grows.  In order to rejuvenate the national economy it is necessary to start with the construction industry. There is no hope in that direction now because the Government, even prior to the budget, had begun to cut back on money for housing.  There are thousands of people waiting to be properly housed and at the same time more building craftsmen are going out of employment every week. The Government should take a hard look at themselves and at their policies.  What small state like ours can go on such a wanton course to political bankruptcy and hope to build a progressive and prosperous society?  The Government must amend their policies.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to discover what the Government's policy is.  We used to accuse the Fine Gael Party of going left or the Labour Party of going right.  Now we say that both of them are going wrong.  Here and in other places of public assembly the Labour Party speak about socialism but generally what we get is outdated nineteenth century socialism which has <Col N="838" /> been discarded by Europe long ago. They trot out all the old clichés about nationalising the banks or nationalising land.  I do not imagine that that would be an answer to our ills, but I do notice that there is no mention anywhere in the budget of nationalising banks or anything else.  Perhaps it is just as well.  The people who a few years ago promised us socialism in the seventies have given us disaster in the seventies.  I do not know whether that is a condemnation of capitalism or of socialism but it certainly is a condemnation of the Government. The Government should realise that the people are losing patience with them.  The Government should give the people a chance to adjudicate on their stewardship.</P>
    <P>The budget will affect the cost of living.  It will affect a wide spectrum of life.  Local authorities this year will have to introduce supplementary estimates in order to meet their commitments. The rates were struck before the budget.  Very shortly local authorities will have to bring in revised estimates because of the rising costs of their operations as a result of Government policy.  The estimates on which local authorities have struck the rates will be found to be completely out of date.  Increased demands will come from local authorities for subventions and the Minister may be forced to introduce another budget.</P>
    <P>The people would be hard to convince that the Government have any policy or are going anywhere other than into bankruptcy.  The Government may say that they have to do certain things to deal with problems affecting society, but the people are not prepared to accept the word of the Government any longer.  I heard comments in a shop this morning.  One had to be careful about buying things this morning because the price of most articles has increased.  The comments of the people there were made in anger tinged with hopelessness.  Many of the people I met this morning had voted for the Government in the more reactionary areas, but the point is that all the people now, whatever area they are in, whether it is Dublin-Artane or Dublin-Rathmines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not think the people will any longer accept any promise made by the Government.  They accepted promises earlier, when Fine Gael promised a just society and Labour promised socialism in the seventies, but all we have left is hopelessness which the Government have brought upon us.</P>
      <P>I do not know who advises the Government on financial or economic affairs.  I am not an economist, but even a person with limited intelligence can see that a country in which there are 120,000 unemployed and which is one of the most highly taxed nations in Europe cannot be a prosperous society.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil had started the process of reducing the qualifying age for old age pension.  That has been abandoned now.  However, even if the Government were to carry out all that was outlined in the budget we would not have great advancement.  The people will remember that the Government reneged on the promise of equal pay for women, and I do not think they will put any trust in anything a member of the Government will say in future.</P>

    <P>This morning, as the Taoiseach spoke, I noticed that more Fianna Fáil members were present than Government backbenchers.  Of course, we are martyrs for punishment and we have suffered a lot of punishment in the last three years by having to listen to Government promises.  I take the absence of Government backbenchers this morning as a mark of cynicism on their part, and who can blame them?  As Deputy Colley pointed out last night, the young Deputy who was successful in the bye-election some months ago will have difficulty explaining to the people in the west the <Col N="840" /> change in the payment of unemployment assistance.  He will have to do that even though the Government assured the people in that constituency that this would not be touched. During that campaign we warned the people that the Government, and their policies, were so prodigal that they would have to start cutting back. Government Ministers thundered forth in Castlebar and Westport and told the people not to believe us.  I wonder who the people of those towns believe this morning?</P>
    <P>In my view this is only the start of the great cutback to the more traditional Fine Gael policies and not the beginning of the road to prosperity. A few years ago the people could have hoped that the Labour Party would have shouted &ldquo;stop&rdquo; but they are not going to shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo; any more; they will go on to their fate knowing that they must hang with the Fine Gael Party because, if not, they will hang separately.  Therefore, we will have an enforced unity, at least on the Front Bench, until the people are giving an opportunity of judging the Government's record or until there is some kind of revolt on the backbenches.</P>

      <P>Thanks very much, but if one had not got a sense of humour when looking at this budget I do not know what would happen.  In the coming weeks the Minister for Finance must endeavour to sell this budget to <Col N="841" /> the Congress of Trade Unions.  This morning the Taoiseach told us that in the last talks he had with these people they accepted that a voluntary cut in wages was necessary.  He emphasised &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; but I wonder if &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; will be the word used shortly.  The Taoiseach rightly condemned violence and tried to define patriotism.  Very often the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has tried to categorise patriotism, even better than Voltaire did.</P>

      <P>That is correct, it was Dr. Johnson in &ldquo;The last resort of a scoundrel&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach spoke of violence in the Six Counties, and we condemn violence there also.  Before the violence started I spent my holidays in that part of the country in an effort to get to know the people better.  I should like to remind the Government that when a Fianna Fáil Government introduced legislation in an effort to stop some of the violence there was quick reaction from Deputies who now support the present Government.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was in Opposition then&mdash;I know he is anxious to know where he is at present&mdash;but it took the bombs in Dublin to bring a sense of reality into the House at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing Northern Ireland it was the Taoiseach who mentioned violence.  The violence in Northern Ireland must be condemned, but we must remember that violence can be inflicted by an inept government.  Without much imagination the Government introduced a budget which those in the lower income bracket will find violent.  It will deprive people of proper housing, and that is also violent.  The violence is being committed by the budget on those sections who cannot fend for themselves.  Our people were looking forward to a wider distribution of the national wealth but there is no division of that wealth in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> In some cases the taxation is savage.</P>
    <P>For many weeks before the budget we were warned by the Taoiseach, and his Ministers, to be prepared for what the Tánaiste described as &ldquo;the toughest budget in peace time&rdquo;.  One would imagine that all they had to do was warn us that it was their intention to impose savage taxation, but there was nothing about who was responsible for bringing about this situation.  Who left our people without leadership?  Had they leadership they could have hoped for a drive towards prosperity and a decent society but because of the crazy mixed-up attitude of the Government on fundamental issues, they have given us this hotchpotch budget with the promise of even more taxation.  The people will see it in all its nakedness and demand their price, which is that the Government leave office and allow a proper Government to lead the country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to spell out how much money the Government intend to invest in the construction industry. I keep repeating this because it is such an important industry in its social implications, apart altogether from the employment it gives.  In the Book of Estimates we see figures but we do not know whether they will be kept to.  We in the local authorities have grave reasons to be doubtful.</P>
    <P>We can understand women's feelings at their treatment by the Government on the matter of equal pay. When the Minister for Finance was in Opposition he used every debating society at every opportunity to tell women the important part they play and would play in the new era of Coalition Government.  Why has he changed his mind on this issue?  Anybody, even a person who is not an economist, can see problems in this matter, but women play a major part in the industrial life of the country and it is immoral not to pay them the same wages and salaries as men.  But we have seen how the Government can shirk moral issues like this simply because they have gone wrong in economic planning.</P>
    <P>We have been told of the great strides we have made in Europe, of the way people there look up to us <Col N="843" /> and say we are great EEC partners. I do not believe that.  I would swop at any time our unemployment rate with that of France, West Germany or any other EEC country.  I would be satisfied if by some magic the Government could even reduce our unemployment rate to the level of some of the countries of Europe.  Why can we not emulate even Turkey, which was once known as the sick man of Europe?  That mantle has now fallen on Britain, and it is no compensation to be told from Government benches that we are no sicker that the UK. We can become even sicker unless the Government change their policies or quit office.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil never boasted of being the Government of all the talents.  In our humility we recognised that in every human institution it is very difficult to attain perfection.  But this Government came in with the facade of ability and people, through the media and the ballot boxes, accepted this picture.  It gives me no satisfaction to contrast the picture of three or even two years ago with that of today.  We see a nation facing a further and graver recession.  To me the gravest part is that the Government have no plans for recovery.  They fall back on the old conservative dodge of cutting back on wages.  When I use that word I do not mean it in the sense of the UK political party. The Government want to preserve the <i>status quo</i> and they have neither the courage nor the ability to branch out.</P>

Look at the outdated socialism of the Labour Party who in 1969 put out a publication called <i>The New Republic.</i>  I have never read such a lot of out-dated Fabianism.  It reads like the minutes of a meeting of the Flat Earth Society.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Moore has many admirable characteristics and among the most striking of them is a good, hard neck.  He made a number of astonishing statements. Perhaps the most astonishing was that this budget involves a cut-back in social welfare.  I wonder what the social welfare recipient during the last four years and again today would think if he listened to the Deputy talking about this alleged cutback in social welfare.  He&mdash;possibly she&mdash; would know that this Government began by very greatly raising social welfare payments.  The Deputy must surely know that.  The Deputy and his party must know that against wind and weather, and in the most difficult possible circumstances, this Government not only maintained but increased payments to social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not forgetting about inflation.  Who could <Col N="845" /> possibly forget about inflation?  Social welfare recipients have been compensated for inflation with commensurate increases in social welfare payments, which have been substantially maintained. The Deputy talks about a cut-back. In fact there is a 10 per cent increase, and what the Deputy obviously has in mind is something else.  What he has in mind is the unstated policy of his own party to let social welfare be eroded.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Far from forgetting about inflation, the Government have compensated social welfare recipients for inflation by giving genuine increases in payments, payments which perhaps did little more than compensate, but which certainly did that, and the Minister for Finance specifically pledged the Government to that policy.</P>
      <P>Many charges can be made against this budget.  It is easy to attack a tough budget.  It is easy to attack unpopular items in a budget, and one expects this will be done.  One thing on which I should have thought this Government invulnerable was on their commitment to social welfare and their concern to protect precisely against inflation the most disadvantaged sections of the community.  We have done that.  I know there are those who advise otherwise.  There was mention of Mr. Seán MacEntee and Professor Martin O'Donoghue.  I have the greatest respect for Mr. Seán MacEntee.

      <P>I bow to the Chair's ruling.  It is also a fact that a prominent and respected academic, who is the adviser of the Fianna Fáil Party on economic affairs, said the same thing.  Deputy Colley accused the Minister for Finance and the Government of &ldquo;allowing expenditure to rip&rdquo;.  He did not say, and neither did Deputy Moore or the leader of the Opposition, where expenditure should be cut, and I believe that, unless the Opposition specify where it should be cut, the electorate will hear them with a certain amount of cynicism.  It is easy to say &ldquo;cut expenditure&rdquo;.  It is easy to say we should reduce the deficit but it is not so easy to say what exactly should be done.  There is nothing but the simple formula: &ldquo;You get out and we will come in and then you will see&rdquo;.  I do not think the people are likely to take that on trust.  We have a more sophisticated electorate than that.  They know the difficulties with which any Government is confronted, and an Opposition which wishes to convince them they can do better will have to say in advance of being elected, and not after, what exactly they will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Allowing expenditure to rip&rdquo;. There are three main areas in which expenditure is very heavy.  One of them is public service pay under the national pay agreements.  Under the impact of inflation public service pay has risen to very high levels.  Would Deputy Colley and Deputy Moore argue that the national pay agreement ought to have been repudiated and public service pay cut back?  We did <Col N="847" /> not do that.  Is that &ldquo;allowing expenditure to rip&rdquo;?  Another area which has proved extremely costly is security.  This Government are paying £100 million to security, which is considerably in excess of what was paid under Fianna Fáil Governments, I agree.  But there are reasons for that.  Different attitudes can be taken on security.  One would be to say: &ldquo;Let us have strict security in the Twenty-Six Counties but it is no business of ours what the IRA may do in the North.  If they keep quiet here what they do up there is no odds.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should tell the House what provoked the call for a quorum.  I referred to the claim by the <Col N="848" /> former Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, that this Government were allowing expenditure to rip.  I asked those opposite, as others asked them but without any response, where they would cut expenditure.  I drew attention to the national pay agreement, the cost of honouring it, and asked whether they would have repudiated it and obtained cuts that way or whether they would have sacked workers.  No answer to that.</P>
      <P>Then I turned to the security area, and this is where Deputy Moore became agitated.  I pointed out that the high cost of security reflected the Government's strong concern for the effective implementation of law and order and the checking not only of IRA activities in this part of the island but also of activities directed against targets in Northern Ireland.  I pointed out that it would be possible to get cuts in security expenditure by pursuing other policies, such as those pursued by his party in 1969-70 of turning a blind eye to the IRA as long as they were active only in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>This Government do not propose to pursue such a policy, have never pursued such a policy and never will pursue such a policy.  The cost of honouring that honourable commitment is high and I am afraid will stay high until that armed conspiracy can be defeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <P>I was referring to something which is contained in this budget, something for which people are being taxed to pay, that is, the high cost of security.  I was explaining why that those high costs exist.  It would be easy to lower the cost of security by doing a deal with the armed conspirators, but this Government have never done and will never do such a deal.  That was the point I was making.</P>
      <P>The only other area in which major cuts in expenditure are possible is social welfare.  Deputy Moore actually had the nerve to accuse this Government of cutting back social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was absolutely normal that the Opposition attack the budget&mdash;they must do so. The budget presents, as any budget which introduces new taxes must, several tempting target areas.  I would ask Deputy Moore in particular to consider whether, in their fight for a legitimate desire to put out the Government and to put themselves in their place, they may not take inadvertently certain courses or certain lines which, whatever they do to the Government, are endangering the national economy.</P>
      <P>I think some of the things said by Deputy Moore today could have that effect.  He said the Government had what he called the audacity to suggest a pay pause.  He seemed to suggest that the idea of a pay pause was altogether unreal.  Surely his words are encouraging those in the trade union movement who might be disposed to reject a pay pause and discourage those who want one?</P>

      <P>It is generally agreed in this House that a pay pause <Col N="850" /> is necessary for the economic survival of this country and to prevent the collapse of industries and job losses. If so, should not an Opposition spokesman, even in the heat of attacking the budget of a Government he wants to put out of office, be rather careful about what he says in that area?</P>
      <P>This links in my mind with something which happened here the other night.  I am speaking now in the context of the budgetary and economic policies.  What happened was that three members of the Deputy's Party raised on the Adjournment the question of an unofficial strike, probably one of the most unjustified unofficial strikes which has ever occurred in this country, the postal strike, which arose out of failure by certain workers to comply with instructions about the parking of their vehicles and their insistence on parking them illegally.  That is how it began. It has now taken on other dimensions. The fact that Members of Fianna Fáil should raise that dispute here on the Adjournment, and make themselves the mouthpieces of the unofficial strikers, as they did, suggests that Fianna Fáil, in their desperation to get back into office, are in danger of being led into actions which sabotage our economy.</P>

      <P>The outstanding characteristic of the budget introduced here yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, in the context of such extreme difficulty, and pressure, and small room for manoeuvre, was its concern for fairness.  That is to say that in a context where sacrifices were necessary&mdash;and we all agree they were necessary&mdash;they should be distributed fairly in the community.  One aspect of that, the existence of which Deputy Moore has just denied, was the Government's insistence on maintaining social welfare levels by the compensatory 10 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other aspects also.  There may be those who consider fairness somehow not fundamentally important economically, however important it is socially.  I do not believe that is the case.  One cause of the industrial unrest which sometimes, as in some recent strikes, seems to reach irrational proportions, has been a cynicism which became strongly dug in over the past couple of decades, a feeling: &ldquo;The workers are always being asked to make sacrifices, but I know other people are getting away with murder in this area.  Why should <Col N="852" /> I consent to a sacrifice?  I pay tax in full under PAYE and I know this one and that one, this farmer and that doctor, pay little or nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That climate of social cynicism produces the use of industrial blackmail, if you like, and other very undesirable things.  This climate developed to a very dangerous and deleterious extent under the former Government through their attitude, amongst other things, to the questions of tax avoidance and tax evasion.  As regards tax avoidance, a former Minister for Finance actually told his officials not to devise measures to combat tax avoidance&mdash;not evasion, avoidance&mdash;and to just let these ingenious devices develop with the result, of course, that surtax payers almost disappeared.  They could all talk their way out of it, and they did, while the taxpayer at the bottom of the scale, the PAYE man, had no escape.</P>
    <P>Nothing was more striking in the response to the budget speech yesterday&mdash;and it was very interesting to watch the response of Deputies over there&mdash;than their reaction to those important parts of it which deal with tax avoidance and tax evasion.  Broad grins all along that front bench, and the broadest grin was that of the former Minister who advised against measures to combat tax avoidance. I should like to have a film of that front bench listening to that part of the Minister's speech.  It would be interesting if it were shown rather widely throughout the country.  It became very clear that the attitude had grown up that the wise guy, the smart fellow who knew his way around, did not have to pay tax and, in a way, should not have to pay tax because he was sufficiently ingenious to get away from tax, and that tax was for the people lower down.  That attitude grew up.  There was no doubt that it did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We were smiling with the Minister, not at him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not including the Deputy.  I did not notice any such behaviour on his part.  One of the most striking characteristics of <Col N="853" /> Deputy Ryan as Minister for Finance has been the zeal and pertinacity with which he reversed the policies of that predecessor and went after tax avoidance and the closing of the many and ingenious loopholes for tax avoidance &mdash;probably it will never be possible to close them all but the fight can be conducted&mdash;and his measures against tax evasion, including the severe measures included in the present legislation.  As people see there is a determination to spread the sacrifices fairly, there will be a willingness to see the advantages of restraint in the interest of the workers themselves collectively, and a greater emphasis on collective advantage and less on the &ldquo;the devil take the hindmost&rdquo; philosophy.</P>
      <P>In the same way the Government have been concerned not only to uphold social welfare levels, contrary to what was suggested, but to ensure that social welfare is not abused.  Our concern in this is not only for the elimination of abuses themselves but with the very protection of the concept of social welfare.  We know that people who are against social welfare for various reasons will use the abuses which do exist as sticks with which to beat the whole system, and if they are effective in that the ultimate losers will be the very poorest classes in the community.  It is for that reason as well as to protect the taxpayer that the Government have taken steps to see that the relatively wealthy people in certain rural areas who have been taking social welfare payments and who are not entitled to them will no longer be able to do that.  That, in my belief, is a courageous decision, one that was shirked for many years.  I think it is timely and will be seen to be timely.  The whole pattern of the budget is marked by this concern for fairness in distribution. It is quite a different budget from what would have been under another Government, and not only in the taxes raised but in the distribution of the sacrifice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important feature of the budget about which little enough has been said is the large new injection of capital, again a difficult thing to <Col N="854" /> attain in present circumstances.  It has been attained, and it has very significant implications for employment. We believe that this tough and in many ways necessarily unpopular budget provides the best way that we can find of weathering this economic storm and of taking the country through to a point at which economic and social progress can be maintained.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;the best way that we can find&rdquo;, and that is what I mean.  The Deputies opposite have used the jibe about the Government of all the talents.  It is a phrase now fathered on us, but of course originally coined as a jibe and maintained in this capacity. The Government naturally make no such claim.  The Government and the country would benefit from an Opposition which not only said: &ldquo;Yah, you have made a mess of it. Get out and let us move in&rdquo;&mdash;which is a very simple thing to say&mdash;but which also presented in broad terms an alternative policy, an idea of what ought to be done, which would not be this and which would be a better way out of our difficulties.  We would be prepared to learn and we could learn from that.  But we are told: &ldquo;We are not advising you on anything except to get out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Opposition have a perfect right to take that attitude, but if they do they are not contributing anything to help the country in its present difficulties. As I have said, I fear that some of the things they have done have actually incited industrial unrest and made a pay pause less likely.  I think that if they reflect they will realise that in their eagerness to get into office they are in danger of doing things which would make their position, if they ever reached that office themselves, less tenable.</P>
    <P>We need an Opposition who will attack our policies, but you can only attack effectively from a point of departure which is known and clear. This Opposition comes from any angle: &ldquo;Attack their taxation policy; attack their every new tax; attack their deficit; attack their expenditure, but do not say how expenditure should be cut; do not say how the taxes could be avoided. Do not say how the deficit could be <Col N="855" /> reduced.&rdquo;  As long as the Opposition do that, the only policy the people have to judge on is the policy of this Government, a policy which has been adapted in changing circumstances and under changing stresses, and will no doubt adapt again.</P>
    <P>Because of adaptations we have been accused just now of lack of integrity. I do not think it is open to that Front Bench to make that charge in view of past history, into which I will not further enter.  As I say, the Government have made mistakes, but one of its characteristics is precisely integrity.  On that it is not vulnerable, and I think that charge should not have been made. It is our hope that, while it is only natural that the people will grumble, they will, on reflection, feel that the budget is fair and that fairness and confidence in fairness is a basic principle of social coherence.  It is tough, but it is tough for everyone.  It is not just directed against one section and it does protect the poorest people. I believe our people have a strong capacity for response to that and I hope that will be forthcoming.  It is certainly the intention of the framers of the budget that that should be the case.</P>

      <P>Over the last couple of years I thought I was old-fashioned and knew nothing about economics at all.  The way the Government were going and the way we were borrowing it seemed there was no worry at all about paying our way.  Now in the speeches of the Minister for Finance yesterday and the Taoiseach and other Members of the Government it is being emphasised that we must pay our way as far as possible and that if we borrow we must be sure that the money borrowed is put to good use.  These speeches have convinced me that I have always been right in my attitude.  I am as much a socialist as anyone else here, but, as I stated in this House before, you cannot take the breeches off a Highlander.  I cannot be socially minded if I have not the money to be so.  I cannot do it on borrowed money.  As a reporter in a newspaper said recently, it is like a teacher who came into school with a box of chocolates.  He wanted to make himself popular and so <Col N="856" /> he distributed all the chocolates in the morning.</P>
      <P>The Government came to power when the country was in a good state and they had a fair amount of finance. They continued to make themselves very popular.  However, they are now at the end of the road.  I am worried about the priorities.  Money should only be borrowed for the right purpose and this is where the Government went wrong.  I know taxation must continue, but even with taxation I can see where the Government are going at present.  The Government must have known about the economy before the oil crisis.  Any government can be socially minded, but one's cloth must be cut according to one's measure.  If money is given out too freely there will soon be no money left to give out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of housing was mentioned and reference was made to the leader of our party.  He is supposed to have said that we should not be building local authority houses but he said no such thing.  He said people should be encouraged to build their own houses.  I am now referring to people who work in towns and prefer to live in the country.  I can see the countryside being depopulated because everybody will have to go to the towns for housing.  If people were given decent grants they could build houses in their own locality where sites are available.  The planning being done by local authorities is abominable. However, the person building his own home can plan it as he likes. People should be encouraged to build their own homes.  If this encouragement were given there would not be so many people looking for local authority houses.  In my county, with the amount of money we are getting, we have a programme for building local authority houses and we are building them as fast as we can.  There is no question of slowing down the building of local authority houses.  I have always believed that people who preferred to build their own homes should get decent grants.  We all expected that these grants would be adjusted upwards but now we find that over a certain limit there is no <Col N="857" /> grant at all.  In this day and age I am surprised that anybody on the Labour benches would be inclined to think that £2,050 is a very high wage for a person.  This is the wage which makes a person ineligible for a grant at the moment.  We want to clarify that position once and for all.</P>
    <P>If there is a question of building local authority houses and the question of building private houses there is no conflict whatsoever.  The people who are prepared to help themselves and to build private houses have been denied the right of a grant by this Government except for the very low income groups.  This is what we have been talking about.  We are trying to do it with the amount of money at our disposal.  In all, the local authorities are making every effort to buy land and build local authority houses and for anyone to say that anyone on this side of the House is against this is ridiculous.  In the counties where we have majorities the housing record and programme are excellent. However, again I want to emphasise strongly that we condemn the withdrawal of grants from people who are prepared to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>I dread depopulation of the countryside and bringing everybody into housing estates, and I also hate the way that these estates are being designed, but the person who is being put into a local authority house has no say in the type of house he is put into.  There is a purchase scheme.  The tenant may become the owner of a house but he has no say as to its type. However, if he builds his own house he gets help to build it; he is taking a lot off the State in providing the house, and he has the opportunity to choose the type of house he likes.</P>
    <P>What worries me about the budget more than anything else is that there is no provision whatsoever for young people unemployed at the moment. There is one good thing, and I like to give credit where it is due.  I welcome the increase for AnCO, because they are making an excellent job of training people, so that when work becomes available and industry can get moving, people will be ready to avail of that work.  However, there was no <Col N="858" /> hope held out to young people coming out of school with perhaps a couple of honours in their leaving certificate and no hope of work for them.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is that nobody can say that this is a farmers' budget.  Everybody on the Government side seems to think that the farmers are too well off.  It seems we are definitely anti-farmer.  At the same time it is admitted by everybody on the Government side that our only hope of survival is agricultural exports. It is freely admitted that our situation would be a lot worse if it were not for agricultural exports.  But what did the budget do for agriculture? Agricultural co-operatives were set up by Horace Plunket many years ago as non-profiting concerns, to help essential production and to market the produce.  This is the difference between a co-operative and a private company. Any time money was put into a co-operative the co-operative had to develop. The purpose of forming a co-operative was to get what the farmer required as cheaply as possible and to enable him to market his product. That is the difference between a co-operative and a private company. There are a few members on the Government benches who know the history of the co-operative.  The purpose of the co-operative is to provide a service for the farmers whereas the purpose of forming a private company is to make profit.  For the first time the co-operative is brought within the tax bracket.</P>

      <P>When co-operatives were formed some farmers put money into them and they lost all.  The name co-operative did not commend itself to the west.  We spent a lot of time trying to get the co-operative movement going again in the form of a limited liability company.  If the limited liability company failed, all that was lost was the amount of share capital in it.  We have co-operative <Col N="859" /> creameries and marts, everyone of which is providing a service.</P>
      <P>This taxation is a terrible blow to the co-operative movement.  It is something that I did not expect, particularly from men on the Government benches who know a bit about co-operation and the hard struggle that went on to have co-operation. This is the first time that anyone attempted to tax a volunary movement. The money made by the co-operative is ploughed back.  The members of the committees are not paid expenses for attending meetings. They give their time for the sake of efficiency.</P>

      <P>The people that I am most interested in are the worker and the farmer.  The majority of people who work in Galway have to go 20 miles to work.  A car is essential for a farmer.  In the case of the man who has to drive 20 miles to his work there will be an additional 13p per gallon on petrol from March 1st, 10p from today and 3p more as a result of the increase in VAT.  If a man takes a pint after his day's work the additional cost on that item is 5p now and 6p in March. You can add that to the 13p on petrol.  If he is a smoker he will pay an additional 3p now and another 1½p in March.  You can add all these amounts to find how this man is affected.  I do not want to agitate here but is difficult to ask a worker to freeze his wages having regard to the direct increases in costs that I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same problem faces the farmer.  Diesel oil is up by 2 pence and VAT is increased also.  Very little mention has been made about the removal of the £17 special <Col N="860" /> employment grant but, in fact, it represents £½ million per year taken out of the farmers pockets.  The Minister for Local Government gave that figure yesterday as the amount which the farmer was getting in relief of rates for employing a person or for keeping his son at home. Admittedly, prices for farm produce are reasonably good at the moment but how much would they want to improve to bring us up a little from what happened in 1974?  There is not one word about that.</P>
    <P>I would have no objection if a scheme were brought in to improve production.  I am sorry that the Minister for Social Welfare is not here at the moment.  The smallholder gets an increase on the first £15 of his valuation. Valuation is the worst way in which to calculate income.  His first £15 is calculated at the rate of £20 for every £1 valuation.  On a valuation of £15 to £20 it goes up by 50 per cent.  His valuation from £15 to £20 is calculated at £30 per £1 valuation and from £20 onwards it is £40.  This means that the man whose income was estimated at £400 at £20 valuation will now be estimated at £800.  I should like to quote an extract from an article in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>Married couples in the £30 PLV category previously qualified for £1.96 with no children, £6.96 with two and £11.16 with four.  They would now need five children to qualify for £1.52 a week, as against £13.06 before the budget.</P>
    <P>I accept that £30 is a reasonable valuation but it is in a bracket that nothing is being done for.  I would have no objection to these changes if the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries introduced a scheme similar to the small farm incentive bonus scheme.  However, small farmers with a valuation of more than £20 are being left with nothing now unless they have a large family.  Such farmers, unless they receive a lot of land, can never hope to qualify as &ldquo;development farmers&rdquo;.  The Department should introduce a scheme of grants for farmers who work to a plan with their local agricultural instructor.  Most of the <Col N="861" /> small farmers in my area who are on Land Commission holdings with a valuation between £20-£30 will be excluded and those who will benefit will get very little.</P>
    <P>I accept that small farmers qualify for grants for erecting sheds, but they cannot plan ahead.  Under the small farm incentive bonus scheme a farmer worked to a plan in consultation with his instructor and if he brought his production up to a point he qualified for a grant at the end of the year.  If a scheme was introduced to discourage social welfare but to encourage development and production by way of grants I would be in favour of it, but to take away the social welfare benefits and leave such farmers with nothing is wrong.  Up to now the farmers with a valuation between £30 and what was described as &ldquo;development status&rdquo; were excluded from such benefits, but this number has now been increased.</P>
    <P>The social welfare benefits helped many farmers, and I accept that they were abused in some cases, but a lot of the farmers who received social welfare benefits ploughed that money back into their farm.  It would hardly pay those who will now receive only £1.95 a week to travel to the local office to sign or collect the money. Why did the Government not do something to encourage people to increase production?  If we do not export agricultural produce this country is finished, and that is why we should have had a scheme to replace the social welfare benefits.  I would praise any Government who decided to borrow money to introduce such a scheme.  Money borrowed for drainage schemes in any part of the country would be well spent and I would not mind what the amount of interest was.</P>
    <P>We expected to get money for land settlement from the EEC which did not materialise and we still have thousands of acres of land in the hands of the Land Commission.  The Government should borrow money to enable the Land Commission to divide that land quickly.  I have been accused of standing up for the Land Commission, but I am merely speaking the truth because the Land Commission <Col N="862" /> can only divide as much land as the amount of money they have will permit.  The Land Commission need a lot of money for the division of land, the provision of fences and road making, but there is nothing in this budget for this purpose.  Because the Government did not introduce a scheme to replace social welfare benefits to the farmers I mentioned I was surprised that rural Deputies who support the Government did not voice their disapproval.  The Government have done everything possible to kill incentive in farming, and I find that hard to understand.  The Taoiseach has told us that our only hope of survival is to export agricultural produce, but how can farmers produce if they are not helped?</P>
    <P>Recently I read a book, written by a communist, on the development of agriculture in the capitalist and communist states.  The author pointed out that farms over the years became bigger in the capitalist states and bigger as state-owned in the communist states.  The idea in making them bigger was because there was a scarcity of labour in industry and it helped industry which was short of labour.  He came to the conclusion that the reverse is the situation now. There is too much labour in industry and a need for labour in agriculture. He also stated that on both sides of the fence, on the capitalist and communist sides, they are back to the idea that the family farm is the best method of production and the best way to keep as many people as possible in agriculture.</P>

      <P>I think it would be most undesirable if there should be any addition to a great deal of the harmful criticism of the Irish Life Assurance Company.  This is a company of which all Ireland can be proud because of the manner in which they have injected a very distinctive Irish element into the whole insurance business. In common with other insurance companies, Irish Life are engaged in reinsurance and in that process they carry on business with about ten other companies.  Irish Life are also engaged in reinsuring on behalf of other companies including many British companies that are very happy to reinsure with Irish Life.  The Irish Life Assurance Company have a significant part of the insurance market and, therefore, it would be wrong for anyone to develop an element of chauvinism in relation to the operations of Irish Life which could be injurious to the best interests of the company, the policy holders and the business of the firm at home and abroad.  I am sure the Deputy realises the significance and importance of what I say and that he would not wish to be a party to any criticism that would suggest that Irish Life are not very anxious to place as much business as they can in Ireland. <Col N="864" /> This is their commitment and it is one I am satisfied from my inquiries they honour to the very best extent.</P>

Nobody is anxious to damage the Irish Life Assurance Company but at this time and in view of what the Minister said yesterday about goods and services being used within the country, surely the company have a responsibility to place their business on the home market?  I am leaving aside reinsurance because that is a separate matter.  Surely the company have a responsibility to place their fire insurance with an Irish-owned and Irish-operated insurance company?</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the practice of placing insurence and reinsurance on the basis of competitive tender.  The Deputy and the country may be assured that there would be a natural inclination on the part of Irish Life to place their insurance with another company in which they might possibly have a substantial shareholding.  As there has been no difference in the insurance practices of Irish Life, and as it is not the practice to disclose in this House the names of individual firms who receive business from companies, I consider it would not be proper for me to give any further details of the ordinary operations of the Irish Life Assurance Company.</P>

      <P>So far as stamp duty is concerned the intermediate type of transaction referred to is specifically covered by section 58 (4) of the Stamp Act, 1891, in order to prevent an excessive incidence of duty on the same property over a relatively short period. I agree in principle with this relief which facilitates a wide range of <i>bona fide</i> transactions in land and other property.  The Deputy will appreciate that if duty were imposed on an intermediate document it would not follow that the duty would necessarily be borne by one person rather than another.  In general stamp duty is charged on documents, not on any particular party to the document.</P>
      <P>Liability to certain other taxes could arise in respect of the transactions referred to.  The matter has been noted for this purpose and a full investigation will be made on the earliest possible occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to my reply to a similar question by the Deputy on 1st July, 1975, namely that the lessees of the theatre were pursuing against the lessors a claim to recover the cost of restoring the theatre and that pending the outcome, a decision on the application for State assistance did not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is very unsatisfactory.  Dublin Corporation as the local authority have agreed in principle to give some money and this was sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government.  Could the Minister not be more forthcoming and say that the Government would be agreeable at least in principle to giving some aid in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is aware that there are a number of legal problems involved in this matter. There is not merely the question of the claim for the restoration of the theatre but there is also the question of the possibility of renewal of the lease in 1978.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that this matter would have to be beyond all doubt before there could be a substantial investment of public moneys in a structure that, if a new lease was not forthcoming in 1978, would mean the investment would be totally negatived. The Deputy may be assured of my anxiety to assist in the matter but I must have regard to the other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not passed any comment about the operations of Dublin Corporation.  That is a matter for them but I consider in my obligations to taxpayers that I have to ensure if money is invested in a project that project has a life span of more than two years.  It may well be that it may have that, but at present the legal advice available to me is not such as to justify putting a substantial <Col N="867" /> amount of public money into this project.</P>

I may be wrong in this&mdash;my information is only what I read in the newspapers, although of course I rely on them as all of us do&mdash;but I understand there is perhaps a question of acquisition of certain rights in the theatre.  If all these matters could be resolved the question of State investment could be looked at.  However, until there is a certainly that the place in which the investment is made will be available for public use for several years to come, clearly I would not be justified in putting in money to restore a structure that would have only a very limited use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I suggest to the Minister that he is prevaricating. There is a major difficulty <Col N="868" /> for the people who have the interest in the remaining part of the lease, the uncertainty being that they are not in a position to proceed with restoration themselves.  Because of the limited amount of money that Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are prepared to advance, whether by way of loan or grant, it would require a commitment at least in principle from the Government to match the commitment of the corporation and the county council £ for £.  That being so, would the Minister not give an indication that in advance of the legal difficulties being cleared, and when they are cleared, he would be willing, in principle, to make some assistance available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that I am well-disposed to this project is well known.  The fact is on record.  The question of the renewal of the lease is also the question of obligation on the part of the owners of the property to reconstruct it.  If the owners of the property are under a legal obligation to reconstruct it then the question of any public money does not arise at all.  Until the uncertainties are cleared away I would not consider it appropriate to give any commitment which might be totally unnecessary and which, by being given, might lead other people to fail to pursue rights which are available to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the children's allowances, which are specifically exempted from income tax under section 354 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, there is no legislative provision to exempt other social welfare benefits or allowances from tax.  Strictly speaking, therefore, all social welfare payments in cash, other than the death grant, are in the nature of income and as such would fall to be taken into consideration for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>In practice, however, a benefit or allowance is disregarded for tax purposes unless it continues to be paid for a period in excess of one year.  Because of the nature of the payments and of the means tests for payment of non-contributory allowances the question of the tax liability of the majority of social welfare payments does not arise.</P>

      <P>The position, technically under the law, is that they can be, but, in practice, because of the exemption limits and so forth, people on non-contributory pensions are not taxed and in so far as persons who may be a receipt of contributory pensions <Col N="872" /> are taxed the tax element invariably arises because they have income other than the contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The number of civil servants in rented accommodation on 15th January, 1976 was 12,397.  The total amount of commercial rent payable in respect of all rented office accommodation for Government Departments is approximately £2,830,000 per annum at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> It is not the practice to disclose the amount of commercial rent payable in respect of individual offices and it would not be in the public interest to do so.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that it is more economical for the State to build its own offices than to rent them, and as the first stage of a long term programme towards that end work has already started on the adaptation, for office purposes, of the former St. Vincent's Nursing Home, while work is expected to start in the near future on the construction of office blocks at Shelbourne Road and Earlsfort Terrace, a new headquarters for the Meteorological Service at Glasnevin, the first stage of a new Garda headquarters at the former training depot in the Phoenix Park and an office block at Inchicore Road, Inchicore.</P>
    <P>The new stamping branch building in the Lower Yard of Dublin Castle is not inadequate for its purposes.</P>
    <P>The building in Kildare Place (Agriculture House) was intended to house the headquarters staff of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and certain other civil service staffs.  Because of the expansion of its staffs it has become necessary to allocate the entire building to the Department and to seek alternative accommodation for the other staffs at present housed these.</P>

      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for referring to an office block in Inchicore Road and that, despite this financial business, the programme is to continue.  I understood him to say when Agriculture House was being constructed that not only would the entire staff of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries be accommodated there but that there would be a surplus of offices.  I understand that members of the Department of Agriculture staff need to be housed elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning is proceeding for the proposed conversion of the Great Hall in University College, Dublin, for use as a concert hall and it is expected that the contract documents to enable tenders to be sought will be completed in about a year's time.</P>

      <P>It is very surprising to think that it will be years before planning permission will be given.  How long after that will it be before we get possession of the hall&mdash;when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the public?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>A steering committee have been set up composed of representatives of RTE, the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance and the Office of Public Works to oversee the project.  There is a lot of technical matter involved, particularly regarding acoustics.  I am told that if all goes well the conversion should commence in 1977.  The time-table is dependent on the availability of the Great Hall. The UCD authorities have agreed to hand over the required area subject to the proviso that they can get space for the conduct of examinations.  It is expected this space will be available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have come to be known as the &ldquo;12 western counties&rdquo; have already been scheduled as disadvantaged areas and recognised as such by the EEC Commission.  The relevant directive authorises the Government to apply in such areas a special system of aids to farmers.  These may consist of compensatory payments on livestock in the most severely handicapped parts of these areas; special assistance for development farmers by way of extra grants for land improvement, for buildings <i>et cetera</i> and assistance for joint investment schemes for fodder production and for improvement works and equipment needed on pasture land and hill grazing areas farmed jointly.  The scheme of compensatory payments on livestock is already in operation in the most severely handicapped <Col N="901" /> parts of the disadvantaged areas.  The other aids envisaged in the directive are being discussed with the EEC Commission and will be announced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Representations have been received from local interests and groups throughout the country to have their areas included in the disadvantaged areas and from similar groups within the disadvantaged areas to have their areas included with those that are most severely handicapped and in which livestock headage payments are made. The principal areas which have sought to be brought within the disadvantaged areas are west Limerick, east Limerick/ north Tipperary and certain parts of west Cork, west Offaly, north Westmeath and north Meath.  Representations were also received in relation to districts in Counties Wexford, Waterford, Laois, Kilkenny and South Tipperary.  The claims of these areas have been examined by my Department, but Deputies will appreciate that there is no possibility whatever of all or many of them meeting the strict criteria laid down in the directive and that such adjustments as may eventually be made in the boundaries will be of a purely marginal nature.</P>
    <P>Within the disadvantaged areas there is pressure from practically all areas which have been excluded from cattle headage payments, including east Galway, south Roscommon and most of Cavan and Monaghan, to have these payments extended to them.  This, of course, would be impracticable from the point of view of cost and in any event would be contrary to the terms of the directive.  My Department have been examining boundary areas in parts of north Kerry, west Cork, Galway, Clare and Longford but are of opinion that in general the existing boundaries are broadly correct.</P>
    <P>Discussions are currently being initiated with the EEC Commission on the operation of the disadvantaged areas scheme and its areas of application and when these have been concluded the necessary decisions will be taken by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that since, as a result of the <Col N="902" /> budget, social welfare is now being cut to anyone with a £50 valuation, these people will become very disadvantaged, and does that not mean a stronger case for including all 12 western counties in the designated areas within the disadvantaged areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that since there has been this fantastic reduction this could make a stronger case for their inclusion in the designated areas within the disadvantaged areas.  Unless they are developing farmers they gain nothing.  Will the Minister give special consideration to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Callanan will have to accept that it is not my decision what to include or exclude.  We put the criteria through the Commission and if we get their agreement, we accept it.  So far we have failed to get agreement that they are suffering the degree of handicap that would entitle us to pay them headage payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not considered it necessary to advise the State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department on the lines suggested. I am satisfied that the bodies concerned are aware of the desirability of purchasing Irish made goods whenever possible.  The answer to the remainder of the question is: Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, £6,011, An Foras Talúntais, £306, Bord na gCon, £14,238.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The £6,011 referred to in the reply represents a single purchase of labels and insert cards for seed potatoes by the agricultural production division.  In this case, the Stationery Office who would normally make such a purchase for the Department reported that they were unable to get a satisfactory quotation. The Department then approached three firms in Ireland and two in the United Kingdom.  Two quotations <Col N="910" /> were received, one Irish and one English.  The Irish quotation was for £12,163 and, furthermore, the label eyelet was not regarded as satisfactory. The lower English quotation was £6,011.  We have the evidence that it was 50 per cent lower than the Irish quotation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I was dealing with the manner in which the farming community have been treated by the Government in this budget and the various ways in which they will be affected by the taxes imposed.  I also described the taxing of the agricultural co-operatives as a retrograde step.  They are not a profit-making concern but are there to provide a service to the farming community.  I was shocked to find that they were being taxed for the first time and given the same status as private companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred also to the effects on the farmers of the VAT increase, the increased price of petrol, and the 2p on diesel.  The Minister for Local Government said it would cost £500,000 to retain the employment subsidy; even though it was only a miserable £17, it is still taking a substantial sum from the farmers.  I said I had no objection to the reduction in social welfare provided it was replaced by some scheme which would provide an incentive to the farmer to produce more.  I thought the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would have greater influence, because if we do not export this country <Col N="919" /> is finished, and agricultural commodities are our principal exports. Agriculture is of vital importance, but not enough attention is being given to it.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to hear the Minister for Agriculture saying that a farmer with a £15 valuation was not severely handicapped.  Maybe that is the case around Dublin where he can specialise, but a man down in the west of Ireland with a £15 valuation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Around my area he would not have 25.  This is where the valuation system is rotten.  That can happen but it is only a small pocket. I come from an area where the Land Commission holdings given out were between 55 and 30 acres.  They are all from 75 pence to 90 pence in the £. The farmers in my area who were getting a fair bit of social welfare, which they did not want&mdash;they would prefer production incentives&mdash;but which they had to get to survive, will lose heavily by this budget proposal. In my area £30 valuation might give you 40 acres of land, and not great land.  In that case, a man with five children who was receiving £13 will now get £1.52 pence.  A man with £25 valuation will have about 35 or 30 statute acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not being given out through a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>He can have a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not change to a means test completely? I was always totally opposed to the valuation system.  I am talking about a system which is being used to allocate social welfare, that is, on a valuation basis.  I am saying that a man with four children who has a £25 valuation will now get £3.46 pence where he formerly got £13.08.  A man on £20 valuation with four children <Col N="920" /> who was getting £15 will now get £11.16.  A man on £15 valuation with four children who was getting £16 will now get £14.04 pence.  A £15 valuation in my area would represent about 20 statute acres of land.  Nobody can tell me that a man with 20 statute acres of land is not disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>This proposal will mean a big reduction in income to the small farmer. As I said, farmers would prefer an incentive to production rather than social welfare benefit.  If this was replaced by a scheme whereby a farm could be planned, as under the old farm incentive scheme, and whereby he could get a good grant as if he was a development farmer, that would be acceptable to the small farmer, but it is wrong to take away social welfare benefit and put nothing in its place.</P>
      <P>The increase in the price of petrol and also the increased tax according to the horse power of a car will be hard on the farmer.  Farmers as a rule do not buy new cars.  A small horse-power car is not much good to a farmer and it is too dear anyway. The higher the horse-power of a car the cheaper you will get it, and this is the type of car farmers usually have.  Therefore taking all the farmer will lose under this budget, it will be seen that there is no incentive to them, particularly the small farmer.  The farmer between 30 and 60 acres is the hardest hit because he can get nothing. His farm is not big enough for development and it is not small enough for him to get social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also spoke before the adjournment about reading a book written by a communist who studied the systems in the capitalist and communist countries, the system that in the communist countries went away from the small family farm into state farms and in the capitalist countries the voluntary co-operative farms and larger farms.  The reason given at the time was that it was to take labour from the land to industry.  Now there is too much labour in industry; there is under-employment there.  The reverse is wanted now, to keep as many people as possible on the land.  Having studied both systems the author of this book says the concensus is <Col N="921" /> that the best solution in respect of the two systems, both in regard to the communal system and the State-owned farms in the communist countries and the system of the big ranches and big co-operative farms in the capitalist countries, is to revert to the family farm.</P>
    <P>The man said he was a communist. I have not got the book with me but it is well worth reading.  He gives a very fair description of two sisters working under the capitalist system and under the communist system.  He eventually comes to the conclusion that the family farm seems to be the ideal situation for people and for production. At that time people were wanted in industry, but now, of course, they are not wanted.  This is why I stress the need for doing something for the family farm.</P>
    <P>I know quite a number of these people who are now hit by this budget.  They would prefer to be given incentives rather than social welfare.  Of course social welfare is not given now and my argument is that it was unfair to take it away without giving an incentive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suddenly in 1976 we turn around and strike at a certain type of farm that is finding it hard to survive.  These farms are not in the development category and they are not recognised in the EEC.  I know the Government are doing their best to change the situation and I am behind them in this but at present the type of farm which the Minister says is not disadvantaged is not recognised and does not get support as a development farm.  The farmer has been badly treated in this budget.  I am only putting up a case for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That is all right.  I believe you are in a bloody hopeless minority.  As Bruce Arnold said in <i>The Irish Independent</i> the Government divided all the chocolates among the children in the morning and there were no chocolates left after lunch.</P>
      <P>I know workers who drive 20 miles to Galway every day.  They will now be hit by the increase of 13p in the price per gallon of petrol, 10p now and 3p later.  If a man wants to drink he is entitled to do so, but he will now pay 5p extra for a pint and 6p after the 1st March.  If a man is a smoker &mdash;and any reasonable smoker will smoke 20 cigarettes a day&mdash;he will have to pay 3p extra now and 1p later.  How do this Government intend to keep the workers to a wage freeze?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance mentioned the huge sum of money that the health scheme was costing the Exchequer.  I agree, but I did ask the Minister for Health on one or two occasions to consider more home care for people with relatives which I believe would save a lot of money.  I understand that hospitals and homes are packed out at the moment, and the reason is because the prescribed relative will not get an allowance unless the person is bed-ridden.  That is terribly wrong.  I do not know the cost of keeping a patient in a hospital or a home but it must be fairly high. If an old person is living with a relative and there is a third person in the house, for example if a daughter is living with a father or mother, she will get an allowance, but if she marries and has her husband in the house she gets nothing for the upkeep of the elderly relative.  I have raised this question time and again.  If that woman had three or four children and the doctor came to see the elderly parent it is quite understandable that she will say: &ldquo;I have a right to mind my children&rdquo;.  If she were receiving a decent allowance in respect of her elderly parent she would not put the parent into hospital.  There are plenty of people taking up hospital beds today who could be well looked after at home if an allowance were given to a relative.  A person who is not a relative can get an allowance for minding anybody.  We could keep hundreds of <Col N="923" /> people out of hospital and reduce the expense of hospitals by giving more for home care.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to make is that there was no mention of the question of obtaining off-shore oil or gas. The Sligo Development Association have written to a number of TDs in the west, but unless the Government do something about it shortly there will be rings formed outside the country. Who will be dealing with this? We do not seem to be making any progress here.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will say that the occasion of this budget is the first time that this Government have come to realise that the country cannot go on borrowing unless it pays its way, and this is the first time they have said it with force, but their attempt to come down with the hammer indicates that their priorities are wrong. Some sections of the community are severely hit by this budget.  Through the device against agriculture, even though it is the most important section for exports, the worker is going to be very hard hit.  Even after all the borrowing that is going on the Government will not nearly be able to balance.  They are putting on taxes and borrowing.  I cannot understand how the Government for years past did not borrow for the purpose of draining the land and giving the Land Commission the money to enable people to settle on the land.  This would have been productive and money well spent, but we seem to be borrowing for anything that is not productive or essential.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to emphasise too much the gloom of the situation.  The Government have caught themselves on but in doing so the nation is going to suffer severely, particularly the people whom I represent, the people in the west, who are going to be very hard hit with expenses.  Workers have to travel long distances to work.  They are going to be hit by prices going up. The farmers will be hit by their social welfare being cut.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is present and before I sit down I will appeal to him to get a national <Col N="924" /> scheme going for these farmers to give them a chance to work to a plan to bring up production and help to export goods, and to give them a chance to get grants and to plan their farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>In approaching this budget debate we should see it in the context of and against the background of the economic situation in which we find ourselves.  The budget must be judged in terms of that economic situation, in terms of its relevance and appropriateness to that situation.  It must be judged also in the context of the actual financial situation the Government find themselves in and the limitations and constraints that these may impose on their freedom of action.</P>
      <P>The economic situation in the last few months has changed somewhat. No longer are we in a period of decline.  There has been a levelling off. There has been a halt to this decline in our economy.  There has not been a recovery.  There is no question of a sudden boom or anything like that, far from it, but there is evidence that the decline has halted.  You have the improvement in the level of retail sales in the latter few months of the year and the recovery in imports reflecting restocking by firms who had allowed their stocks to run down very far, a levelling off in the decline in industrial production in the third quarter.  You have had, moreover, although it is not evident on the surface of the figures, evidence of a levelling off of unemployment.  Let me spend a minute or two on this because this is an area where the figures are of their nature misleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make my point.  If the Deputy wants to challenge me afterwards, fair enough.  The position here is that you have, of course, a very strong seasonal component in unemployment.  It always rises sharply in the winter, particularly in the period immediately after Christmas.  It is important to try to <Col N="925" /> detect the underlying trend in unemployment. For this purpose seasonal correction factors are applied.  There are some doubts about these seasonal correction factors, especially when the whole scale of unemployment has changed as it has done with a sharp increase in the last couple of years. On the best seasonal adjustment available there is evidence of fractional decline in unemployment in November as against October, some indication of this continuing in December although the December figures are unreliable.  Because of the effect of the day of the week on which Christmas falls, the end December figures are not a reliable indicator. The trend in January, where there has been the usual sharp post-Christmas seasonal increase, so far suggests that the end January figure when seasonally adjusted will show a decline of several thousand in the underlying trend of unemployment by comparison with November and December. We cannot be certain yet until we get to the end of the month, but last week's figure showed a very small increase and unless the increase in the current fortnight, the last two weeks of the month, is as high as 4,000, certainly the seasonally adjusted figure for unemployment at the end of January will be below the figure for November which itself was below the figure for October.  In fact, it looks as if we are at the stage now where the underlying trend of unemployment is slightly downwards and has brought us back to the position of about last June.  This is something which will only become clear when we get the figures in January and February and when the seasonal adjustments are made to them, and I am in a sense, sticking my neck out a bit by making this point at this stage, but it is important and we should not be misled by superficial appearances.  The reality of a levelling off in the decline in our economy with an impact on unemployment occurring sooner than one might have expected is a feature of our economy at the end of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This does not mean, however, that any real recovery involving a substantial increase in output or a significant <Col N="926" /> drop in unemployment is likely in the six or even perhaps nine months ahead.  What we have at the moment is a reaction to the excessive running down of stocks.  It is to some degree a technical recovery.  It is limited in character, and only two things can make that a worth-while recovery. One is, and only within strict limits, the action the Government take in the budget in seeking to stimulate output and employment.  Given the external restraints, given the problems of borrowing, given the continuing sluggish demand in most export markets, there are strict limits to what the Government can do, but the Government can do something in the budget to encourage this recovery, to give it a bit of a boost in the nine months ahead as we wait for the external demand factor, which is ultimately the important one, to take effect.</P>
    <P>That is what this budget within the restraints imposed by the financial difficulties is designed to do, as I shall show in a few minutes.  Our hope would be, then, that this would lead to a recovery so that in the current year taken as a whole national output, instead of falling by 3 per cent as it did last year, would rise by perhaps 2 per cent.  That is the Minister for Finance's forecast.  Personally I would hope that he may be a little pessimistic and that the upturn towards the end of the year may be somewhat sharper and the recovery more than 2 per cent.  The Minister for Finance is right to be cautious in an area where over the past couple of years every country's expert forecasters have proved to be too optimistic.</P>
    <P>That is the economic background. What is needed then is a budget which within the limits of what is financially possible and financially wise will give some stimulus to the economy, and that is what this budget is designed to do, and when it is examined it will be seen that it is orientated in this direction very strongly indeed.  This is most noticeable on the capital side.</P>
    <P>We have a problem here in the presentation of the budget, to be quite frank about it.  The traditional system under which the expenditure figures are published first and accepted as given and then the Minister comes in <Col N="927" /> to find the money to pay for the expenditure is one which can give a false impression of the impact of the budget. The budget is not just the Minister for Finance coming in and announcing £100 million extra taxation.  The budget is the sum total of the decisions taken by Government on expenditure and revenue and it is only when seen as a whole that its impact can be seen.  Virtually every budget involves some increase in taxation. That does not mean that every budget is deflationary.  It is the overall impact of expenditure and revenue, current and capital, which determines whether the budget is deflationary or reflationary. If one takes the budget as a whole and examine its composition, current and capital, and the increases under different headings, and take this in conjunction with the increase in taxation one gets an overall picture of a budget which is to a significant degree reflationary, not strongly so because the financial constraints are such that there is a limit to what can be done, but strongly, orientated in that direction.</P>
    <P>A broad test that one can apply as to whether a budget is reflationary or not, before looking at details of the pattern of expenditure and taxation, is the trend of capital spending and of current deficit.  Current deficit as now forecast is higher than last year by about £68 million.  This represents an increase which is significantly higher but not enormously higher than the expected increase in the cost of living.  It means the deficit will be slightly larger in real terms.  On the capital side the increase in capital spending foreshadowed is 27½ per cent which is roughly twice the expected increase in the cost of living during the year.  This means that the volume of capital spending is up 14 per cent.  A budget which after the addition of taxation involves a somewhat higher current deficit and a significant increase in capital spending is a budget which in broad terms is reflationary.</P>
    <P>When one comes to examine the composition of the spending, on the capital side in particular, one sees how strongly orientated it is in this direction because, if Deputies examine the <Col N="928" /> capital programme they will find that there is a very striking increase in certain particular areas, the areas which are most likely to generate employment, the areas in particular of industry and tourism and I would add as a very productive area, the modernisation of agriculture.  Taking these three together, in the 1975 budget these three together absorbed about 22½ per cent of the Exchequer capital spending.  The increase in spending in these areas is 70 per cent, which is a colossal increase, an increase in real terms of over 50 per cent.  Even allowing for price changes, that is a colossal increase in capital investment in these highly productive areas most of which have important employment implications. The effect has been, in fact, that something like 60 per cent of the whole increase in capital spending is concentrated in these areas, which themselves represent barely one-fifth of existing capital spending.  There is a remarkable reorientation of the Government's capital programme in a highly productive direction, in a direction most likely to yield economic growth and increased employment.  The combination, therefore, of the overall pattern of the budget with a somewhat increased current deficit in real terms and a substantially increased capital programme in real terms, and within that capital programme priority given to productive projects, industry, tourism and the modernisation of agriculture&mdash;the sum total of that is a significant reflation of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is necessarily limited because of financial constraints, and it has involved considerable restraint in other areas to divert resources in these directions in order to achieve this result. Certainly, nobody looking at the budget objectively could regard it as deflationary; it is a reflationary budget within the limits of what is possible at this time.  The problem the Government faces in this budget is the large increases required under the headings of public service pay and remuneration of debt.  Public service pay increases are, of course, limited to the carry-over effect of increases in a national wage round last year, together with some special claims conceded <Col N="929" /> in the early part of the year, before the Government indicated that they were not in a position to make further concessions in the form of special claims.</P>
    <P>The carry-over effect of the national wage round into 1976, and of whatever special claims were conceded in the first half of last year, without any further increase in public pay in the current year&mdash;apart from the 2.8 per cent arising from the last stage of the 16th round&mdash;is an increase of £112 million, or about 20 per cent in public service pay.  Of that figure 2 per cent is accounted for by increased numbers in two areas, in the Army and in teaching to keep up with the increased number of pupils, something I am sure Deputy Wilson will welcome although no doubt he will say it is inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the two areas in which priority is given in regard to numbers.  It is an 18 per cent increase per capita arising from the carry-over effect.  There is £100 million extra in remuneration of debt arising from the increased borrowing required last year.  Therefore, these two areas together account for something approaching twice the buoyancy of tax revenue which is estimated at £129 million.  Either one of these on its own would absorb almost the whole of the buoyancy of tax revenue.  In addition, the Government have to provide for the increased cost of social welfare, the carry-over effect of last year's increases, and the fact that even with gently declining unemployment as we are likely to have from now on the volume of unemployment during much of the year will, nevertheless, be higher than it was at the same period last year.  Even if there were no socal welfare increases, and we have given a 10 per cent increase to cover the first six months of the financial year, we would have to face an increase.  In addition there is the carry-over effect of the subsidies given last year in connection with the reduction of the cost of living and the Government's counter-inflationary policies and in its successful efforts to <Col N="930" /> have the national wage agreement renegotiated, and all these have to be paid for before one comes to Government spending proper, the rest of non-pay expenditure.  In that area the Government have taken severe measures to cut back on any unnecessary expenditure which does not generate employment. This is an area where the Government can and must do something. It is an area where the increase in non-pay expenditure, apart from social welfare and the subsidies, is an increase of only 11 per cent which in real terms means a reduction of 3 per cent in this area.  The reduction was achieved by careful pruning of expenditure under many headings, but all headings that would not have an effect on employment.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Government have been able, for the first time in many years&mdash;I am not sure if this has happened before in living memory&mdash;to actually cut the volume of non-pay expenditure in this way by pruning, under a whole variety of headings, is a substantial achievement.  It involved cutting out something like 20 per cent of the increases sought by different Departments.  It was a difficult and painful exercise but one well worth while, because inevitably over the years the public current spending develops a certain amount of fat which needs to be pruned from time to time.  In conditions like the present that pruning was necessary, desirable and healthy.  An important feature of the budget is that there has been this holding-down of non-pay expenditure in real terms, diversion of resources on to the capital side and, within the capital programme itself, a marked diversion towards productive investment. All these features of the budget should help to achieve good economic results in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been allegations from the other side of the House that the budget is not alone deflationary but that it is inflationary.  It is hard to reconcile these different allegations, but it is worth considering the budget in this context.  In my view the budget is not an inflationary budget.  At this stage I should like to say something about Fianna Fáil's proposals about the budget now and over the last <Col N="931" /> couple of years.  It is worth reviewing them to see where we would be if Fianna Fáil were in Government, on the dubious assumption that if in Government they would have done the things which they said they would do while in Opposition.  In the course of an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> Deputy Colley suggested tax increases which were slightly lower than the Government introduced, of the order of £75 million to £100 million.  He suggested that the Government should rely largely on the old reliables and, to a very significant extent, we have done so.  He also spoke of the need to increase taxes that do not affect employment and/or inflation, but he was notably unspecific as to what form of taxation has these beneficial characteristics. It would be useful if during the course of the debate Fianna Fáil Deputies would indicate what this magic tax is.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that Deputy Colley advocated taxation of the approximate order of magnitude of that which has been imposed and that he advocated a fair degree of reliance on the old reliables Fianna Fáil nevertheless opposed the tax increases.  If they had been successful in their efforts in opposing them the deficit facing us would be larger than it is today.</P>

      <P>It is the Opposition's job to dodge, but they should dodge a little more elegantly.  Let us review Fianna Fáil's proposals.  We have been doing some research into those proposals in an effort to find out what the cost of them would be. I should like to sum up for the House the size of deficits we would have had to face in the last couple of years if Fianna Fáil's proposals were adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1974 Deputy Lynch proposed that we should have increased social welfare by 25 per cent as against an increase of 18 per cent which we gave.  That would have cost £8 million extra.  Deputy Lynch wanted tax-free allowances which would give people a saving of £125 for a man, wife and three children, and that would have cost, conservatively, £20 million extra.  He wanted agricultural rates abolished and that would have cost £18 million extra.  He also wanted a subsidy on the green pound from September, 1974, which would have cost £6 million extra.  If those proposals of Fianna Fáil had been adopted the deficit in 1974 would have been about 50 per cent greater than it was; instead of £91 million it would have been £144 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 1975 Fianna Fáil made a number of proposals.  They were against the petrol and other indirect tax rises. Had they not been imposed the deficit would have been £60 million greater. They wanted to introduce, they claimed, certain subsidies earlier than the Government.  Deputy Colley claimed that he said this in a speech in September, 1974, but diligent research has so far failed to elicit any published statement to this effect, but I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil speakers will direct our attention to what we have missed.  The subsequent claim to have proposed these VAT reductions in subsidies as early as that, if true and if it is what Fianna Fáil would have done, would have meant a net cost of £45 million more than the cost of the subsidies introduced in June by the National Coalition. Fianna Fáil also wanted a 20 per cent <Col N="933" /> tax allowance rise as against the 15 per cent which we were able to concede, and that would have cost £9 million extra.  They thought that instead of £11 million for industry we should have given £50 million; that would have cost £39 million extra.  They did not want capital taxes introduced and they spent a lot of time trying to stop them; that would have cost about £3 million.</P>
    <P>Allowing for possible savings in public-sector pay, if their proposals had been introduced there might have been a saving of £15 million in public-sector pay and the effect of all this would be an additional deficit of £141 million in 1975 in addition to the £52 million extra deficit they would have carried over from 1974.  That means that in 1975 the deficit would have been not £259 million but £452 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to 1976, as far as I can calculate the effect of their proposals for this year and the carry over from the two previous years would have given us an opening deficit of £586 million as against £433 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said he would have increased taxation by £75 million to £100 million and the remaining deficit would have been about £486 million to £511 million.  Fianna Fáil policy, as stated in Fianna Fáil utterances &mdash; I hope I have not omitted or distorted any statement they have made; I think I have given an accurate account&mdash; would have yielded a deficit of £144 million in 1974 as against £91 million, of £452 million in 1975 as against £259 million, and somewhere of the order of £500 million in 1976 as against £327 million.  Fianna Fáil statements were made with a certain amount of prodigality which opposition encourages and government makes impossible.</P>
    <P>We would have been approximately £600 million more in deficit under Fianna Fáil with an appropriate amount of additional remuneration of debt.  I have given Deputies all the figures.  I have shown my hand completely and they can tell me if I have misrepresented them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy asked that question.  In order to prevent these deficits increasing in this way as I calculated the buoyancy of revenue would need to have been more than 50 per cent higher as a result of these magnificent Fianna Fáil policies.  The best rate of buoyancy we have had in recent years is about 20 per cent and it is not to be believed that even the prodigality of Fianna Fáil in having these massive deficits and spending on the scale they proposed would have increased by two-and-a-half times the best figure for buoyancy the country has ever achieved.</P>

      <P>We should not be misled too much by Fianna Fáil references to the possibility of inducing buoyancy by the prodigality of their policies.  For a party who have made proposals on these lines, which would have left us £600 million more in deficit after four years, to accuse us of being spendthrift shows a degree of effrontery which does great credit to the Opposition in terms of their oratorical prowess but very little in terms of their economic expertise.</P>
      <P>I must not omit a further Fianna Fáil proposal, if it is such, that put forward by their economic adviser, Martin O'Donoghue, who before the budget called for a 10 per cent cut in public service pay and a £30 million cut in social welfare.  He was speaking at a conference a few days ago.  If this was a Fianna Fáil proposal it would have brought the deficit down to not more than £80 million above what it is for the current year.</P>

For Fianna Fáil to move from their policy in the sixties of absolutely balancing every budget within the £4 million tolerance for net errors of estimation and to reach the stage of advocating a deficit of £600 million in a single year is carrying conversion too far.

      <P>The number of interruptions during my economic analysis is a fair indication that I must have struck very near the bone and naturally that gives me great pleasure.  We should look ahead to the future and, given the stimulus to the economy provided by this budget, we should see what kind of prospect there is for the economy in the period immediately ahead.  As the Minister for Finance wisely and courageously looked further ahead, we must also consider the medium-term future which is in many ways a pretty grim one because of the problems facing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> So far as the immediate future is concerned, there has been a limited recovery, a bouncing off the bottom of the depression in recent months. The Government's budgetary measures should maintain this impetus and improve it so that during the greater part of this year there should be some recovery in the economy and a small decline in unemployment, seasonally adjusted.  The decline in unemployment will appear greater than it is when we get over the hump of the seasonal peak in March&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not be deceived by that because the underlying trend is unlikely to show a very sharp drop in unemployment and one could easily be deceived by the non-seasonally adjusted figures from March to July.  There will be some small recovery in the economy and an improvement in the underlying trend of unemployment, a continuation of the trend we have had since last October in the seasonally adjusted figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be until the second half and the end of the year that this recovery is likely to take more concrete shape when the present recovery in the United States and Japan communicates itself to Europe in the first half of the year and eventually to Britain and to us.  We are not helped here by the fact that we are still to a significant degree dependent on the UK economy&mdash;even after three years' membership of the EEC.  That economy is likely to be one of the more sluggish in Europe this year, as in so many past years.  Nevertheless, towards the end of the year the stimulus of increased external demand should begin to have its impact and it should stimulate confidence here. We have a very substantial spare capacity at present and with the availability of labour which, God help us, is certainly the least of our problems &mdash;there are far too many people available&mdash;and the spare capacity within industry it will be possible to achieve very substantial increases in output, in productivity and substantial improvements in labour costs if we can <Col N="938" /> maintain the pay pause during the year which should put us in a good position to face 1977 and 1978, years which are likely to be in the world, in Europe and hopefully in this country years of very rapid economic growth indeed.</P>
    <P>The problem will be how the 1977-78 boom is handled by the great economic powers of the world.  Do they handle it wisely so that growth can be maintained thereafter or do we plunge again into another recession because of the inability of the major countries in the capitalist world jointly to control their economies? That is a question one could not begin to answer at this stage.  We ought at this stage to prepare for the very sharp rise in demand and output in 1977 and 1978.  We ought to begin to consider how we handle that situation because it will be important that we do not allow an excessive proportion of the increased output to be diverted to private consumption and that we operate policies, difficult though they may be to operate and unpopular though they may be, to divert as much as possible of the increased resources into productive investment.</P>
    <P>The policies that we have adopted over the last 50 years, although they have given us a measure of economic growth, have proved, as the Minister for Finance pointed out so effectively yesterday, quite inadequate to the scale of our employment surplus problem, one which will be more difficult in the years ahead than it has been in those years.  This is the real difficulty we face.  It is aggravated because the number of people coming on the labour market will be greater. We have gone through a period when there has been an increase in marriage and birth rates which will impinge on the entries to the labour market in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>We have gone through a period when there was a very rapid intake in the educational sector, which at a certain point begins to taper off, so that the extra people taken out of the labour market entrants each year to be retained in education will begin to diminish.  That is not very well put but <Col N="939" /> it is a difficult concept.  Over recent years the number of people entering the labour market has been consistently lower than the number of people passing 15 years of age because each year more people have remained on in the educational sector. I believe that process has already begun to diminish to some degree and the retentions in the educational sector will not be such a big factor in reducing input into the labour market.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but is there not also a lay off in that some people continued in school this year who, if they had jobs available, would not have done so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an immediate factor present certainly.  At the moment there will be people staying on in school and some going to university as the safest place to be in a period of high unemployment so that they will be released on the market also.  That is a relatively small and temporary addition.  I am thinking more of long term trends running against us.  There is the very sharp increase in the number of married women in employment, the whole change of attitudes here moving from the position where married women remaining in employment after marriage was commonly disapproved of to a stage where married women seem to feel that they will be found some way inadequate if they do not remain on in employment. This shift in attitudes here means that a significant proportion of the additional vacancies becoming available will be taken up by married women on a scale that was not the case previously, or, to put it another way around, that the vacancies which in the past occurred almost automatically on marriage will in the future only occur in a certain number of cases on marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a problem that vacancies for people coming on the labour market for the first time will become more acute.  The number of <Col N="940" /> extra jobs needed at any time is a function, on the one hand, of vacancies becoming available and, on the other hand, people coming on the labour market.  These are two aggregates. It is the difference between them which determines the number of extra jobs required.  If you get even quite small changes in either or both aggregates you can get very big changes in the residual which is the number of new jobs required.  The increase in the number of new jobs required is likely to be quite disproportionate. The figure is, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, likely to be on a scale far beyond anything we have been able to cope with hitherto.</P>
      <P>We no longer can get away with the easy outlet of emigration which in the past was the case.  Where emigration was easily available people were accustomed to emigrate and this deprived Irish Governments of the incentive to solve our problems at home.  Over 50 years we had things too easy.  If it was not possible for people to emigrate as easily as they could in those years the rise in unemployment here on a massive scale would have forced Governments of all complexions into much more radical measures to deal with the unemployment problem.  That ready access to emigration is not there any longer.  The outlets are not that easy.</P>
      <P>Other countries will also suffer a long term structural unemployment problem which will make them places to which people will be rather reluctant to go.  We have, rightly, improved our social welfare provisions to a point where there is no longer the pressure to move to Britain because the dole was higher there than it was here.  It used to be the case for many years right through the period of the last Government, it must be said.  That has changed, too, and the contrast between Northern Ireland and the Republic, where in Northern Ireland people remained at home because the dole was high and they did not emigrate, and in the Republic, where people left because the social welfare benefits were better in Britain, has now disappeared, and the incentive to emigrate has disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must begin to solve these <Col N="941" /> problems at home.  The scale of difficulties this will create is not understood and the extent to which it will be necessary for us to shift our policies over towards a much larger scale of productive investment is not understood.  The implications of that for the availability of resources for other purposes is not understood.  It will be the job of politicians, and I hope Fianna Fáil will join construtively with us in trying to get this message across in a general way, while naturally continuing to criticise the Government in regard to the carrying out of their duties, which is the job of an Opposition, in trying to educate public opinion to the scale of the problems that will face us in the period after this 1977-78 boom as we move on towards the eighties and of the need to change many popular, easy policies and do things which are difficult and tough, which will be necessary, in order to obtain employment on the scale which will be needed in that period.  This is something to which we must turn our minds as we move ahead through this year.  The immediate task facing us will be to consider what policies we should adopt to ensure that the increased output in 1977-78 does not go in the wrong direction to a consumer boom but that it is diverted to constructive national purposes, what kind of policies, what kind of tax policies will make that possible.  This is the difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is guaranteeing that 1977-78 will be a boom period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is highly probable and this country does not have to benefit from it.  In the past we have shown our capacity to fail to benefit from booms abroad.  This happened in the fifties when the economy of this country stagnated while that of others was booming.  We are capable of missing out in a boom but we do not have to.  If we have self-discipline to come through this year with a pay pause and come into 1977 in a good posture with regard to level of income, level of pay, level of labour costs, then the boom that pretty certainly <Col N="942" /> will occur in the world at large and in Europe in 1977-78 can overflow to this country.  Our problem is to arrive in 1977 in the right posture in terms of income levels and then to use our powers of government wisely in those years, to begin the diversion of resources into investments on the kind of scale necessary to cope with the employment problems which we will face in those years and in the years that follow.</P>

      <P>This seems to me to be the kind of approach which we should be adopting towards our economic problems at present.  For this purpose the economic plan being prepared by the Government will provide the framework for public discussion and debate.  We must start by posing the issues, by telling people what kind of future there is for them if we job along the way we have been going traditionally and where that will leave us in terms of growth rates and unemployment.  We then have to show them the contrast, what could be achieved if we have the courage to take tough decisions, the kind of growth that could be achieved, the kind of impact on employment.</P>
      <P>These are the alternatives we must pose, and the purpose of planning should first be to pose these alternatives, to get public discussion going, to mobilise public opinion in favour of courageous policies based on a medium-term plan that will relate to the scale of the problems that we have to face.  That is the job we have ahead of us, and with this budget behind us we can embark on that plan.</P>

      <P>There have been some very famous European composers of fairytales&mdash;the Grimm Brothers, Hans Christian Andersen and others&mdash;but most of them did not go for their raw material to economics, which is not a very promising place to go for raw materials for fairytales, but I must say that with a fascinating piece of word-weaving the Minister for Foreign Affairs has just done that.  He has composed a marvellous fairytale about <Col N="943" /> the economy and the future, and history he left out.  When talking about deficits he never went back to look at the purse as it was handed to the present Minister for Finance after a long period of stewardship by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>He spoke about the lack of economic expertise on this side of the House, and if it is evidence of economic expertise to estimate a current budget deficit of £24.6 million for 1975 and end up with a £259 million deficit, that is the kind of economic expertise I for one would be very willing to do without.  If I also had come here claiming I had a packet to right the economy in 1976 and estimated a current budget deficit of £327 million, I would be doubtful about my economic expertise, and I would be doubly doubtful if it dawned on me that I might be wrong in this one too and that the deficit at the end of 1976 might be proportionately as large in difference from the estimated one, as happened last year.</P>
      <P>The Government to a certain extent were saved last year by what was called the buoyancy of earnings from agriculture, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was taking on the prophet role did not consider this at all, though he quoted from the Central Bank Report on several occasions.  On page 23 that report states:</P>
      <P>Agricultural exports may not be so buoyant in 1976.  In particular the volume of cattle and beef exports is forecast to fall by about one third and the increase in the price of dairy exports may be as little as one half of that which took place in 1975.  These figures suggest that there will actually be a decrease in the value of agricultural exports in 1976 of about 5 per cent and a fall in volume of about 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister was getting the raw material for his economic fantasy he carefully avoided all references in the documents from which he quoted that would tend to give a gloomier picture of the economic prospect for <Col N="944" /> this year, and one of the points that should be made is that there has been a fall in cattle output of 560,000 head.  This is bound to cause economic difficulty later in 1976.</P>
    <P>Nearly everything the Minister for Finance said yesterday posited a pay pause in the theoretical part of the speech; and in the practical part of it nearly everything he did was guaranteeing that there would not be and could not be a pay pause.  Most of the speakers so far have referred in particular to the increase in the cost of petrol.  There is also an increase in the cost of insurance on cars, there may very well be a scarcity of petrol at the end of this year, there is the increase in VAT charges, the increase in motor vehicle duty&mdash;all nails in the coffin of the social partnership.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to be able to think up our own terminology when we are dealing with our own problems.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach wrote about this recently.  We talk about social partners because our neighbour talks social contracts.  We seem to be taking everything from across the water, including our economic and social terminology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And our furniture, of course.  The social partners can sit on it.  The fact is that you cannot continue to have a partnership if one of the partners, namely the Government, is inefficient and unjust, and if the Government call for a pay pause and at the same time stick their hands into the pockets of the workers, the social partners, it is very hard to build confidence or to guarantee that any kind of a partnership will continue to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like if the Minister for Finance would comment on this whole question later on&mdash;it is one that puzzles me&mdash;of wages and competitiveness in the export business.  Some economists have been dubious about this matter: for example, has the economic state of the countries to which goods are being exported a far greater effect on depressing the export market than have the wages of our workers?  I am not coming down on <Col N="945" /> one side or the other&mdash;I am open to conviction on the matter.  If one is convinced, then it should be possible to convince the perfectly reasonable people who compose the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In the past three years, according to the documentation, there has been a 251 per cent increase in the annual borrowing of the Central Bank.  To what purpose?  I shall come back to this later.</P>
    <P>In 1973, 1974 and 1975 we had an 11 per cent, a 17 per cent and a 21 per cent inflation rate respectively.  We had fantasy deficits from the Minister for Foreign Affairs today for Fianna Fáil. In 1972-73 the deficit was £5½ million. In 1973-74 it was £10 million. Now we begin to get into business. For the nine months in 1974 it was £92 million.  In 1975 it was £259 million and the figure projected for 1976 is £327 million.  Economic expertise, my granny's grunt!  Anyone who has the effrontery to claim economic expertise and end up with that kind of figure, while productive investment is declining, has a brass neck.  I would suggest that the Director of the National Gallery should send over to the office of the Minister for Finance a lovely set of paintings.  I think they are on loan from Sir Alfred Beit.  The pictures are called &ldquo;The Prodigal Son&rdquo;.  They were painted by a famous painter, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo.  I think there are four pictures altogether.  There is a remarkable resemblance between the prodigal son and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The lesson is an expensive one, I will admit.  The whole <i>mise en scène</i> is extremely good.  There is a nice young man, well-groomed in picture No. 1, surrounded by luxury and wealth.  He is given his patrimony to go and set up on his own.  In the second picture&mdash;I speak from memory &mdash;he is carousing, spending his money on obviously unproductive purposes. In the third he has reached the end of the trail.  The husks the swine ate are providing him with a meal.  But there is a happy ending, as we all know.  In the last picture he is back <Col N="946" /> home.  He has been welcomed and&mdash; I am afraid Murillo's idea of a fatted calf and mine would be different&mdash; there is a calf peeping in at a door, obviously ready for the slaughter.  The Minister for Finance might have difficulty about the calf because we have allowed a great number of our calves to be sent to Italy.  I think it would be a good thing for the Minister to get these paintings&mdash;they are magnificent&mdash;and to study them and learn a lesson from them.  The country would benefit thereby.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said there was a recovery around the corner.  Of course this recovery was around the corner for 1975, but it did not materialise.  There must be&mdash;I agree with him&mdash;a certain recovery anyway seeing that there must be restocking. There has been a considerable amount of&mdash;I do not like the word, but the economists are using it &mdash;destocking over the last couple of years, a run down of stocks, and there is bound to be a restocking and so there will be a stimulus to imports and, in general, that should improve the economy.</P>
      <P>Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard is bare, or nearly bare, and it will have to be restocked and this should have a good effect on the economy.  In 1975 there was a fall of 3¼ per cent in gross national product, and I cannot understand why the Minister for Foreign Affairs, so jocular, so avuncular and so jovial about the economic situation, did not avert to this.  I want to quote now from page 10 of the report of the Central Bank:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties of the present recession it is necessary to stress also the longer-term needs of the economy, particularly, a high rate of investment to create capacity to meet growing employment need.</P>
      <P>Except for a little bit of a proviso at the end the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not say very much in this regard.</P>
      <P>In turn, this high rate of investment requires an adequate level of domestic savings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> They went up last year because people began to get afraid.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;including, in particular, retained profits.</P>
    <P>The general trend on the part of members of the Government, including the Minister for Finance, has been to criticise people with wealth, to say a whole series of laws was necessary to milk certain people of wealth to which they were not entitled.  I would be very much in favour of a proper distribution of wealth because I know the social evil and the danger of concentrating wealth in too few hands, but at times terms were being used&mdash; universal discourse was employed&mdash; more suited to other societies than to ours.  I thought really that in this budget the Minister would give tax concessions to industrialists who were expanding employment and expanding production to encourage them to have confidence in the Government, because these people have not much confidence in the Government at present and part of the recession and the stagnation is due to that lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to a discussion we had on the IDA Bill which is relevant to this point.  During the Second Stage debate I made reference to an article by the head of the ESRI.  He pointed out that the Danish Government was particularly lenient taxwise to industrialists who were investing and expanding their industries and employment&mdash;that happened in a country where taxes were very high. In my view, there is a case for this here.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the concessions of export tax reliefs. A particular type of industry I would like to see developing in my own area, for example, is a small industry with maybe not a very great potential for export.  That type of industry should get further relief from the the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>To me, the most important single problem facing the Minister and the Government at the present time is unemployment. Neither the Minister nor the Government should forget this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> There should be some mechanism which would keep the Government and the Opposition thinking all the time that this is a serious economic and social problem, a problem that demands everybody's ingenuity to solve.  It is also a problem which is fraught with danger.  When I made that comment here two years ago there were sniggers from a member of the Cabinet&mdash;not the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;when I said that there was a danger having a number of educated people doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I have spent most of my life with young people, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was right when he said that the tendency to want to emigrate is less than it was.  I am delighted that that is so.  As most of my schoolchildren have had to emigrate, I know a good deal about this.  Indeed, I emigrated for a short time myself.  I hope the young people will stand their ground and let themselves be heard in society, by Government and Opposition and by everyone who is charged with public responsibility. I cannot think of a mechanism, unless it were to reduce the salaries of TDs, administrators and so on, if the numbers of unemployed went beyond a certain figure.  We need something to keep this position in our minds all the time.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of visiting a far eastern country just over a year ago. To an aggravated extent this kind of problem existed there.  Of course, they had a much higher population than we had.  It was the most literate country in Asia and the inevitable happened: there was a teenage revolution. Thousands of young people were shot by a Government which contained a number of strong leftwing. Ministers&mdash;men who thought that that was the best ideology to apply to the social problems of their country.  I do not want to be a prophet of doom but I hope the young people will stay and let everyone in this House know that we are letting them down by not providing them with the opportunity of staying and making a living here.  That idea is implanted in my mind to such an extent that it is <Col N="949" /> a neurosis, and I wish everybody here felt the same about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is limited in the amount of manipulation he can do to create productive employment. The Minister for Labour told me that a survey of school leavers who did not have jobs was being conducted.  Is that right?  Can the Minister tell me anything about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the extent and the nature of the survey I cannot tell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an idea that it is a comprehensive survey for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could all bend our minds to thinking of ways in which young people could be gainfully employed. Even for a short time, they could be used to take a census.  This would be useful to the Government, this House, <Col N="950" /> the socialists and the economists.  I was at the annual general meeting of the National Library Association and there I heard about a cataloguing job that had been done by the prisoners at Portlaoise prison.  This drew a protest from a prison rights man later.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of work to be done in the National Library.  I realise that space might be the problem there, but I am sure reliable people could take that work home with them.  There are plenty of opportunities in the field of archaeology, indexing of newspapers, cataloguing of archives in county towns and so on. This work is worthwhile for the country and would give jobs for a time to young people who are now unemployed.</P>
