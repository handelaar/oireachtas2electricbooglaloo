    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state the progress being made regarding the phasing out of hospitals within the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of three of the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals&mdash;Sir Patrick Dun's, Mercers and Baggot Street&mdash;is scheduled to take place when the development of St. James's Hospital now being planned, is effected.  Phasing out of other Federated Hospitals is dependent on the programme for the development of other major hospitals in Dublin, notably the new hospital at Newlands Cross.</P>
      <P>A certain movement of services from the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals Group to St. James's has taken place or is under consideration. This movement, in general, has my support and in the meantime the position of the various hospitals in the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister when the first of the federated hospitals will be closed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said this, when the development of St. James's Hospital has been effected, but there has been a partial transfer in respect of St. James's Hospital for surgery and <Col N="1376" /> for medicine where they have taken over about 49 beds, 34 for medicine and 15 for surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from what the Minister says that these hospitals cannot be saved, that they will go anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They have agreed to be phased into St. James's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if Beaumont Hospital is included in this programme and what are the present plans for the hospital?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning has not started yet, but there are hopeful negotiations in respect of a site there. I am informed there will be no difficulty about planning and amenities such as water and sewerage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo; in respect of the site.  The site is fixed but negotiations are proceeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be possible to go ahead with the planning of the hospitals in anticipation of the acquisition of the site rather than have delays caused by legal tie-ups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations and discussions are going along in regard to Beaumont, but as I indicated on another occasion, priority has been given to St. James's Hospital as far as planning is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his Department have <Col N="1377" /> considered alternative methods of financing the health services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>An inter-departmental working party are at present examining the financing of the health and social welfare services with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>1)  To examine the present system of financing the social welfare and health services and its capacity to meet the requirements of those services in the light of probable future trends and developments and in particular of the present and prospective budgetary constraints.</P>
      <P>2)  To recommend such changes and improvements in the system as are considered necessary.</P>
      <P>3)  To prepare a broad outline of any legislation which may be necessary to give effect to those recommendations.</P>
      <P>I expect that the committee will be reporting on the very complex problems involved within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this is the inter-departmental committee who have been sitting for some time.  Has the Minister anything to say about the proposal which Deputy O'Connell has put forward on a number of occasions about the setting up of an all-party committee of this House to look into the matter?  Does one take the place of the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two separate and distinct things.  The one referred to in the question is in connection with the financing of the health services: the other is in connection with the reappraisal of all the health services, particularly in regard to the establishment of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but, first, could the Minister tell the House in connection with this question anything about his thinking in regard to the establishment of an all-party committee of this House to review the health services in their entirety?  Secondly, does he regard it <Col N="1378" /> as appropriate that, in a matter of such fundamental public importance as the financing of the health services, an inter-departmental committee is an appropriate body to examine the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As it was appropriate in 1967, I think it is appropriate in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, may I say the Minister has not answered either of my two questions? They are legitimate, straightforward questions: first, has the Minister anything to say about the suggestion that an all-party committee of the House be established; and, secondly, does he consider that this inter-departmental committee can make recommendations of any value in regard to a matter of such fundamental public importance as the financing of the health services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two separate and distinct questions.  This refers to the financing of the social services. What was raised here in debate was a review of the health board system since it was established five years ago. That was the the consensus of opinion here in this House, that that sort of committee representing members of the House and possibly some others would be established in order to make this over-all review.  This is, if you like, a duplication of an effort which was made in 1967 to consider the financing not alone of social welfare and health but of education as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if I am right in thinking that the inter-departmental committee reviewing the finances of the health services consists purely of representatives of the two Departments for which he is responsible, namely, Health and Social Welfare?  Are there any other departmental representatives involved, particularly representatives of the Department of Finance and, secondly, at what level of the public service is this departmental committee carrying out this review&mdash;principal officer, clerical officer, or what?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the protestations of public representatives and the general public against the demolition of the Fermoy Hospital, County Cork, and in view of the lack of hospital accommodation in the area, he will immediately direct the Southern Health Board to discontinue demolition of the buildings pending further inquiry and consideration of the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the proposed demolition of block A of Fermoy hospital.  This block is in very poor condition and adequate and improved alternative accommodation is, I understand, available for those previously housed there or still there.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I do not intend to intervene in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a recent press report (details supplied) on the acute financial difficulties of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children; and if he will provide an adequate grant-in-aid to enable the society to continue its invaluable work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  The current <Col N="1380" /> level of contribution to the society from public funds represents approximately two-thirds of its agreed expenditure for the current year.  I would regard this level of contribution as reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that women married in this country whose husbands have deserted them, divorced them in England, remarried and subsequently died, are not classed as legal widows in this country and that the only entitlement available to them is the deserted wife's allowance; the action he intends taking; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>As is clear from my reply to Deputy Cronin's question of 2nd March, 1976, I am aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As I explained previously, the legal advice available to my Department has always been to the effect that a divorce properly obtained by a person domiciled in another jurisdiction must be recognised as valid in this country.</P>
      <P>Continuation of payments under the schemes of deserted wife's allowance and deserted wife's benefit after the deaths of deserting husbands ensures to the women concerned an income from my Department equivalent to that which they might obtain as widows. This is a significant improvement on the position which existed prior to the introduction of these schemes.</P>
      <P>The problem of divorce is a complex one which affects matters other than widow's pensions&mdash;for example, the validity of subsequent marriages, devolution of property <i>et cetera</i>.  The Minister for Social Welfare has always been guided by the general law of the country as interpreted by the Attorney General and the Courts.  If there should be a change in that law or in its interpretation I will give effect to such change in relation to widows' pensions, but action to bring about a change would not be a matter for my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the devolution of the deceased husband's <Col N="1381" /> property.  As I understand it, a widow domiciled in Ireland cannot benefit under the will made by the husband. Is that not the position?  Effectively the Irish widow cannot remarry, even if she so desires, having regard to the effect of the 1937 Constitution and effectively this country does not give her any legal identity whatsoever in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am awaiting a question from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us what action the Government contemplate taking to do away with this very serious and upsetting anomaly?  The Minister will agree that the Irish widows are not responsible for the actions of their husbands in leaving them and going to another jurisdiction and it seems very unfair that they should suffer as a result of an action&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order.  The Deputy may not proceed to make a speech under the guise of asking a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a speech I would like to make at considerable length and I am doing my best.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be made now.  This is Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would agree that, in addition to the anomaly relating to the widow, if the widow has children there is also an anomaly there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned only with a deserted wife's entitlement to social welfare and I would not be prepared in present circumstances or as Minister for Social Welfare to reply to the very many points made by the Deputy with regard to the position generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will, as deputy political leader of the country, accept collective responsibility for the invidious and serious situation these women, who lack a legal identity, find themselves in. Surely the Minister would tell the House, arising out of what he has <Col N="1382" /> said, what action he and his Government intend taking in this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest the Deputy put down a question on all these points.  The question is directed towards the entitlement of women whose husbands have obtained divorces in another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recognise that what we are concerned with in this question is the entitlement of this very limited group of people to social welfare benefits and does he not further recognise that we are not here concerned with any complicated legal questions of their exact standing before the law and would he admit that, if he wished to do so, he could simply make a ministerial regulation making these particular benefits available to this category of persons, if so minded, without regard to any complicated legal question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy has read the question or listened to the reply.  I have been asked what is the position of these people and what their entitlement is.  They are still entitled to a deserted wife's allowance, which is the very same amount as a widow's non-contributory allowance, to which they would ordinarily be entitled if there was no divorce at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other aspects to this matter.  Would the Minister give me a straightforward answer to this simple question?  If he wished to bring this limited category of persons into entitlement for benefits which widows have, he could do that by simple ministerial regulation under the Social Welfare Act without regard to any other legal difficulties or complications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no need to do that.  They get deserted wives' allowances and the deserted wife's allowance is the same amount as they would get by way of widow's noncontributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more involved than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more involved in Social Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks at my question, to follow up what Deputy Haughey has said, I have said that these particular women&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are not classed as legal widows.  That is the first part of the question.  Surely that deserves an answer.  What action do the Government intend taking to ensure these people be given legality&mdash;in other words, recognised as widows&mdash;arising out of a situation for which they have no responsibility and for which the Government in the circumstances appear to be avoiding responsibility and the second part of the question, of course, relates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They give them recognition as far as payment of an allowance is concerned.  The position the Deputy describes obtained up to 1974 and it was changed in 1974 to make sure they would get some sort of allowance.  Up to 1974 they would not get anything.</P>

She appealed against this decision and after an oral hearing of the appeal, at which she attended and gave evidence on her own behalf, an appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.

      <P>The annual repayment on a local authority house purchase loan of £4,500 advanced in May, 1975, over a repayment period of 30 years was £497.38.  The corresponding figure for a similar amount advanced over the same repayment period in February, 1976, was £579.42.  I might <Col N="1385" /> add that a local authority house purchase loan is subsidised by the Exchequer which is currently paying in excess of 14½ per cent for capital issued by the local loans fund to local authorities at 12 per cent.</P>

      <P>I accept that it was not the Minister's intention but I am sure he will agree that if you calculate the amount payable over a 35-year period, which was the period in existence in May, 1975, you will get a lower figure than £497.</P>

      <P>That is not so.  I would refer the Minister to a speech made by him during Private Members' time last week when he stated he was anxious to encourage young people to build their own homes.  Will the Minister state if he regards this increase in repayments, which was caused directly by his own and the Government's intervention, as an incentive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the alternative is to move interest rates up and down, as happens with bank rates.  The people who are building their own homes and who are borrowing SDA loans are on fixed repayments and they fare better than they would if the interest rates moved up and down.  Is the Deputy suggesting that we should adopt that system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the number of years he took in relation to repayment was 30 years instead of 35 years and, of course, this means that the figure would be much lower if he had taken the period of 35 years.  The difference is quite exceptional.  Will the Minister <Col N="1386" /> not agree that a young couple with an income of £40 per week who wish to build their own home are being deprived of the State grant by the Minister?  Their interest rates have been increased but there has been no increase in the maximum loan or the maximum income limit.  Will the Minister not agree that this is a serious disincentive to people building their own homes?</P>

      <P>The Minister has not given a reply to my question.  All he can tell us is that it does not mean a thing.  I would ask the Minister if he is not perturbed about the serious fall in the number of applications for SDA loans because of the increase in the interest rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the position was the same as when I took up office as Minister for Local Government, namely, that the money could not be found anywhere else, I would be seriously perturbed.  However, in view of the fact that the vast amount of money available for SDA loans is being taken up fully and that there are other areas where the money can be found by those who want to build their houses, I do not think the situation is as set out by Deputy Faulkner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the SDA loans were intended for those least able to build their own homes?  Further, will he not agree that the increase in the interest rate, plus the fact that the loan is still at the level of £4,500 since May, 1973, is ensuring that these people who were previously entitled to the loans and who were able to build their homes are unable to make use of the loans now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in the Dublin area the amount being borrowed under those loans has dropped considerably but throughout <Col N="1387" /> the country the money is being taken up by people who want to build their own houses.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the difficulties that occasionally arise in establishing group water schemes off main water or regional water schemes because the main supply pipes prove too narrow to provide adequate supply, he will direct that mains be installed in future that will be adequate in width to meet such contingencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that such difficulties apply to older water supply schemes.  The normal practice in recent years is that new water supply schemes are planned to meet all requirements for the foreseeable future. This applies particularly to headworks schemes to provide source supplies for rural areas and includes pipeline capacities.  In addition, local authorities frequently make contributions to group schemes to enable larger capacity pipes to be provided where extensions for other areas may be envisaged later.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons advanced by the Civil Service Commissioners for their decision are that if Tuam had been selected, only one examination centre there involving only one superintendent would probably have been justified as was the case in previous years.  However, it <Col N="1389" /> has been the commissioners' experience that problems can occasionally arise in the holding of examinations in one centre with one superintendent. Such problems can be dealt with more satisfactorily where several centres are near each other.</P>
    <P>Therefore, whenever the commissioners have a choice, they prefer to hold examinations in cities or towns which are convenient for candidates, able to cater for large numbers of them and suitable for several examination centres.  For this reason, Galway city was selected as the centre for candidates in County Galway at this examination.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Deputy is aware, the decision in cases like this rests with the Land Commission.  I am not aware of the particulars in relation to the holding referred to by the Deputy.  If the Deputy gives me those particulars I will look into the matter.  In regard to this holding I should like to state that it contains 38a. 1r. 36p. and is described as being of heavy nature and difficult to work.  There are 17 acres of fair grazing which is rush infested; 16 acres consist of peaty hilly grazing with furze, rushes and some rock outcropping.  Five acres are covered with water and waste.  There is another 39-acre holding in the same townland in the final stages of acquisition by the Land Commission.  The holding the subject of the question was fully investigated by the Land Commission in relation to a request to consent to the sale under section 45 of the Land Act, 1965.  It transpires that the purchaser is Her Serene Highness, Princess Grace of Monaco. The Land Commission considered the matter and, having regard to the international status of the purchaser, her family association with the area and the land the subject of the question&mdash;I believe her forefathers owned it&mdash;and having regard to the respect, and affection in which Princess Grace is held in Mayo and in the country, came to the conclusion&mdash;I believe rightly so&mdash;that the local and national interest would be best served by permitting the sale.  They did so.  While I have no function in relation to the matter I entirely agree with what the Land Commission did in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree that we all would like to see Princess Grace coming here but the Land Commission might have considered making the land available to local congests.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the Government are pursuing the question of providing a 50-mile exclusive fishery limit for Ireland; and if he will state when he expects a firm decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the current discussions on the review of the EEC common fisheries policy arising out of the probable establishment of 200-mile economic zones as a result of the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference we have made it clear that Ireland will require a substantial exclusive zone up to 50 miles from our base lines.  Our case is based on the need for conservation of fish stocks and on the regional importance of the industry.</P>
      <P>In our view these grounds justify the exclusion of fishermen from other member states who have traditionally fished off our coasts, save to the extent that as part of a general arrangement involving adequate quotas for Irish fishermen in the 200-mile economic zone some provision might be made in an outer part of the proposed exclusive fishing zone for artisanal fishermen from ports in other member countries who have traditionally fished off our coasts, and who use boats of limited size and engine power.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the different member states varies considerably in this matter and negotiations are likely to be protracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state what obstacles are being placed in the Government's way in trying to achieve this 50-mile exclusive limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the Acquisition Treaty negotiated in 1971 provide for a common fisheries policy under which there will be no exclusive zone whatever after 1982 unless agreement is reached unanimously on some alternative arrangement.  Our problem is, starting from that somewhat weak bargaining position which we inherited, to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  Clearly, other countries have divergent interests.  These have to be reconciled in a result which will safeguard our legitimate interests and <Col N="1397" /> be acceptable to the other countries concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that if there is an agreement with the member states the 50-mile limit would not be reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless agreement is reached on some new arrangement which we are now attempting to negotiate, we are left with the situation negotiated by the previous Government in 1971 but I would be hopeful that some new arrangement will be reached which will protect our interests and I think the basis on which it is being approached is the one most likely to yield this result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of agreement not being reached, is it contemplated that unilateral action might be taken by the Government in this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no unilateral action we can take.  We adhered to the EEC on certain terms negotiated by the previous Government. Its laws are directly applicable here in respect of our territory and we are bound by them as we are bound by our own Constitution.  Our problem is to renegotiate this on a basis that will salvage the situation and give us a satisfactory result for our fishermen who are at present suffering severely from the inroads made into fish stocks off our coasts through overfishing by fishermen from other states, including member states of the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has laid emphasis on the negotiations in 1971.  Would he accept that at that time we were outside the EEC and very anxious to get inside?  Would he not agree that the Government are <Col N="1398" /> now, as full members of the EEC, in a much stronger position to negotiate on this matter and get the terms that the fishermen are so anxiously trying to get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are obviously in a stronger position to negotiate inside than outside, but our starting point of the negotiations is a difficult one.  I do not wish in anything I have said to reflect on the terms negotiated. There was a difficulty in that these countries decided to adopt this common fisheries policy before our entrance which I regarded as unfair and objectionable, but we were faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>.  Nobody should have any illusions as to the problems facing us in achieving an improvement starting from that very unsatisfactory position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy to encourage conservation in the use of energy.  District heating represents a potential means of achieving efficiency and economy in the use of energy and I am interested, therefore, in seeing studies undertaken to establish whether the savings potentially available are economically achievable in our circumstances.</P>
      <P>Among the factors which affect the situation are the capital costs, the design and location of existing or future generating stations, the present heating systems in areas which might be considered, the cost and feasibility of converting them and the question of freedom of choice of heating systems by the owners of the buildings which might be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board in 1975 published the results of a preliminary study which they had carried <Col N="1400" /> out on the possibilities of adopting a combined district heating system utilising rejected heat.  The preliminary study did not reach definite conclusions about the feasibility or economics of introducing such a system in Ireland.  The board are now carrying out further detailed examination to establish the extent to which such a system can be adopted.</P>
    <P>The District Heating Association of Ireland has also organised a number of meetings designed to inform all the interests concerned and the public in general of the possibilities of district heating and to promote the concept of district heating.</P>

      <P>District heating, as the Minister is aware, is widely used on the Continent, in Britain and the North of Ireland.  It is a big success on the Continent.  Would the Minister agree that the ESB should be encouraged or instructed to get into this field, for fuel conservation purposes and also to ensure that people will get centrally heated homes at a reasonable cost.  The ESB are always looking for new areas to develop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, of course. The ESB do not need encouragement or instruction from me.  They are doing it anyway.  They are interested in two locations in the country.  The ideal for the use of excess heat generated in generating stations would be new generating plant built next to a new town.  There is in Galway district heating in the form Deputy Coogan mentioned.  Ballymun is the prime example in Dublin.  The existing location of generating plants and the fact that there are many built-up areas where some of the houses have a different form of central heating and may not be willing to take district heating make the economics of it somewhat questionable.  There are two areas the subject of detailed study at the moment. One is next to the Marino station in Cork, and the other one is in Dublin where the Poolbeg station could supply district heating to a number of houses. A report is expected on these at the end of the current year.  I will give any Deputy who requires it information about the results.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that a receiver was appointed to <Col N="1403" /> the firm in question on 14th April last. The firm, which was established to produce specialised boots for the US market, has been experiencing serious difficulties in that market.  Efforts to secure alternative markets were not successful.</P>
      <P>The IDA, through SFADCo, their agents in the mid-west region, are endeavouring to find a suitable replacement project to safeguard employment in the area.  The IDA will be prepared to consider sympathetically the use of their full range of incentives to assist any suitable replacement project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that those workers were trained over a period of about six months in a highly specialised technique, and that their opportunity of getting employment in any other sort of industry in that area is very remote because there is very little.  In these circumstances would the Minister make a special effort to have this factory reopened in the same line of business, whether by the same firm or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I committed the IDA and SFADCo to making every effort to reopen.  I do not agree with the Deputy's suggestion in regard to the availability of employment in the surrounding area.  The maximum number of people employed in this factory was 12.  It came into production in December, 1974, but within an area of 12 miles of Knocklong there were 36 more industrial jobs in 1975 than there were in 1974. There are industrial jobs in the neighbourhood and the number has been increasing over the last three years&mdash;104, 114 and 150&mdash;within a 12 mile radius.  Therefore, while the claim for an alternative with the same skill is very strong, I would not base it on the unavailability of work.  It is very desirable to keep the skills that <Col N="1404" /> have been built up in that sort of occupation.  That is what SFADCo and the IDA are trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the management, which was imported from America for this firm, was particularly weak, and that on the marketing side the management was almost non-existent?  Has the Minister or the IDA any method whereby they could ensure that foreign management which is brought into this country is of an adequate standard to enable enterprises such as this to continue and not to collapse after a very short period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that the firm was a subsidiary of the US company which came on the basis that it possessed the market outlets in the USA.  The track record of the IDA for spotting and heading off potential failures is better than comparable promotion agencies in very many other countries.  If one were to draw such rigorous guidelines so as to totally rule out the possibility of failure a lot of valuable companies would be ruled out as well.  As the subsidiary of a USA company which possessed outlets it was a reasonable inference that if they decided to set up a plant in Ireland they would be able to market the product.  It was not so in this case.  I agree with what the Deputy says about the quality of management but that is something for which the IDA could not be blamed for not having foreseen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the parent company of this firm in the United States now has 900 orders a week, which would be more than adequate for both factories &mdash;the factory in Nebraska and the factory in County Limerick?  In those circumstances would the Minister not agree that it is extremely regrettable that after a very short period a foreign firm should be allowed, after availing of public money here by way of training grants and so on, to close the door and clear out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Deputy.  But the fact he has quoted about the orders in the United <Col N="1405" /> States in Nebraska is an indication that the IDA were drawing a legitimate inference that the production of that Irish factory could be marketed if the parent company were willing to do so.  What has happened is deplorable.  It is the sort of thing that is difficult to avoid unless one is going to draw such restrictive rules that foreign investment will be inhibited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of firms asked to tender for the £10m. contract on the NET project at Marino Point; if his attention has been drawn to the dissatisfaction expressed by Irish firms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The placing of contracts by NET is a management function, and as such is for decision by the board of the company.  My consent is not required.</P>
      <P>I am, however, informed by NET that the position is as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  The work referred to in these questions is the very technical and sophisticated job of erecting the main plant, comprising the installation of major components, such as reactor chambers, heat exchangers and other vessels which operate under high temperatures and pressures, and the erection of the necessary inter-connecting work to establish a continuous process plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> 2.  No separate contract has been placed for this work which forms part of the main contract for design and construction of the plant. Kellog International Corporation were selected by NET, after considering tenders from three foreign firms, as the contractors for the design, engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of the complete plant.  This firm is extremely experienced and competent in this specialised field and are and have been involved in the erection of a number of such plants throughout the world.</P>
    <P>3.  It has been the policy of NET that as far as possible subcontracts should be awarded by the main contractors to Irish contractors and a number of subcontracts have been awarded to such firms.  The awarding of subcontracts is of course subject to the paramount consideration that the plant must be completed on time and must be fully efficient.  It is the responsibility of the main contractor to ensure timely completion and quality of work.</P>
    <P>4.  The Marino Point project is different in scale and nature from anything so far built in Ireland.  There is only one larger ammonia plant operating in the world than the plant to be erected at Marino Point.  The Cork plant will have ten times the capacity of NET's existing ammonia plant at Arklow.  The urea plant, at 1,000 tons per day, will also be very large by world standards.  The work referred to by the Deputies is central to the safety and efficiency of the plant when completed and consequently it is essential that the optimum degree of management control must be applied to it and that it should be under the direct control of the main contractors, who are responsible for the design of the plant.</P>
    <P>5.  NET therefore decided that this aspect of the work should be carried out by direct labour under the guidance and supervision of the main contractors. Having so decided NET set about ensuring that the Irish input to the mechanical construction should be as high as possible.  I understand that virtually 90 per cent of the total cost <Col N="1407" /> of this part of the overall contract will be paid to Irish concerns and workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House why no Irish firm was asked to tender for this sub-contract although firms were asked to tender for other parts of the contract such as structural steelworks and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House already that there were only three firms in the world considered competent to offer designs for a basic plant&mdash;one German and two US firms with British subsidiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The work referred to in these questions concerns the efficient working up to the level guaranteed by the contract of extremely large and sophisticated chemical plant for which NET, in consultation with experts, considered there were only three firms in the world competent to undertake the work.  If these were to do the assembly of the chemical part of the plant, not the subsidiary part but the core, crucial, chemical part, there had to be a guarantee that it would perform to specification and be delivered on time.  In those circumstances it was decided that that part of the work should not be sub-contracted but should be supervised directly by the same people who manufactured the plant.  These are the people who hold the patents for the plant and who export such plants worldwide.  Therefore, the decision seems reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is the second major part of this plant in respect of which Irish firms were excluded deliberately and that the Construction Industry Federation have stated they are satisfied that there are several member firms of the federation who are capable of carrying out this sort of work, that those firms are short of <Col N="1408" /> work, some having laid off employees while others are in danger of doing so?  In view of the high rate of unemployment that we are experiencing would the Minister not intervene with NET so as to ensure that the maximum possible amount of work arising out of this whole project is given to Irish firms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of NET is for the maximum possible Irish content both of product and of labour.  In this instance it makes no difference to the Irish labour content whether there is an Irish subcontractor or whether there is the supervision of the parent firm, Kellog, who designed and built the plant.  The number of Irish people would not be one more on that plant should the work be done in a different way.  As agreed with my Department for many years both under previous Administrations and this one, and as reiterated frequently and accepted wholeheartedly by them, it is the policy of NET that there should be the maximum possible Irish content. There is that content in the circumstances in question but I must make the distinction between routine construction and the very complex sophisticated producer plant which is not the same as structural steelwork but is something which is at the limit of technology.  The NET decision is in the best interests of their workers, of the profitability of the company, of Irish agriculture which will benefit from the gas and of the whole Irish economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not very difficult to accept the Minister's statement in regard to this 90 per cent when he has told us that because of the nature of the plant it must be imported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that in so far as the crucial part of the plant is concerned there are only a few firms in the world capable of making it to the standard we require. I said that 90 per cent of the total cost of this part of the overall contract will be paid to Irish concerns and workers; that NET decided that this aspect of the work should be carried out by direct labour under the guidance and supervision of the main contractors.  The great bulk of the expenditure is on purchasing the plant.  More of the expenditure is on putting it together and commissioning it.  Parts of it must be imported since we cannot make them here but of the parts that can be obtained in Ireland I understand that virtually 90 per cent of the total cost of the overall contract will be paid to Irish concerns and workers.  I can itemise that if the Deputy wishes but I can try also to reassure him as to the extent of surveillance because there are 30 of the staff of NET employed exclusively on the project.  These conlist of a project managers, a construction manager, a personnel manager, 17 engineers, two accountants and supporting staff.  The NET development division with a chemical engineer <Col N="1410" /> as head are in overall charge and they are working continuously with Kellog to ensure that at no stage will there be scope for temptation on the part of an overseas firm to talk to their pals and exclude Irish firms. There is major Irish surveillance by experts at every step so as to ensure that the benefit to Ireland, not only in the end result but during the course of construction, is maximised.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 19:</P>
    <P>In page 25, before section 27, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>27.&mdash;Section 54 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>`(4) (a)  &ldquo;Goods&rdquo; in this section shall not include goods sold to the agency whether or not the goods are exported out of the State.</P>
    <P>(b)  &ldquo;The agency&rdquo; in paragraph (a) means the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries when exercising or performing any power or function conferred on him by Regulation 3 of the European Communities (Common Agricultural Policy) (Market Intervention) Regulations, 1973, and any other person when exercising or performing any corresponding power or function in any member state of the European Economic Community.'</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance).</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I adverted on the last occasion in regard to which I should like a little more information.  The Minister described to us an operation which he was trying to prevent by this amendment, an operation through which goods as described in the amendment, or rather the ownership of the goods, <Col N="1420" /> was transferred to an agent, say in Britain, and the ownership having been so transferred, the goods were then sold into intervention.  Does this amendment deal with that situation, and in which way?  On the face of it, it would not appear to have any adverse effect on plans of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates to export tax relief and to what exporters from Ireland are doing.  If goods are genuinely exported to a foreign market export tax relief is available.  If something happens after that, as a result of which goods from here go to intervention somewhere else, we have no control over that, but we are ensuring that if goods go into intervention here they will not enjoy export tax relief. The relief from tax is given as an encouragement to people to obtain foreign markets and to find foreign markets and it is inappropriate that the concession should be given to people who are putting them into intervention which is not in a true sense a foreign market.  That is the illustration I gave the other day. Where goods exported from here to a third party end up elsewhere is something over which we have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I misunderstood the Minister?  I understand from what he is now saying, and I agree, that this amendment would appear to have the effect that if goods were sold from this country into intervention, the intervention depot being outside the State, the effect of the amendment would be that export tax relief would not apply to such transactions.  That is clear enough.  Am I right in thinking that the Minister is now saying that if there were an agent in Britain to whom ownership of the goods were transferred, and that that happened before the goods went into intervention, this would not affect that situation? I understood the Minister last week to say that was the kind of transaction he was trying to prevent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I said that or gave that impression, I am sorry.  I did not intend to.  What we are doing is putting on an equal basis all transactions within our control which end up with <Col N="1421" /> the goods in question being put into intervention.  We obviously have no control over what happens in other jurisdictions, although the EEC may well have views about that situation, to regulate it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 25, lines 17 to 20, to delete subsection (2) and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  This section applies to interest on housing loans received on or after the 1st day of July, 1975, by an approved bank, or a subsidiary thereof, being interest which has been charged at the approved rate.</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 52 of the Finance Act, 1920, shall not apply to interest to which this section applies.</P>
      <P>(4)  Section 79 (3) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, is hereby amended by the insertion, after paragraph (c), of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>`(cc)  interest to which section 27 of the Finance Act, 1976, applies, and, for this purpose, that interest shall, without any deduction therefrom, be regarded as part of the income of the company for the relevant accounting period.' &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the original draft section was prepared and printed prior to the passing of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  Accordingly, it contained a reference only to section 52 of the Finance Act, 1920.  The effect of the section, as drafted, was to exempt the interest on the banks' housing loans from corporation profits tax, leaving the interest liable to income tax only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequential on the passing of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, companies become liable to corporation tax and not to income tax.  Accordingly, it is necessary to rewrite subsection (2) of the present section in terms of corporation tax so as to invoke the provisions of section 79 of the Corporation Tax Act.  This is <Col N="1422" /> being done by replacing subsection (2) by three new subsections which ensure that, as well as applying the exemption from corporation profits tax, the reduced rate of corporation tax&mdash;35 per cent which is the equivalent of the existing standard rate of income tax which applied to companies up to the present&mdash;provided for in section 79 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, will apply.  The exemption from corporation profits tax is available should the need for such exemption arise, which could happen if any company which commenced trading on a date after April 5th, 1973, undertook to operate the agreed scheme of housing loans.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a total exemption. It is an exemption of part only of the tax.  It will be charged at a rate of 35 per cent, which means they are able to make available loans comparable to those of other agencies.</P>

There was a television programme some time ago in the course of which reference was made to the interest being received by banks on housing loans.  I forget the exact details but I know that I was very surprised when I heard the reference because it would appear that it was assumed that the banks were not going to pay any tax on the interest being charged. I take it now that the position is that, in respect of any of these loans given by banks from the commencement of the arrangement made by the Government <Col N="1423" /> with the banks for the giving of housing loans&mdash;from the commencement of that scheme&mdash;banks will pay tax at the rate of 35 per cent?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 25, line 22, after &ldquo;1975&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or section 41 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first amendment follows on the passing of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 and extends to interest chargeable under section 41 of that Act the prohibition against the deduction of the interest in the computation of profits or income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment is a drafting one consequential on the passing of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  It deletes the word &ldquo;income&rdquo; in the expression &ldquo;the Income Tax Acts&rdquo; and, by so doing, converts the expression <Col N="1424" /> into &ldquo;the Tax Acts&rdquo; which is defined in section 155, subsection (2) of the Corporation Tax Acts as meaning the Income Tax Acts, as defined in section 3 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the Corporation Tax Act of 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one small point on amendment No. 22.  I know that we dealt with similar amendments earlier but I should like to be clear on the position arising.  The expression &ldquo;Tax Acts&rdquo; is defined in the Corporation Tax Act.  But is that definition carried into this Bill merely by referring to the Tax Acts or should it be necessary to refer to the Tax Acts as defined in the Corporation Tax Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Corporation Tax Act, 1976, section 155, subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>In this Act and in any Act passed after this Act, &ldquo;the Tax Acts&rdquo;, except in so far as the context otherwise requires, means the Income Tax Acts (as defined in section 3 of the Income Tax Act, 1967) and the Corporation Tax Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Incidentally, I mistakenly put the year 1976 in after my previous reference to this matter.  In my opening statement on this section I said the Corporation Tax Act, 1976. As you see, the section refers to the Corporation Tax Acts and I should not have had the date in.  While there is now only one Corporation Tax Act, the definition in the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 is &ldquo;Corporation Tax Acts&rdquo; which is, therefore, making provision for the day when there could be another Corporation Tax Act.</P>

      <P>That explains a point I shall raise later on.  We shall go into it in greater detail when we come to it.  It does not explain it; it opens it up.  However, I do not think it is appropriate on this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 25, to delete lines 30 to 39 and to substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `the specified amount of tax' means, in a case where notice of appeal against an assessment to tax has been given&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the amount of tax specified in the notice in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2), or</P>
      <P>(b)  where no amount of tax is so specified, or where the amount of tax specified exceeds the tax assessed, the tax assessed;</P>
      <P>`tax' means income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax, as may be appropriate;</P>
      <P>`the tax assessed' means the amount of tax charged by the assessment or, in a case where the tax is payable in two instalments, the amount of each instalment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment alters subsection (1) which relates solely to definitions. Apart from a re-arranging of the sequence of the definitions, the amendment provides two changes from the subsection as introduced.  They are, firstly, a re-wording of the definition of &ldquo;the specified amount of tax&rdquo; and, secondly, the introduction of a definition of &ldquo;the tax assessed&rdquo; which is now used in the revised definition of &ldquo;the specified amount of tax&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of these changes is to provide that, if a taxpayer does not specify an amount of tax&mdash;as required under subsection (2) (b) of the section, or if he specifies an amount in excess of the tax charged by the assessment, the specified amount will be the amount of the tax charged in the assessment.  If the definition as introduced, were allowed to stand it would be open to a taxpayer to specify an amount which he clearly knew would be in excess of the tax ultimately chargeable on determination of the appeal. In those circumstances, having paid the specified amount, he would be <Col N="1426" /> entitled to a repayment of the amount over-paid with interest.  Clearly, that would be contrary to the public good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of course from rather dim recollection and it may be that what I am speaking of is a rate of interest on overpayment of wealth tax or capital gains tax.  In one of these the Minister certainly refused to accept the proposition that there should be the same rate of interest on repayment as there was on tax overdue.  Perhaps he could say what is the provision which obliges a repayment of tax of this kind to carry 18 per cent interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the House that the purpose of having a high rate of interest charged on arrears is to provide a penalty in respect of failure to pay tax promptly and to provide an encouragement to people to pay tax promptly.  Subsection (4) of section 29 provides that where an overpayment of tax is to be repaid under subsection (3) the overpayment should carry interest at the rate or rates in force by virtue of section 550 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, for the period from the date or dates of the payment of the amount or amounts giving rise to the overpayment, as the case may require, to the date on which the repayment is made.  The Income Tax Act, 1967, also has a corresponding provision in <Col N="1427" /> section 419 which deals with appeal cases.</P>

      <P>It would certainly be the best investment going if the State could borrow money on better terms than that.  That is something we clearly want to avoid.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see what the Minister's difficulty is.  It is certainly possible that somebody who is very well off and who is liable for £X tax could in fact pay £10X and then claim a refund of £9X at 18 per cent interest. This is obviously what the Minister is trying to avoid and one can understand that he would want to avoid it.  Nevertheless the method he is adopting to avoid it seems to be one that deals with that case but it also deals with the case where somebody inadvertently or in good faith makes a payment based on a self-assessment which, as Deputy Fitzpatrick says, is the only way he can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be misunderstanding the Minister in relation to what he is saying in regard to an assessment being made.  If somebody makes a payment under this section on account and it transpires that, although made in good faith it was more than he owed, he will not get any interest on the money so made available to the Revenue Commissioners to which they were not entitled.  That is my understanding of what the Minister said.  It may be that there is a distinction based on whether or not there has been an assessment by the Revenue Commissioners. It would appear that this section only operates effectively where there has been an assessment and <Col N="1429" /> where there is an appeal against the assessment.  If that is so it would seem that the effect of this amendment is that whether the overpayment is due to somebody trying to get the benefit of a high interest rate or whether it is inadvertent or due to the fact&mdash;we will be raising this point on the section&mdash; that there is a question of principle involved and if it is decided one way then he is liable for a substantial amount of tax but if it is decided the other way he is only liable for a small amount of tax.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this person is in the position that when he is making his appeal he has to gauge whether he is likely to win on this question of principle.  If he wins he then has overpaid tax very considerably but gets no interest on it.  If he loses on the question of principle then he has not overpaid but he has got to make this decision in advance before the appeal is heard and he has to do this all so that the Minister can avoid allowing people to use the Exchequer as a good form of investment which would yield 18 per cent interest.</P>
    <P>The real trouble here, as we pointed out to the Minister before, is that the 18 per cent is usurious, harsh and excessive and has led, and is leading, to various anomalies.  A lower rate of interest more related to the going rate would be effective for the Minister's purpose but would not produce this kind of anomaly.  The only answer to this, which the Minister apparently has in this amendment, is to treat those who are <i>bona fide</i> and those who are not in exactly the same way.</P>
    <P>This is the usual blunt instrument that the Minister tends to apply when he is trying to deal with any attempts at evasion or in this case attempts at making money out of the Exchequer, something that is not very commonly possible for taxpayers to do.  He is applying a blunt instrument which is treating the person acting <i>bona fide</i> and the person who is not in exactly the same way.  I do not think that that is the answer to the problem posed here, a problem which arises directly out of the inordinately high rate of interest which the Minister is imposing.</P>

      <P>There is another point that I intended to raise on the section but I think it is relevant now.  Some time ago the Minister introduced a 10 per cent surcharge on the various bands of income tax above the lowest one of 26 per cent.  I think that was introduced in June of the relevant year.  It would appear that under this section if that were to happen again a person who had appealed on the basis of existing liability would be wrong because the law had been amended in the meantime.  But under the section and under the amendment he will get no interest if he overpays, gambling on a change that may come, and, on the other hand, if the law has been changed so that he cannot possibly assess the correct amount of tax, the Minister says: &ldquo;That is his hard luck; he underestimated and will have to pay interest on the amount he underestimated&rdquo;.  Surely that is not a defensible position?</P>

      <P>There are three courses of action open to the taxpayer. He may appeal and pay the amount of the tax which is actually charged in the assessment and if the amount paid is greater than the amount that is ultimately due he will receive a repayment of the tax overpaid together with interest at the rate of 18 per cent which interest is tax free.  He really does well in that case.  Secondly, he may specify the amount of tax which he thinks is his proper liability.  In the normal course, unless there is a point of law at issue, he should be in a position to state fairly accurately what his income is and what the proper tax liability will be.</P>

      <P>Every man is presumed to have some capacity to handle his own affairs and we cannot design legislation to provide escape for fools.  The chances are that if they are in that category they will not be in the tax bracket anyway.  The assumption that a person will not be able to make a reasonably accurate assessment of his income is not a well-founded one.  He may pay an amount which represents only 80 per cent of the tax to which he is ultimately liable.  I can see problems arising in that area.</P>
      <P>If he decides to make the minimum payment and this turns out to be less than 80 per cent of the tax chargeable, he will be subject to an interest charge but that is the result of his own decision.  If he decides to play cute and reduce his payment to what he considers the lowest figure he could possibly hope to get away with and hopes to underprice himself, he will be asked to pay interest on the amount by which he has underpriced himself. It must be remembered that what the taxpayer should pay on the normal date is his full payment of tax. If he desires to do so and makes a proper estimate, he has nothing to fear.  If he makes one which is not adequate he will be asked to pay 18 per cent on the short-fall.  There will not be any atrocious penalty but there is encouragement to people to make a realistic assessment.</P>

      <P>This section, which would apply in the case of tax assessments made on or after the passing of the Act, amends the existing provisions in relation to payments on account in cases where appeals are made against assessments.  The amendment brings into the new arrangements for payments on account a proviso similar to that which applied under the old arrangement in relation to agreed payments on account.  The proviso ensures that where in appeal cases tax is overpaid and has to be repaid with interest, the interest will not be charged to tax.  As an administrative easement and an easement to taxpayers interest will not be paid when the amount is less than £1.  The proviso corresponds with that contained in section 419 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which will no longer apply to assessments made after the passing of the Act.  Section 419 is the measure which provided for the enforcement of agreed payments on account in appeal cases.</P>

      <P>(a)  the tax assessed, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  80 per cent. of the amount of tax found to be chargeable by <Col N="1435" /> the assessment on the determination of the appeal,</P>
    <P>interest shall not be payable on any balance of tax&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to subsection (5) which provides that if a taxpayer complies with certain requirements in relation to the payment of his tax liability he will not be charged interest on late payment of the tax.  The requirements are that (a) the specified amount is paid within two months of the date it was due and payable; (b) the specified amount so paid is not less than 80 per cent of the tax found to be chargeable on the determination of the appeal; and (c) any balance of tax payable on determination of the appeal is paid within two months of the date of determination.</P>
    <P>The amendment changes the requirement to the effect that the specified amount paid must not be less than the lesser of, firstly, the tax charged on the original assessment or, secondly, 80 per cent of the tax found to be chargeable on the determination of the appeal.  In a case in which the tax charge in the original assessment is the specified amount and is subsequently found to be less than 80 per cent of the tax chargeable on determination of the appeal, the taxpayer would, apart from this amendment, be liable to an interest charge on the balance of tax payable.  If, on the other hand, that taxpayer had not lodged an appeal and had paid the tax charged on the assessment within two months, no interest charge would arise.  An additional liability would be charged in an additional assessment to tax which would be due and payable on a date fixed by reference to the date of the additional assessment.  If the additional tax was paid within two months of that date, no interest charge would arise.  The amendment will remove this anomaly treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this section is based on a financial version of Russian roulette and is very objectionable in the way it will work out in some cases.  Before I deal with that, on one of the earlier amendments I pointed out&mdash;it arises under this section &mdash;that one of the problems being created here is the extent of the interest rate charged on unpaid tax or the extent of the interest payable by the <Col N="1437" /> Revenue on overpaid tax.  I have figures in front of me which show that the interest on unpaid tax here is considerably higher than that charged in Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Japan or the United States.  Is the Minister aware of any country where the rate of interest charged is as high as it is here?  As I indicated, it is so high here that it is creating problems, whether it is in the form of the interest chargeable on unpaid tax or interest payable by the Exchequer on overpaid tax.  I believe it is not effective in trying to achieve what it is supposed to achieve.</P>
      <P>As regards the whole machinery envisaged in this section, in my view that also is unsatisfactory.  Many people who are more familiar than I am with the practical problems arising are convinced that this section is unworkable. First, we might have a look at the present position and what it would be if this section were not enacted.</P>
      <P>Under the present system the inspector of taxes can agree or refuse to agree to a payment on account before an appeal is made and it is then up to the taxpayer to pay 80 per cent of the final liability if he wants to avoid liability for interest.  The inspector would know from experience which taxpayers are offering reasonable payments on account and which are not.  Where the inspector is convinced that the offer is not a reasonable one he can refuse to agree a payment on account.  Even the present system is quite harsh because there is no right of appeal against the inspectors' refusal to agree a payment on account, but at least there is some discretion for the inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any evidence that the system is not working in the way in which it would be wished that it would work.  The Minister is not satisfied with that arrangement and he is introducing a situation in which in order to appeal against an assessment one must engage in a very risky calculation to try to determine what one's liability is likely to be.  If one happens to be wrong one is liable for interest at 18 per cent per annum on the amount by which one is wrong.  This has no regard for people acting in good faith. <Col N="1438" /> There is no flexibility built into this section.  The interest rate of 18 per cent is clearly introduced as a penalty and should be applicable only where there is evidence of negligence or fraud.  The taxpayer who acts in good faith and does his best to comply with the requirements of the inspector of taxes should not be called upon to pay interest at this penal rate.</P>
    <P>The time limit for making an appeal is 21 days.  If one allows time for the notice&mdash;and the post is not at its best at present&mdash;to reach the taxpayer and the appeal to reach the Revenue Commissioners, and allowing for the intervention of weekends, the period for the appeal will normally be less than 15 full working days.  If the appeal notice is issued during a holiday period it will be shorter than that.  In many cases during this quite short period the taxpayer will be required to consult with the tax agent in order to calculate his tax liability.  In some cases it may well be necessary to prepare accounts.  It would be unusual if such a thing could be done in 15 working days.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the provisions of section 6 of this Bill, under which it is proposed that the first instalment of tax would be paid on 1st July in the year of assessment, it can be presumed that the assessment would be issued shortly after the 6th April each year. In those circumstances the taxpayer will have to make his appeal and get an accurate estimate of his tax liability before the 30th of April, Many people who have practical experience in this field believe that this kind of arrangement is unworkable.  If we must have a section like this&mdash;and I do not think we should have it at all because the existing system is good enough&mdash;there is a very strong case for extending the period of appeal.  Alternatively, if the 21-day period for appeal is retained, the taxayer should be given a considerably longer time in which to specify the amount of tax which in his opinion is likely to become payable on the determination of his appeal.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, a very difficult problem arises here if a taxpayer is making an appeal on a question <Col N="1439" /> of principle or law.  The Minister made some reference in parenthesis to this in relation to an appeal on a point of law, but he did not say what would happen to the taxpayer if such a thing happened.  It is worth considering the provision of this section in the light of that.  If somebody is making an appeal on a point of law or principle, the difference between what he could be liable for if the appeal is in his favour or if it goes against him could be considerable. The Minister's only answer to that situation is that the taxpayer must assume that it will go against him, pay the much larger sum involved and be out-of-pocket on that sum while the appeal is pending.  There is no real way that a taxpayer can readily calculate what his liability will be in the circumstances.  I submit that a taxpayer acting in the best of good faith should not be penalised, should not be liable in this way to a clearly penal interest rate of 18 per cent per annum.  A change in the law under this section can put a taxpayer on the wrong foot and make him liable for interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that in the event of a change of the kind he brought in some time ago introducing the surcharge of 10 per cent one can take it that the necessary changes would also be made in this section.  I hope he is right.  It would clearly be a gross injustice if such a thing were to happen.  The Minister has not appreciated the problems which can arise for taxpayers.  Such taxpayers, in case there is any doubt about it, would appear very definitely not to be confined to individuals but to include trading companies as well.  I do not think the Minister has grasped the problem that can arise for taxpayers where their year of account comes at a particular date and they have not accounts prepared in time to make the calculation of how much they should lodge.  I believe that the use of the computer by the Revenue Commissioners has meant that assessments for each tax district are issued on the same day.  The consequence of this is that agents for taxpayers are inundated with assessments on the same <Col N="1440" /> day.  Many such agents will receive assessments on behalf of 50 per cent of their clients in a period of one week.  They will be required in many of these cases to advise clients and calculate their tax liability so that their clients can make a payment on account which will not result in their being liable for interest at this penal rate of 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>All of this seems to me to add up to an unworkable and unnecessary provision in this section&mdash;unnecessary because there is no evidence that the existing system is not effective, and unworkable for the reasons I have outlined. It is also unjust in many cases and, in particular, in the light of one of the amendments the Minister has now brought in whereby, in effect, if a taxpayer is wrong, that is his hard luck, but if the Revenue Commissioners are wrong, that may be the the taxpayer's hard luck too.  I am not saying this is being done merely to grind the taxpayer into the ground, but I am saying that in order to get at people who might abuse this and invest their money in the Revenue Commissioners at 18 per cent per annum, in order to prevent that the Minister is using a very blunt instrument which is going to prevent them from doing it but he is also getting at the great majority of taxpayers who are acting in good faith.  There is no flexibility in this.  There should, at the very least, be a provision in this section which would give the Revenue Commissioners a discretion which they could exercise where they were satisfied that the taxpayer was acting <i>bona fide</i>, that he would not be subjected to a penal interest rate of 18 per cent. That is the very minimum that is required in this section if it is to be even remotely acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case where a taxpayer appeals against an assessment and is required to specify an amount of tax which would be not less than 80 per cent of the tax which would be ultimately due, he may have difficulty in doing so if a substantial portion of his income is taxed income. I accept that case which has been made.  Tax income, for example, dividends which he receives under deduction <Col N="1441" /> of tax, is chargeable for tax on a current year basis and, as a very significant portion of it is received towards the end of the year, a taxpayer might not be in a position earlier in the year to assess what that income is likely to be.  The point is made that it would be unreasonable to require him to specify an amount of tax in these circumstances with the overhanging threat of an interest charge if he does not make the required payment on account.</P>
      <P>Another case which has been made, particularly by accountants, is that the responsibility of appealing against assessments has been left to their profession, in particular, by their clients. Because of the computerisation of assessments, large numbers of these cases arrive in the tax agent's offices at the same time, and at present there is a 21 day limit on the making of appeals against these assessments.  It is their view that if they are required not alone to appeal against the assessment but to specify an appropriate amount of tax to be paid on account, the 21 day period might not be adequate and it is, therefore, suggested by Deputy Colley and others that it should be extended.</P>
      <P>In response to these arguments I am prepared to give an assurance that I will bring in amendments on Report Stage to the following effect: first, the taxpayer can be given the option of taking the tax income of the preceding year instead of the current year for the purpose of calculating the 80 per cent of the tax ultimately due.  This will clearly take care of the problem of not knowing what the tax income is for the current year.  Secondly, the period of 21 days for appeals will be extended to 30 days.  I think this will go a long way towards meeting the problems which have been recognised, which I accept as being legitimate and which I would want to avoid.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister may go a small way towards relieving the problem by amending this legislation.  As it stands, I doubt if any businessman could work this and be reasonably accurate as to 80 per cent.  At 81 per cent one would be paying too much and at 79 per cent one is charged interest.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands, one must pay 80 per cent of what is due.  In my opinion that will be impracticable.  There should be some room for manoeuvre between 80 per cent and 85 per cent. That would be a common-sense approach.  No businessman knows exactly what his income tax will be until his accounts are finalised.  The Minister must realise it is impracticable to insist that one assesses oneself as to 80 per cent of what is due. Accuracy will be impossible.  If the intention is to assess on last year's assessments, then 95 per cent of public companies will be paying too much because profits have dropped.  This might be possible in an expanding economy with increasing profits but in a declining economy and declining profits it will be utterly impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment will not work.  The cash flow has almost entirely dried up.  This is the second section in this Bill which will not work. What the Minister is trying to do here is extract more tax.  It is possible there will be an overpayment and very few businesses can afford that today. I can see no reason for this section. The existing system has worked well. This will cause confusion.  Accountants will not be in a position to advise their clients.  Already, with capital gains tax and wealth tax, they are not able to handle the business at all.  Here the Minister proposes to give them an additional burden.  It will be a huge burden on accountants and business people generally.  This just will not work.  What additional revenue does the Minister hope to collect as a result of this?  I do not believe it will be a substantial figure. Why the present system, which operated so well as between the <Col N="1445" /> Revenue Commissioner, auditors and their clients, should not continue is something I cannot understand.  Even if the Minister modifies this, I maintain it will cause nothing but confusion.</P>

      <P>The principal amendment which the Minister proposes, namely, to give the taxpayer the option in such case of basing his assessment on the previous year's income is ineffective in a situation of a declining economy and declining profits.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed this out already.  The Minister has not made a convincing case for a change from the existing system.  As far as I am concerned, even though the Minister proposes to amend the section, it will be unworkable and, far from being an improvement on the present position, it is likely to cause much greater problems.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (a) secures that expenditure incurred on or before 28th January, 1976, on the provision or hiring, except by means of hire purchase, of a vehicle is not to qualify for the increased limit.  Also excluded from the new limit is expenditure incurred within 12 months after 28th January, 1976, under a contract entered into before that date.  This corresponds with a similar provision in section 30 (5) of the 1973 Act.  Paragraph (b) provides that expenditure under a contract of hire purchase entered into on or before 28th January, 1976, is not to qualify for the increased limit of £3,500.

      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide for a restriction on the amount of running expenses allowed as a deduction for tax purposes in respect of cars costing over £3,500.  The restriction which would be applied to the amount of expenses which would be allowable under the <Col N="1450" /> existing rules will be one-third of the cost of the car over £3,500.  If, however, it is more favourable to the taxpayer, he may opt to have the amount of the running expenses reduced in the proportion which £3,500 bears to the cost of the car.  The restrictions relate to running expenses incurred after 28th January, 1976, the date of the budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 27, line 33, before section 32, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;32.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>`society' means a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1971, which is an agricultural society or a fishery society within the meaning of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
      <P>`period of account' has the meaning assigned to it by section 155 (5) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976;</P>

      <P>`initial allowance' means an allowance under Chapter I, Part XV of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
      <P>`investment allowance' means an allowance under section 22 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>(2)  In the case of a trade carried on by a society no transaction on or after the 6th day of April, 1976, shall be regarded as an exempted transaction for the purposes of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade before the 6th day of April, 1976, an accounting period of the society shall end for the purposes of corporation tax on the 5th day of April, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Where a society carrying on a trade incurred before the 6th day of April, 1976, capital expenditure on <Col N="1452" /> the provision of machinery or plant for the purposes of the trade and that expenditure was either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  qualifying expenditure within the meaning of section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or</P>
    <P>(b)  expenditure on qualifying machinery or plant within the meaning of section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971,</P>
    <P>an allowance equal to the specified amount of that capital expenditure may at the election of the society be made in taxing the trade of the society for the accounting period which commences on the 6th day of April, 1976, as if it were an allowance on account of the wear and tear of the machinery or plant in that accounting period, and where such an election is made, the amount of the capital expenditure on the provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of any subsequent event shall for the purposes of Chapter II of Part XVI of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be deemed to be nil.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of subsection (4) the specified amount of the capital expenditure means the amount of that capital expenditure together with any investment allowance in respect of that expenditure after deducting from the aggregate amount thereof&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount, as diminished by section 220 (5) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, of any investment allowance made to the society in respect of that expenditure;</P>
    <P>(b)  the aggregate amount, as diminished by the said section 220 (5), of the wear and tear allowances and initial allowances made to the society in respect of that expenditure for all chargeable periods before the accounting period commencing on the 6th day of April, 1976;</P>
    <P>(c)  the aggregate of the amounts by which the wear and tear allowances in respect of that expenditure would have been diminished by the said section <Col N="1453" /> 220 (5) if the only wear and tear allowances for those chargeable periods in respect of that expenditure were the amounts which would have been made if a proper claim had been duly made by the society for each chargeable period without regard to section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade,</P>

    <P>the income from the trade for the period of account shall be computed (in accordance with the provisions applicable to Case I of Schedule D) without regard to the provisions of section 220 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the income as so computed shall be apportioned to the part of the period of account falling before the 6th day of April, 1976, and the part falling after that date, and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4) of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and section 70 (5) of the Finance Act, 1963, each such part shall be deemed to be a period of account and the income from the trade for that part shall be the amount apportioned to it under the provisions of this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are few sections of this year's Finance Bill which have given rise to more inaccurate comment than this section and the <Col N="1454" /> amendment thereto.  The vehemence, inaccuracy and irrelevace of much of the comment made about the original section are now equalled only by the vehemence of some comment which is now being made about some of the amendments which I have introduced to the original Bill.  I, therefore, would like to deal with this matter at some length.</P>
      <P>The amendment substitutes a new provision for section 32 which would extend the tax-charged profits from exempted transactions of agricultural and fishery co-operative societies.  Those exempted transactions are very numerous and far-reaching, so numerous and far-reaching as to extend virtually full exemption in tax to most of these societies.  The scope of some of the operations of these societies has now become so vast, extending far beyond agricultural and fishery activities into motor assembly and production, oil development and exploration, as certainly to blur the contrast which was at one time drawn between what one might call traditional agricultural and fishery co-operative societies and private enterprise.  The extension of the tax charge, as we know, to profits made by agriculture and fishery co-operative societies has been very strongly opposed by representatives of the organisations concerned and they have taken great pains to secure support from many thousands of people, who will in no way be affected by tax provisions, by attempting to play upon their emotions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to look at this in perspective. The actual amount to the tax charge&mdash;I speak about the tax charge as distinct from what the net take will be after certain allowances are given&mdash;will be about £3 million. This will come out of a turnover of over £750 million and cannot, I say with respect, be regarded as an unduly heavy contribution to the running costs of the country by a section of the community whose prosperity has increased considerably over the last few years. As I indicated previously, the new tax provisions will affect profits arising on or after 6th April, 1976 and the balance of capital allowances over the normal wear and tear allowances in respect of certain capital expenditure incurred in <Col N="1455" /> earlier years will be allowed in the first year of the charge to corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Since the new charge would apply to profits arising on or after 6th April, 1976, and since most of the societies have accounts made up by reference to calendar years, the first payment of tax to be paid by societies generally speaking will be in October, 1977. Subsection (1) defines &ldquo;society&rdquo; as:</P>
    <P>...a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1971, which is an agricultural society or a fishery society within the meaning of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>In the case of a trade carried on by a society no transaction on or after the 6th day of April, 1976 shall be regarded as an exempted transaction for the purposes of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>The profits arising from all transactions of a society as of that date will, therefore, be chargeable to tax.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with some questions arising under section 10 about financing of RTE capital expenditure pending availability of Exchequer repayable advances. I had given some indication of the magnitude of the capital programme and I indicated that it would be unreasonable to expect RTE to finance a programme of this magnitude from their own resources and that heavy draws on the Exchequer to help finance development of our broadcasting services over the next five years must be envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 27 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, provides that <Col N="1456" /> RTE may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, borrow money by the creation of stock or other forms of security for any purpose arising in the performance of its functions, but there may be attached to the consent to borrow a condition that the moneys shall be utilised only for the purposes of a programme of capital works approved of by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  In 1975 the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Finance consented to bank borrowing for RTE's approved capital programme for 1975. The amount of borrowing approved was £2.833 million which was equivalent to the amount of repayable advances approved for 1975.  RTE were given an assurance that this borrowing would be redeemed by means of repayable advances when the amending legislation was enacted.  To date, RTE have been given approval for temporary borrowing to a total of £1.6 million under section 27 of the 1960 Act in respect of their 1976 capital programme.  RTE are advised that the interest payable in respect of short-term commercial borrowing is only marginally in excess of the interest that would have been payable if Exchequer advances had been available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the Minister's opening remarks in relation to section 10 can be taken as covering section 11 as well.  Section 10 specifically amends section 23 (2) of the principal Act raising the limit of the amount of money that the Minister for Finance might make by way of <Col N="1458" /> advances to the Authority for capital purposes.</P>
      <P>In the explanation that the Minister gave on this section he seemed to spend most of his time talking about the borrowing capacity of the Authority and the right to borrow and I wonder did we stop off on the last occasion at section 11 rather than section 10 because most of the explanation dealt mainly with section 11.  The Minister outlined the amount of borrowing that had taken place over the last couple of years, and mentioned £1.6 million as the amount that had recently been sanctioned as a figure to be borrowed.  I would like to know where the thinking changed in this regard.  When this Bill was first circulated, to my recollection, it was for discussion in the Dáil towards the end of 1974 and there was anxiety to have this Bill passed.  We explained that it was too comprehensive to have it dealt with speedily before the Christmas recess and then there was a specific request that we should agree to a short Bill covering section 10 so that the additional money might be made available from the Exchequer by the Minister for Finance towards capital works required by the RTE Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This never went ahead.  I presume that at some stage there was a decision that there was no need to go ahead with the advancing of capital finance, that the amount would be borrowed under section 27 of the 1960 Act.  At present we are talking in terms of the provisions that have been made by way of borrowing.  Section 10 deals with the £4 million limit.  The original Bill talked in terms of a limit of £2 million and that was raised to £4 million in a subsequent amending Act.  The ceiling of £4 million maximum advance from the Minister for Finance had been reached and we are now proposing to raise that ceiling, very objectively under the circumstances, to £15 million.  Could the Minister give us any idea of what he could expect from the Minister for Finance, within the reasonably immediate future, towards capital development works by RTE or does the explanation that we have got only <Col N="1459" /> mean that most or all of the money that RTE proposed to spend on capital development will be borrowed or can we have an expectation that when we raise this limit there will be money forthcoming?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the last question, the increase in the limit is designed to cover the situation during the next five years or so.  I cannot make any definite statement as to the availability of further capital for RTE during the next couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>During his Second Stage speech the Minister spelled out the projects on which it was proposed to spend this money and I am wondering whether that situation remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, that remains the situation.  Presently the RTE capital plans are under further study but I do not think that during the debate on this section I should undertake to go into more detail about that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor raised some other matters also.  He said that in my earlier statement on this section I covered a number of matters, some of which might be relevant also to section 11.  I suppose that could be held to be the case but I thought that as we were now entering into the sections dealing in general with RTE's borrowing powers it would be helpful to the House if I covered the situation fairly and generally.  The Deputy said rightly that at a considerably earlier stage of this legislation, which is rather drawn out, we approached his party with a view to seeing whether we might put through a short Bill covering this general area of the limit of Exchequer advances.  At one stage RTE feared that the marginal difference between getting the money through a bank and getting it through the Exchequer was such as to impose a significant burden on the Authority. Subsequently they found, fortunately, that that was not the case and, consequently, it was not necessary at that stage for us to endeavour to put through a short Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding another point raised by <Col N="1460" /> the Deputy I can tell him that the money borrowed by RTE from commercial sources will be repaid by way of Exchequer advances.  The amount involved so far is £2.833 million in respect of the 1975 programme and £1.6 million in respect of 1976 to date.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We do not object to the section because we realise that capital expenditure is necessary.  I presume, though, that the increased money will be spent entirely on a programme of a capital nature and not on current programmes.  During the past few years there has been too much borrowing in respect of current expenditure. The Minister has outlined certain undertakings in regard to regional stations and we are to have a second channel but it is unfortunate that we should be discussing a Bill of this nature at this time.  While the advance of £11 million is necessary the present climate is not conducive to such legislation.  I say this particularly having regard to the disenchantment that prevails in certain parts of the country with the existing service.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give any indications of what steps, if any, are being taken by him or by his Department towards settling the unfortunate television strike taking place now?  I have had numerous letters and telephone calls on this matter from people in the single-channel areas.  These people have paid their licence fees but since they are getting no service they may be asking for a refund of their money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall, therefore, deal with the remaining matters. I should like to stress a point a little closer to the section, and that is the fact that the £11 million extra allowed for is by way of an enabling provision only&mdash;it does not necessarily mean that the amount will be made available to RTE in any particular period. The next point that must be made is that there appears to be some kind of suggestion that the idea of providing extra capital at all for RTE is in some way an extravagance.  Any moneys raised by RTE for any purpose have to be contributed ultimately by the licence fee payers who, therefore, are the ultimate judges as to what is required here.  There we would have to estimate the demand, for example, for RTE's second channel and in general for the improvement of RTE services.  If the capital intake is not forthcoming, the people who will suffer a degree of inconvenience ultimately are the licence fee payers. There is a delicate enough balance there, but as the licence fee payers put up the capital ultimately, they are the people who have to be the judges as to whether that is extravagant, and considering what is a major consideration of most viewers, the factor of entertainment, the cost of entertainment supplied in value for the licence fee is not all that high compared with other sources of entertainment, leaving aside the other aspects of broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should here recapitulate in relation to Deputy Lalor's question as to what the money goes for.  As regards the 1975 programme, the actual capital programme undertaken by RTE was: transmitter network for a second RTE channel, £0.933 million; renewal and extension of TV production of existing services, £1.697 million; renewal of existing TV transmitters to avoid extensive co-channel interference, £0.144 million; improving reception of existing services in areas where it was less than satisfactory, £0.087 million; miscellaneous, £0.699 million; total, £3.56 million.  The capital programme for 1967 totals £3.8 million.  Final details have not been settled but the main items of expenditure will be the <Col N="1463" /> transmitter network for the second channel, renewal of existing transmitter network, additional TV production facilities, and, again, improvement of reception in areas where it was less than satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was doing a sum while the Minister was giving his figures.  He gave a sum of £3.56 million for 1975 capital development, although earlier he informed us that the amount borrowed for this was £2.833 million in 1975.  Does that mean that the difference of £0.7 million is made up out of reserves?  In accounting for the reason why this capital money is required, the Minister referred to transmission network receivers and improving arrangements for reception in affected areas.  The point was made a few minutes ago that there is no reception in any area at the present time and this must be discussed naturally when we are talking on a Bill dealing with broadcasting.  In section 10 are the bones of the whole thing in this respect.  It is useless going on to later sections dealing with the extension of reception when there is no reception at all.  Legitimately, the Minister spoke about the licence fee payer who has to pay for the lot and this is what is hurtful at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking about an increase of £11 million in the ceiling for capital moneys invested in the development of television at a time when we find ourselves in the unfortunate position that we are not permitted to refer to the present blackout.  The man responsible for RTE is the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who has the solution to all the problems of all the other Departments, including Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach's Department, but he cannot solve a dispute in his own Department. I appeal to the Minister to put the same effort into running his own Department as he seems to put into the running of all other Departments. Probably also the RTE Authority would run more smoothly and operate more efficiently if he did so.  Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps they would function far less efficiently.  However, <Col N="1464" /> the job of the Minister is to look after the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, including RTE, and, if he did so, we might not have the troubles being experienced at present.</P>
    <P>Arising from a previous question I put to the Minister as to the amount of capital moneys that he would legitimately expect to get from the Department of Finance towards the development of RTE in the next five years, in a sort of a breakdown situation the Minister mentioned that the £2.833 million borrowed last year, that did £3.60 million of work and the £1.6 million spent already this year will be repaid by Exchequer advances. If only for technical reasons I should like to know whether the wording of section 23 of the Principal Act that is being amended here is such that it enables the money to be used for the repayment of loans.  As I read it section 23 of the 1960 Act specifically says that the Minister for Finance may make advances to the authority for capital purposes.  It continues to say that advances under that section may be made out of central funds and shall not exceed £15 million.  According to the wording of that section the money can be advanced by the Minister only for use for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am taking a narrow view of this, that I am wrong and, if the Minister says so, I will accept it.  I know that RTE had borrowed money for capital works.  What the Minister proposes in this section is to pay back&mdash; I presume capital and interest&mdash;on behalf of RTE to whoever provided the funds.  In that context I wonder whether it would be necessary to amend section 23 (1) of the Principal Act in some way because, according to that, the money is to be used specifically for capital development.  I accept that it is replacing money, with interest, that has been borrowed for that purpose.  I wonder if the right under section 23 (1) of the Principal Act can be used in the manner in which the Minister proposes at present.</P>

      <P>I think we have probably covered this ground fairly well, and there is some ground that I think I am debarred from entering on. <Col N="1465" /> However, there were two specific questions raised by Deputy Lalor which require an answer.  First of all, as regards the difference between the £3.56 million and the commercial borrowing of £2.8 million, which Deputy Lalor rightly raised, his surmise about the answer to it is, generally speaking, correct. This was made from RTE internal sources, including depreciation.  The other point is whether the relevant section enables repayment of loans. The answer is, I think, that the advances would be for capital purposes under section 23.  Incidentally, the fact that they would enable RTE to cease commercial borrowing would not conflict with section 2.  When Exchequer advances are available only the principal will be repaid.</P>

      <P>In this section the provisions for foreign borrowing by RTE are enabling only.  They can borrow abroad only with my prior approval and that of the Minister for Finance.  There is nothing unusual about this provision.  As Deputies are probably aware, other State-sponsored bodies have borrowed abroad on occasions. However, I should add that I am not aware of any plans by RTE to borrow in foreign currencies at present. This is simply an enabling provision to complete provision for all contingencies that might arise in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can quite understand the reason for this section.  I agree it is an enabling section, increasing the amount of borrowing from £4 million to £11 million.  Up to now the obligation to provide this money was placed on the Minister for Finance.  Probably the Minister for Finance has sufficient problems within his own Department. There is every likelihood that the Minister for Finance, with the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, will tell the authority to float their own loans abroad.  Knowing that revenue is scare within the Department of Finance I can see that happening. The undertaking of the establishment of the second channel and the building of other transmitters required throughout the country must be honoured. We know how undesirable is foreign borrowing and that it should be avoided if at all possible.  We have observed the steady depreciation of sterling especially against stronger currencies over the past three or four years.  We have seen the State itself embark upon a huge spree of foreign borrowing, some for capital purposes and, indeed, some for current purposes. I always disagree with foreign borrowing for current purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £11 million about which we are speaking is sufficient only to keep the Authority going up to 1979.  It is more than likely that they will be demanding the largest part of that amount within the next 18 months. Naturally, the most expensive part of their undertaking will be the building of new transmitters and the establishment of a second channel.  There is also heavy depreciation within the station itself.  But, if the authority are placed in a situation which forces them to borrow on foreign markets, they will find themselves in a very different position from what they have experienced heretofore.  For example, up to now the £4 million was not repayable; it has not been repaid since the establishment of the Authority. If and when loans are floated abroad by the Authority themselves, in their own right&mdash;and this is what the Minister is doing here; I know they will have to come back to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the <Col N="1467" /> Minister for Finance&mdash;these may be given very willingly if there is insufficient moneys available within the Department of Finance.  Whether or not they realise it at present it will place a very severe strain on the Authority.</P>
    <P>Probably some such loans will be granted for a very short period.  We know that some loans floated by the Minister himself over the past two years have been very regulated and restrictive as to their repayment.  We know that the interest charged on such loans is fairly substantial.  Not alone will the Authority have to fund such loans but they will have to repay them.  If, in four or five years' time there has been a loan of anything in the region of £5 million to £6 million, I cannot see how the Authority will repay it.  Looking at their performance since the establishment of television, the Authority have found it difficult to break even.  I believe one or two years they made a profit but it was very limited.  This will certainly place an obligation on the Authority as far as foreign borrowing is concerned to honour their commitments. Their running costs will have a big effect on what the Authority will charge in licence fees.  We know, in relation to the present state of costings, that the recent increase in licence fees will barely cover the running operations of the Authority in 1976.</P>
    <P>Semi-State bodies such as the ESB and local authorities have borrowed money from abroad but they usually are paying propositions.  They can generally increase their charges to the public.  I do not think RTE have the same latitude in regard to this type of situation.  There is a certain limit on how high we can put licence fees and there is also a certain limit in regard to advertising.  Advertising is not increasing. We do not know what the financial state of the Authority will be in five or six years' time when they will probably be forced to engage in some sort of foreign borrowing.  Such a loan will have to be repaid within a certain period.  I believe at that stage the Authority will find themselves in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> Foreign borrowing did not come into question for the Authority up to now, but now it has.  I would prefer to see the Authority raising money within the State.  In the case of such borrowings the Exchequer get a substantial part back in interest.  In relation to any money borrowed outside the State the State loses in regard to the interest paid by the depositor and also in regard to repayments.  Have the Authority researched what their position will be in five or six years from now if they undertake foreign borrowing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a slight misunderstanding about this. There is no intention on the part of the Government to put RTE in the position where they will be forced to borrow in foreign markets.  This section of the Bill is not inserted on the initiative of the Government at all but at the request of RTE to cover the possible situation where it might be advantageous to have recourse to this method which other State corporations have from time to time had recourse to.  I appreciate the reasons for the reservations of Deputy Fitzpatrick on this but I think it is fully covered by the fact that the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is required for such borrowings and that the provision is sought by RTE themselves.</P>
      <P>In reference to some general points which have been made, which I think are very well understood here but might not be so well understood by some sections of the public, I should put on the record here that of course Exchequer advances are repayable but RTE have not been required to repay any capital to the Exchequer yet.  I know the Deputy appreciates that but I think it is well to put it on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to speak on this section without also referring to section 16.  Section 11 deals with borrowing from abroad for general purposes and section 16 deals with temporary borrowing from abroad for current expenditure.  While borrowing under both sections would <Col N="1469" /> require the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Finance it should be remembered that the autonomy of our national broadcasting service should be jealously safeguarded and that the entry of foreign finance might bring with it influences and pressures which would impair that autonomy, particularly as RTE have no realisable assets to offer as security for the borrowing.  If RTE decide to borrow the only security they can offer is that they are borrowing abroad with the backing of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very particular to point out that section 11 was an enabling section.  Section 10 is also an enabling section.  I am worried that there could be influences on the RTE Authority in relation to presentation of programmes because of this borrowing. We recently publicised the fact that one of the recent Government loans from the European Investment Bank had a number of regulations tied in with it as to how the Minister for Finance and the Government are to manage our affairs or otherwise we will not get any more lolly.  I have a feeling we will not get any more because the Government are not managing our affairs as instructed.  When the Minister stands up and says that this section is not in the Bill because of any positive wish of his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am worried about this. In the long-term I can see the necessity for borrowing.  I will have more to say on section 16 rather than on section 11.  We are talking about money for capital development and current account moneys.  In this instance we are talking about money for general purposes which cover capital and current expenditure.  In section 16 we are specifically talking about current borrowing.  While there is no specific reason why this section should be opposed by us, I hope the Minister and the Minister for Finance will examine thoroughly and in depth any request from the Authority to borrow money abroad.</P>

      <P>I am glad to note that the section says the Authority, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister, may borrow because I would not like to give them <i>carte blanche</i> to borrow abroad as much as they liked whenever they liked, if only because the only backing any Irish State or semi-State company has is the Exchequer and the Irish taxpayer.  Therefore, the political authorities should have the final decision as to whether there should be borrowing or not.  I do not see RTE as being in the same category as, say, the ESB or Aer Lingus, one of which at least has borrowed abroad&mdash;I am not sure about the other.  I can see arguments in favour of the ESB in that they are engaged in economic effort, that they are in a position to produce their own expenditure.  In the case of companies such as Aer Lingus some measure of foreign borrowing can be justified on the basis that it is largely for investment abroad.  In the case of RTE I would be concerned to see any substantial borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our television and radio broadcasting system is one we should be able to carry ourselves.  The question one asks is: on what basis could you <Col N="1471" /> seek money abroad?  Certainly if you had a State insurance company or a company like the ESB producing power or an overseas trading company like Aer Lingus, you would have grounds for seeking capital abroad but in RTE's case I do not see the economic justification for it.  If you were engaged to a large extent in commercial sponsoring and transmitting overseas this might be a justification. It would strike me as, perhaps, an easy way out that you should look for capital abroad.  In the last analysis it would not be RTE that would be seeking the capital but RTE in the name of the Irish State.  For that reason I am glad the Authority can only do so with the consent of the Minister for Finance because there can be many reasons for borrowing abroad for other purposes, as the present Government have done in a very large measure over the past couple of years.  The decision as to what form of borrowing should take place other than that which is economically justifiable and therefore self-justifying must be a matter for which the Government must be answerable and not a State body as such.</P>

You go and look after your own affairs like the ESB or Aer Lingus.&rdquo;  The Authority could find themselves in such a situation.  If they do, they will find the repayments and their funds.

      <P>This section deals with the RTE superannuation fund which is a perpetual fund registered under the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act, 1933.  The Schedule to that Act sets out the requirements of the Act as to the rules regulating perpetual funds.  In particular, paragraph 6 specifies that when the trustees of the fund are authorised by the rules of the fund to invest capital moneys belonging to the fund by depositing such moneys with the employer of persons employed in the undertaking in connection with which the fund is established, such moneys shall not be deposited unless (a) the employer is a body corporate, (b) the undertaking has paid dividends of not less than 3 per cent on its ordinary stocks and shares in each of the past ten years and (c) the deposit is secured by a charge on the whole or part of the assets of the undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the RTE superannuation scheme the trustees may make loans to the RTE Authority provided the loans comply with paragraph 6 of the Schedule to the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act, 1933, <Col N="1473" /> but in fact it is not possible for RTE to comply with paragraph 6.  They do not declare a dividend on stocks and shares and the securing of a loan on the assets of the Authority could also cause problems.  That point has, I think, already been made by Deputies opposite.  The proposed amendment would remove this legal difficulty but it would also remove the element of protection of the interests of the RTE employees contained in these provisions of the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act.  However, I wish to assure the House by way of this public commitment that any advance made at any time by the RTE superannuation fund to the RTE Authority will be secure both as to interest and repayment of capital so that the interests of RTE employees will continue to be fully protected.</P>

    <P>In page 27, line 33, before section 32, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;32. &mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>`society' means a society, registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1971, which is an agricultural society or a fishery society within the meaning of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>`period of account' has the meaning assigned to it by section 155 (5) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976;</P>
    <P>`wear and tear allowance' means an allowance under section 241 of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>`initial allowance' means an allowance under Chapter I, Part XV of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>`investment allowance' means an allowance under section 22 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of a trade carried on by a society no transaction on or after the 6th day of April, 1976, <Col N="1474" /> shall be regarded as an exempted transaction for the purpose of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade before the 6th day of April, 1976, an accounting period of the society shall end for the purposes of corporation tax on the 5th day of April, 1976.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a society carrying on a trade incurred before the 6th day of April, 1976, capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant for the purposes of the trade and that expenditure was either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  qualifying expenditure within the meaning of section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or</P>
    <P>(b)  expenditure on qualifying machinery or plant within the meaning of section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971,</P>
    <P>an allowance equal to the specified amount of that capital expenditure may at the election of the society be made in taxing the trade of the society for the accounting period which commences on the 6th day of April, 1976, as if it were an allowance on account of the wear and tear of the machinery or plant in that accounting period, and where such an election is made, the amount of the capital expenditure on the provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of any subsequent event shall for the purposes of Chapter II of Part XVI of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be deemed to be nil.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of subsection (4) the specified amount of the capital expenditure means the amount of that capital expenditure together with any investment allowance in respect of that expenditure after deducting from the aggregate amount thereof&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount, as diminished by section 220 (5) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, of any investment allowance made to the society in respect of that expenditure;</P>
    <P>(b)  the aggregate amount, as <Col N="1475" /> diminished by the said section 220 (5), of the wear and tear allowances and initial allowances made to the society in respect of that expenditure for all chargeable periods before the accounting period commencing on the 6th day of April, 1976;</P>
    <P>(c)  the aggregate of the amounts by which the wear and tear allowances in respect of that expenditure would have been diminished by the said section 220 (5) if the only wear and tear allowances for those chargeable periods in respect of that expenditure were the amounts which would have been made if a proper claim had been duly made by the society for each chargeable period without regard to section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade,</P>

    <P>the income from the trade for the period of account shall be computed (in accordance with the provisions applicable to Case I of the Schedule D) without regard to the provisions of section 220 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the income as so computed shall be apportioned to the part of the period of account falling before the 6th day of April, 1976, and the part falling after that date, and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4) of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and section 70 (5) of the Finance Act, 1963, each such part shall be deemed to be a period of account and the income from the trade for that part shall be the amount apportioned to it under the provisions of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that the Minister was going through the amendment and had only got to the second subsection. There are a number of technical matters on this amendment on which I would like to get some enlightenment, but we can deal with them later.  The most important part of this lengthy amendment is contained in subsection (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>In the case of a trade carried on by a society no transaction on or after the 6th day of April, 1976, shall be regarded as an exempted transaction for the purposes of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>That subsection proposes to remove from agriculture and fishery co-ops the exemption which they long enjoyed, an exemption which applies only to a limited portion of their activities.  There is a considerable misunderstanding in this regard and it should be clearly understood that the ordinary trading activities of these co-ops&mdash;those that are generally regarded as being in competition with shopkeepers and so on&mdash;are, of course, subject to tax in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe the concept behind this provision is totally wrong, is not in the national interest, should not be enacted, and, if enacted, when we on this side of the are returned to Government we will repeal it.  We do <Col N="1477" /> not say that lightly.  We say it because we believe that what is involved here is very important for the co-operative movement, which itself is very important in our whole economy, and because this provision encapsulates what is basically wrong with the approach to the management of our economy by this Government.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Finance, aided and abetted by a number of his colleagues and backbenchers, who seek to justify many of the measures he introduced, including this one, on the basis of achieving equity in taxation.  He has put forward on occasions the proposition that taxpayers in receipt of equal incomes should pay equal tax.  I have had occasion a number of times to deal with this in this House and I think it is necessary to do so again because the only possible justification for this amendment is the proposition that it is achieving equity in taxation.  We ought to examine this proposition of what equity in taxation involves and whether we or the Minister for Finance believe in it absolutely.  I suggest that when one examines it one will find that one does not believe in it, nobody could.  There are many examples but the most obvious and outstanding one is the fact that we provide complete exemption from tax on profits derived from the export of manufactured goods.  That is not equitable.  In fact, there is clear inequity involved when you give complete exemption from taxation to a company on its profits derived from the export of manufactured goods if you do not give equal exemption to a company earning the same profits but on the home market, and obliging it to pay taxation at the rate of 50 per cent. Whatever else is involved in that, it is not equity in the sense that the Minister for Finance has been using that word.</P>
    <P>There are a few people, not many, in this country who would advocate the abolition of the remission of taxation on profits derived from exports of manufactured goods because the reality is that there is <Col N="1478" /> much more involved in taxation than alleged equity.  Taxation serves other purposes than raising revenue or appearing, on paper, to treat all citizens alike.  Taxation is a very potent weapon in the hands of any Government in encouraging growth in our economy and in discouraging tendencies which are not in the national interest.  It is for that reason that exemption from taxation is given in respect of profits derived from the export of manufactured goods.  It is for that reason that the Taoiseach came in here in the budget debate, after I had raised this point when the Minister was ranting on about equity, to make it quite clear that the Government did not intend to abolish that relief, and rightly so in my opinion.</P>
    <P>It is a very potent weapon in the hands of any Government in trying to encourage growth and increase employment in our economy.  I am taking that as an extreme example but there are many other examples.  One example is the state of our economy today.  We have historically high levels of unemployment, the highest inflation rate of any developed country in the world and an enormous and growing national debt.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance recently stated that we have to reverse this trend to achieve growth.  It took him a long time to realise that but at least he has got to the stage of preaching that doctrine.  I suggest that he ought to practice what he preaches.  If we want to achieve growth in our economy we will have to be ruthless about picking out the sectors in our economy which can produce growth and produce it quickly.  When we talk about growth we are not just talking about a mathematical increase in the GNP. Implied in that is more jobs for our people, a lowering of our inflation rate and, because of increased earnings, the ability to pay our national debt and to reduce the necessity for borrowing by increasing the inflow to the Exchequer.  All of that is implied when we talk about achieving growth in our economy.  It is no good to tell the thousands of people on the dole queues that the Minister is achieving <Col N="1479" /> equity in taxation if in the process he is increasing the dole queues, shoving up our inflation rate and increasing the national debt still further.</P>
    <P>I suggest, Sir, that a basic obligation of any Government and, in particular, of any Minister for Finance, extends far beyond the taxation code and any tinkering with it in the alleged interest of equity.  Alleged, I say, because I hope I have demonstrated that the Minister does not mean it when he talks about achieving equity in taxation. He recognises that there are things that you have to do in the course of taxation policy which are not equitable but which are in the national interest.  The question of the exemption of agriculture and fishery co-operatives from taxation is a classic example of one of those things.  If we recall that, in dealing with these co-operatives, we are dealing with a very large sector of our economy which is concerned with food and food products we will recognise immediately that we are talking about an area of our economy which has enormous potential for producing growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>The employment provided by these co-operatives is at present in the region of 15,000 people.  A good deal of that employment is provided in remote parts of rural Ireland where nobody else will provide employment, or is likely to provide employment in the foreseeable future.  Consequently, anything which might interfere in any way with the effective operations of these co-operatives should be considered carefully. But more than that, the activities of these co-operatives have enormous potential in the national interest.  I am not speaking of the interest of members of these co-operatives and of the farming community but of the interests of all the people.  Here is a sector which, if given the right handling and incentives, can contribute very rapidly to the achievement of more employment and more exports.  Is that not what we need?  If it is what we need, enormous justification is required before interfering with the role of those co-operatives.</P>
    <P>One of the things that annoys me <Col N="1480" /> about this proposition is that it is so silly.  Quite apart from his proposal's potential for causing damage, the reality is that if it is enacted it will do damage but it will not produce revenue for the Exchequer.  It may well result in increased prices for the various food items produced by these co-operatives. It may well result in increased prices of inputs to farmers.  But one thing one can be reasonably sure of is that it will not result in any increase in the surpluses of these co-operatives.  Almost certainly it will result in their reduction. Apart from any reduction that will come about as a direct consequence of this proposal, we may take it that most co-operatives can very easily ensure that they have no surpluses.  I suggest that the net result of all this will be little or no revenue to the Exchequer and a considerable disruption of this vital area of our economy.  If the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;I believe that these co-operatives have tremendous potential for growth in our economy and that is what we need, but I am not satisfied with the way they are organised and I am not satisfied that they are achieving maximum potential, consequently, I am going to reappraise the role of co-operatives with the view to providing incentives to see that they contribute more to the national economy&rdquo;, I&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is of significance and of interest that the Minister for Finance is reduced to the level of making a false allegation in regard to our party and of threatening businessmen of this party for its opposition to the proposal he has for the taxation of co-ops.  For the record, there was no vote in our party on this issue, because the decision was unanimous. That is no. 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Second, as I pointed out, co-ops are, of course, taxed and paying tax on their activities which are in competition with ordinary traders.  Therefore, the Minister need not try to run either of those hares but the fact that he is trying is indictive of the straits to which he has been reduced.</P>
      <P>I was pointing out that, if the Minister had come into the House with a proposal to reappraise the whole role of co-ops to try to ensure that they contribute even more than they do at present to growth in our economy, to the provision of employment, I for one would be in full support of the Minister's proposals.  But there is no mention of that by the Minister.  I am glad to say that this party is concerned in that regard with the role of co-ops and wants to see them contribute a great deal more for the benefit of the whole of our economy, which they can do, and we are taking steps to reappraise that role in consultation with representatives of farming organisations, because we believe that there is enormous potential involved in these co-ops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we hear talk&mdash;and the Minister repeated it again today&mdash; about the size of the turnover of these co-ops.  Various figures have been tossed around and I wonder what relevance that has to anything.  The size of the turnover of any business, I would suggest, is irrelevant to taxation. What is relevant is the amount of profit that is made and here we find an interesting situation.  The net profit of co-ops as a percentage of sales is only 2.1 per cent nationally compared with an average of almost 7 per cent earned by public companies. That is not surprising if you consider the reason why co-ops were set up in the first place and the whole reason for their existence.  You find that the co-op is not the place for the large scale investor or the speculator or the entreprenuer who is really oriented towards profit.  None of those will find a place in a co-op.  The maximum shareholding allowable for each individual is £100,000, and the principle of one-man one-vote applies rigidly within the co-ops.  As I said, <Col N="1482" /> they operate on very low margins, and the maximum dividend payable is 10 per cent and many of them do not pay anything like that.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the founding of co-ops&mdash;not the only reason&mdash;was that so many small farmers were being exploited by merchants and very large companies, some of them multinational, although I do not suppose they were called multi-nationals at that time.  One consequence of damaging the co-ops is to ensure that such people will get the opportunity again to exploit the small farmer.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do well to consider the implications of what he is doing, to consider why these co-ops were set up, the role they are playing at the moment and in particular the the role they could play, given the right urging, the right handling and the right incentives by the State.  The co-ops which have built up, some of them, to a very large size have done so mainly by the retention of surpluses as a means of building up their reserves for investment.  The taxation proposed in this amendment will result in a depletion of those surpluses, a depletion of the sources of funding their investment, which has already proved to be too low in many cases.  Irish co-ops are, of their nature, very much under-capitalised.  Of their total resources, share capital accounts for only 7 per cent, while finance from loans and creditors' accounts accounts for 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, that now more than ever it is important that the co-ops are given greater freedom from the controls of the various lending agencies from whom they have to borrow, and the best way to give them that is to enable them to increase their own reserves, whereas this proposal before us will have the effect of lessening their reserves and increasing their dependance on borrowing as a source of finance.  The consequence of this will be that the co-ops will go even deeper and deeper in debt and that they will find the cost of servicing this debt through high interest charges to be an increasing burden on their operations. In fact, I have before me details&mdash; and I think the Minister received <Col N="1483" /> representations also&mdash;of a particular co-op whose premises have been taken over by a local authority which plans to build new premises, develop and extend their activities and has projected the manner in which that can be financed, and the projections applying the Minister's taxation proposals show that it simply cannot be done, and if this measure goes through that particular operation is going to disappear.</P>
    <P>The Minister should realise that, not only in that case but in the case of all the co-ops, the people who are affected are, in the main, small farmers.  Over 70 per cent of the members of even the largest co-ops are small farmers.  The Minister brought in measures here to apply income taxation to farmers, but he did not apply it to those under £20 valuation in any circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this whole proposal is grossly misconceived and will do damage to a most important sector of our economy, important economically and important socially, and that damage will affect the small farmers in particular.  It will give little or no return to the Revenue and the Minister is here striking a blow at the whole concept of co-operation in agriculture, a concept I have not heard anybody in my time attack.  On the contrary, I have heard people encourage and urge that it should be developed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the thinking behind this.  One can only assume that the thinking came from people who just do not have a notion of what these co-ops are about, what role they play in our economy and in <Col N="1484" /> rural Ireland.  The idea that we should apply this kind of approach is, I suppose, typical of what this Minister has been doing.  He applies the thumbscrew more and more in taxation. There might be some possible justification for him doing that if, at the same time, the economy was growing, the Exchequer was benefiting and he was really achieving equity in taxation. Of course, what he is really doing is causing the economy to contract, to become smaller and smaller as the demands on it get bigger and bigger, and those who could and would, given the right climate, contribute to the expansion of our economy, who would turn back the drift in the last few years, who would begin to get the country moving by their efforts and by their investment&mdash;here I do not mean just money; I mean effort&mdash;who would contribute by their production and by their contribution to exports are all being squeezed harder and harder by this Minister and by this Government.</P>
    <P>We believe that the requirements of the country at the moment are that we should identify those sectors of the economy which can, and quickly, add to employment and add to growth and these should be encouraged, urged and given incentives to do just that.  This Government are following a course diametrically opposite to that.  Nowhere is this better exemplified than in this amendment, an amendment so misconceived having regard to the state of our economy as to be almost incredible.  There are a number of Members who know, perhaps, a good deal more about this subject from personal experience than I do and they no doubt will have something to say but, even for somebody who does not have personal experience, it is not necessary for one to be a farmer or a genius to realise that this proposal is totally against the interests of the workers and the businessmen because anything tending to reduce activity in our economy, anything causing the economy to contract further, is not in the interests of any man, woman or child.  This will put more and more people on the dole.  Already a number of these co-ops are working on marginal levels.  They have been retaining <Col N="1485" /> workers in a way which would probably earn them a good deal of odium in ordinary commercial circles. But they have a sense of social obligation and they have been struggling to keep workers on in difficult circumstances. The effect of this proposal will be to ensure that these workers kept on in these difficult marginal circumstances will certainly be put on the scrap heap, all for an illusory gain to the Exchequer and a totally misconceived idea of equity in taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by reverting to the only possible argument in favour of this proposal, the alleged equity in taxation.  There are Members over there who have been ranting and prattling about equity in taxation when they did not mean one word of it, as I tried to demonstrate earlier.  If Members over there really believe there should be equity in taxation, irrespective of economic and social consequences, and this is a possible position, let them get up and propose the abolition of the exemption from tax on profits from exports of manufactured goods.  If they are not prepared to do that, let them tell us what are the economic and social consequences of this proposal of the Minister and let them justify them. Let them not try to justify them on the alleged grounds of equity in taxation.  We had enough of that kind of nonsense here in the last few years.</P>
    <P>As our economy gets weaker and weaker, the dole queues grow and inflation rises we hear more and more about this alleged equity in taxation. If Members opposite believe in equity in taxation let them get up and demand the abolition of favoured treatment in taxation for all groups, including exporting companies, and, if they are not prepared to do that, then do not tell us they are getting at the co-ops in the interest of equity in taxation.  Tell us what is the advantage socially, what is the advantage economically, in this proposal. What is the advantage to the Exchequer?  Unless we can be given very good and convincing reasons, then Members over there should think again before they go into the <Col N="1486" /> division lobby to support this misconceived proposal which, if it is carried, will certainly be repealed after the next election when we are back over there.</P>

What we are dealing with here was the putting out of a Member, whether rightly or wrongly I am not sure because I was not in the House, but I am told by my colleagues here that there was no reason for it, that if there was anybody in the wrong it was the Minister or somebody else.</P>

Seven Deputies for whom I requested pairs were in the House and subsequently were permitted to leave. People, whose names would not in the ordinary way have been given to me until the vote has been called from the floor of the House, were absent, or most of them were absent.

    <P>`period of account' has the meaning assigned to it by section 155 (5) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976; `wear and tear allowance' means an allowance under section 241 of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>

    <P>(3)  Where a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade before the 6th day of April, 1976, an accounting period of the society shall end for purposes of corporation tax on the 5th day of April, 1976.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a society carrying on a trade incurred before the 6th day of April, 1976, capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant for the purposes of the trade and that expenditure was either&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> (a)  qualifying expenditure within the meaning of section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or</P>
    <P>(b)  expenditure on qualifying machinery or plant within the meaning of section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971,</P>
    <P>an allowance equal to the specified amount of that capital expenditure may at the election of the society be made in taxing the trade of the society for the accounting period which commences on the 6th day of April, 1976, as if it were an allowance on account of the wear and tear of the machinery or plant in that accounting period, and where such an election is made, the amount of the capital expenditure on the provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of any subsequent event shall for the purposes of Chapter II of Part XVI of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be deemed to be nil.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of subsection (4) the specified amount of the capital expenditure means the amount of that capital expenditure together with any investment allowance in respect of that expenditure after deducting from the aggregate amount thereof&mdash;</P>

    <P>(c)  the aggregate of the amounts by which the wear and tear allowances in respect of that expenditure would have been diminished by the said section 220 (5) if the only wear and tear allowances for those chargeable <Col N="1495" /> periods in respect of that expenditure were the amounts which would have been made if a proper claim had been duly made by the society for each chargeable period without regard to section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out, for instance, that recently at the meeting which I am told unanimously requested the withdrawal of the proposal to remove the exemptions for agricultural and fishery co-operatives, at the same meeting they decided that £400,000 should be speculated in prospecting for oil off our coasts.  It is straining the imagination and the intelligence rather far to say that when exemption was given to the traditional agricultural and fishery co-operatives it was indicated that tax exemptions should extend to the speculation of money for oil off our coasts.  There are many other activities now engaged in by organisations which are qualified for relief which certainly very few farmers are engaged in.  For instance, one of the requests made in recent years for exemption was for the wholesale sale of ice cream by these people.  It is far from ice cream some of the small farmers or fishermen of Ireland were reared, or for whom the taxation exemptions were first introduced. <Col N="1499" /> It is a fair indication of the justice of our case when you have such heat and venom turned on, when in fact all we are doing is trying to put people in business on an equal footing.  Certain suggestions have been made by members of the Opposition and others that this Government do not know the difference between working for profit and working within a co-operative.  This has had the support of the Opposition which leads me to believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are Deputies opposite who know well that there are some co-operatives in relation to which my words of censure are well deserved.  Farmers know this too.  Some of them have written into <i>The Farmers' Journal</i>.  One farmer said he was a member of his own co-operative for 20 years and had never received an account.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were protests from people who for many years knew they were being unfairly competed against by people who were engaged in identical business.  There are many business people who have suffered and there are employees who have suffered because certain sections of the co-operative movement have competed against them on terms which were not equal, because one section was exempt from taxation and others were not.  <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> records cases of farmers expressing their disagreement with the way in which particular co-operatives have been operated.  There are examples of industries and other activities in which there was unfair competition because some are exempt and some are not. There is unfair competition in milk powder production, in cheese production, in livestock marketing, cattle slaughtering, in marketing of fertilisers, marketing of animal feed and the marketing of seeds.  These are just some of the areas in which there is unfair competition.  We also have it in relation to the manufacture and supply of equipment to the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether Deputies opposite like it or not these are areas of unfair competition. You may argue that there is a case to be made in favour of the co-operatives but it cannot be denied that there is unequal competition.  I have received representations from farmers saying they could not understand the reason for the opposition to the taxation because they had on most occasions got better terms outside <Col N="1503" /> the co-operative movement than from the co-ops.  These are the views of farmers engaged in the activities that can be serviced by either of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The involvement of co-operatives has extended far beyond what anybody could reasonably have anticipated in relation to agricultural and fisheries activities.  For instance, one well-known company, which I shall not name but which can be ascertained by anyone who refers to the financial and farming press in recent weeks, have had a substantial stake in a motor assembly industry.  In this case disputes have arisen because shareholders were not consulted in relation to selling a 49 per cent stake in the assembly industry concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These activities are not quite in keeping with the exemption. I come now to the question of the line drawn between taxed activities and those not taxed.  The difference is very hard to find, as any person familar with accounts must realise. Another area in which the co-operative movement has been engaged and engaged legitimately&mdash;let no one be under the impression that I am questioning the propriety of their being engaged in these activities&mdash;is in the manufacture of equipment not merely for small farmers but for the whole farming community and for the food processing industry.  It is good for the farmers, for the co-ops and for the country that there is this activity, but let them all be subject to the same regime of tax so that they all start <Col N="1504" /> at the line together, thereby allowing the biggest profits to be made by the most efficient concerns.  I want to see more of this activity.  Can those who are so vehement in defence of the co-operative movement justify why there should be any difference in the ultimate amount of tax paid by people who are engaged in like activities?  A number of those are exempt totally because of the descriptions given in various orders that have been made and under which almost anything can be exempt from tax so long as somebody can show that the particular equipment or activity will result ultimately in assisting the agricultural or fishery community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been alleged wrongly that the taxation of farming co-operatives will mean bringing into the tax net small farmers who are not now within that net.  There is no such proposal and anybody who has asserted otherwise has given reason for having his or her integrity called into question.  Yet that is the basis of the Fianna Fáil political campaign. That party have gone around the country pretending to people whose existence has never been made known to the Revenue Commissioners and is unlikely ever to be made known to them that because they happen to be small shareholders they will become liable to taxation.  There is no basis for any such allegation but it is the one which has brought many unfortunate farmers away from their fields earlier than was necessary so that they might attend meetings which had no relevance to their welfare.</P>

    <P>In opposing the proposal to abolish tax exemption the claim has been made that co-operatives are not strictly business concerns and should not be taxed as such.  There is a claim that they are mutual societies acting solely for the benefit of their members by providing goods and services essential to the activity of farming at <Col N="1505" /> reasonable cost and passing on all benefits gained from their commercial activities to their members.  The general contention is that the co-op is for the small farmer and to tax the co-op is to tax the small farmer. That is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that investment by the farmer and the fisherman in the co-operative movement is to be encouraged.  If for half a century exemption from tax has not provided the necessary encouragement, the subjecting of profits to taxation for the next half century is hardly likely to alter the situation. I suggest that those who have been embroiled politically and emotionally in one of the most dishonest campaigns ever in relation to taxation should turn their attention towards trying genuinely to promote the co-operative movement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With encouragement that movement can grow, but it will not grow so long as there are the powerful wealthy elements supported by the main Opposition that have opposed every taxation reform proposed by this Government, arguing that the treatment of agriculture and fishery co-ops within the taxation system is something which should not happen.</P>
      <P>What we propose will result in farmers thinking about what is happening in their co-ops, in their seeing whether they are getting value for money, whether they have over borrowed or whether the return on their capital is adequate.  This action, not only in the long term but in the short term too, will operate to the advantage of the farmers for whom the co-operative movement is intended to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem arising from the present position of exemption is that of the competition from private traders.  This has led to complaints by those traders who are liable to taxation.  In one area there was a complaint from a reputable organisation alleging unfair competition on the part of one of the large co-operative societies.  The complaint was about the activities of a large <Col N="1507" /> co-operative organisation which were importing large quantities of tinned fruits and juices which were being sold at profit margins very much below that which was customary in the trade.  A further complaint was to the effect that certain co-operative groups were diversifying into a variety of trades and commercial ventures which had previously been the traditional business of recognised sectors of industry. Incidentally, I would not consider that such a complaint was deserving of particular sympathy: I believe in competition, I believe in allowing them to do it, but on equal terms, not on unequal terms.</P>
    <P>The activity about which the complaint was made was in relation to constructional steel.  I was interested today to hear so many Deputies opposite waxing eloquent about certain complaints being made in regard to the construction industry, including the constructional steel sector concerning a certain State company.  Is it not extraordinary how they can change their attitudes as they think votes may be gained or lost?  In relation to this element of competition, I consider it is proper the co-operatives should be involved in the constructional steel industry if they want to do so, but I suggest that all these things should be on an equal basis.  However, because of the way in which the rules and regulations are drawn up at the moment, the co-operatives can engage in that activity free of tax while others who are competing with them are subject to tax.  I do not consider that to be fair.  Other activities of commercial concerns are in competition with co-operatives and there is unequal competition because the private sector are subject to tax and the others are not, including meat processing, livestock marts and poultry.</P>
    <P>The spate of criticism which has followed my announcement of the decision to terminate exemption for co-operatives should not cloud the real issue involved.  The expected yield of taxation when this proposal is fully effective will not be very great.  It will be in the region of £2 million to £3 million a year.  If profits rise, of <Col N="1508" /> course the figure will rise as well, but against a turnover of £750 million, it is peanuts.  It may be argued that it is not worth bothering about.  That is the kind of attitude that gets countries into a mess in relation to tax laws and ultimately generates frustration and political and social revolution.  If the profits are as small as alleged and if the return to the Revenue is as small as we believe it may be, it is fair to ask why there is all this excitement and opposition.  The answer is simple: It has little or no business or commercial impact on the co-op movement but it is good political manure and that is why so much of it has been flung around in recent months.  It is not based on any business-like assessment of the real position.</P>

      <P>Some of the Deputies may have seen the annual report of the co-operative movement.  Very few of the critics have even bothered to read it.  It shows that ten leading co-ops in the year 1974 made profits of between £4.5 million and £4.7 million apiece. Not bad at all, very good, and I am delighted to see them making these profits, but I consider that these profits having been made it is not inappropriate that they should bear some share of taxation.</P>

      <P>I have no figure ready to hand but no doubt this is not the last word I shall be saying on this matter before the conclusion of the debate.  If I can find the figure I will certainly give it.  In the case of the co-op which made £4.5 million, the turnover was £97.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, but there are many private businesses who have a similar experience but this does not <Col N="1509" /> exempt them from tax.  Anybody who knows anything about co-ops knows that co-ops may adjust their distribution in such a way as to reduce their book profits and pass on benefits direct to members.  This is one of the arguments advanced in favour of not taxing co-operatives at all&mdash;that co-operatives are set up not to generate profit&mdash;I will quote from the official representations made and the official handouts given to newspapers and others with great PRO backing&mdash;but for the purpose of passing back the benefits to the members.  If the operation of a tax code means that more benefits go back to members, the members should have no cause for complaint.</P>
      <P>We come back again to the central issue which is important to some people, and that is what they regard as the inadequate investment by the farming community in their own co-ops.  That position existed long before now, indeed from the beginning of the co-operative movement, and I do not believe it will be materially affected by the taxation of farming co-ops.  I am not prepared to succumb or surrender to the kind of attack Deputy Colley has so often led on me and on the Government in the House when he argues that we are wrong to be concerned with endeavouring to achieve equity in the tax system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One man's tax foregone is another man's tax load increased. The Deputy cannot gainsay that because it is true.  Tax ought to be related to capacity to bear it.  I have received strong representations during the years, particularly in relation to this proposal, that it would be inequitable to the general body of taxpayers to allow the exemption enjoyed by agriculture and fishery co-ops to be continued.  If the tax now to be levied on the co-ops is not to be paid by them it will have to be paid by the ordinary wage and salary earners who last year paid more than £359 million, which is 76.5 per cent.  Indeed, <Col N="1510" /> this year it is estimated that employees will pay more than 80 per cent of the income tax load.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible in equity to defend a situation under which a sector of the community with business turnover of more than £750 million should be excused a very small tax load at a time when employees have been carrying such a massive tax burden. The claim was also wrongly made that the imposition of income tax on co-operatives will result in the tax falling on the farming community, most of whom are not liable to tax. Of course, it is true that most farmers are not liable to tax; 95 per cent to 96 per cent of them are exempt from tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But even if the total tax bill from this new tax over the next few years was to be distributed over the total co-operative tax membership, which exceeds 160,000&mdash;and remember all farmers are not in co-operatives&mdash;the tax would turn out at something exceedingly small, probably about £10 per head per year.  The clerk-typist, paying digs along with many other burdens, will be paying on average £336 in income tax in the present year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">

      <P>Perhaps the Opposition would make up their minds and indicate whether they are for or against a fair system of taxation, when <Col N="1511" /> we could get somewhere.  It is fair to look for a moment at the attitude of the Opposition.  Since they went into Opposition they have attacked virtually every tax reform of this Government.  They have attacked all the taxes that we introduced which sought to remove some of the burden from ordinary taxpayers on to those who previously enjoyed exemption. Therefore let us see this fight for what it is.  It is a fight between privilege, on the one hand, supported by an Opposition which in power left privilege untouched and, on the other hand, a fight on the part of a Government concerned with looking after the general body of taxpayers as best they can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fight for the maintenance of a tax free position for one section of the community, whose share of the tax burden will then have to be carried by the ordinary taxpayer, the small person who has no strong organisation to create difficulties on his or her behalf.  One naturally expects the representatives of people who were not previously subject to tax to protest when they are asked to pay tax Thanks be to God they do it for, if they did not do it, we would think there was something wrong with them.  None of us likes to pay tax and from the moment we realise we are doing so we harbour a certain sense of resentment.  That has always been so.  It will always be so, I suppose one could almost say, in a healthy society.  If people succumbed without protest, then probably <Col N="1512" /> there would be something wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <P>But protest ought to be reasonable.  I would suggest that, if they want to get a hearing, those who protest about changes ought to justify their protest on facts and not on emotion.  I think there is some cause to be alarmed at the virulence and ferocity of the campaign that has been mounted in relation to the taxation of agricultural co-operatives.  I am sorry to say that &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; might be the most appropriate word. We have been told that strong organisations are actually keeping dossiers on Members of this House and of the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in which their words and actions are going to be recorded so that, if they are not in keeping with the wishes of the intimidators, they will be punished on the next occasion when the people go to the polls.  I believe this is a gross interference with not merely the rights but the obligations, which are far more important, of Members of this House.  Insofar as Members of this House have rights they are rights to be exercised for the welfare of the people, but their obligation is to all the people.  The obligation of Deputies is to ensure as best they can that all burdens on our society are equitably spread.  They are not discharging those burdens if for the sake of temporary political gain&mdash;it is certainly temporary but no doubt they hope it will be more than temporary &mdash;they champion the cause of one sector which is annoyed and thereby impose a greater burden on others. These issues go to the very foundations of democracy.  I shudder to think what would happen were the same tactics to be used throughout the length and breadth of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are not merely my thoughts. I should like to put on the record of the House the views of Mr. Raymond Smith who wrote in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of 1st April last.  He <Col N="1513" /> recorded words that I believe should be put on record here.  They are the words of an impartial observer who has from time to time applauded Members from both sides of the House and criticised Members from both sides of the House.  Nobody can say he has any particular axe to grind. This is what he says, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The demarcation line between&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The demarcation line between asking a Fine Gael or Labour Deputy where he stands on the Bill and conveying to him that farmers will vote against him in the next General Election&mdash;if he supports taxation of co-operatives&mdash; is, to my mind, a very thin one. Farmers cannot always be expected to stay on the right side of that line &mdash;if not properly guided from the top.</P>
      <P>There is a fear in political circles in Dublin that what might start as innocent questioning of Dáil Deputies could grow into something decidedly ugly.</P>
      <P>In the higher councils of the IFA itself, the danger is fully recognised. And it is accepted that individual farmers might be tempted to use intimidation and that this would be a blatant interference with the normal democratic processes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1969 when Fianna Fáil were in power they wrote into legislation an extraordinary provision to ensure that, notwithstanding exemption from tax on farming profits, farmers who had other incomes, whether from investment or from business of any sort, could set their farming losses off against other income. This enabled and encouraged wealthy hobby farmers in our midst to spend very heavily in purchasing farms against legitimate, full-time farmers and then spend very heavily on amenities of various kinds for their farms so that the resultant book losses could be set off against their profits thereby reducing the tax on their other incomes.</P>
      <P>I was very interested that when we brought this scandal to an end we received the encouragement&mdash;not merely verbally but in writing&mdash;from the farming organisations in support of our action terminating the growth of the special privilege of hobby farmers who were doing such damage to the legitimate interests of Irish farmers.  That is described as poppycock by a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I would like to put that on the record so that the farmers will know that our efforts to protect them are regarded as poppycock by a Fianna Fáil spokesman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are making this pledge in relation to the taxation of farming co-operatives.  How many other pledges have been given?  Why not <Col N="1516" /> tell the PAYE payers, which is something they ought to tell because it is quite clear from their actions this is what they intend, that they will also abolish wealth tax and capital gains tax because their Ard Fheis mandated them not to introduce it and to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is not true, like the other statements the Minister has made about this party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt Fianna Fáil will also proceed to restore many other privileges that we have removed, including the privilege of exemption from taxation on mines.</P>

      <P>That is another interesting example.  It will be recalled that when Fianna Fáil were in power in 1967 they granted a period of exemption for 20 years to the mining industry.  The interesting thing is that they granted that exemption although nobody asked them for it.  They are now giving pledges when they are being asked for them and because they are succumbing to intimidation which our Deputies will not succumb to.  We are being told about many other privileges they will restore.</P>

      <P>I was pointing out that just nine years ago the Fianna Fáil Party gave a 20 year exemption from taxation on mining profits although nobody asked them for it. My distinguished predecessor, the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman, was present at the meeting when this bonanza was thrown out, although unasked <Col N="1517" /> for.  As he said in this House, God be good to him, he nearly fell off his chair with shock and so did his colleagues.</P>

      <P>It is also the attitude of Fianna Fáil in relation to many other things: let off those who are best in a position to pay but screw those who have no opportunity of avoiding it.  That is not acceptable to this Government.  We will never subscribe to that attitude.  All this should be carefully weighed by people when they consider a very fundamental issue: the whole approach of political parties in the country to the question of who should pay to run the country.</P>

      <P>We believe that all should make their fair contribution. To listen to the Fianna Fáil Party one would think that wealth was not generated by anybody in the country except the wealthy.

      <P>The person who receives and invests money is also generating wealth and also has an obligation to pay tax just as much as the labourer because all enjoy the blessings and the benefits of our society. No person should get exemption because he happens to have more wealth than another.  All should pay their fair share.  That is all this Government have ever endeavoured to do.</P>

All of those things have helped to provide jobs which in turn have generated wealth and have given an opportunity for people in the country to expand.

Deputy Colley knows that you have then to collect it by way of indirect taxation. We had months of opposition by the Fianna Fáil Party going on while we discussed this Finance Bill, objecting to indirect taxation on some of the less essentials of life.  There has to be a balance.  We never pretended otherwise. We are very far from even striking a balance but we are at least taking a step in the right direction when we are asking for a contribution of a couple of million pounds from an activity which has a turnover of £750 million, which has disclosed profits of £18 million and which is on a growth path.</P>

The information furnished with his claim was insufficient to enable the amount of his earnings during the 1974-75 income tax year, on which his entitlement to pay-related benefit depended, to be ascertained.  The further inquiries which were necessary have now been completed and his weekly entitlement to that benefit has been assessed.  In the meantime it had been decided by a deciding officer that he was not unemployed from 15th March, 1976, to 7th April, 1976, in respect of which period he had signed the unemployed register.

On the basis of this rate of means, which is derived from self employment and from ownership of land, he is entitled to unemployment assistance at a reduced rate subject to the usual conditions for receiving it.

The records of this Department showed that a total of only seven contributions was paid in respect of her.  On the information supplied by the claimant, however, it appears that she had had employment for which further contributions had been paid but in respect of which a stamped insurance card could not be produced and also employment in respect of which contributions had not been paid.

      <P>The contractor operating the transport service to Rath national school also operates another service for handicapped children to a special school in Birr.  It is not possible to arrange for both sets of pupils to arive at their respective schools at 9.30 a.m. without employing an additional contractor and this would involve considerable additional expense.  I have, however, arranged for a somewhat later arrival time for the Killyon children, 9.15 a.m. instead of 9.00 a.m.</P>
