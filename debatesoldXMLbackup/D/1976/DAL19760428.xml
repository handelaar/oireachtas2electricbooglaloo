      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach or the Minister for Labour about No. 17 on the Order Paper, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill, 1975?  On 7th April last, I asked when we could expect a statement from the Government clarifying the situation in view of the confusion that has been created.  On that morning the Minister for Labour said he would issue a statement shortly.  I want to know now when we may expect that statement from him.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy sought that morning was information about the status of the amending Bill which was before the House.  On that matter no formal communication has been received as yet from the Commission in Brussels.  On the general position of the Equal Pay Bill, 1974, it was made abundantly clear during the passage of that amending Bill here recently that if Brussels were not accepting the amending Bill, the full terms of the 1974 Equal Pay Bill would apply.  Although no formal communication has been received from Brussels on the amending Bill, it is clear from statements made from Brussels that the terms of the amending Bill will not be accepted and therefore, as I have made clear in <Col N="160" /> this House and elsewhere, the full terms of the 1974 Equal Pay Bill apply. However, shortly, as soon as a formal communication is received from Brussels, I will make a statement in the House.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1976: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this measure one must be aware that the Finance Bill and the budget are imperfect annual mechanisms for economic recovery and growth.  Nevertheless, in this debate we have seen highlighted two basic problems facing the Government, and I think these reside at the core of the expansion of a modern mixed economy such as ours. The first is how to regain some measure of full employment without further accelerating our rate of inflation.  The second problem is how to manage the economy in an open and egalitarian manner without excessively increasing wages and prices and the general level of taxation.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that the Finance Bill attempted to deal with these two problems, and there is a paucity of constructive comment from the Fianna Fáil Party on how these two basic economic problems should be dealt with.  We must acknowledge that any employment prospects well be dependent on progressive economic policies being fully implemented by the Government. If we are to have any hope of not having in excess of 100,000 people unemployed again next year, we need a major surge forward similar to that generated in the sixties by the late Seán Lemass and the former secretary of the Department of Finance, Mr. Whitaker.  We need a major development in productive capital formation, because without this there is no hope of recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in the fifties when I first started work the question at issue was whether the Irish as a race would survive, there were so many emigrating at the time.  That is not an issue today.  Because of the growth in the economy due to the commencement <Col N="161" /> of major industrial development in the sixties, we are not faced with that appalling situation. But we are faced with a very critical, continuing unemployment situation, and the question is, does the Finance Bill in any way mitigate that degree of unemployment?</P>
    <P>I hold the view that within the Department of Finance and within our major representative bodies, both employers' organisations and trade union organisations and at general industrial level, particularly in bodies like the CII, the IMI and so on, there has been an improvement in expertise in economic management.  There has certainly been an improvement in entrepreneurial skills, and I would hope that political abilities to manage a mixed economy would also have grown in that period.  I frankly have my doubts that the political judgement of the Oireachtas in the seventies has shown much maturity in handling the complexities of a mixed economy.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Second Stage debate on this Bill did not give much hope that what one would call the political input of the political parties has been of major consequence.  If we are to make any serious impact on such startling data as that produced by the NESC, when they indicated we have to have a net increase of about 30,000 jobs annually in order to absorb new entrants to the work force to make up for redundancy in agriculture, I wonder if this Finance Bill or the views of the Opposition in relation to it are likely to make any impact at all.</P>
    <P>I get very cynical when I see both the Opposition and some other politicians screaming about the Walsh Report.  One would not have imagined that it was available right through 1975.  It was only when somebody suddenly discovered that Brendan Walsh and a few more academics had done these projections that they were suddenly dragged out of somebody's drawer somewhere and somebody began to read them, but they were available for at least 15 to 18 months prior to that recent spate of publicity which they received.  However, politicians are wont to find things out 15 <Col N="162" /> or 18 months later, just as, for example, in relation to the Finance Bill perhaps the most serious criticism was that it was deflationary at the time when one should have been attempting to hold course.  Therefore the question is does this Finance Bill aid economic recovery and to what extent could it be regarded as a contribution towards economic and social planning? That is the question that we have to attempt to answer in any assessment of the Bill itself.  It is very easy to put on an ideological hat and to say, &ldquo;Well, of course, the Bill is not a contribution towards effective economic planning.&rdquo;  It is quite a different exercise trying to spell out in detail what other mechanisms one would favour in practice.  That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I make a plea, and here I share the view of the managing director of the IDA when he spoke at the Statistical and Social Enquiry Society of Ireland symposium last November, and I quote him:</P>
    <P>I make a plea therefore that we do not waste time seeking simplistic solutions.</P>
    <P>He correctly pointed out that the environment for industry today is far more complex than it was in 1958. The nostalgic harping back of both Deputy Haughey and Deputy Colley for the good old days of Seán Lemass when things were nice and simple, with a little bit of trade protection here and there and you kept an industry floating, is useless.  Now with EEC membership, with much closer world economies, with violent fluctuations in monetary policies, with a far more volatile industrial technology, with markets which can come and disappear overnight, with very rapid job losses&mdash;and most job losses in this country have been on the import competing side&mdash;and with the very substantial cost of new job investment, planning in this climate is extremely complex and formidable.  It seems to me, therefore, that there is no simplistic solution.</P>
    <P>In view of that, for the Opposition in Dáil Éireann to hope that the Minister for Finance will trot in here once a year with one Finance Bill, or that <Col N="163" /> he will arrive in a few months time with a new economic and social plan produced by the Government is naïve in the extreme.  One might say that we all want plans and we all want Finance Bills, provided the other fellow is foolish enough to produce them for us, and no sooner are they produced than we tear these propositions to shreds.  Very frequently we have nothing much to contribute ourselves.</P>
    <P>I favour planning mechanism.  I see some reason why one should support the view&mdash;in other matters I do not agree with the gentleman&mdash;of one economist, Mr. Desmond Norton, who in his broadsheet&mdash;&ldquo;Problems in Economic Planning and Policy Formation in Ireland, 1958-1974&rdquo;&mdash;suggested that we need a rolling plan of some four years' duration which would take into account unforeseen initial conditions and which would also take into account the accumulation of information over time.  I see merit in that.  The planning, therefore, in the context of the budget and the Finance Bill, must be an ongoing exercise. It is rather like wishing that there would be a 13th programme for economic expansion produced tomorrow morning with a joint foreword by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, and by Deputy Colley with a nostalgic epilogue written by Deputy Haughey.  That kind of production is not likely to produce one new job in this country.  This presumably is the purpose of that exercise.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I stress the point that there are no simplistic solutions.  I think I am in order in dealing with the planning aspect of the Finance Bill to the extent to which it fits into a planning context.  There has been a lot of windy talk about national planning.  There is a naïve view, very prevalent among politicians and some business people, very prevalent in Fianna Fáil who keep on demanding that the Government must produce plans and so on, that all the Department of Finance have to do is to produce another paper plan of, say, objective economic projections to 1980 and automatically we will all know <Col N="164" /> where we are going.  I remember going through that exercise in the mid-sixties in regard to the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion.  I remember going through them on the annual review of industry. I remember when I was not in this House and when both Deputy Haughey, and Deputy Colley subsequently, were solemnly hostile to those programmes for economic expansion. They did not believe in it at all.  They bitterly resented the old NIEC reports. How dare anybody suggest that Dáil Éireann and the Cabinet were not capable of knowing their own minds? There was great hostility to that performance and the attitude was: &ldquo;We will produce an annual budget and we will have an annual Finance Bill and we will know exactly where we are going.&rdquo;  Some politicians, therefore, suffer from what might be called in the Irish context a simplistic beggary.  I think that is the only phrase I can use.</P>
    <P>The real life of investments, of employment, of export promotion, and the complex problem of social planning cannot all be encompassed in a 20,000 word document produced by the Department of Finance once every three or four years.  My plea is that the entrepreneurial managers in the private and public sectors do their main job, get on with the job of economic recovery and not sit back and wait for the Government to just produce a plan. That is not in any way to defend the almost total absence of economic and social planning in the past five years.</P>
    <P>I do not share the view that it will prove to be the total panacea for all ills.  There has been an almost complete absence of economic planning and a great underestimation of the gravity of the situation, particularly during the first half of 1975.  I hold the view that many of the efforts to curb inflation were not particularly sophisticated and some of them were positively hamfisted.  It might even be argued at times that there seems to be an absence of a coherent policy. These criticisms are valid enough but they do not get over the fact that we still have to have, by our own ingenuity in the public and private sector, managers <Col N="165" /> who are creative, inventive and have imagination.  Unless such managers have in the export areas a flair for design and a flair for going to other countries to get markets for their products we are in for a very grim time in 1977.</P>
    <P>Even now two out of every five jobs here are dependent on our exports.  If we lose our competitiveness in the export field&mdash;there is not that much indication that as yet we have&mdash;the two out of every five jobs in manufacturing industry at present will go down the drain because no foreign importer owes any Irish worker a job.  I hope, therefore, that the plea that we get on with the job of economic recovery will ring a bell in somebody's ears.  I do not hold the commonly expressed view in some ultra-conservative business sectors that the Irish people have lost the incentive to work.  That is simplistic nonsense.  Some hold that view because they can no longer avoid paying taxes. There are some who would hold the view that they should not pay taxes at all, like the 120 or more family investment trusts that are now being wound up here.  Deputy Colley's heart bleeds for them although they have been avoiding taxation for the past ten or 15 years.  They are now caught and my heart does not bleed for them.  It is time we all in that context paid our taxes because otherwise the prospects of having any kind of budgetary revenue here will go down the drain.</P>
    <P>There are those who simply believe that some economic mandarin in the Department of Finance is just going to produce a plan that we would all work to gaily without question.  I describe that as simplistic binary.  There are those who maintain that the country has lost any incentive to work and I dismiss that view also.  There are those who would take a more realistic view.  The reality of our economic set up is that we have a tripod policy of economic future development.  We have a strong agricultural base. We have prosperous farmers and we are glad to have them.  We have a well off substantially based food industry and both farmers and <Col N="166" /> workers in these agricultural sectors are about twice as well off now as they were 10 years ago.  God knows we pour enough taxation money into them to keep them that way.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I questioned the Minister for Finance about aid to agriculture and I am sure Deputy Callanan would be interested in the reply I received. In terms of aid in 1965, £54 million was given to agriculture; in 1970 it was £95 million; in 1972, £114 million; in 1974, £156 million and in 1975, £219 million.  Revenue from agriculture, Exchequer-wise, was £18.6 million in 1975.  Therefore, the net aid was £200 million.  The real increase in aid and revenue from agriculture which is staggering over 1965 is about 77 per cent&mdash;a phenomenal growth in aid to agriculture.  One gets a bit of a pain, and I am sure every industrial worker liable for PAYE gets a bit of a pain, when one reads of the income tax paid by farmers and rates payable in respect of agricultural holdings for 1975.  Income tax realised £1.6 million which, in the context of income tax, is peanuts.  I can break down that figure.  The income from the restriction of allowances where there is an income other than farming profits was £500,000.  Farmers with another trade or business paid £1 million in taxation to the Exchequer and farmers whose sole income was farming in 1975 paid £100,000 in taxation.</P>

      <P>The cost of putting the Finance Bill through this House, in terms of time in debate, printing and circulating it to farmers, I would say was a nett loss to the Exchequer.  It brought in £100,000 from farmers whose sole income was from farming.  It probably lost about £100,000.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy heard what was said in this House by Deputy Colley and others and the promises made by the Deputy's party at IFA meetings around the country that they would abolish income tax for the farmers, the Deputy would not support the view that I put forward, that is, that one can have a farm of £80 or £50 valuation and can make a good living from it.  You can have a farm of £100 valuation which can make a loss for one reason or another. Therefore, the valuation system is crazy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but any effort by the Government to introduce a rational system of income taxation for farmers has been thwarted. With all due respect to Deputy Callanan, the Fianna Fáil capacity at the moment is to vote for the poor, give promises behind closed doors to the rich about what they will do after the next general election and then to assure both that they will protect one another.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond is in possession and he must be allowed to make his contribution without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a strong industrial and services sector which, <Col N="168" /> even in recession, has done remarkably well in relation to exports but which has suffered quite heavy unemployment in the domestic importing sector.  That sector contributes to the economy due to the fact that two of every five industrial workers in this country are engaged in exports.  We have a very substantial and efficient construction sector in this country. A lot of speculative fat has gone from the construction industry.  Fly-by-night merchants are no longer making a £1,000 on a private house.  The major and efficient construction firms have remained in this sector.  We also have State-sponsored bodies which are fairly efficient and reasonably well managed. Some of them in terms of their management structure seem akin to private enterprise and some might not necessarily be called, to any great degree, State-sponsored bodies.  Nonetheless, they are pretty efficient and well managed.</P>
      <P>These four sectors employ tens of thousands of Irish men and women. They are the basic productive wealth of the nation.  I have no doubt that these sectors will contribute towards economic recovery in this country.  It is the job of politicians to provide democratic institutions of the State to enable these sectors to develop in confidence.  Our financial institutions must provide them with short term liquidity and investment.  It is important to note that despite the gloom of Fianna Fáil our external reserves are quite healthy.  Our level of domestic savings is quite substantial.  As a result of this we were never better poised for economic recovery.  Farm prices were very good in 1975 and with many other sectors receiving a 30 per cent wage increase in 1975 I hold the view that it is not a surprise that the level of domestic savings should not have gone up to such a substantial degree but it is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The civil service must work to provide flexible administration to protect the public interest as determined by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Within the public sector and the public service, the civil service in particular, there is enormous goodwill and a high degree of dedication, ready to <Col N="169" /> make a contribution towards economic recovery.  It is the job of politicians, particularly those in charge of the various Government Departments, to harness that goodwill, to give it a sense of purpose, to lay out clear strategies in each Government Department, so that the public service will know what is expected of it and will have a respect for the political heads of those Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Our trade union movement has special responsibility at all levels towards economic recovery.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employment organisations of this country deserve tremendous support.  They have overcome a number of obstacles that have been placed in their way&mdash; not least by the Finance Bill&mdash;and produced a national wage agreement. I would advise some of my colleagues in veiled terms that between now and the ratification of that agreement by the parties concerned they would be well advised to stay quiet.  While I know it is a political function of the heads of any Department, particularly the Department of Finance, to manage the economy in the context of the Finance Bill, I believe that there are occasions when silence could make a major contribution to enabling the parties to reach agreement and I would make that plea.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone should think that I am anti economic and social planning let me say that what we need is a flexible form of consultative review structure for our key economic and social sectors. In such a structure the major representative bodies would have to have an adequate opportunity of alerting one another to individual problems and anticipated needs.  A structure of that kind would be more beneficial than simply the opening of another office block in Merrion Square staffed by principal officers and assistant secretaries and which would be called a national planning commission office.  I have reservations about that kind of structure.  As an integral part of their evolutions of economic strategy the Government should promote a more flexible, more positive and, perhaps, an enlarged role for the National Economic and Social <Col N="170" /> Council.  We should concentrate on developing existing institutions rather than setting up more institutions. Already we have enough self-appointed institutions without the politicians adding further structures unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The NESC should develop as a common meeting ground as between their members and the Government. The previous Administration was totally remiss in this regard.  There is no evidence that Fianna Fáil had such a structure within their Cabinet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is less evidence now of any such structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that there is one now but the point I am making is that there is need for an economic and social committee within the Cabinet structure and that there should be direct discussions between that Cabinet sub-committee and the members of the NESC.  The work of the Cabinet sub-committees would be to commence internal reports and then proceed to discuss them with the major representative bodies.  This is what gives flesh and blood to what we call planning.  It is a much more flexible and more effective approach than simply setting up a grandiose bureaucratic office, placing gilt letters on the door and calling the office a national planning commission.  I do not wish to see our public service economists hived off into that sort of service because ultimately it would lead to the same kind of situation we had when the old NIEC reports were presented. Deputy Haughey did not want to hear about them.  Deputy Colley became very frustrated about the whole matter because, as Minister for Finance, he thought someone was impinging on his prerogatives, that somebody from outside was giving him advice.  Too many reports were appearing so the whole thing became too much for the then Minister. There must be an inter-meshing between the Government and the NESC.  In recent times we have seen the National Employer-Labour Conference assume the role of government for a while in relation to the <Col N="171" /> planned development of income levels during the next 15 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy objecting to that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I should have thought that the role of the Oireachtas would not necessarily conflict with the role of representative bodies and that there should be a high degree of consultation on that basis.  Irrespective of the acceptance or otherwise of the current pay package I, as a trade unionist, intend voting in favour of it in my union.  The NELC have assumed a major economic and social role in our economy. Therefore, any consultative planning structure must encompass that body.</P>
      <P>I emphasise again that, rather than create new institutions, we should concentrate on developing existing ones.  An example of what I have in mind was the development in the Department of Social Welfare of a programme of reform.  This programme was initiated by the Parliamentary Secretary with the full co-operation of the departmental staff. Another development of an existing institution was the responsibility given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to officers in his Department for the formation of a policy on the advancement of our oil, gas and mineral development.  There are some fine officers in the section concerned. They know where they are going. They have a sense of purpose and do not need any new monolith in order to get on with the job.  It is regrettable that Fianna Fáil Ministers were not so constructive while in Government. Indeed, the reverse was in evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Would the Deputy like to elaborate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is arguable whether the annual budget, particularly the capital budget, is the most effective short-term mechanism for economic policy.  The Finance Bill can be of no use if the policy of the Government of the day oscillates widely and bends exclusively to the pressures of different lobby groups or <Col N="172" /> to the interests of political expediency in the months preceding each budget. However, where a Government have evolved a definite line of economic and budgetary policy for their span in office the annual budget is an admirable means of implementing that policy.  A capital budget with a perspective of up to five years would be of major benefit.  As a member of a local authority I know how frustrating it is to be dependent on the often wild fluctuations in capital allocations for housing, roads, sanitary services and so on, sometimes on the basis of a six-month period.  One must have a coherent policy in regard to forward planning and capital allocations. Otherewise it has a corrosive effect on local authority planning and on employment. It is also extremely wasteful.</P>
      <P>As a social democrat and a socialist I am in favour of strong purposeful economic and social planning.  That does not necessarily mean I would throw out the baby with the bath water in terms of the role of the annual budget.  It is regrettable that Ministers for Finance in recent years &mdash;and here I would include all three: Deputy Haughey, Deputy Colley and to an extent Deputy Ryan as well&mdash; have worked on a six monthly basis. There are enormous pressures on them.  Every Minister for Finance deserves our sympathy.  The enormous pressures on them mean that long-term economic management perspectives on the economy go out the door. They work on a six monthly basis and this is disastrous in terms of managing the economy.

      <P>I gather there is one on security and one has been publicly announced at sub-governmental study level.  I am not so sure there is an economic and planning sub-committee as such.  If our politicians at Government and Opposition level are incapable of planning ahead for two or three years, what hope has national planning?  There is a very sensible argument that what a Government decide to do in the first 12 months determines what will be done politically for the next three or four years.  That is very true.  Any decisions of any consequence which have ever been taken in this country at political level have been taken in the first 12 months after the Government took office.  They spend the next 12 months explaining why they did certain things in the first 12 months, and the last 12 months in office explaining why they should be re-elected.</P>

      <P>It is a very interesting thought.  Looking back over the Dáil debates proves that the Fianna Fáil Party's preoccupation was power and Government and not so much the management of the country or dealing with departmental affairs, and so on.  They were the Government.  They were in power and they let the civil servants run the country.  We have tried to do the two jobs and I am not quite sure we have succeeded.  We have to be serious about economic planning.  I have no doubt that in the mid-sixties Deputy Lynch, Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland regarded the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion as purely public relations exercises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The only man who turned up for the funeral of the third economic programme was the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  I think Ruaidhrí Roberts sent a telegram of regret from Congress.  Congress were never particularly in favour of that kind of indicative programming.  They <Col N="175" /> were in favour of a more full-blooded version.</P>
      <P>In this context we must consider the proposals of my colleague, Senator Halligan.  I gather we cannot refer to the Seanad but he made a public contribution about the need for a much greater rate of job creation.  I am not entirely in favour of the setting up of a national planning commission.  I do not think enough work has been done on the creation of a national pensions insurance fund as yet for us as politicians really to understand what we are talking about.  A great deal of work is being done by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Cluskey, on the question of a national occupational injuries fund and a national pensions fund.  I should like to see the results of that work before making up my mind about it.  There is a proposal that a State development corporation should be set up.  I am not entirely in favour of it.  We should have a State holding corporation because the State now has a very substantial amount of shares in private companies.  I know I am precluded from mentioning private companies but I see merit in the concept of a State holding company holding substantial State investment in the private sector.  I gather the Minister for Industry and Commerce may favour that concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He has been converted to that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The State holds substantial shares in such well-known companies as Asahi, Cement Road-stone, Tara, and so on.  A very substantial slice of the taxpayers' money is invested by the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, ICI, ICC and Irish Life in the public sector.  They need to be monitored on a regular basis in aggregate by the State to ensure co-ordination of investment and policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is patently impossible for the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce to undertake the complex task of accountability on a regular basis for the very large State investment in the private sector.  The IDA have major <Col N="176" /> equity share holdings in seven major Irish industries.  Therefore, there is logic in the concept of what I would call a State investment holding company which would be rather different from a State development corporation. I do not think much flesh has been put on the latter concept.  I understand the Government favour such a proposal.  It would be extremely interesting to hear the views of the other economic members of the Cabinet, particularly the Minister for Finance, on such a proposition.</P>
    <P>I might deal also with the proposal of Senator Halligan that the State should hold a segment of the commercial banking structure.  Frankly, I would prefer to turn the horse around in another direction.  Rather than the Oireachtas trying out any type of unconstitutional expropriation&mdash;which I do not think is on in terms of an infusion into the commercial banking system&mdash;I would pick a different horse to back.  Rather should the Oireachtas expand the Central Bank's statues to enable the bank, where appropriate in the national interest, to underwrite such developments and, for example, the State's industrial, commercial ventures in say, oil, gas and mineral development.  The Central Bank should be entitled to be involved in that role.  It should not be left exclusively to our commercial banks.  This would be to our benefit. Of course, it would constitute a radical policy change.</P>
    <P>In our planning and in the strictures we have made of late we have failed to acknowledge the pivotal role of the Industrial Development Authority in job creation.  Any national planning mechanism, even on a consultative basis, which fails to take into account the role of the IDA will simply flop.  Too many commentators and politicians gloss over the fact that the scale of industrial development by the IDA since 1970 exceeded that of the entire preceding lifespan of the IDA since their inception by the second Coalition in 1950.  More work was done by the IDA in terms of actual industrial investment since 1970 than in the whole of the 20 years from 1950 to 1970.  Between 1970 and <Col N="177" /> 1975 the IDA approved industrial proposals from home and overseas sources, with a potential of 95,000 jobs at full production, compared with 68,000 in the preceding 20 years.  One must bear that tremendous contribution in mind.</P>
    <P>I have been rather critical of some comments made about, say, a national planning commission, a national pensions insurance fund and so on; I have not been entirely enamoured of some of those concepts. One of the points made was that our State-sponsored bodies be given a more active commercial role.  I would go along with that.  There is a need to give the manufacturing and marketing State-sponsored bodies a full opportunity to engage in direct competition.  They should be given a competitive role and allowed enter into joint ventures with the private sector.  The State should give State-sponsored bodies every encouragement in that direction.  They should be allowed to engage in viable, commercial, competitive operations.  I do not hold the very traditional view, which is very much a Fianna Fáil one, that there must be a sharp division between the public sector&mdash;which is purely for servicing the private sector&mdash;and the private sector, which must be allowed to get all the cream. In a mixed economy the State must achieve a fair balance between the private and public sectors.  If we are to achieve any real economic recovery our State-sponsored bodies must be given an opportunity to engage in direct, competitive undertakings.  I would support any proposal made in that direction.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of very unfair public comment by some business people about the lack of State understanding and support for their business.  As a matter of fact, I get a bit of a pain when I hear some of this because the same business people have no hesitation in demanding from Members of the Oireachtas and from all Government Ministers all sorts of concessions in relation to their ordinary day-to-day commercial activities. The managing directors of some businesses slate the Government from on <Col N="178" /> high for their taxation policies while, at the same time, writing letters to Ministers seeking help from Fóir Teoranta, from the IDA&mdash;from the taxpayers' money.  They come screaming to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards with technological problems, again taxpayers' money; they want assistance from CCT for export markets, again taxpayers' money.  They want assistance in relation to industrial training from AnCO and, in relation to the filling of jobs, they want to avail of the services of the National Manpower Service, again the taxpayers' money. We have too much belly-aching from some business people about what the State allegedly is or is not doing in the taxation structure.  It is time we recognised that the State gives massive assistance to the private sector.  We are a mixed economy and there is no reason why we should not do so.  It should be acknowledged also that millions of ounds of taxpayers' money are given in transfer payments to private enterprise here.  I do not begrudge the giving of that money but certainly I find it disturbing that some individuals very much resent the fact that they have to pay some taxes and, consequently, will not acknowledge what they get from the State.</P>
    <P>If we are to have any real economic recovery we shall have to examine very carefully the public capital programme in conjunction with the Finance Bill.  I do not know how we will do it; whether we would ever get sanction for such borrowing.  I would advance the view that at present it is arguable that we should have a supplementary capital budget; if we could have an emergency public capital programme of approximately £150 million.  Admittedly, one would have to find £15 million to £20 million a year to service that borrowing.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that if one had a major capital programme for productive investment introduced on an emergency basis&mdash;and this is something I favour&mdash;productive work for the tens of thousands of unemployed could be found in the short term.  There would be a consequential saving in social welfare payments and the Exchequer <Col N="179" /> would gain more in PAYE. At least 50 per cent of the £150 million programme would go in wages with, as I said, a consequential saving to the State in social welfare payments because of a substantial reduction in unemployment.  This suggestion should be seriously examined by the Government. This is not just a gimmick.  In such a major capital programme a great deal of the money could go on essential construction purposes, more than might be devoted to an expansion of the telephone service, which is itself quite viable.  A good deal of the money could be spent in the direction of coping with the explosion we will have in our schools because of the tremendous growth in the young age segment of the population.  That kind of public capital investment could substantially reduce unemployment because one could put 20,000 back to work with a programme of that kind.  I would certainly favour such a programme.</P>
    <P>We should exercise great care in our concept of economic planning.  The generation of economic activity, the expertise required in coming to an investment decision in a particular firm, which may be trying to project a price 12 months ahead, coping with severe monetary fluctuations and the harnessing of the goodwill and dedication of the public service sector are not easily amenable to the grand strategy of planning and the answer to our real problems will not necessarily be found in just another programme for economic expansion.  The answer will certainly not come from the conservative business spokesmen, such as the President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, or the head of the Construction Industry Federation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would point out that some of the socalled <i>entrepreneurs</i> who denounce the Minister for what they call his anti-business attitude&mdash;such rubbish&mdash; and who at their poverty stricken business lunches denounce alleged abuses of social welfare would be better employed in ensuring that export delivery dates are met as promised and in raising the level of productivity in their own firms.  They would certainly be better employed in ensuring that this Government are not unfairly attacked.

      <P>We have listened for a considerable period now to Deputy Desmond, who might be described as the shock absorber of the Government. Last night we listened to his attack on the IFA, on the clerics, to a bit of bishop bashing, and today we listened to his attack on the farmers, the industrialists, the <i>entrepreneurs</i> and the people who talk about abuses of social welfare benefits.  He has attacked almost every section.  I would point out to him that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health has already spoken out loudly about abuses in social welfare and the corrective measures that will be taken to ensure this practice is stopped at the earliest possible moment.  Of course this is typical of Deputy Desmond's approach.  He seeks to be on both sides at the same time, but I think the public have now become aware of the double dealing approach of the Deputy and his words now go unheeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the budget and this Finance Bill it is difficult to rely on statements made by Ministers.  There is a confusion of thought.  There is a change in attitude from day to day. All this makes it very difficult for the man in the street to understand what exactly a Minister means when he makes a statement and whether that statement has the support of the <Col N="181" /> Government or whether it is a personal view.  It is difficult to know in what capacity he makes the statement. In the not too distant past statements have been made in the capacity of private individuals.  Statements have been made and repudiated by official sources.  As I say, it is difficult to assess what Ministers really mean when they make statements, difficult to know if the statements are an indication of Government policy, an indication of a desire to implement some particular measure.  Like many people I have completely lost interest in ministerial statements.  Emphasis is placed on one thing today and another thing tomorrow and repudiated the next day.</P>
    <P>I no longer examine the statements made by the Minister for Finance in any depth or detail because I feel that in a matter of hours the statement will be repudiated, twisted or rejected. Instead I read the Minister's horoscope every morning to find out exactly what will happen.  We are told here under &ldquo;Your Lucky Stars&rdquo;: &ldquo;Your sense of loyalty will keep you going today when it seems you would be a lot better off if you threw in the towel&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is rather peculiar.  Who, in fact, is running the country?  In the Minister's speech introducing this Bill he told us that £34 out of £100 has to be borrowed.  That figure was increased recently by another Minister to £35. We have the appalling situation in which £35 out of every £100 has to be borrowed.  In the case of a person receiving a possible £10 benefit £3.50 of that benefit is borrowed money. This situation is difficult to understand. Money has been offered if it is spent in the way the people who offered it have indicated.  Therefore, we have lost control of the situation. <Col N="182" /> This is a serious matter in a particularly critical time in our history.</P>
      <P>The Government are a bankrupt concern.  It has been said by some people that they have not enough left to pay a compliment.  Those are the people who are dealing with the crisis we are facing.  Is it worthwhile discussing the situation in the House? Deputy Desmond, when discussing this Finance Bill, was flying his kite about a second budget, an emergency budget.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance told us some time ago that if the pay pause was not honoured the Government would have to act.  We are now faced with another budget.  I am quite sure when there is an examination in depth made of the problems that have been placed on the country by the Government, by their inactivity and irresponsibility, the people in due course will make their voices heard.  If our situation is an example of what we can expect by the compiling together of two policies, the just society and the new republic, then the people will answer in a short space of time.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance is replying to this debate I would expect, if he has an important statement to make, that he would make it in the House not in Killarney.  The House here is the appropriate place to make important statements.  We have been told in the press that the Minister for Finance has an important statement to make which will be made in Killarney.  We hope that he will instead make that statement in the House.  There are other Ministers parading through the country trying to deflect people's attention from the real problems of inflation, unemployment and the other matters which the Finance Bill seeks to remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear talk about family limitations but people at the moment are more concerned with bills than with pills.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would be better off devoting his time and energy making some suggestions about alleviating the terrible problems which confront the country rather than dealing with his suggested limitations of family as a solution to the economic problems. Our economic problems are vast but <Col N="183" /> we must have a look at the situation in general.</P>
    <P>It has recently been revealed that the unemployment situation is much worse than people were led to believe over the past three years.  We are told now that there are approximately 180,000 people unemployed.  There are 115,500 people on the live register plus the 20,000 small farmers and between 30,000 and 50,000 school leavers.  This party have indicated on many occasions that the live register is not a true indication of the number of people unemployed.  Last December 23,000 people were unemployed in the building trade.  This increased in January to 24,500, that is an increase of 6,424 over last year's figure.  As the same time we are told by the Minister for Local Government that the Government are building more houses than ever before despite the fact that 24,500 fewer people are employed in the building trade, that 10 per cent less cement and 10 per cent less sand is used and the yards of the builders providers are full of timber and other essential items for the production of houses.  The Minister, therefore, is building houses without sand, cement and men.  We have the &ldquo;Jim-will-fix-it&rdquo; situation in the House.  Every time the question of housing the people is mentioned the Minister trots out that the record breaking house building programme is reaching its target, but when one examines the matter one finds the situation is different.</P>
    <P>We find in the food industry at the moment that 6,877 people are unemployed, that is 1,817 people more than last year, so the position in that industry is a major cause of concern. In the clothing industry 5,240 people are unemployed; in the metal manufacturing industry, 16,016; transport and communications, 5,181, an increase of 1,097 on last year's figure. In yesterday's paper we find that more jobs are to go, that the &ldquo;Stock Exchange switch hit jobs&rdquo; because a printing contract is to go to Britain from the Irish Stock Exchange, a £12,000 contract, which must mean additional unemployment in the printing industry.  We are told that there <Col N="184" /> will be a reduction of one-third of the work force on the Dublin docks, which means there will be substantial redundancy there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, April 27th in relation to the Stock Exchange.  We also see on the same page headlines of &ldquo;Redundancy tussle in Court,&rdquo; 37 employees of British Rail for lay-off, &ldquo;Ballsbridge picket&rdquo;, the Dublin College's Branch of the Teachers' Union pickets the headquarters of the Vocational Education Committee. &ldquo;Mum should not work unless she has to&rdquo;.  There is also a criticism of Deputy Desmond on this page for some of his outbursts.  We have a vast number of people unemployed.  If we look at the figures submitted by the Central Statistics Office we find that last year there was an increase in unemployment in the building trade of 6,424; in agriculture, 2,277; the food industries. 1,817; the distributive trades, 1,529; the personnel services, 1,171: transport and communications, 1,097; the professions, 753; unspecified, 601; public administration, which includes national government and local government service, 588; the fertiliser and chemical industries, 541; paper making, stationery, printing and book binding, 474; mines and quarries, 295; woodworking and furniture, 275; finance, 264.  This includes pawnbroking, money lending, hospital sweeps, and so on.  I am at a loss to know how pawnbrokers are reducing their staffs at a time like this.  Bricks and artificial building materials, pottery and glass show 263 more than last year; gas, electricity and water, electricity undertakings, 260; vehicles, 244; entertainment and sports, 166; other industries, 154; drinks, cider and so on, 130; fishing 123.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right across the board there is a decline in the work force.  In the case of the building trade we are told it is the result of general slackness; in agriculture, seasonal slackness; in finance, short time working; in the clothing factories slackness, layoffs in some factories; in metal manufactures, short <Col N="185" /> time working; vehicles, short time working; food, slackness, layoffs in some factories and in the professions, transport and communications and woodworking, general slackness; in bricks, artificial materials, pottery and glass, skins and leathers, layoffs, short time working.</P>
    <P>We have this desperate situation and there is no plan to relieve it.  Some time ago we were told by the Minister for Finance that until they had sufficient information no plan would be forthcoming.  Apparently, they have not yet sufficient information notwithstanding that over a considerable period the position has been allowed to become worse and worse up to the present with the vast amount of unemployment we have on an increasing scale.  While some areas are showing signs of improvement the general trend is one that does not give much hope.  No plan has been forthcoming, despite a whisper from the Tánaiste recently that we should have a plan.  It is a pity that he does not make those noises at Government level. His whisper was probably a sound coming before the drum to indicate that a member of the Labour Party was producing a plan to save the nation. We have seen this plan in some detail recently.</P>
    <P>The big problem is to get people back to work, to ensure that school leavers, professional workers, those in public administration will get to work as quickly as possible.  We must have some productive employment to offer people.  Many suggestions have been made here about schemes that could be introduced by the Minister to provide employment.  Perhaps the Minister will produce a plan in Killarney or perhaps this is just another anti-Kerryman joke.  I hope we get some indication that there is a positive plan for the future to ensure employment for our people.  We have a bubble-bursting Tánaiste, a buck-passing Taoiseach and a runaway Minister but we want people here who will not talk about bursting bubbles or pass the buck but who can come here with something positive that can be examined in detail.  We want to know on what information such a plan is based, if it exists or has been formulated. <Col N="186" /> We want the Government to seek the advice and assistance of the Opposition in this regard.  Captains of industry are often invited to discuss matters with the Government but they have been so often in and out of Government offices that they are disillusioned like many Members of the House with the promises of the present Government.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify some points in the Finance Bill, on which I think he knows our views. Section 23 speaks of benefits in kind. We are told the section provides for the introduction of a minimum charge where an employee has available to him for his private use a car provided by his employer, and it is stated that it seems reasonable to hold that the availability of a car for private use is a benefit in kind.  Does this apply to local authority officials who have cars?  Does it apply to State and semi-State bodies whose members have cars from these bodies?  Does it apply to Ministers in respect of the cars they have?  Or does it only apply to workers who have cars for the purposes of their work?  Some of these are on 24-hour call.  Will the Minister tax such a man, whose car is a necessity at all times, in the same way as he proposes to tax people who can avail of a car for private purposes? Will the benefit of cars to Ministers be tax-free as against the workers who are taxed to the hilt?  How will this affect vans used in the same way as cars the Minister spoke about? Perhaps there will be a different type of vehicle in future.  Does this apply only to private cars provided for workers or does it apply to State and semi-State bodies and to local authority members who have cars for one reason or another and who are on 24-hour call?</P>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy Desmond have told us about the benefits people enjoy.  The Minister spoke of the typical family of three children who in return for paying taxation, enjoy various things.  These are certain rights they have: primary and secondary schooling for which he puts down £750 annually; medical services to parents and children, the protection of persons and property from wrongdoers, <Col N="187" /> £150; social welfare children's allowances, £120; benefit of State subsidisation of rates for domestic rate-payers, £45; subsidisation of foodstuffs and transport, £100; Exchequer contributions towards the cost of roads, £33 per private vehicle.  This is what they enjoy, according to the Minister, but education is by right and medical services are by right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting these should not be paid for by anybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but this is whitewashing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For every right there is a corresponding duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that and that with every duty goes a right but by the way in which this is framed one would think that many of these things are enjoyed by people just because the Minister says so.  This is not the case.  If we go into this in any sort of detail we find that it deals with tenants of local authority houses and income tax relief on housing loans.  These were all put there for one purpose or another.  For instance, they were put there to encourage people to buy their own homes and to have a stake in the community.  It is not as simple as the Minister has indicated&mdash;that the State is making a massive contribution to individuals. The State has a responsibility.  The whole theme of the Minister's speech is an indication that the essentials of life in relation to primary schooling would be reduced if taxes were not increased.  I hope the Minister will reach a stage where he will understand that these are basic rights and that no amount of camouflage will change that situation.  In connection with changing taxation from one sector to another, a subsidy on foodstuffs is fair enough, but we are told that there will be a reduction in certain essential services if the Minister cannot get certain taxations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that other Members will deal with the speech in greater depth.  Therefore, I do not propose to deal with the particular sections in <Col N="188" /> any way other than to ask the Minister if the figure of £34 per 100 has increased and how far it will affect benefits in kind, because Ministers have a variety of benefits in kind which other people have not got.  Are they going to be taxed?  We must restore confidence in the country and we must have a policy geared towards the eighties and the nineties.  There has been no indication yet that any effort has been made to formulate a policy for the eighties or nineties.  The Government are dealing with our present depression in a way that will create problems in the eighties and nineties.  We want a positive approach. We want to know where we are going and we want the necessary information to base policies on.  Much of that information can be obtained from statistical sources such as the census of population.  I hope the Minister will relent and make the necessary moneys available for a census. We are told that 85 per cent of a person's previous income can now be obtained in social welfare benefits. The collection of data of this type is surely a labour intensive job.  The Minister would be well advised to spend the extra 15 per cent to accummulate the information that is required. Talk is not enough in relation to the problems of the future.  The Government Information Service does not produce policies but it produces excuses on occasions.  We want a positive policy so that our young people will have a future.  At the moment parents are being followed on the ever increasing dole queues by their children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asked what was our solution to the problem.  Our solution is for the Government to resign.  When they do so we will produce the necessary policies to inspire confidence, ensure a future for young people and create employment.  We will create policies to ensure that we are not classified as political paupers on the Continent.  The time for talking has run out.  We have had a variety of excuses from time to time in relation to the manner in which the problems of young people will be tackled. Nevertheless, in relation to unemployment <Col N="189" /> we are told in <i>Industry and Society,</i> which is a weekly booklet from the EEC, that our unemployment rate as a percentage of the civilian labour force in 1975 was 8.4 as against the Community average of 4.1.  Our unemployment rate as a percentage of the labour force is the highest in the Community.  It is 4.5 in Denmark, 4.5 in Germany, 3.9 in France, 3.7 in Italy, 4.4 in the Netherlands, 4.8 in Belgium, .7 in Luxembourg and 3.6 in the United Kingdom. The forecast for 1976 as a percentage of the labour force is a Community average of 4.6, Ireland 10.1, Denmark 3.7, Germany 4.6, France 4.00, Italy 3.9, the Netherlands 5.2, Belgium 5.6, Luxembourg 0.7, United Kingdom 5.3. We are twice as bad as the worst, and that would be either the Netherlands or the United Kingdom.  Again, in 1975 we are twice as bad as the Community average.  This reflects the serious situation we are in.  Efforts have been made by other countries to correct the situation.  One would at least have thought that corrective action would have altered the situation but we have this increase from 8.4 per cent in 1975 to 10.1 per cent in 1976.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to the Commission in 1976&mdash; information which Deputies do not have&mdash;they forecast a substantial increase. While other countries' economies are on the upsurge ours is falling.  We must consider unemployment with consumer prices.  We should have another look at the Commission's forecast for the change in consumer prices in 1976 as against 1975.  While the Community average is 9.6 per cent, Ireland's is 16 per cent; the average for Germany is 5.5 per cent, Luxembourg 8.5 per cent, the Netherlands 10 per cent and Denmark 8 per cent.  This shows that the consumer price forecast of 16 per cent for Ireland is very serious.</P>
    <P>People receiving social welfare benefits got an increase of 10 per cent, but this means they will be worse off than they were.  It is desirable to ensure that social welfare benefits are paid to the weaker sections of the community.  The Minister for Finance, the Parliamentary Secretary to the <Col N="190" /> Minister for Social Welfare and the Government should examine their consciences in relation to people in receipt of social welfare benefits at this time and ensure that those in need of assistance will get at least an amount that will be sufficient to meet the increased consumer prices which result from inflation.  Unfortunately, these people have been dumped on this occasion.  They got half the amount they needed.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy B. Desmond, there are people abusing social welfare benefits.  On the other hand, there are people on social welfare who are not receiving enough.  We must try to strike a balance to ensure that people requiring assistance get it.  In our present abnormal situation to reduce the standards of the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan, the sick, the disabled or the unemployed is very serious.  Social welfare benefits must keep abreast with the rising cost of living.  Abuses must be done away with. We must ensure that the system is fair and equitable and that the people entitled to benefits will get them.</P>
    <P>We have heard some talk about the building trade.  In recent times a number of circulars and documents dealing with the finances that would be available for the future issued from the Department of Local Government. They dealt with the vast cutbacks which will be followed by substantial rates and rent increases that will result from recent Government action.  This comes on top of the unemployment situation, the reduction in social welfare benefits and the fact that there is no future for school leavers.  The substantial increases in rents and rates will reduce further the purchasing power of our workers.  I forecast a very dismal future for the few people who will have the capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>We are told that the building trade is booming in the country.  There is no evidence of this in Dublin.  I want to correct an erroneous impression created by the Minister for Local Government on the situation in Dublin city.  There are 24,699 unemployed.  In 1975 in Dublin, the year of the records we are told by the Minister for Local Government, money was pumped into housing <Col N="191" /> and a record number of houses had been built&mdash;1,529 houses.  In 1967-68, Dublin Corporation built 1,964 houses, 435 more than were built in the record year.</P>

It is not unreasonable to point out how the Minister has been misled by his colleague.  As I said, in 1967-68 under Fianna Fáil 435 more houses were built than in the record year mentioned by the Minister.  In 1968-69 Fianna Fáil built 1,996 houses, 467 more than last year.</P>

      <P>The Government get their finances by way of taxation. Deputy B. Desmond has indicated that another budget will be introduced. To stimulate the economy and the building trade, perhaps the Minister will ensure that the 24,000 people now on the breadline are put back to work as quickly as possible.  An effort should be made to ensure that work is made available for those who are willing and capable of working. Assistance is needed in the building and construction industry, yet we are told that there will be substantial cutbacks.  I was at a housing meeting of Dublin Corporation and alarm was expressed at the documents which issued from the Department of Local Government recently.</P>

      <P>The only reason I raised this point was that I feel the Minister for Local Government has misled the Minister for Finance in the same way he misled the country. I am just producing the facts to show that the statements made here in the House and outside it by the Minister for Local Government about the number of houses produced are erroneous, and I want the Minister for Finance to be aware of the facts. I know his concern for the people of this city.  He was a member of the Dublin Corporation and he knows the problems.</P>

      <P>We were told that local authority building in Dublin was the area where the major portion of money would go in the future. This is what the Minister for Local Government stated when he opened a housing estate outside Dublin recently.  I hope there will be no impeding of this desire of the Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who now finds his mistake.  The building industry provides substantial employment, and these 24,000 people can be put back to work at an early stage if moneys are made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to formulating a policy on housing and providing employment, because the taxpayer has to foot substantial bills in Dublin as a result of ministerial interference. Because of ministerial interference, the taxpayer has to find the rent arrears of Dublin Corporation, which amount to £1,500,000 at the moment. Had the Dublin Corporation members been allowed to solve this problem without the interference of a <Col N="193" /> Minister, the Government would not have to foot this bill.  There is also £8 million worth of property tied up in Dublin as a result of Government inactivity in relation to squatting.  A great deal of money is also spent on security every year.  This money has to come from some source, namely, taxation.</P>
    <P>I have read with interest the expressions of disapproval by local authority members throughout the country of the recent circular indicating that repairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before I leave that I want to point out that if houses are not repaired there must be a greater housing problem in the future because more money will be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget and the Finance Bill seriously affect the housewife.  The Minister's hand is in the housewife's pocket all the time.  Every housewife knows the name Deputy Richie Ryan, the Minister for Finance, only too well.  He is not very popular with them and he will realise that when they get their hands on him during the next campaign.  There have been substantial increases in many items as a result of VAT.  There has been a rise in the cost of education.  Education is no longer free, as indicated by the Minister in the earlier part of his Second Reading speech.  Parents are asked to make contributions in all schools now.  There is also the increases in fares, thus raising the cost of transporting children to and from school, of travelling to hospitals, shops and so forth.  There is the increase in television licences, central heating, ESB and Post Office charges. The prices of books and newspapers have increased.  One would have thought that at least medical appliances for people who are disabled would have been excluded from VAT increases, but even the disabled are attacked in this Finance Bill.  The Minister at some later stage might think of releasing medical appliances from VAT.  Medical expenses are <Col N="194" /> steep enough at the moment without people having to meet a further imposition by the Minister through value-added tax.</P>
    <P>One would think that furniture, cleaning materials, haberdashery, electrical appliances, kitchen equipment and so on were not essential in the household.  No one has an objection to the taxing of commodities which are not essential, but it is a fairly serious situation when essential commodities are heavily taxed.  Many tears have been shed in this House about the working man's pint.  Now we are told that the drop in consumption will mean a reduction of 10 to 15 per cent and that the breweries will have to allow people to go as a result of the last budget.  Social welfare benefits were up by only 10 per cent; the pint is up by 20 per cent. This means that the working man and the old age pensioner will be in a fairly bad way in the near future.</P>
    <P>The direction of finance into productive employment-giving activities is all-important and is a matter that cannot be stressed too much.  Apparently the thought of giving people employment is a forgotten one by the Government.  We hope that the Minister's speech that we are promised will produce something substantial because the publicity given indicated that he had something fairly substantial to say in Killarney.  We hope it will be a plan for the future, something that will give hope to young men and women, school leavers and those on the bread-line.  This major statement that we are going to hear we look forward to with great anxiety.  I hope that the Minister does not meet the same problem that he met in Slattery's when there was nobody to meet him.  It would be a pity to make the journey with petrol so dear and have nobody to listen. For that reason I hope the Minister will give us some indication before he goes of the content of his speech, whether it will have some hope for the future or if it will be the usual cover-up.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have lost their identity with the Irish worker now that they are completely submerged <Col N="195" /> in Fine Gael.  As a party, they have no further use.  We have a one-party Government dominated by Fine Gael, pressurised by the various groups within Fine Gael.  The Taoiseach does what he is told by the pressure being applied.  If he did not, he would not be a man at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The Deputy should stay relevant to the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to some of the provisions of the Finance Bill it would seem that pressures were used by a variety of groups to pressurise the Government in a particular direction.  I have a document here that was sent out in an Oireachtas envelope.  It is called &ldquo;The Irish Marxist Society.  Public lecture, Capitalism and Unemployment&rdquo; and I quote from it:</P>
      <P>Dear Comrade:</P>
      <P>Annual Conference in Dún Laoghaire (October, '75) passed Composite Resolution No. 10, calling on the Labour Parliamentary Party to introduce a Bill in Dáil Éireann before May, 1976 to bring natural resources into public ownership and control so that the development could be a basis of industrial job creation in Ireland instead of creating wealth for the Multi-Nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document goes on to tell about Labour Party branch meetings.  It is signed by a variety of Labour Party officials.  We wonder if Sam Nolan would come up with any solution for the Government in regard to this lecture to enlighten Labour Party members.  Now that the Labour Party is tied up with the Marxist Society and again embodied in Fine Gael one does not know where to turn to get a comment that would convey something that was not complicated by a variety of Fine Gael, Marxism and the past Labour Party policy.  If the situation we are in now is a result of the combination of the Just Society and the Labour Party policy we heard so much about in the 1960s, then we can say both that the Just Society <Col N="196" /> document was a failure and the Labour Party policy at that period was a failure also.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that moneys are made available to stimulate the construction industry to put the people back to work, so that we can have a real look at the developing situation as a result of ministerial statements that come from time to time in relation to this aspect.  It is one on which there is utter confusion, one in which local authorities are unable to decipher statements on account of complicated messages coming from the Custom House.  I hope that at least in Killarney we will get some indication of hope and of a positive effort being made to plan for the future, and that the school-leavers, the unemployed and the housewives can look forward.  No doubt it may be an election gimmick on the Minister's part, maybe a build-up for Donegal and Dublin South-West, but I hope we will be able to sort the Minister and the Government out as we proceed on these election campaigns.  Nevertheless the Minister has this opportunity between now and polling day to make some reference and give some hope. These elections may stimulate the Minister into some endeavour to produce some policy that would give a hope to the repressed section of the people.</P>
    <P>Again I condemn the Government for their failure to honour their commitment to the people on social welfare benefits, that is the repressed section who this year are getting only 10 per cent instead of the amount required to meet the upward spiral that is continuing in both the cost of living and the cost of dying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the highest regard for the intelligence of the Irish people.  I am sorry Deputy Dowling is running out.  I am sure he will recall that the West Mayo by-election was a tragic disappointment for his party when they lost a seat.  It should be recalled that that by-election was held in the middle of the present international recession.  He raised the question of the coming by-elections.  They are going to be interesting and they are going to be a test.  The outcome, <Col N="197" /> to my mind, would be that the Government will gain at least one extra seat to what they now hold.</P>
      <P>In passing I would like to add my personal regrets and condolences to the relatives of both Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Lemass, both of whom, as Members of the House, were indeed gentlemen.</P>
      <P>The last two years have been most difficult for this country.  We are sharing with many countries other than those of Europe the international recession which was triggered off by the energy crisis.  We are in the middle of negotiations for a partial pay pause and a new national wage agreement.  I hope that the outcome of those will be such that the Minister for Finance and the Government will be satisfied with it.</P>
      <P>I am, I suppose, by profession an economist in so far as I hold a Master's Degree in Economics.  I am not particularly enamoured of the economics I have seen in relation to the budget deficits over the past few years.  I realise the necessity for them to a certain extent, but I doubt in the long run if they can be continued. I was pleased to hear the Minister saying that he intends to restore the budget balance over the next three years.  It is important because the part a budget plays in the development of an economy can be overrated. Indeed, perhaps a budget imbalance may be more of an incentive to development than an expansionary or deflationary budget especially in times of inflation.  The atmosphere within a country is far more important from the point of view of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the country will prosper when we can&mdash;it is vital that we do so&mdash;restore the inflation rate to a level at least comparable to the lower rates existing in European countries and the countries to which we export our goods.  The inflation question should head the list of priorities. Also of importance is the question of good industrial relations.  Good industrial relations are vital to the future expansion of our country and to the attraction of capital from <Col N="198" /> within the country and from outside. On occasions I put forward the suggestion that we should introduce a cooling-off period such as exists in America in relation to strikes.  That system is one to be commended.  I mediated in two strikes in my city recently and I found that a cooling-off period and a time for negotiation would resolve many strikes.</P>
    <P>The question of incentives is also important for our future development. The IDA, the ICC and, in these difficult times, Fóir Teoranta, have played a vital role in maintaining employment and in encouraging expansion of our industrial base.  I do not think that the work of those bodies is appreciated enough by the public.  I am not tremendously impressed by all the prognostications that are published by the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the various banking reports.  I do not know if they do any good.  Invariably they are pessimistic; they want more money spent here and less money spent there.  I believe too many reports are issued and too much advice circulated.  Too much is written by people who are not that well qualified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And one thing they never do is admit they were wrong the previous year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They vary every year to suit their own purpose.  The lack of statements from people qualified to speak on such matters&mdash; such people exist in our universities &mdash;surprises me.  We get plenty of unqualified recommendations and advice which changes as much as the weather.  They do not do any good although the comments may be used here to throw at each other now and again.  The Minister has pointed out that taxation is necessary in order that benefits can be given and I believe our people understand the position. I do not think the budget was a popular one because there was increased taxation on such items as beer, motor tax and expenses for the use of company cars.  I was disappointed that VAT was put on hired <Col N="199" /> cars.  The decision to impose VAT on hired cars should have been deferred until after the tourist season.  When I was in America recently Americans told me they could not understand why they had to pay VAT on cars they would have to rent when visiting here.  In my view there was a case for withholding the imposition of VAT on hired cars.</P>
      <P>The Minister has dealt with the question of taxing farmers.  Frankly, I was not very happy with the decision to introduce taxation on farmers with £100 valuation or more. Those who were taxed are annoyed and those with a valuation of £50 and over fear that they will be taxed in the future.  In my view the farming organisations realise, and accept, the necessity and correctness of their paying an equitable share of the tax burden.  An equitable solution could be found by the farming organisations meeting the Minister to hammer out a proper system which could be based on income rather than on valuation.  I also agree that in changing this system consideration should be given to abolishing rates on agricultural land as exists in England.  The present taxation system has not gone down well with the farming community from the point of view of equity.  I have great respect for the farming community who have worked hard and have come through hard times. They experienced lean times in the thirties and forties and they had their ups and downs in the fifties.  In the sixties they had good years and have had very good years in the seventies. The value of their land holdings has increased tremendously in the past decade.  They realise that.  They are quite conscious of the part that they can and should play in our community and they are willing to play it on a equitable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposed taxation of agriculture and fisheries co-operatives under section 32 of the Bill, I am pleased to note that the Minister is fully aware of the problems and is studying the matter.  I believe he intends to introduce amendments on <Col N="200" /> Committee Stage.  I live in a constituency with two major processing co-operatives, the Clover Meats group and the Waterford Co-operative Society in Dungarvan, both of which have done great work down the years.  When a Minister introduces a tax net to a new sector he is obliged to do everything in his power to ease the burden in a transitional period.  The Waterford Co-operative have made substantial investments on the assumption that their cash flow would not be subject to taxation. Now they find that it will be subject to taxation on profits arising after 6th April, 1976.  This upsets the decisions that have already been made and implemented.  They and other co-operatives should get the benefit of the doubt and get certain alleviation in respect of investments already made. When the tax is introduced it should be introduced as if for a new company. Therefore the co-operatives would be entitled to tax relief up to 1990, which is the last year allowed.  They should also be allowed free depreciation, which already applies to private companies, on their equipment, even equipment purchased before this budget. This would benefit the societies.</P>
    <P>The greatest benefit that could be bestowed on co-operatives, and indeed on private companies, is the proposed exemption from taxation on reinvested profits or services.  In the present recession there is a valid case for giving some incentive for reinvestment of profits.  The simplest way to do this is to relieve reinvested money, to some extent at least, from taxation.  It would help employment, and it would encourage firms to go ahead with expansion plans which may be in the balance because of tax proposals or existing tax.  Taxation on co-operatives should be phased in.  I would suggest a three-year phasing in of the taxation on co-operatives.</P>
    <P>The question of fisheries co-operatives has already been raised by Bishop Casey.  There is a valid case here for allowing in underdeveloped areas where fishery co-operatives exist about £20,000 of a profit before the tax net would become effective.  It would be an exception but it would be an incentive <Col N="201" /> in underdeveloped areas.  Small co-operatives in underdeveloped areas, where small communities come together and try to do something for themselves, deserve our support.  The Minister might consider allowing a certain profit before tax is imposed.  I must admit that certain parts of co-operatives are in direct competition with private enterprise.  It is unfair that a shopkeeper with five children is taxed whereas a co-operative nearby is not taxed and therefore would have a price advantage.  However, the Minister should give sympathetic understanding in a transitional period to co-operatives.</P>
    <P>There has been controversy recently about the establishment of State development corporations, planning, and the taking over and nationalisation of banks.  I do not agree with it.  The British experience will prove of no benefit to the British economy.  The institutions established&mdash;the Industrial Development Authority, the Industrial Credit Company, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta and the other semi-State bodies are sufficient to handle the development of the Irish economy at every level, assuming that they are given the necessary finance from central funds.  We do not need a proliferation of new State bodies.  We have enough, some might say we have too many of them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has made his views known that parishes and local communities should be more active and should be more aware of their own existence. That is a valid point but I suggest that the IDA are a flexible authority, that they are a very well manned authority and I have the highest regard for them. I am not aware of any disinterest on the part of the staff in relation to any matter of the establishment of smaller businesses.  Perhaps the IDA and community councils can come together and adopt an approach such as that suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The Chair might allow me to digress slightly here and say a few words about the way in which we deal with business in the House.  I am impressed by the European Parliamentary committee system of discussing various departments. The position here is that we <Col N="202" /> discuss each Department in the House on the occasion of the relevant Estimate but it is my opinion that the time of the House would be utilised better in dealing with more vital business.  That is why I advocate a committee system for discussing individual Departments.  The committees would have the same standing as this House.  This would allow the Dáil to deal strictly with legislation.  However, the matter may be more relevant to be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic in so far as the future of the country is concerned.  As a member of the Council of Europe I travel abroad regularly and I have detected the return of an air of optimism regarding the future of European economies.  The American economy has improved faster than expected and there has been an increase in activity in Germany and France, for instance. Despite the position of the £ the British economy seems to be settling down.  At least, it can be expected to improve substantially within the next year.  It is reasonable to look forward to an upturn in our economy during this summer and early autumn.</P>
    <P>Our principal objective must be the controlling of inflation but our success in this sphere will depend on the national wage agreement, on the pay pause and on whatever action the Government may consider necessary from time to time although I trust that no harsh action will have to be taken.  We must return to a rate of inflation that does not outprice our products on the export market.  This is essential to our development and must be a key factor in Government policy in the coming months.</P>

      <P>In the period that has elapsed since budget day the people have had an opportunity of experiencing what the budget's provisions mean for them.  Many comments and suggestions are made at the time of a budget's introduction and many theories are put forward as to which groups or individuals will be affected adversely or otherwise.  In the case of this budget nobody has benefited but everybody has been affected. It has disastrous effects for many.  But <Col N="203" /> the budget was only consistent with the successive budgetary policies, with the lack of overall planning that this Government have displayed during the past three years.</P>
      <P>It has been said during this debate that the Finance Bill we are discussing is a direct result of the mismanagement of an economy during, admittedly, a period of recession. Deputy Collins is a sensible Deputy, but it was obvious that as a backbencher he was embarrassed and ashamed of the Minister's performance. Of course he would have liked to have been able to hand out credits but there were none.  From moving through his constituency the Deputy realises the dreadful impact that the budgetary provisions have had on so many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might ask who are those that these measures affect most severely; who will stand to lose most and with what areas should we be concerned mainly.  We have had a surfeit of problems created by this Government. Let us take first the unemployment situation.  On the admission yesterday of the Parliamentary Secretary the unemployment figure from June this year will be at least 180,000.  Naturally, as a member of the Government and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly's figure would be conservative.  It is my opinion that if we add to the live register the school leavers of last year and this year the figure will be nearer the 200,000 mark or almost 20 per cent of the total work force.  This is a very serious situation but the most serious aspect of it is the number of young people who are frustrated, disappointed and have no opportunities open to them.  Instead of assisting them, encouraging them and giving them a ray of hope for the future, this Bill further harms their prospects. This is also a very grave social problem.  Our young people have been educated within our system.  We may complain about the educational system.  We may suggest that possibly some of them should have been directed into other channels.  That is not important.  They have been <Col N="204" /> educated and there are no opportunities open to them.</P>
    <P>Their parents are appalled.  What are we creating?  The Government seem to be closing their eyes to the situation.  We were told yesterday by the Parliamentary Secretary that we always had school leavers.  Certainly we had.  Because an opportunity was given to people to avail of further education we have more young people educated today.  In the past the vast majority of our school leavers had employment opportunities.  Now the reverse is the case.  A boy or a girl at school today is looking dismally to the future and is becoming disillusioned with the structure of our society.  This will create serious social unrest for us.  The Minister has not taken steps in this Bill to solve that problem.  Instead, he has created further problems for them and greater disillusionment.  The result is that young people are taking a greater interest in drink.  The Minister tried to excuse the increase in the price of drink by saying people were drinking too much.  This may well be so.  If it is, I would prefer to see steps taken to prevent that situation other than providing a negative remedy.</P>
    <P>We have many serious employment problems.  Many jobs have been lost which could have been saved.  The Government are relying on the payment of unemployment and social welfare benefits.  I do not want to be misrepresented.  I have often spelled out the fact that I realise the need for a social welfare structure to assist those who are underprivileged in our society because of age, infirmity, or genuine loss of jobs.  The Government have allowed industry to run down.  They have created problems for industry particularly in measures such as this.  The only solution they offer is unemployment assistance. This is necessary in the case of genuine job losses but it should not be the only solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins spoke this morning about upturns.  There is no point in talking about upturns in America, or in Europe, or in England, unless we have the courage and the determination to tackle our own problems. <Col N="205" /> Nearly 20 per cent of our labour force is unemployed.  This places a greater burden on a diminishing work force, the burden of supporting a growing group of unemployed.  This cannot continue indefinitely.  Something has to collapse.  The Parliamentary Secretary was so bereft of ideas yesterday on the Finance Bill that he used ludicrous arguments and attacked this party.  He referred to us as the legion of the rearguard because we referred to what the British Chancellor did in his recent budget.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be a member of a party with such a proud record of achievements in Government.  I have not buried my head in the sand and said Fianna Fáil achieved everything. They did not.  They achieved a great deal.  They were constructive and progressive.  They had courage.  They showed leadership.  Deputies have probably read a very interesting article on this party by a well known man of high repute, a political commentator who served this House long and well.  In <i>The Word</i> magazine he referred to our achievements, leadership and loyalty.  This is very important at a time of economic stress.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying the American economy or any economy is on the upswing unless we inspire confidence in our people to grapple with the situation.  Money is lying in the banks.  People will not take it because they have not got the confidence to invest it.  Young people are playing pool and drinking and perhaps taking drugs because they have no other outlet. I charge the Minister and the Government with neglecting those young people and with turning a blind eye to the situation.  I admire the Parliamentary Secretary's integrity but I am surprised that he said such things yesterday evening because three or four members of this party quoted the performance of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As a people we must look within ourselves for a solution to our problems. We must try to learn how to solve them within our own resources but we must also study outside factors.  Thank God for our independence.  Thanks are due to the many people who struggled <Col N="206" /> for it down through the centuries.  We are not serfs.  There is no serfdom in looking at what a neighbouring chancellor does with an economy which is having its difficulties too.  Before the budget the Taoiseach and the Minister appealed to the workers, the trade unions and the employers to accept a pay pause.  I believe a modest increase was possible and would have been accepted if the Government had taken the necessary steps in the budget to create a climate for such a development. They failed to do this and it will not be forgotten to them.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to say why we should not compare like with like.  We have many economic relations with our neighbour who is having troubles somewhat similar to our own.  The British Chancellor tried to slow down the rate of inflation to encourage the acceptance of modest pay increases.  Our Minister is creating further inflation but at the same time saying: &ldquo;We want a pay pause but this is the kind of budget we will give you.&rdquo;  It was not on from that day onwards.</P>

      <P>As the interests of Northern Ireland are represented in the European Communities by the British Government, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to make representations to the institutions of the European Communities for special assistance confined to that area.

      <P>I take it the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that within the terms of the Community itself it has been concerned to eliminate regional imbalances and that this cannot be done where there is civil or political unrest of the nature we have in the North of Ireland.  In view of that would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that, even acting within its own principles, the Community should have a concern for the social disorders in the North of Ireland and that our Government, either informally or otherwise&mdash;in a spirit of co-operation&mdash;could call on the Community to actively assist in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree that the Community ought to have a concern but that concern ought to be called forth in concrete terms, in the first instance, by the Government which enjoys sovereignty over that area and that, unfortunately, is not us. To do otherwise would be to invite a rebuttal from the Community in the first place, a complaint from the other Government concerned in the second and would probably cause a great deal of resentment among the population of the area, with which we are all concerned, in the third place.  As I said yesterday in connection with a similar question, although the burden <Col N="208" /> of the Deputy's concern is shared by the Government the legality and propriety of doing what the Deputy appears to want the Government to do is not evident.</P>

Does the Parliamentary Secretary not recognise that we are dealing with a position where a part of the North of Ireland is in fact in a sense under represented in the Community and, in view of that, is there not a special obligation on both Governments to speak on every possible occasion, to promote their interests on every possible occasion, and is the Parliamentary Secretary telling me that is beyond the function of our Government?</P>

I gave details of two such projects yesterday in reply to the Deputy and I explained why it took so long to bring the projects into being. We could not get the British Government to agree about the size of one project in which we would have been interested.  It was a fairly big one and not something minuscule.  We have got agreement now on two fairly big cross-Border studies and, I hope, in the end <Col N="210" /> more concrete projects, and we are glad to have got that and in that context scope exists for joint activity, joint representations and joint proposals to the Community but that is the only context.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the European Council meeting in Rome on 1st and 2nd December, 1975, agreed that direct elections to the Parliament should take place on a single date in May or June, 1978, with the proviso that any country which at that date is unable to hold direct elections should be allowed to appoint its representatives from amongst the elected members of its national Parliament.  As a party to that agreement Ireland is fully committed to the holding of direct elections to the European Parliament in 1978.  Only Britain and Denmark have intimated that they might not be able to accept that date: Britain because it requires a further period for internal consultations before adopting a final position regarding the date fixed and Denmark because, for an initial period at least, it wishes to hold European elections on the same date as national elections.  I should add that even if Britain and Denmark are unable to hold direct elections on an agreed date in 1978 this would not in any way prevent the other member states from holding elections on that date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Irish Government's proposals to the resumed Law of the Sea Conference, particularly on territorial waters, an economic zone and Continental Shelf rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The fourth session of the Law of the Sea Conference commenced in New York on the 15th March last and will continue till the 8th May.  The work of the conference is divided among three main committees and the basis for discussion will be single negotiating texts prepared by the chairman of these committees and circulated after the third session of the conference.  These texts have been examined by Government Departments, and inter-departmental working group meetings have been held to consider these texts and to formulate policy for the delegation attending the fourth session of the conference.  Co-ordination meetings with our European Communities partners have also taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the territorial sea our present limit is three miles.  At the <Col N="213" /> conference there is wide support for provisions permitting extension of territorial seas to a limit of 12 miles. The chairman's negotiating text provides for such extension and its provision on the matter is broadly acceptable.</P>
    <P>The delegation will support provisions for territorial sea limits out to 12 miles and for a reasonable elaboration of the right of innocent passage.</P>
    <P>It appears likely that a 200 mile economic zone in which the coastal state would have jurisdiction will be agreed at the conference and the single negotiating text as drafted reflects in a large measure the interests of coastal states.</P>
    <P>The delegation will support any proposal for the establishment of a zone extending for 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured in which the coastal state will exercise jurisdiction over the whole area in so far as <i>inter alia</i> regulation of fisheries is concerned in accordance with principles and criteria laid down by appropriate fishery organisations and at the same time support measures directed towards confining the exploitation of anadromous species of fish&mdash;for example, salmon&mdash;to states of origin of those species.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Continental Shelf the single negotiating text includes a definition of the Continental Shelf which gives coastal state jurisdiction to the outer limit of the continental margin and broadly meets our needs. The delegation will support a policy of jurisdiction over the whole continental margin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that comprehensive reply, may I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the Government have still firmly set their face against any unilateral action on our part to protect our rights on the Continental Shelf by way of extension of our fishery rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>These are two separate things.  The Deputy knows the Government announced a certain intention with regard to the Continental <Col N="214" /> Shelf early in March.  In regard to the fishery limit, I propose to answer that specifically in the next question. Briefly, the situation is the Government are against any unilateral step in regard to fisheries and would doubt, as I said before, the usefulness of such a step because it would not affect those fishing nationalities which do the most damage to our fishing stocks and are in the greatest competition with our fishing fleets because they are already doubly protected under the London Fisheries Convention and, above all, because of EEC membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will acknowledge that other countries of greater economic strength than us have taken unilateral action and, in the light of that, will he not agree that we should at least consider our position in that direction and thereafter negotiate within our membership of the Community as to what our rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> our fellow members in the Community would be to that extended area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government would reserve their position entirely and would not rule out acting unilaterally in this matter as they have in other matters.  All I am pointing out is that we are not in the same position as the United States.  It is not a member of the EEC and does not have to share its territorial waters with powerful neighbours with highly developed industries which take the greater part of the catch available off its coast and if the United States extends its limits to 200 miles and is able to police them it is giving itself that much more exclusive water which its own fishing industry can exploit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not in that situation, as I have tried to explain several times in the House and outside, and if we were to extend our territorial waters unilaterally right up to the Statue of Liberty it still would not suffice or have the slightest effect on keeping out the Dutch and the French, who are the main exploiters of our waters, that at any rate one hears complaints about, or the British or any of the other EEC partners.  I would be glad <Col N="215" /> of the Deputy's co-operation on this. The public ought to understand that no unilateral act on our part, unless we leave the EEC, will have the slightest effect on the Dutch, the French and those other nationalities unless and until, by negotiation within the Community, we can achieve a more satisfactory regime than we have at the moment.  That is what we are attempting to do at the moment.</P>

      <P>If you bear with me for a moment you may decide whether or not my supplementary is relevant and brief.  Have the Government changed their views since the occasion on which they extended unilaterally their claim to the Continental Shelf and the Rockall Bank? The Government said then that they would not favour similar unilateral action.  Have they been consistent in their approach to unilateral action on fisheries, because the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply now seems to indicate that they have changed their view?  The only reason, I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary, that we would not make a unilateral claim on our fishing limits is that we could not police the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to your ruling, I would like an opportunity of replying very briefly to that supplementary question.  The Government's position about unilateral action here or anything else is that we are a sovereign state and within international law must at all times reserve our position in regard to what we are going to do.  The reason the Government leaned against unilateral action, and still do, in connection with fishing limits is because to make a unilateral claim in regard to fishing limits, firstly, would not have any serious effect of a beneficial sort on our fishing industry for the reasons I have just explained, because it would not leave out the fishermen who mostly exploit us.  It would not derrogate from our obligations under the EEC. So far as the EEC are concerned and the EEC fishermen, we could designate not 200 miles but 2,000 miles westwards and they could ignore it. The only way we can get out of the EEC obligation is by leaving the EEC. and if the Deputy wants to advocate that let him do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that the second reason the Government would lean against the futility of unilateral action, apart from the absolute futility of doing so having regard to EEC obligations, is that there seems a secondary futility in doing so when the Law of the Sea Conference is accepted to be certain to generalise a 200 mile limit for all countries.  So why jump a gun which will fire anyway?  That is the second reason.  Both reasons to me seem to be jointly and fairly compelling reasons. I quite agree with the Deputy, whether or not we have a 200 mile limit&mdash;let us suppose we have one&mdash;we will still have to achieve a regime, so far as we can, satisfactory to Irish fishermen <i>vis-á-vis</i> our EEC partners.  I freely admit that the present situation is most unsatisfactory and I have said that before also.  We are doing our best inside the EEC&mdash;I may be able to tell the House something more about it in a few weeks&mdash;to achieve a more satisfactory situation than the one recently proposed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the recent statement made by the United States Government that that country intends to extend its sea limits unilaterally to 200 miles unless agreement is reached at the Law of the Sea Conference, he will now make a <Col N="218" /> similar declaration of intent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>You will be aware from my reply of the 5th February last that the Government regard unilateral action to extend fisheries as undesirable. This is because of the desirability of achieving a zone by general agreement and because of the reality of our existing obligations both as a European Community member and under the London Fisheries Convention. I understand that the US legislation will come into effect in March, 1977, and that at least one further session of the Law of the Sea Conference is likely to take place before that date by which time a revised single negotiating text is likely to be achieved at the conference.  In such circumstances and regardless of the other considerations, which of course still apply, there would not appear to be good reason for making a declaration as suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs recently met a delegation of fishermen.  Afterwards they said they were highly satisfied with the assurances he gave them.  Was not one of those assurances that he would press, unilaterally or otherwise, for the limit of 200 miles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not give any such assurance and no such assurance was demanded of him.  I was present at the meeting the Deputy refers to. The delegation to which the Deputy refers wanted a 50-mile exclusive zone.  While the Minister did not and could not permit the Government to attach their flag firmly to a particular mileage, which might be impossible of achievement, the Minister naturally will press for a very substantially improved exclusive fishery limit inside the EEC.  That is the only one which will be any use to us.  The only extension of fishing limits which can be any use to us is one which will roll back from our waters EEC fishing boats, which in any case very shortly will be entitled to fish right up to the mail boat pier in Dún Laoghaire, because the existing exclusive limits <Col N="219" /> for member states only lasts for a limited period and when that period is up there will be no exclusive limit at all unless we can negotiate one. That is what is going on.  The Deputy's inquiry about the fishermen's delegation is quite correct.  The delegation came to express their point of view very eloquently and very effectively but they did not look for an exclusive 200-mile limit.  That was never even mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary bear in mind that there are others beside the EEC fishermen involved, particularly on the west and the north-west coast, particularly the Russians?  All of the argument the Parliamentary Secretary has used here is ignoring, basically, that there is any other interest concerned.  Might I also put the other point to the Parliamentary Secretary that in Deputy O'Kennedy's supplementary to a previous question he advocated&mdash;I strongly support the idea&mdash;that we should go for a much wider limit and within that so far as the EEC countries are concerned it is then, and only then, that we will be in a position to talk about how to exclude them from those limits by special arrangement. The Russians are off our coasts and are taking massive quantities of fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is a Russian presence of a fishing kind around our coasts.  The Deputy has put his finger on the only country, although I think there may be other Eastern countries, such as the Bulgarians the odd time, but principally the Russians, who occasionally show up off our coasts.  They are the only people who could be affected even on paper by the extension of our limit to 200 miles.  When you have affected them on paper you then have to get around to the question of how to control this area, which is approximately 25 times the size of the area which we are at the pin of our collar at present trying to control effectively, as the Deputy well knows.</P>

Does he not recognise that the Government have a great opportunity of calling on the Community, within the terms of our membership, to assist us in the first instance in effectively policing the area, with them if necessary, and of course also in developing our fishing industry and fishing fleet? Does he not recognise that the Government have such a responsibility so that we can compete effectively with the Russians and others who may make things very difficult for our fishing fleet?</P>

      <P>No.  There is an ambiguity in the question in the sense that a radio-telephone system between a car and a home is perfectly feasible under existing arrangements and that is what has been considered and, in some cases, developed in relation to the ministerial cars and so on, but in no case has there been permission for connection of a car telephone to the general telephone system.

      <P>As I have informed the Deputy, our policy is not to allow direct connection to the public telephone network of privately owned radio-telephone or paging systems.  This is also the policy adopted by other administrations, a number of whom have provided their own system.  A radio-telephone system for cars, and so on, with access to the public network requires high quality radio transmitting and receiving equipment at base stations suitably located to ensure satisfactory communication. The range of each base station depends on transmitter power, topography and other factors and even in favourable circumstances might not exceed a radius of about 15 miles, so that to get wider coverage would require a large number of stations.  This would be quite expensive and I have no evidence that there is sufficient demand for such a service to justify that kind of expenditure.</P>

      <P>I am aware of, and I very much regret, the hardship and inconvenience caused to the public in the Dún Laoghaire area by the interruption of postal services there on two days last week and one day this week.  Normal services were resumed on Tuesday, the 27th.</P>
      <P>The background to the interruption of services is that postmen in Dún Laoghaire took unofficial industrial action by refusing to deliver telephone directories.  Such deliveries are made on completion of normal duty and are paid for at overtime rates.  Representatives of the postmen in Dún Laoghaire said that they were unwilling to make the number of deliveries per hour which the Department proposed and which was the same as the number per hour being delivered in the Dublin Postal District.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were told that the delivery rates would be tested by the Department during the course of work, the results discussed with the local union branch, and any changes found to be necessary would be made.  As the postmen persisted in their refusal to deliver the directories, a number of them were suspended from duty on the 22nd April.  Other members of the staff then stopped work.  The suspensions were lifted on an undertaking that the delivery of the directories <Col N="228" /> would be made.  The tests already referred to will be carried out.</P>

Would the Minister tell the House how this dispute arose and how the dispute came to be resolved?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have consulted Bord Fáilte about the reported statement referred to by the Deputy.  On the question of spending on goods the board have pointed out that very substantial revenue arises from visitor purchases &mdash;which include purely souvenir items &mdash;the estimated revenue in 1975 being in excess of £32 million.  For some time now, Bord Fáilte have concentrated their efforts on securing the availability of a wider range of better quality goods and there is considerable evidence to suggest that progress has been made in this area and that visitor satisfaction has improved greatly. During the period immediately ahead, the board's efforts will include the provision of advisory services to producers and retailers as well as a programme of consumer and market research to establish more closely what the visitor wants.</P>
      <P>On the question of entertainment, it is true that Ireland does not offer expensive, sophisticated night club entertainment, casinos, and so on, which are to be found in most of the European cities.  It is not a feature of Irish life, and from surveys made of visitor reactions, Bord Fáilte have found that it is not something that they expect to find here.  Lack of sufficient evening entertainment of a high quality, particularly in resorts with a high visitor population in summer months and a sparse local community during the remainder of the year, has been a problem. A number of schemes aimed specifically at overcoming this lack have been encouraged and assisted by Bord Fáilte in recent years and the recently published tourism development plan allows for accelerated growth in this area.  None of the entertainment schemes encouraged by Bord Fáilte is expensive and all are designed to facilitate family groups as well as individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that the complaint that <Col N="231" /> tourists are returning home with money in their pockets is a refreshing change from the complaints sometimes made that Ireland is being priced out of the tourism market.</P>

In view of the fact that in many instances the lump sum being asked for is from £1,000 or £1,500 to £2,000, does he not see any hope of assistance for people in rural Ireland building new houses?</P>

      <P>This legislation is to cater for people who were in these houses before rural electrification came and had no choice as to where they should put their houses.  Anybody building a new house should take this into consideration because there is an element of choice in the selection of a site for a new house.  People already in houses have not got a choice.  People building new houses should consult the ESB as to the cost of connecting electricity.  Normally these people contact the county council and other people about the cost of connecting running water and so on. During the last two years county councils have been advising people that they should also take into account the cost of connecting electricity.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together. The factory in question has been in Receivership, along with the United Kingdom group to which it belongs, since 18th March, 1976.  It is continuing to operate and I understand <Col N="235" /> that the Receiver is endeavouring to sell it as a going concern.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the adverse effects which a permanent closedown of this factory would have for the area.  The Industrial Development Authority and Fóir Teoranta are maintaining close touch with the situation with a view to providing all possible assistance that would facilitate the takeover of the factory and its continuance as a significant source of employment in clothing manufacture.</P>
      <P>Apart from the problem of this particular factory, I fully recognise the need for further new industry in Carndonagh and in the Inishowen Peninsula generally and the IDA have been making and will continue to make strenuous efforts to establish new industry in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to do so now.  The IDA are offering very special terms in relation to the filling of this advance factory at Carndonagh. They have taken the exceptional step of offering it to a potential industrialist rent free for the first two years of its operation there.  They have also indicated that they are prepared to go to the very maximum of 60 per cent in relation to any grants they might make available for the <Col N="238" /> development of an industry there.  In discussions with the IDA on this matter this very day I have been assured that, in every case where it is reasonable, pressure is put on any industrialist coming to the country for whom this site might be suitable to put it on their itinerary.  Of course, there is a limit to what one can do, as industrialists going on itineraries around the country are, in the ultimate, free agents.  However, I can tell the Deputy that nine industrialists have been brought to the factory in question and that grants were approved for a particular project last year to locate here, but unfortunately that project could not go ahead due to the general world recession.</P>

      <P>The employment of crew members for the rigs is primarily a matter for the operators and their drilling contractors. It is not possible at this stage to give the figures which the Deputy has requested.</P>
      <P>However, I am empowered under section 57 of the new exclusive licensing conditions to specify appropriate requirements in regard to recruitment procedures.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I may help to put the matter in context if I point out that, in the case of the three drilling rigs which were operating in Irish waters during the last drilling season, there were about 90 Irish persons, approximately half the total, on the Glomar North Sea drill ship and 24 on the Saipem drill ship.  This indicates that there were a substantial number of Irish people last year.  I think it is desirable, however, as the Deputy implied in his question, that these consultations with the Department of Labour should proceed with the maximum haste, and I will do everything I can to ensure that they do. But I would point out to him that a major achievement of the Minister has been the very negotiation of this procedure under section 57 of the terms which enable him to actually do something about ensuring that Irish people are employed on these rigs.  I cannot say that this is a unique procedure in such a licence but it is one which is very valuable.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whom we do not have or who would be required to travel from one country to another, who would be drilling off the south coast of Ireland this year, off the west coast of Africa next year and off other coasts in some later years.  It is possible that, quite apart from many other training difficulties, many Irish people would not wish to get into that category of employment.  In some cases there are types of employment and substantial opportunities where Irish <Col N="242" /> people could be taken in without entering into commitments of that sort. It depends on the individual type of rig how much of that type of employment could be given.</P>
      <P>As far as training is concerned, the Deputy is aware that the Department of Labour have carried out a very detailed study on this matter which has been recently published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the lunch adjournment I referred at length, and I hope in some detail, to the necessity for concern and a positive approach to the serious problems of young persons in employment within our society.  I referred very briefly to the lack of consistency shown by the Government regarding the pay pause situation.  I also referred to the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance and the contents of it seriously harming any hope there was of seeing a modest increase in wages this year.</P>
      <P>The budget over, it was obvious to even the youngest school child that there was no way that anything approaching a pay pause was possible. It was rather childish of the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday evening to have charged this party with looking at the British budget.  One is obliged to look at the performance of people in comparable situations faced with somewhat similar problems. Certainly in the field of performance here the Minister for Finance has failed and failed miserably.</P>
      <P>The budget being over, it ruled out any possibility of a type of pay increase that in such a time is probably desirable, with the work force of this country penalised and overburdened with taxation, with social welfare stamp increases, with cost-of-living increases generally.  Then it showed the lack of knowledge of the situation, the lack of appreciation of the seriousness of the plight of these people by the current holder of the office in Finance, and, indeed, by the Taoiseach himself, when they continued to demand pay pauses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach's back was turned and he had gone to the United States, the Minister for Labour came out and took a different line, perhaps for his own political reasons or perhaps he was more aware of the realities of the situation that faced Irish working people.  As well as that, the Government at a crucial time like this should <Col N="250" /> have given guidelines.  Already spelled out by Deputy Haughey and by other speakers in this House was the necessity for this overall planning, this overall co-operation between participants in national wage agreement negotiations, the employers and trade unions. As well as that a government at a time like this should involve themselves in trying to encourage the approach that was highly desirable.  Everybody knows now what harm the budget has done. The cost of living and the inflation it has created are serious, particularly in relation to our credit situation.</P>
    <P>We are told, first of all by the Tánaiste, that the bubble has burst.  It has but for whom has it burst?  For the people who mismanaged this economy over a three-year period and have continued to blame outside factors and are now saying world trends are changing, the United States economy is recovering, the economy of the Continent of Europe is recovering.</P>
    <P>We must tackle our own problems and restore confidence in our people so that we can hope for a recovery from our own resources and from within our own resources.  We cannot have that recovery while we have the type of Government we presently have, without positive leadership without courage, in fact without anything, but guided by a desire for propaganda and publicity at enormous cost not only to this generation but to future generations of Irish people.  There are many instances of the Government trying to pull with both reins, trying to pretend they are going a bit of the road with everybody.  This is a time for courage. We want to see confidence restored.  It is necessary and desirable to make a positive approach to the unemployment situation.  We had one miserable effort last year&mdash;the premium employment scheme, as a result of the budget of 1975.  This was introduced by the Minister for Labour who set a job target on it of 10,000 jobs.  We co-operated and intimated that as far as we were concerned we would not stop at a target of 10,000 jobs, that it would be even far more desirable to put the figure far above that.  Because of the narrow conditions of the scheme, because of impossible targets set for some industries, <Col N="251" /> just over 4,000 jobs were created by it&mdash;less than half the expectations. But for the waiving of those conditions in certain circumstances not even that figure would have been achieved.  We have heard little about it in recent times.  We do not know whether it will be extended or the scope widened.  It is desirable that it should be.</P>
    <P>Dr. T. K. Whitaker, the former governor of the Central Bank, today in <i>The Irish Press</i> endorsed what I am saying and what my party have been saying for many months.  The bubble that must burst is how he described the economic trends in pay and costs in public spending and foreign borrowing in recent years.  He said there was a temptation to become dispirited and this is what we have been saying.  In recent years the difficulties have been great and we were not at our best in dealing with them.  I would say we were at our worst.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach must be challenged for his completely worthless contribution yesterday to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Dr. Whitaker said that people were even to be heard referring to the good years of the 1960s as if they were a flash in the pan.  This is exactly what the Parliamentary Secretary spelt out yesterday evening.  Dr. Whitaker goes on to say:</P>
    <P>There was nothing artificial, nothing unsound, about that series of years in which an annual growth rate of 4 per cent was maintained with only a moderate increase in prices, and virtually no foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>That situation was achieved within a climate created by a sound, constructive and positively led Government from this side of the House at that time.  Dr. Whitaker also says:</P>
    <P>If we do not have the foresight, courage and discipline to devise and follow a well ordered programme of recovery then we can well be dispirited.</P>
    <P>We have been projecting this message for a long time.  If we have not the courage, determination and goodwill to inspire our people to help themselves to recovery and stop our absolute <Col N="252" /> reliance on blaming people and events abroad, there is no hope for our young people.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of people are employed by the co-operative movement. Their employment is highly desirable not only for the content of the employment but for the location of such employment. Such employment is widespread. In the southern part of the country particularly the employment given by these concerns has meant a substantial benefit to the economies of towns, villages and even local crossroads. Our stand on the proposal to tax co-operatives has been spelt out. Nobody knows exactly what the position is on the other side.  The Minister for Finance introduced it in the budget debate.  We are not yet sure exactly what is meant by it.  We know he is under extreme pressure from his backbenchers who see the folly of his ways. Deputy John L. O'Sullivan spelt out in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> that he is not going ahead with this tax at all or if he does go ahead with it it will be in a very limited form.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the importance of the employment content.  The consumer of essential foodstuffs within this country will be the sufferer if this tax is imposed because many of these co-operative societies, particularly the bigger ones, the major employers, have expanded considerably.  Because of that expansion they have stretched themselves and are committed to repaying entire surpluses to the bank, in many cases for a long number of years.  If some of those surpluses are taxed it means that the banks must still get the money and the co-operatives must increase the surpluses. They can only increase them by imposing a greater cost on the consumer. What will this bring in by way of revenue?  I suspect very little.  The Minister has an obsession for imposing taxes on anything that appears to him to be a profit.  So that I will not be misrepresented I will say that I, too, would like to see profits taxed, if they were being used exclusively for the personal gain of individuals, company directors or, indeed, if they were being gained by exploitation of a work force.  If profits are being reinvested in industry, to keep our industry <Col N="253" /> and business up to date and to expand and create more jobs within it, it is important that assistance be forthcoming rather than have an attack on profits.</P>
    <P>I was coming to the question of how we should tackle unemployment. I have spelled out already&mdash;and no response has come from the Minister directly concerned&mdash;that the position can be described as a national emergency. All bodies with anything to contribute should try to find ways and means of improving the immediate situation.  In his contribution to the budget debate, Deputy Haughey suggested setting aside £100 million for the creation of jobs as quickly as possible. I am not saying the Minister can wave a magic wand.  I am realistic enough to know there are serious problems.  Unless the Government can create confidence in our people, fail we must.  I charge the Government with having encouraged failure, with having failed to create a proper climate, and with disregarding the problems facing our young people in particular. It is incumbent on them to save whatever little honour is left to them by putting their performance on the line and letting the Irish people decide whether they want them to continue in office.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Desmond said the pattern of a Government was set in their first 12 months in office.  The next 12 months are spent trying to persuade everybody their policies during their first 12 months were the right ones. From then on they began to think how they could ensure their return to office in the next election.  He went on to say the Government tried to govern the country and run the civil service and failed in both areas.  Basically that is what he was saying.  He was admitting to failure on behalf of the Coalition. If the first 12 months in office of this Government set the pattern, may God protect us from very many more months with them in office.  Perhaps he was reading some signs when he said the average life of a Government here was three-and-a-quarter years.  We are approaching that now.  I can assure the House the vast majority of the <Col N="254" /> Irish people would like the Government to call it a day and give them an opportunity to return a Government with the courage to take us out of the dreadful mess into which we have been landed, not by any outside factors, but by the mishandling of the Government and their failure to realise the steps which should have been taken in time.</P>
    <P>We have another worry.  We are a member of the European Community. In 1975, because of our involvement we got £100 million&mdash;no mean income from that source.  It was a major contribution to our economy.  What is the feeling in the Community at the moment?  This Government have managed our affairs so hopelessly that we may find they may go further than laying down conditions for our borrowing and instruct the Government, in the short time left to them, on how they should tackle the problems.  If the Community lose confidence in the ability of our people to govern themselves, the chances are that we will be affected in the areas in which it is vital that we should be able to obtain money.  That is the image which has been created by this publicity-conscious Government.</P>
    <P>The saga of the wage agreement is still going on.  It was reached after protracted negotiations.  It is a tribute to the employer and trade union groups that, despite the breakdown of the conference, when they were asked to come back together they stayed with it until agreement was reached.  The size of the increases may be a cause for concern.  The Minister who contributed so much to the size of the increases by his mishandling of the budget, by creating more inflation, said this was the end of the story, and he then told us he is going to the IMI conference in Killarney this weekend and he will make a major statement.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister who speaks in pubs when there is nobody there that he has a duty to the democratically elected Members of this House, and a duty to the people, to make such a statement, whatever its contents, in this House this evening. I want to stitch it into the record that there is an obligation on him to make that statement this evening <Col N="255" /> to the elected Members of the House.  He should state clearly what is involved.  Is it the nucleus of a plan which he said for so long was not necessary despite promptings from this side of the House?  When it was too late did he realise it was necessary?  Up to now he has taken no positive steps, to our knowledge, to set it in motion.  Is that the message he will be spelling out in Killarney?  There is no point in newspaper correspondents or some of his colleagues in the Labour Party going around the country and blaming the Minister.  The blame must rest on the shoulders of the entire Government for the inability of this man, the inefficiency of this man.</P>
    <P>The best cartoon I saw was a headstone in a newspaper last week with the words: &ldquo;In fond memory of the pint.  Erected by Richie Ryan.&rdquo;  There will be many monuments to the Minister when he vacates the position of Minister for Finance.  It is not enough for his colleagues to blame him.  They too have to accept their share of the blame for the situation which has arisen.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to offshore developments.  This Bill will create further unemployment in areas which matter to us.  The increase in the tax on petrol shows how inconsistent this man is.  In November or December, 1974, we were all here awaiting a dramatic announcement. We got a huge increase in the price of petrol.  The reason advanced by the Minister was that we had to bring it into line with the price of petrol in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Where is his consistency? What is his excuse now for the fact that we are so far ahead of them?  Other speakers have referred to the increased taxation on motor vehicles and have spelled out the necessity for having a motor car today.  It is no longer a luxury.  It is a necessity for the farmer and for the worker.  This is another example of taxation phobia, of hitting the workers with everything one can hit <Col N="256" /> them with.  At times one would begin to wonder whether or not it is an offence to work while this man is Minister for Finance.  He seems constantly to impose tax on those people.  This is a penal taxation on a vehicle that may not be used during a certain part of the year. We all have many constituents affected.  We have them in Cork. Perhaps in a more affluent constituency like Meath one may not have such people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in many parts of my county was that working people particularly used their cars for six or nine months of the year, perhaps to have the opportunity of taking their families out on a Sunday, surely their entitlement if they wished to do so.  Possibly they garaged them for three months and, in some cases for six months, simply because of economies&mdash;not being able to run or tax them for a full year. They can no longer do so with advantage. If such a car is left in a garage, it means now it must be taxed whether or not used.  I do not know how much revenue it will bring in.  It would not appear to me to be a lot. The important thing is that the Minister has obviously become punch drunk with the idea of taxing our people.  But the people of Ireland have become punch drunk with the belting they have received from successive impositions of taxation, especially on their incomes, on their thrift, on their initiative to succeed if they have a little business and are, perhaps, creating jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government will be remembered for its failure to take cognisance of the serious question of unemployment, for their failure to spell out remedial action or create some sort of action committee that would tackle the situation in the short term. I refer to the £100 million.  I see no reason why Ministers responsible for <Col N="257" /> the economy could not bring together a group of people involving, particularly, the IDA, the financial institutions and banks&mdash;where this is money lying idle because of lack of confidence&mdash;Fóir Teoranta, the trade unions, representatives of some of the unemployed action groups.  Indeed, the Opposition would be willing to take part, if requested, provided responsibility rests with the Government. Such initiative is urgently needed.  The terms of reference would be wide.  It would not need to be a commission or any such body.  It would merely be a group of people politically attuned, aware of the situation obtaining, of the necessity of creating employment in many spheres and spending more money productively for a change.  I could spell out many areas that might be examined and on which action might be taken very quickly.  For example, we have seen the building industry decline.  We have seen approximately 13,000 to 14,000 unemployed in that industry, a tragedy in itself.</P>
    <P>There are other ideas along those lines that should be pursued but the important issue is that the Government show an interest in this priority because, otherwise, our entire structure will collapse.  It is not sufficient to say&mdash;I quoted earlier from what Dr. Whitaker said&mdash;that we always had high unemployment figures.  Emigration was stopped, not by a Coalition Government but by Fianna Fáil Governments; jobs were created but at a time like this history is of no use to us.  What matters is that we have a problem that must be tackled quickly and, unless it is, we shall have dual results&mdash;a collapse of our existing structures and the creation of the great social evil of the young, educated, unemployed people.  These people are disappointed, frustrated. They have become disillusioned with politicians and with governments.  It is those people over on those benches who must accept full and absolute responsibility for that disillusionment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to introduce an element of realism into the debate <Col N="258" /> on the budget which this Finance Bill implements.  It is fair to say that the Minister had four basic options open to him in the preparation of the budget and this Bill.  He could have done what he did, which was basically to raise the money he felt the Government needed by expenditure taxes.  He could have gone for increased borrowing and not raised any taxes.  He could have raised the money he felt should be raised by income tax or, lastly, he could have cut public spending drastically and in that way render any extra taxation or extra borrowing unnecessary. In the circumstances obtaining I believe the Minister made the basically correct choice between those four options.  I challenge the critics of the budget to indicate within the terms of those options which alternative option they would have chosen.</P>
      <P>It was correct of the Minister not to go for an increase of borrowing, either internal or external, to finance what was necessary to be done because it is quite clear that the terms on which finance was being made available were very onerous, indeed, and the interest rates very high.  It is clear also that any money borrowed now will have to be repaid some time.  It would introduce a great lack of freedon for any Minister, present or subsequent, if too much of his current revenue had to be devoted simply to repaying the capital and interest on an inflated national debt.  Indeed, although Deputies opposite call on the Minister to spend money on this or that project in the name of employment creation, education and all the other desirable social objectives, they have said also they do not believe that the Minister should have gone for borrowing in excess of what he has done.  They cannot have it both ways and I think they agree implicitly with the basic choice not to go for borrowing beyond the present extent. Therefore, that disposes of that potential criticism of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are even fewer people who would have urged the Minister to raise the money he has raised in the way he has by increasing income tax instead. I do not think there is a Deputy who would  it would be preferable <Col N="259" /> to raise the money being raised on taxation of petrol by increasing the basic rate of income tax instead.  What we need most at present is an incentive for people to work and any increase in income tax would be directly and immediately contrary to that objective. I challenge those who criticise the Minister's basic decision to opt for increases in expenditure taxes and who do not believe he should have gone for excessive borrowing, to say frankly if they believe he should have raised the money instead through income tax. I do not believe any Deputy would have the courage to say that.</P>
    <P>The other possible alternative muttered occasionally by people opposite, but never very specifically, is that the Minister should have gone for cuts in public spending.  Not sufficient people realise the extent to which existing public spending actually directly maintains employment.  I ask those who say that we should cut public spending now, in 1976, to say whether they are prepared to take the consequences in terms of public servants, or those directly or indirectly employed through the public service, actually being laid off.  I do not think they would be prepared to accept public spending cuts were that to be the result.  It must be borne in mind that the amount of public expenditure which is going directly to the pay of public servants is now 32 per cent of all public spending and any cut could only be made on that expenditure by laying those people off.  Is that the sort of public spending cut the Opposition want?  Most of the other money, whether in grants for schools or other purposes which some might suggest should be cut, is going indirectly to create employment.  Take the example of maintenance grants for schools.  Some might suggest these should be reduced.  But that money is going to employ painters, for instance, who may be painting schools or people engaged in cleaning schools. If the money were not paid either those people would lose their jobs or would be paid less.  That is the hard option we face.</P>
    <P>I agree that in the long run, perhaps <Col N="260" /> in the next two or three years and subsequently, we must take a very hard look indeed at the growth of public spending but I would argue most strenuously that the trough of a recession is not the right time to administer cuts of the size that seem to be suggested by some Government critics because we would then be unloading into already an excessively large pool of unemployed further numerous companions, thereby creating greater difficulty for all in finding employment. I do not believe many people could seriously, giving chapter and verse, argue that the Minister should instead of what he did have opted for cuts in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a serious case for criticising the Minister for not borrowing more or for not raising the money by income tax instead of the expenditure tax he chose.  I do not believe there is a serious case for criticising him for not rendering unnecessary the taxes he had to impose by making further cuts in public spending.  This brings us down to accepting or rejecting the basic choice made by the Minister which was to raise the money required by expenditure taxation.</P>
    <P>We can criticise the Minister technically in regard to the particular expenditure taxation he imposed.  Some might say that he should have put more on VAT and less on petrol or that he should have put less on drink and more on tobacco or something like that.  This is open to argument but it does not criticise the basic option taken by the Minister.  Individual taxes have been discussed at such length that there is no need for me to go into them in detail once I have established that the basic choice made by the Minister was the correct one, but I shall mention a few.</P>
    <P>How many Deputies realise that despite the most recent increase in tax the Government are at present taking a lesser proportion of every penny spent on petrol than was being taken by the then Government in 1973?  The Government are taking something in the region of 58 per cent in tax on every penny spent by petrol consumers and this compares with approximately 62 per cent of every penny spent on <Col N="261" /> petrol in 1973.  The larger contributor to the increase in the price of petrol has not been the Government but those selling oil, whether internal oil companies or producers in Arab countries or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As a community, in the long run we must take a careful look at our pattern of consumption of energy generated by petrol.  We must look at the life style we had in the sixties and the settlement pattern we then developed based on the no-longer-true assumption of cheap, imported petrol.  We must realise that petrol at present is an entirely imported commodity and what the Government do not take from the price of petrol goes almost entirely abroad.  It is correct that we should to some extent discourage consumption of material imported to the profit of people outside.  That applies to petrol. Perhaps it is not entirely a justification for what the Minister has done but it is certainly evidence in support of it.</P>
    <P>I said that I feel the Minister was correct in not seeking at this time further cuts in public expenditure.  The clamour generated by the Opposition about the cuts or failure to increase money in some areas where this has occurred, has been such as to cast doubt on their sincerity when they argue for further cuts.  I argue that we should not cut public spending now but I most strongly argue that in the long run and when times improve we must take a very hard look at the growth of the public sector.  Some people say it is not right to finance this or that scheme now but when times are good the Government will be able to finance all these things people might want.  That thinking, to my mind, runs directly contrary to the idea of counter-cyclical action by the Government in relation to aggregate demand.  If it is justifiable for the Government, in order to create employment, when times are bad to spend a little more than they have, if the Government are to stay in balance in the long run they must be prepared when times are good to spend a little less than they could. They cannot have it both ways.  You cannot spend more than you have when times are bad and still spend more than you have when times are good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> It is for that reason that I would argue that the crucial time for stringent care of increases in public spending will come, not now, but when times start to improve in the Irish economy.  It is then we will have to look to repaying our national debt. It is then we will have to look to not embarking on schemes which we feel are not really necessary.  I believe that there are probably schemes in different parts of the Government apparatus which, while they are useful, do not represent the optimum allocation of resources but remain because of the inertia which exists in every Department. No Department are going to voluntarily say, &ldquo;We think we could save money on this, that or the other this year so we are not looking for an increase in our Estimate&rdquo;.  No Minister or Department are going to come forward with that of their own accord because that Minister or that Department would take the stick themselves. They are not the people who are going to identify the schemes in their own area which if not wholly redundant do not represent the optimum allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>I would argue that perhaps we should examine the need for some sort of an independent commission to look in the long run at public spending and to issue reports on schemes which are in being and which they feel do not represent the optimum distribution of resources.  I am thinking particularly of the very good work which is being done by the National Prices Commission in consultancy studies on individual applications, either from public sector bodies or from private sector bodies, which point out on the basis of carefully substantiated evidence where inefficiencies exist and where costs could be cut.  Perhaps we need a similar commission on the broader area of public spending to look at all the different schemes which are costing money year in and year out and which will continue to do so unless they are identified.  Perhaps we need some such body which would come forward with unpopular recommendations which we as politicians would then have to face up to and do something about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> New schemes should only perhaps be set up on the basis of a statutory time limit in relation to quantifiable objectives which must be met.  If the scheme is not meeting the quantifiable objectives within the time limit set, then the scheme should automatically fall to be questioned.  Such a procedure does not exist.  Schemes have been set up in relation to assumptions and objectives which are no longer relevant; and despite the fact that neither the assumptions nor the objections exist any more the schemes trundle on.  We need some built-in safeguard against this sort of operation.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the Opposition talking about the need to inject £100,000,000 into the economy to create jobs.  We need to be very careful in our assessment of suggestions made to the effect that simply spending money creates jobs with a long-term prospect of success.  To take the most obvious example of a public works' programme, if you spend money on employing people in, say, cleaning roads, first of all that process will have to end at some time and those people will cease to be employed.  Secondly, that process is not likely to have any direct result in creating any further employment.  Thirdly, it is possible that while those people are engaged on their contract on this public works programme that a job opportunity might become available which had a genuine long-term prospect of success, but because they are engaged on this public works' programme they are not available to take it and either the job goes to somebody else or the promoter of the job with the long-term viability does not go ahead at all because he has not been able to get the type of employee he wants.</P>
    <P>We need to be very careful about the implication that spending money on public works' programmes generates long-term job prospects.  Let us be clear that what we are interested in is long-term job prospects.  The Government have been spending money on job creation in the correct way with a view to obtaining such long-term job prospects.  We have put it through the IDA who apply a <Col N="264" /> strict viability test in relation to any grants they pay out in the creation of new jobs, and that is as it should be. We gave it in the form of an employment premium scheme which made it quite clear that the responsibility lay with the potential employer to ensure that the job would last.</P>
    <P>I believe that was the correct approach by the Government to spending money for the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>We hear references to the need for economic planning.  I studied economic planning when I was at university and economic planning is not an elixir for all our problems.  After all, what is it?  Does some public servant spend six months drawing up a long statement on the mushroom industry and tell us how many mushrooms he thinks we might produce in 1979, giving another equally theoretical figure for the number of mushrooms we might produce in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983, and produce this very detailed set of quantifiable targets for the mushroom industry, publishing these and saying &ldquo;There is our plan. We have a plan to produce X number of mushrooms by 1982.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is anybody seriously suggesting that that sort of plan is going to have any material effect in ensuring that cattle arrive on our farms, that chickens are produced, or that those mushrooms are produced?  Of course it will not.  What planning really cannot do is create employment; but it can provide a mechanism for communication between the different sectors in our economy.  Planning is not about producing big projections like, for instance&mdash;and not being unduly critical&mdash;the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  That was full of immensely detailed and scholarly projections which were not even reached&mdash;except of course the target for Government spending. Planning is basically communication. The present Government have a very good record indeed in relation to ensuring that communication takes place between the important interests in our economy.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the Taoiseach and Ministers have repeatedly and at considerable length met the different <Col N="265" /> interests in the economy and that there has been as much consultation, and more than ever before, between Government and the important interests in the economy.  It is also true that when the previous Government were in office they had a body called the NIEC which was supposed to assist in the planning process but they left the farmers off that council.  The present body, NESC, have the farmers, who represent the most important single industry in our community, playing their rightful part in the deliberations of national policy. That is as it should be and that is the position under the present Government.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the problems of the Irish people and our economy will be solved not by 15 men sitting in Government&mdash;no matter to what party or parties they belong&mdash;but by the people themselves.  It may sound very old-fashioned but I believe we need to renew some of the spirit of patriotism which existed in this country in the first 20 or 30 years of the existence of the State.  That spirit does not exist to the same extent now.  We need that will to work together, to be created again, if we hope to succeed. We also need to build up our confidence&mdash;and it is a justifiable confidence&mdash;in ourselves as a people and in our ability to achieve things in the world.  In that context the Irish presidency of the EEC, although it came in very difficult times, was carried off very well not just by the Ministers, although they played their part, but by many public servants and people in voluntary bodies who acted as chairmen in Brussels and elsewhere in the Community.  That showed what the Irish people can do on the international stage.  Now we must apply the same ability and talent to solving our problems on the domestic stage. The evidence of our presidency of the EEC gives us every ground for optimism in our ability to solve our own problems.</P>
    <P>There are certain obstacles we must get over.  We must become a little more honest as a people.  There is a culture developing in the community that it is all right to draw benefit to <Col N="266" /> which you are not entitled.  It is all right to draw unemployment benefit even though you are doing some work on the side.  It is not all right.  It is time all the leaders of moral thought in the community pointed out that it is not all right, nor is it all right for people not to pay taxes due by them or to fail to disclose information so that a proper assessment of their liabilities can be made.  People who draw benefits they are not entitled to or who fail to pay taxes due by them are stealing money not from an individual but from all the Irish people.  The fact that they are stealing from a number of people rather than one does not in any way diminish the extent to which it is stealing and a moral fault; in fact, it enhances it.  Until we get over this attitude and the concomitant attitude of looking for the Government to solve all our problems for us, we will not succeed.  On the other hand, we must realise that as a people we have a very great potential.  We realise that we have natural resources we never dreamed of.</P>
    <P>Due to the work of successive Ministers for Education and people engaged in every facet of the educational system, we have people who are as well educated and as capable of tackling work requiring educational ability as any in the world.  We also have an ability as a people&mdash;and this is most important in any area of economic achievement &mdash;to communicate with one another. We have an ability to talk and to express ourselves.  If, for instance, economic planning is to be successful, ultimately it is based on the ability of people to know one another and to communicate with one another. As a people, we have this ability, and we should turn that to good effect in co-operative ventures in relation to the improvement of our economic situation.  These are a few of the ideas I feel give grounds for optimism in relation to our long-term success as a people.</P>
    <P>Depression in the economy, whether it be the world or the domestic economy, is in substantial measure a <Col N="267" /> psychological phenomenon.  If enough people think times are going to be bad, they will become bad, because they will not spend money.  As a result, others will not have money to spend either.  This will reinforce itself and a depression will take hold. Clearly, that is what happened in 1929 and in the early thirties.  Those who for political or other reasons or who wished to get notoriety for themselves&mdash;which all of us, particularly those in politics, like to do from time to time&mdash;by spreading the message of doom about the Irish economy should realise that they are not just making academic observations. They are probably directly contributing to a psychology of defeat in relation to the economy and to a psychology which itself will actually reinforce a depression.</P>
    <P>I heard a criticism of the budget at some meetings I attended.  Some people asked&mdash;particularly when they saw the crowds at Fairyhouse&mdash;why did the Government not raise the money they needed by increasing the taxes on gambling instead of increasing the price of petrol.  We should realise, first of all, that the taxes on gambling were increased in the last budget and, secondly, that taxes on off-course betting in Ireland are now 20 per cent as against taxes on off-course betting in the United Kingdom of 7½ per cent. Increasing that gap still further would probably not have been a desirable move.  There is a certain degree of mobility in the racing industry between this country and the United Kingdom, and if our taxes on gambling go too far out of line with those in the United Kingdom it could have desirable effects.  It is also important to recognise that those taxes on gambling which already exist are percentage taxes.  The more people spend on gambling the more the Government get and, therefore, people need not worry too much about the crowds they see at Fairy-house. The more bets they put on the more is coming into the coffers of the Government and the better it is for everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Finance Bill is one of <Col N="268" /> the most important measures we process through this House every year.  It gives effect to the budget and introduces measures against new types of evasion and avoidance which come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners. It is a Bill which needs serious consideration and we will be discussing it in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We expected positive measures in the budget to improve the economic situation and I could not agree more with the Parliamentary Secretary when he said you could talk yourself into a depression and that such a depression can be created by psychological factors. The economic depression we are experiencing today has been created by the Government.  When we left office in 1973 the air of depression which is prevalent today did not exist at that time.  I blame the various measures which have been brought into this House and bad budgetary proposals over the past three or four years for bringing about this psychological effect on our people.  They created that climate among the industrial sector and gave no incentive to the average worker.  They produced no positive plan.  If there is no lead from the top in industry or business this atmosphere of depression can arise.  It applies more than anything to the Government that guidance and example should be forthcoming and reach every level in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government neglected that fundamental principle when coming to power.  They failed to produce any positive measures from the very outset. They got the economy in a sound condition, and it is important to go back three years to see exactly what the state of the economy was when they assumed office.  For the first 12 or 18 months we on this side of the House were criticised, and probably justifiably, by the various sections of the media for letting them off too lightly. However, we know that some of the legislation which was introduced following their assuming office was legislation which was being drafted when we left.  We treated that responsibly, but there is no excuse for any mistakes the Government made over the past 18 months or two years.  It is from this <Col N="269" /> stage onwards that we believe the Government made their mistakes.</P>
    <P>Apart from failing to plan, they overspent in every section.  I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that it is when times are good that you should save.  I would dispute that.  I interrupted the Parliamentary Secretary on one occasion to say that I remember the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he was on this side of the House as Finance spokesman and when we were planning our budget, from 1965 onwards&mdash;and these were times when budgets were in credit&mdash;saying that we should go into deficit and further expand the economy when times were good.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I would contradict that.  This would apply to any industrialist today.  If you have the money in reserve, by all means expand that industry, and I would give the same advice to any Government.  Any borrowing we did in the past was for capital purposes.  We were criticised in the past for such borrowing, but I think it is regrettable that we did not borrow more on the capital side in the sixties and early seventies.  If we had borrowed beyond what we did borrow we would have further expanded the economy, built new roads, hospitals and schools, and we would have been building them 50 per cent cheaper than we can build them today. While I have been in this House I have never criticised borrowing for capital purposes.  If there is anything I would criticise this budget for it is not borrowing enough for capital purposes.  We can never borrow enough when we are investing it wisely in the State.  Such investment in the future will have to be made in productive projects with a job-generating content.  It is important how we direct our capital budget in these coming years if we are to absorb our labour force.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the predictions we read in the papers day in and day out, this country is facing a very serious challenge.  There is a serious challenge for this Government, but they have failed to take any positive steps to try to expand the economy.  The fundamental question for any Government is the <Col N="270" /> creation of new jobs.  That is the test of a Government.  It must be the test of any Government because it is their prime objective.  Every economic correspondent in papers which I read prior to the budget was advising the Minister of positive steps he should take to curb inflation.  Inflation is the most detrimental thing facing this country today.  Inflation has bedevilled every country in western Europe as well as America and Japan.  The prime objective of any Government is to ensure that inflation is brought under control.</P>
    <P>What positive measures did the Government take to bring inflation under control in this budget?  The contents of the budget speak for themselves. The budgetary measures are definitely inflationary.  They will have no effect in bringing down the unit cost.  They are no incentive to workers because every measure contained in the budget is increased taxation.  At no time during the budget did we see concessions given to the average working man, except a very small concession as regards income tax.</P>
    <P>We left office three years ago with growth rate at that time.  In 1973 we had our unit cost, the most important thing today as regards our exports, under control.  We were keeping our current budgets in balance.  When we left office in 1973 we were budgeting for a deficit of roughly £5 million.  At the same time we had just successfully negotiated entry into the Common Market.  These were all the assets going for the Government at that time.  Taking over that type of economy the Government should have done better over the past three years.  If we look at the situation today we will find a completely different picture.  We have now a negative growth rate.  Inflation is the highest in the EEC countries. Spending on the public sector side has risen considerably over the past three years, and our budgets on the current side have gone completely out of control. The Government have failed to keep all these things under control, which is of vital importance if the economy is to be restored to a healthy situation.</P>
    <P>It is possible for a time, irrespective of whether in a manufacturing or <Col N="271" /> other type of business, to carry a downward trend in business.  This is acceptable in any country, and the Government can at times of depression tide themselves over that difficult time if they have to borrow on a limited scale.  Deputy Colley at that time conceded that limited borrowing is acceptable in any country, especially at a time of depression.  However, continuous borrowing, that can go completely out of control without any hope of seeing where it is going to stop or of taking any measures to control it, is bound to lead the country into economic disaster.</P>
    <P>We know the situation today as regards borrowing.  We know that this year alone the Minister is budgeting for a deficit of £327 million.  That is an astronomical figure to be budgeting for in the year 1976.  If the predictions turn out the same as last year's deficit, then we will find ourselves in a serious situation.  The Government will have to take positive steps.  The problems which have been created have become so large that it is very difficult to handle them; but proper measures should have been taken in the last three budgets.  The ills of mismanagement are not cured in one budget.</P>
    <P>When we hear members of the Government, and indeed the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton, mentioning what alternatives should be put forward apart from those introduced by the Minister in his financial statement, I would like to tell him or anybody on that side of the House that we would never have allowed ourselves to arrive at that situation.  I do not believe there is one Member on this side of the House who would allow the country to mortgage itself to that extent, especially for borrowing for a current budget.  I have no doubts at all that positive measures would be taken to boost the economy, to generate money in the right sector.  That is where our money should have been spent over the past three years.  There is no good in saying: &ldquo;What would you do with the public sector?&rdquo; or things like that. These measures should have been <Col N="272" /> taken gradually.  The situation should never have been allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>The whole situation is that they failed to boost the private sector, and this is where the Government have fallen down.  We have various statements from Government Ministers, depending on which side of the fence they are. Members of the Coalition, if they are Labour Ministers, advocate one policy for our industrial development and a fiscal policy.  Leading Members of the Labour Party have been advocating over the past two years that we should break with sterling.  Statements such as this, especially from people occupying important positions, can be damaging internationally.  These are statements that should not be made glibly, especially by somebody occupying an important situation.  I do not underestimate the intelligence of the man who is advocating this.  But at this time to be advocating a break with sterling when our economy is the weakest in western Europe is an irresponsible suggestion from a man in an important position.  I would not mind if it came from some other person whose views would not be taken as seriously, but the Minister for Finance knows perfectly well that, irrespective of how bad sterling is, we will have to stay with it.  The only time we can consider breaking with sterling is when we have properly developed our economy, when our unit cost is about 10 per cent under the British unit cost, when our exports represent 25 per cent of those of the UK.  We all know that at the moment our exports are well over 55 per cent of the UK's.</P>
    <P>To be advocating an action such as that at this time, without properly processing it, is damaging.  We have a long way to go before we can consider that. I would be the first to advocate it if I thought it could be done.  Of course this type of statement may get plenty of publicity, but such suggestions should be thought out seriously and properly processed.  If we should ever dream of breaking the link with sterling the people who advocate it should spell out exactly whom they intend to tie our currency with.  Will they tie it with some of the strong currencies, the Deutschemark or the Belgium <Col N="273" /> franc, or will they float it on their own? We should be told what exactly it is intended to do before irresponsible statements are made.  If we made such a statement, I am sure the Minister for Finance would be the first to ask how exactly it should be done, and if we had researched the whole procedure.</P>
    <P>I do not hear any criticisms from the Minister for Finance of statements from other sections of the community. If the Minister favours this I would like to know the Government's position in this regard?  There must be no uncertainty in relation to such matters because they are important to industrial development and foreign financiers. If there is any ambiguity about this, it could retard expansion.  These are some of the factors that can create uncertainty.  This is what Deputy Bruton was talking about when he referred to the fact that depression can be caused by psychological aspects &mdash;that we can talk ourselves into depression.</P>
    <P>The Government talked us into a depression by a complete lack of any positive plan over the past three years and by contradictory statements from the two parties in the Government. The Labour Party are advocating a very socialistic policy in relation to public ownership, and from recent Press reports I have read the Fine Gael Party seem to hold an opposite view. The situation is that when there are two groupings in a Government, two different ideologies, it is very difficult for them to come out with any agreement on a set of policies.  These factors are holding back the development of our country.</P>
    <P>The people do not know what the Government have in mind.  They have watched the decline in the economy over the past three years.  Some of these problems were caused by an international situation beyond our control, but many of the problems we face today were of the Government's making. It is not good enough for any Government Minister to put forward the excuse that the state in which we find the economy today was completely beyond our control and caused by international events.  The oil crisis had a certain effect on our economy at that time.  We knew perfectly well that, <Col N="274" /> when the oil producing countries took the decision to charge huge increases for fuel, it would create problems in this country.  It also created problems for western European countries who were completely dependent on the import of oil but they grasped the nettle in time and saw what the consequences would be if something were not done about it.</P>
    <P>There has been a transfer of wealth from west to east.  These oil producing countries are going to industrialise their whole areas.  They are entitled to do it and to get a fair return for their products.  Whether that is excessive or not I am not in a position to say, but I would not dispute their figures.  The Government should at that time have fully assessed the situation to see exactly where they stood. Instead, we progressed along the same line, spending money excessively.</P>
    <P>I do not mean spending money where it is urgently needed: on all the weaker sections of our community, old age pensioners, widows and orphans and so on.  The Government have spent money to keep their popularity at a high rate.  I criticise that type of expenditure.  It is not the duty of a Government to remain popular all the time.  Their first duty is to see that the economy is kept viable&mdash;the creation of jobs and the protection of the standard of living of our people.  Sometimes to do that it is necessary to make unpopular decisions affecting some sectors of our community.  The good must be taken with the bad when you are in Government. If the Government had taken proper steps at that time the economy would not be in the state it is in today.</P>
    <P>Our borrowing power is obviously practically exhausted.  Restrictions have been placed on the recent loan of £150 million negotiated within the EEC.  Irrespective of whether these restrictions coincided with Government policy or not they are attached to the loan, and have to be adhered to.  Government Ministers say that they are in line with Government policy.  That is all right, but the Government have no option during this year of changing their minds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> I expected that some positive steps would be taken to try to get the economy moving.  Everyone is looking for that today.  How are we to expand the economy?  What measures will be taken to create new jobs?  Many sections of this Bill deal with additional taxation of various kinds.  There is not one section to which we could point and say when it is implemented it will be a boost to the economy. That is what budgets are all about. Only proper fiscal policies will restore confidence and the best time to introduce them is in a budgetary period. That is when we should see positive steps taken by the Government through the Minister for Finance. Instead we see the opposite.  There is confusion.</P>
    <P>In one section of the Bill income tax concessions were given but it is a deferment for this year only.  In no other section is there any effort good, bad, or indifferent, to expand the economy.  All we see is additional taxation on petrol, motor cars, beer, wine, spirits and luxuries.  Anyone with common sense knows this will not expand the economy.  I believe it will have the opposite effect because of the amount of money being taken out of the economy.  In the last budget, £107 million was taken in taxes.  This is bound to have a depressing effect on retail sales.</P>
    <P>We saw recently in the papers that during the month of March there was a big drop in car sales.  In the budget debate I told the Minister car manufacturers had adjusted their projections for 1976.  They give subcontracts for tyres and other parts and they must project a year in advance.  The car assemblers adjusted their sales figures downwards by 15 per cent for 1976.  Brewers and distillers have also adjusted their projections downwards for 1976.  This is quite logical.  This decline is bound to take place in sales.  When the figures come out shortly we will see it becoming apparent that the downward trend is there.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister will agree many companies have gone out of business over the past three years.  Wages, overheads and various other factors put them out of business.  Profits were so eroded that they were left with no choice.  Unless there is profitability in any company or any business, there is only one way it can go and that is downwards.  When there is profitability you can expand your business, keep it up to modern standards, and keep proper staff.  The day you lose that you take a downward step.  Unfortunately that is what happened to many companies over the past three or four years.  They could not maintain their profits.  They could not maintain their staff.  We know what happens. Eventually the receiver is put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister drew my attention to profitability.  I have here a useful book circulated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It quotes 13 public companies last year.  Their pre-tax profits dropped by 68.3 per cent.  Profits after tax dropped by 56 per cent.  This is where the Minister will have his real problem when the upswing comes.  In those 19 companies, retained profits declined by 82.6 per cent.  It goes on to quote 99 other public companies in 1975.  The accountancy date was between May and August.  They showed a decrease of 22.5 per cent in pre-tax profits.  Profit after tax was down by 21.7 per cent and retained profits were down by 32.1 per cent. That makes 118 public companies which constitute a big majority of the private sector.  The Minister knows what a serious consequence the figures for retained profits will have when <Col N="277" /> expansion takes place and there is the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>I will tell the Minister what will happen when the upswing comes, and it must come some time.  When it does come about such companies will have no money available for readaptation purposes, to buy new plant and modernise their premises.  That applies to all those companies because of the huge decline in retained profits.  The Minister needs to direct his attention to that aspect, to ascertain whether or not anything can be done to encourage more undistributed profits to be retained by companies through some taxation concession and 118 public companies are a substantial number. Does the Minister want to encourage that type of procedure?</P>
    <P>One must remember that dividends were down by 14 and 9 per cent.  They were not down proportionately on net profits because, evidently, dividends are being paid by these public companies in excess of their annual profits so also are directors' fees which have increased during that period.  Dividends have to be paid by some companies to their shareholders but who suffers?  Such dividends are being paid out at the expense of retained profits because it is in that section only one can achieve economic expansion when the appropriate time arises.</P>
    <P>How will we equip ourselves?  How are we to get the finance with which to create new jobs?  That is the profitability reality of any company or business. Unless a certain amount can be retained for expansion and updating, we know what will happen.  It may not happen immediately but what will be the consequences in two or three years?  It is most undesirable to see a drop in those 99 companies of some 32 per cent in retained profits.  Yet we observe a 25 per cent increase in directors' fees and minus 9.2 per cent on dividends, when we are aware that the whole financial structure of such companies is very weak.  It would be interesting to see their annual reports and ascertain what are their retained profits.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we get the economy moving, bring about expansion, as I hope we will irrespective of who is in <Col N="278" /> office.  There is the feeling abroad at present that people are merely hanging on to see what will happen.  Indeed, people are asking also if the Government have any type of economic policy.  I was interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that no 15 men in a cabinet could solve our present economic situation.  Of course, I agree with him to a certain extent but it is the duty of the Cabinet to draw up guidelines, give some lead.  I am not saying it will work miracles but at least they should lay down some broad principles as to how they will operate over the 12 coming months.  They should give some encouragement and, above all, good example. One cannot preach one thing and practise another.  The Minister has been preaching restraint for the past 12 months.  We all agreed that certain restraints had to take place.  We heard from the Minister many times at the end of 1975 about the state of the economy, huge spending in the public sector and so on but where do we find restraint in the budget?  The Minister preaches one thing and practises another.  One has merely to look at increased taxation of every kind.  One must show sincerity.  If one preaches something, one must practise it.  One cannot hope to get the public to listen to one's principles unless one practises them oneself and the Government have failed to practise restraint over the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>There is then the huge increase in road tax.  The car today is a must for many people as a means of transport to and from their place of employment. Perhaps there was a time 30 or 40 years ago when a car was considered a luxury but that no longer obtains. Today it is part of the accepted pattern of life.  To tell a man using his car to and from his place of employment over the past ten years that it is unnecessary just will not be accepted and the quicker we forget about that type of philosophy the better.  The car is a generally accepted possession in our society, something with which we have lived and accepted for many years and there is no way now we can say it is a luxury or unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I hope some type of successful national wage agreement is arrived at <Col N="279" /> but if it is negotiated at a level higher than the Minister anticipated late in 1975, I blame nobody but the Minister himself.  I blame him because he occupies that office.  Yet it is a matter for the Cabinet as a whole.  They are all responsible for fuelling inflation in this budget.  If we do not do something to control our unit costs, there is no other way of which I am aware to expand our economy and let us be practical about it.  Unit costs in the EEC countries have remained at a reasonable level over the past two or three years.  We had a considerable advantage over the United Kingdom during the year 1965 to 1970.  To a certain extent that is how we built up our industrial arm.  We all know now that this unit cost has been eroded completely but could have been avoided had proper fiscal policies been adhered to.  It is unfair to blame the average worker merely because he has to claim additional salary to keep up with inflation or increases in prices. I do not believe his standard of living has improved to any great extent beyond the gross national product.  But had proper measures been taken&mdash;as were taken in other countries&mdash;we would have preserved our competitiveness in this regard.  That is the kernel of the problem.  Unit cost is of vital importance to anybody wanting to come here to establish an industry.  It is one of the fundamental factors to be examined. Industrialists will examine the political situation of a country, its stability.  They will ascertain whether good trade union principles are adhered to and, of course, what the export prospects will be.  They will ask whether they will be competitive as regards unit costs?  Those are fundamental factors any industrialist will take into account before investing his money.  Have we created that climate since we entered the Common Market?</P>
    <P>We left office in February, 1973 and we had successfully negotiated entry into the Common Market.  At that time proper research was done as to the requirements for encouraging foreign investors into the country.  I do not believe we have fully capitalised on <Col N="280" /> the benefits we should have received from the Common Market.  There have been substantial benefits on the agricultural front but I doubt if we have capitalised on other benefits which were there for the taking if proper policies were projected at the time to encourage investors.  That was before the present international recession.  The important thing then was that we had a unit cost advantage.  The situation is now far more difficult.  Our competitive position has been eroded and there is every likelihood that in the coming 12 months it will be still further eroded. I have always said that it is good for this country that there should be a strong British economy but that can go too far so that we have a very competitive British economy.  It would be detrimental to us if their unit costs are lower than ours.  Looking at the recent British budget and listening to various trade union leaders there, it seems there is every possibility that they will negotiate something in the region of a 3 per cent to 5 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be conscious of these things as must anybody reading the papers.  The Minister has this information first-hand.  We must realise the challenge that will then face us in this country if our competitiveness is further eroded.  How can our manufacturers compete?  I think that between 50 and 54 per cent of our exports still go to the UK.  If the position turns out to be what one expects, it would be very serious for us because we know that it is to expansion of industry, whether based on by-products of agriculture or other goods, that we must look if we are to absorb our labour force.  This must be done through manufacturing and service industries. The pattern in the EEC countries and in America is of a steady decline in agriculture and we must spell out some positive means of absorbing the displaced people into jobs which will give them a decent standard of living in the future.</P>
    <P>It is a worrying situation when we see so many young boys and girls with no future as regards employment.  There is nothing so demoralising for a boy or girl after getting a leaving certificate <Col N="281" /> or having completed some vocational training to be told on leaving school that there is no hope of employment. That is a sad situation and something that must worry every section of the community.  It worries parents and must be a worry to social workers because, without casting any reflection on their characters the danger to young people of 18 or 20 years of age who are walking about every day doing nothing, is tremendous.  There is the danger of their being channelled into subversive organisations or other undesirable bodies.  This applies more in the built-up parts of our cities than in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We must make a positive effort to ensure that boys and girls walking aimlessly about day after day do not find themselves in trouble.  I can see problems in my own constituency of Dublin Central.  I have sympathy for the boys and girls in this situation.  If there is no proper pattern or outline for their future lives there is discouragement and disenchantment.  They will wonder if democracy has failed them.  I do not say they will become sickened with Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour but there is a danger that they will tire of our political institutions.  They will ask why we are here.  Are we not capable of doing something definite to provide them with the employment which it is the duty of a country to provide?  Anybody born in this country has a right to employment here.  That is a serious obligation and one which must be tackled.  How this can be done must occupy the mind of every politician.</P>
    <P>Those in the public service have directed their minds to this problem but we do not appear to have found any solution.  If employers could take even one boy or girl beyond their requirements it would help.  Obviously, sacrifices will have to be made on all sides if some good is to be achieved. The Government should initiate some such scheme.  I condemn them on one ground.  Last year, if there was any scheme suitable for young people aged 18 to 21, it was taking the census.  This was a scheme by which we could distribute £1½ million or £2 million to those who had left school and who had no employment.  It represents an <Col N="282" /> insignificant figure in the current budget. The Government made a bad decision in cancelling the census which would have given useful employment to young people.  It would occupy their minds and would also be educational. It was an especially short-sighted decision in our unemployment situation. If we had not to contend with a huge growth in unemployment one could, perhaps, understand it.  That was the most suitable scheme I can think of. The census was necessary and it would not mean throwing money away.  It would tide these people over for a few months and would keep them working. The Government failed to implement the census due, they said, to the financial situation.</P>
    <P>The cost of living index figure for the period ending 17th March showed a 7.3 per cent rise and this will not help in our inflation problem today. This type of a rise at this time is certainly not going to help our inflationary tendencies which are apparent today.  This type of a rise is bound to reduce the standard of living of the average working man.  Nobody wants their standard of living reduced.</P>
    <P>If people do not want their standard of living reduced there is only one other way you can solve the problem and that is to produce more wealth in the country, get more jobs going which will increase the amount of money going to the revenue.  That is the only positive way we can do it. You cannot solve inflation by taxation. If anyone tells me that that is the cure for solving inflation I will not believe them.  Inflation cannot be cured by applying additional taxation.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has seen that.  He has kept taxation at a minimum.  Indeed, if we could get to the stage of reducing taxation, or if we could promise a reduction in taxation in conjunction with a suitable wage agreement, we would have some chance of solving our problem.</P>
    <P>Additional taxation only adds to the burden and there is no doubt about that.  That is what this budget contains. Every section in it contains taxation of various kinds.  I am not saying that you do not require some taxation.  The Exchequer must get money, but it <Col N="283" /> must get it in moderation.  It must assess the ability of the person to pay. It is only on those lines that you can get the country to accept a moderate type of taxation.  Taxation in the budget is only a part of the many increases which the taxpayers and business people have to carry.  Before Christmas we had an increase in taxation of a very substantial nature on postal and telecommunications which was something in the region of 30 to 35 per cent. That was bound to affect manufacturing industry.  Just six weeks ago we had a substantial increase in social security stamps.  When we on this side of the House recommended that some relief should be given in the budget to the manufacturing sector as regards social welfare contributions, not alone did the Minister go in the opposite direction, but the £8 million which the Exchequer contributed was passed on to employee and employer.  Every industry was under pressure at this time. This was bound to have an effect on unit cost and that is why people are becoming unemployed.  I cannot see why £8 million should be taken from the Central Fund this year and placed with employer and employee when we are at our weakest situation industrially.</P>
    <P>This type of negative planning has caused a lot of trouble.  We know that the capital budget is of vital importance. I would never criticise in any way any borrowing from the capital budget, but how long can we keep borrowing at this present rate?  Indeed, the Minister mentioned that he is going to wipe out the deficit in three years.  I wonder what deficit is the Minister talking about?  I am concerned about the deficit outstanding for three years.  If he is talking about wiping out deficits, they come to practically £700 million.  Is that the deficit the Minister is talking about, or is it the £327 million deficit this year?  I can tell the Minister now that he will not wipe out the deficit.  He has no hope of doing it and he knows that perfectly well.  The Minister knows perfectly well that he will be entering next January with a substantial deficit <Col N="284" /> to make up from a very weak taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that there is no confidence in the country today.  The average man is concerned about his employment, the school leavers are completely disenchanted because they can see no future in employment for them.  They can see no positive plan by this Government for their future and the creation of jobs.  The test of any Government is the creation of new jobs.  New ideas must be brought in by the Minister, and it is obvious that the present Government have no intention of taking positive steps to cure the economy.  If they did, it would be contained in their budget statement or in this Finance Bill.  They know that the upset to the economy and the troubles which have taken place over the past few years are their responsibility.  The people have waited three years for this Government to do something positive to overcome the difficulties.  I am not the only one who is complaining.  The Minister knows perfectly well that everybody is concerned about the future.  They want to know if the Minister can give them any promise in connection with their future.  Unless we instill some confidence into our people we will continue to be the bankrupt nation of western Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe the people in this country have ability and will respond if given the proper example by the Government. Unless that example comes from the Government&mdash;and going into their fourth year of office they have failed to respond or in any positive way to produce a plan for the future &mdash;they stand condemned.  The people of this country will judge that at the next general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the few consolations available to a Minister for Finance in a western European country at the present time is that there are very few people who would willingly undertake the obligations of his office.  We have had unprecedented problems to deal with in the past three years but I can honestly say that none of them was more difficult than replying to this debate.  I do not know, and the country <Col N="285" /> does not know, whether Fianna Fáil wants more public expenditure or less, more taxation or less, or more unemployed or less.  Not only have speakers contradicted one another, but every Fianna Fáil speaker, including Deputy Fitzpatrick, contradicted himself. This is in part, no doubt, a reflection of the fact that there is virtually no economic influence which does not generate some unwanted side effect. After their confusion in the budget debate which I pointed out, I had hoped they would have sat down together to work out a common approach to the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Fianna Fáil Party are not only unable to agree on matters affecting the security of the State, but they are also unable to agree on economic and social policies.  Like Rip Van Winkle they appear to have been asleep during the worst recession the world has experienced in 50 years. They made snide references to the possibility that outside the recession might have affected this economy and then proceeded to attribute all our difficulties to this Government's handling of the situation.  If there is truth in the Fianna Fáil allegation, the world does not know what has happened to it.  All the upheavals the world has suffered were not attributable to the causes which international organisations have long since identified, but, if the Rip Van Winkles of Fianna Fáil are to be believed, they were attributable to the presence of a National Coalition Government in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are like some people in this country who are not prepared to acknowledge that there were any difficulties facing our economy until there was a significant increase in the pint of beer in Ireland in 1976.  The economy was supposed to be sinking as fast as some of the thirsty people can sink a pint.  What are the realities? Complaints of unprecedented difficulties are now emerging from the Fianna Fáil benches, from people who had not an iota of spunk in them for the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is now stabilising. The underlying unemployment has not increased since October last.  That is a very significant switch.  Industrial <Col N="286" /> production has been rising since September last.  Industrial exports are rising.  The overall situation is improving. It is at this stage that the Fianna Fáil Party wake up from their slumbers and try to speak and preach ruination.</P>
    <P>We have had very big current deficits in the last few years.  The Government openly and deliberately proceeded on a policy of public expenditure to make good the lack of expenditure in the private sector.  Many of our critics today were themselves enthusiastic supporters of the Government's policies in 1973, 1974 and at the commencement of 1975.  They knew, as we and the whole world knew, that the right policies for this country were those being followed by this Government.  In 1973 when we came into power, in a time of world boom, we found our economy working well below its then existing capacity. We took up that under-used capacity and achieved a gross rate of nearly 7 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by independent companies and by the Central Bank itself who acknowledged the necessity in the unprecedented difficulties of 1974, 1975 and 1976 to borrow on the scale which became necessary.  There was an alternative, a ruthless, cruel <Col N="287" /> and stupid alternative, which Fianna Fáil are on record as wanting, and that is not to borrow, not to tax, but to run the economy in a greater decline and to have more unemployment. That is what Fianna Fáil did year after year when they were in power: they kept this economy in decline and let the poor devils who could not get work emigrate.</P>
      <P>Even if Fianna Fáil by some chance got back to power, that safety valve would not be available to them any longer, because other countries are not disposed to absorb unemployed people from outside their own areas of responsibility.  This country does not have the escape hatch of emigration for anybody now.  We have to employ our own.  That is what this Government have been endeavouring to do in the past two years and are continuing to do this year in the face of criticism by those vultures who would endeavour to win popularity out of the inevitable taxations.  These have to be applied in order to ensure an adequate level of spending and of capital investment here to improve the economy today and in the long run.</P>
      <P>Naturally in a democracy every disappointment is attributed to the Government of the day.  That is one of the advantages of a democracy: people are able to voice their complaints against the Government of the day. The people in their heart of hearts know that, while the Government may be a very convenient scapegoat, the problems facing this country are not capable of solution entirely by Government action.  It is urged by some that there are natural rivalries in our society between labour and capital, between employer and worker, and therefore that it is not possible to have co-operation.  The Government reject that view.  We have spent a lot of time and we will spend a great deal more preaching the lesson that all Irish men and women have a common interest in producing wealth and that they have a common responsibility to ensure the fair distribution of the wealth so produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our people have such a common <Col N="288" /> interest, but the trouble is that our institutions are geared in such a way as to conceal that common interest and to excite confrontation.  We see it ourselves here in this House.  The Deputies opposite uttered criticisms in the course of this debate which I know well they would not be voicing if they were on this side of the House. Fair enough, if the political pendulum were to change, we would perhaps be uttering sentiments not too similar to some of those expressed by the Opposition over the last few weeks. What is not going to solve the problems of this country is engaging in what the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy John Kelly, has properly called this ding-dong battle, making noise but producing very little result.</P>
    <P>One instance of this pointless form of debate arises out of criticism of insurance contributions which employers and employees are called upon to pay.  It is unthinkable that there should be any breach of the principle that insurance contributions should be as much as is necessary to meet the cost of payments from the Insurance Fund.  This country has a larger share of welfare coming from the Exchequer than any other EEC country.  Before we entered into the EEC and afterwards, the Fianna Fáil Party accepted that there would have to be a change in that position and that this country would have to move in line with the EEC countries so that insurance funds were built up by employer and employee contributions without contributions from the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  There is considerable pressure from the EEC because, as indeed the arguments advanced in favour of abolishing these insurance contributions support, if the transfer does not take place, then costings will be distorted.  The Exchequer bearing the cost here would mean that there would be a subsidy for production costs in Ireland which would not be available in other countries.  We cannot breach <Col N="289" /> the principle that insurance benefits and insurance contributions must be related.</P>
      <P>As I said, we have dealt with unprecedented problems in the last three years.  We could not have dealt with those problems if we handled them in the ordinary way.  We had to take unprecedented measures.  We took them and we have fully justified them.  When we took these unprecedented measures, again and again we warned that it would not be possible to continue indefinitely with massive current budget deficits, as such procedures, while necessary in the short term during a recession, are dangerous to continue in a time of growth.</P>
      <P>We have the biggest deficit of all this year, although percentagewise it is less than last year, but we will have growth this year and in the following years.  As that growth arises, then there will have to be a reduction in the deficit, because borrowing is not an alternative to taxation, though some people believe it is.  The borrowing has to be repaid with interest, and therefore borrowing in the long term adds to the burden of taxation rather than lessens it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and others referred to the conditions attaching to the EEC loan.  Again we had the mischief-makers in this regard.  There is nothing in relation to the EEC loan which is not already part of Government policy which we do not intend to change.  Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that the Government were wrong to follow these rules, to reduce the current budget deficit.  In the next few years, he said, we should not commit ourselves to that because it might be necessary to increase it.  That is fair enough, but if he says that, why have he and his colleagues spent so much time in this House and elsewhere for several months past arguing against the size of the deficit and the borrowing? He cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>When the Community decided to set up the facility whereby countries could borrow under the auspices of the Community, they said that conditions should be attached to every loan made by the Community, and if the Community were to make a loan tomorrow to Germany, conditions would have to be attached to it.  If anyone can think of a more benign set of conditions than those which were attached to the loan to Ireland I would like to know of them. They interfere in no way with our freedom of manoeuvre.  They impose no conditions on us which we are not more determined than the EEC that this country should fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the requirement to reduce our current budget deficit and borrowing requirements, the Community loan also set out as a guideline that the Government should endeavour to borrow more on the Irish money market from the non-banking sector.  Not alone is that the Government's policy but it happens to be a policy in which we have been singularly successful in 1975 and 1974, <Col N="291" /> where we have far exceeded any previous developments in this area and far exceeded our own estimates as to what was possible.  This will continue to be the Government's objective.</P>
    <P>The burden of taxation will always be a cause for comment.  If people fail to complain about taxation the suspicion might arise that they were in receipt of excessive income, so it does not do not to complain about taxation.  Therefore people will continue to express dissatisfaction with the level of taxation.  Eaten bread is soon forgotten, and I would like to remind the House and the country that at a time of exceptional Exchequer difficulty the Government have given personal allowance income tax reliefs of £80 million, have abolished death duties at a cost of not less than £16 million per annum, have given stock reliefs to companies to assist employment costing £20 million, have taken value added tax off food, clothing and footwear, and have also provided for business group reliefs, and the overall rate of corporate taxation in Ireland is one of the lowest in the Community. The effective rate of corporate tax is only 20 per cent.  All these are very significant improvements in the taxation position in Ireland.  It is fair to say on the basis of previous experience that Fianna Fáil would not have given such reliefs.  It took them 11 years before they gave even a puny improvement in personal income tax allowance.  One can well imagine what would have happened over the last three years had they been in power without any adjustment in personal income tax allowances.</P>
    <P>Mind you, if we had not given them, the size of the current deficit would be about £120 million less than it is, or our borrowing requirement would have been reduced by that amount.  However, that would have been taking money out of the economy, an issue which has been a matter of some heated debate in the course of this discussion, the latest contribution having been made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  How he can <Col N="292" /> suggest that we are taking money out of the economy when we are pumping more back in than we are getting out I do not know.  The Deputy knows because he and others have complained that out of every hundred pounds of Government expenditure £35 is borrowed.  That is pumping money into the economy, not taking it out.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley, <i>inter alia,</i> thought that we should scrap the Republic and join the UK again.  He was sorry that we had not got Chancellor Denis Healey in charge of the public purse in Ireland.  If Fianna Fáil were in power, he said, they would have done as Mr. Healey <Col N="293" /> did.  That is exceedingly interesting.  I hope Deputy George Colley will reprimand Deputy O'Malley, because that would have meant a very significant increase in the current deficit. It would have meant increasing the current deficit by 2.3 per cent.  Is that the policy of Fianna Fáil or is that the particular view of Deputy O'Malley which is repudiated by Deputy Colley who has the responsibility for the time being for finance?  It would also have meant increasing the central Government budget as a percentage of the GNP from 3¾ per cent to 4.7 per cent. Is that the policy of Deputy O'Malley? It cannot be Deputy Colley's policy because he has very vigorously condemned the size of the current deficit and of the Government's take of the gross national product.</P>
      <P>These are the realities.  This country has far greater constraints applying to its economic manoeurvrability than has Britain, for the reason that, being a very open, vulnerable economy and having far greater investment needs than Britain, and having regard to the fact that the public side contributes 60 per cent of the total capital investment in Ireland as against 40 per cent in Britain, we have a much greater capital requirement than Britain or indeed than any other European country.</P>

We are not at all impressed by those who do not bother to do their homework but try to mislead our people by chasing after whatever appears to be a current fashion in countries which have totally different economic circumstances from ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The size of Government expenditure has been criticised.  Some Deputies opposite have on the one hand suggested that the Government are a spendthrift Government without any control over their expenditure, and on the other hand have suggested we ought to spend a great deal more.  I challenge anybody to deny this: 75 per cent of parliamentary questions from the <Col N="294" /> Fianna Fáil Party involve additional Government expenditure which if acceded to would put the public financing totally out of control and the country would be bankrupt within six months.  When we received the Estimates this year we cut over £500 million off the Estimates.  The Estimates when originally presented were for £2.6 billion and we cut over £500 million off that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister presented it to his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very substantial cut in public expenditure.  It may be called thwarting of individual ambitions, of other Departments and State agencies.  No doubt it has had its effect of not allowing the economy temporarily to jump ahead at a faster rate, but that temporary jump ahead could have been made only at an intolerable cost, if it were feasible at all. It would have involved far greater taxation and borrowing, both of which would have been unsustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So these cuts have been made and throughout this year the most rigid control is being maintained over Government expenditure.  It has been made clear that Departments and State agencies have to live within their existing allocations.  If policy changes are required in order to live within those allocations those policy changes must be made.  That is the only way in which any Government in this or any other country can bring public expenditure within the control that is necessary in order that the resources of the country can be applied to best use.  In our circumstances best use requires that they be applied to the maintenance of employment and the provision of new employment.  Of course, fiscal policy has to attempt to tackle a range of conflicting aims. For example, the budget is expected to arrest the rate of inflation without exacerbating the unemployment situation. The Government net borrowing requirement is supposed to be contained without further taxation or deductions in expenditure.  The truth is that it is impossible to satisfy every man's ideal of the role and execution of budgetary policy.  It is simply not <Col N="295" /> feasible to solve or to require to solve, even over the long term, all the economic and social ills through budgetary action alone.</P>
    <P>However, the Opposition, and certain other commentators, have suggested that the budget is the most economic instrument in the State; that it is a potential panacea for all ills, whatever their origin.  In fact, there are massive limitations on budgetary policy for stabilisation at any time, particularly when crucial decisions affecting the expenditure of the community&mdash;that involves decisions affecting incomes&mdash;are made outside the context of the budget.  However, these are the institutions which we inherited and these are the institutions and procedures which we are endeavouring to change.  There is no point in allowing the country to sink according to established procedures when it is possible to save the country by changing those procedures.  But there is not yet the will to change those procedures and those changes of procedure, I think, will eventually involve this House, the whole organisation of industrial relations and the general management of our society.  I believe that the problems ahead of us are of such a nature that those changes will have to be made.  It is better that we should examine the need for these changes now and make those changes voluntarily rather than have changes imposed upon us which would be alien to our beliefs.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Opposition, one would imagine that in recent years public finance had become strained only in Ireland but that is not so. Every country in the EEC last year had a current budget deficit.  That is an extraordinary development for several countries on the European mainland where budget deficits would never have been tolerated in normal times.  However, such countries have been obliged, because of the depth and extent of the recession, to accept budget deficits as appropriate to the circumstances of our time.  In Ireland, economic depression, accompanied by exceptionally high rates of inflation, inexorably shoved up expenditure <Col N="296" /> costs.  For example, pay rates, a significant part of the public sector bill, and social welfare payments, have necessarily had to follow the upward price trend but, contrary to previous experience, taxation buoyancy has not followed the same trend.  The tax yield from unchanged rates of taxes in Ireland and abroad have fallen over the last three years.  This inevitably meant that the tax rates in some areas have had to be increased.  There is reason to hope that, as growth again becomes the norm, buoyancy in revenue will once again improve and, therefore, make it possible to reduce the income tax rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that he has approximately ten minutes left and we would hope, although he has many things to cover, that he would say to the House the main substance of what he proposes to say next Saturday. This is the place to say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to next Saturday I shall make comments which are appropriate to address to the Irish Management Institute on the problems which the Irish Management Institute has before it.  In relation to this debate, I shall reply to the points raised in the course of the debate on the Finance Bill, most of which, with respect to the Chair, were not relevant to the Finance Bill as such.  It was more a repetition, and a very tiresome repetition, of some of the remarks made last January and early February on the budget.  In the time left to me I should like to address myself to some of the specific provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the measures of the Bill which relate to the payment of tax under Schedule D and suggested that in some way these measures increased the tax liability. However, the fact is that Schedule D tax, which is paid by self-employed persons, is not being increased by these measures.  This Bill is bringing a large number of people within the PAYE system who were not previously within that system.  The vast majority of the people here&mdash;I believe it is 95 or 96 <Col N="297" /> per cent&mdash;have to pay tax on a current year basis and pay it every time they receive a pay cheque.  In that situation it would clearly be inequitable to allow those to pay tax in arrear on the profits of a preceding year, oftentimes in arrear to the extent of 18 months or two years after they make their profit to remain so long in arrear. All we are doing is to advance the time of payment of the tax by three months; it does not increase the burden of the tax.  No additional tax is being demanded.  Schedule D payers are not being taxed on a current year basis.  When inflation is running as fast as it it at present, it is a very significant advantage for people to be paying tax on last year's profits or, in many cases, on a 12-month period which is far beyond 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no case for the claim being made that some particular cash concession should be given to such people.  Cash concessions are being given to PAYE payers in the public service who are being brought within the PAYE net now because they will be required to pay not merely on the current year basis but also are required to pay the money instantly.  That means in many cases that if there was not a cash concession people would find themselves with less take home pay in 1976 than they would have had in 1975.  The Opposition have not argued that we were wrong to give those concessions but as they accept that we were correct in giving those concessions I trust they will see that it would be inappropriate to give similar concessions to people who would be still paying tax on an arrears basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley also raised some points in relation to stock relief. Financial journals and financial advisers have for a long time been pointing out that it was wrong for firms to assume that stock relief would be a permanent feature.  They have been advising against the distribution of profits which arise on the books by reason of the granting of stock relief.  It is desirable that profits arising out of the stock relief should be retained and reinvested in a firm. All I have done this year is to put <Col N="298" /> down a marker to indicate that stock relief is going to be looked at and that, therefore, it would be wise for firms to consider the possibility that stock relief which has been given in the exceptional circumstances for the last two years of unprecedented inflation and recession might not continue to apply in totally changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney wanted to know about the effects of section 19 which deals with the fragmentation of holdings. He feared that this anti-avoidance provision might constitute a restriction on the sale of land.  I want to disabuse him and anybody else of that idea.  The only action which we are moving against is cases where land is let out at a nominal rent or on a rent-free basis.  It does not apply to land which is genuinely sold.  We are taking action to stop a deliberate practice where there is no genuine transfer of the ownership of land.</P>
    <P>The provision on the continuous liability for road tax has been introduced to defend the interests of the majority of motorists who pay their tax but who deeply resent an insignificant number of motorists who deliberately evade payment of the road tax.  Such evasion means that there is a greater burden of tax on other road users.  It has been estimated that at any time from one-fifth to one-sixth of road users are on the road without payment of motor duty. That is obviously an abuse which it would be wrong for Dáil Éireann to tolerate any longer than necessary. The Minister for Local Government has the responsibility of drafting the regulations to provide for continuous liability.  The draft order will then have to come before the Dáil and Seanad for approval.  I sympathise with some of the arguments that have been advanced about the comparatively small minority who may not normally tax their cars on a full 12-months' basis.  There are special situations such as the owners of vintage motor cars and so on who may only take them out of the shed and polish them once a year to run them in a vintage car rally.  Deputies can be <Col N="299" /> assured that the regulations will provide adequately for such cases or cases where the nature of the business for which a vehicle is used is only seasonal.  This will be a matter for a resolution in the draft orders.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of taxation of petrol.  Where there is a very substantial grant to public transport, when public transport is subsidised to the tune of £28 million it would be illogical not to collect a tax from other road users.  If public transport did not exist in this country, obviously very many people especially the poorer people in the community would be seriously disadvantaged.  If the subsidy of £28 million did not exist, there could be a reduction of 13½p in the retail price of petrol.  That would be popular to the users of motor cars but the Government have an obligation to ensure that public transport is provided and to encourage people to use public transport.  If it were used adequately, it could operate to much greater public benefit than our present system of duplicating and triplicating a great deal of the transport services here.  While people are understandably disappointed about the percentage of the price for a gallon of petrol that is taken in tax, the percentage is now less than it was at any time between 1964 and November, 1973.  In the meantime, incomes have risen substantially higher than the movement in the cost-living index, so that the actual burden of such tax is now less than it was during the period 1964 to 1973.  The price of petrol in Ireland ranks about half-way in the price of petrol in our Community colleagues.</P>
    <P>The agricultural co-operatives generated some heat in the course of this debate comparable only with the great deal of heat which was generated outside. <Col N="300" /> Most of the comment has been inaccurate and irrelevant.  One of the most recent commentators is a revered member of the Hierarchy whom I respect because of his rank, his capacity to speak about theology, philosophy and religion, but I suggest that he and others might respect my capacity to speak about taxation matters and the equity of the taxation code.  Where there is a business operation in this country with a turnover exceeding £600 million per annum it is surely not unfair that a sum of about £1½ to £2 million should be collected from such an operation towards the general running of the country.  Anyone who considers that to be wrong should stand up and say that they consider it to be wrong.  They do not want to say that yet they wax on eloquently about the injustice of the measure without dealing with facts.  Recently this church dignitary, whom I respect in his own sphere of responsibility, has on several occasions demanded massive additional public expenditure for items which he considered to be desirable.  He has even said that there was a willingness on the part of the public to pay more in order to cover the expenditure which he was seeking. It seems that what he and others are suggesting is that people who are already caught within the tax net should pay more but those who have gone scot free in the past should continue to go free.  That is totally unacceptable and is contrary to every principle of fair play.  We will be making adjustments to meet the particular current problems facing some co-operatives and I am sure they will find in relation to this matter that the Government are prepared to listen and adjust the laws where necessary to make them fair.</P>

I suggest the Whips would consider the matter and we should fix the earliest possible date for the debate.  A fortnight would be a totally inadequate period.  As the Deputy appreciates, the Bill has to be signed by the President by 29th May, I think. Therefore, it would have to be with him a week before that date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening when I reported progress I had endeavoured to give an analysis of the concept of the National Institute of Higher Education and the development of the institute under the Fianna Fáil Government. I pointed out the sorry contrast between the confidence the Fianna Fáil Government had in that institute and the contribution it could make to the development of the Irish economy, and the confused attitude the Government are displaying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is noteworthy that, up to the moment, no Member of the Government parties and no Minister has intervened in this debate.  They are very constrained this evening in the numbers who can contribute.  This is quite extraordinary.  Everywhere we have gone over the past six to 12 months the young students from the institute, and the staff, have sought discussions with the various representatives, in the mid-western region in particular.  Their <Col N="306" /> case has been discussed, or mentioned rather than discussed, at county council, urban council and other meetings. As I speak here this evening, the Nenagh Urban Council, of which I am a member, are discussing it and presumably giving their support to the case being presented by the students and the staff of the institute.</P>
    <P>Among those who have expressed soft plámás for the case made by the students and the staff, which coincides with the original aims and programmes of Fianna Fáil for the institute, is Deputy Ryan from North Tipperary whom I have not seen in the House since this debate started.  If he can speak words of soft reassurance to students who are entitled to something a little more genuine than that, he should be in here putting on the record what his position is.  Deputy Coughlan is here now.  I should like to hear from him an analysis of where he sees the difference between what Fianna Fáil have proposed and what the students are asking for, which happens to be the same thing, and what the Government are doing.</P>
    <P>Some Government Deputies do not really understand the difference.  They are actually giving support to concepts they do not fully understand.  Last evening our spokesman on Education, Deputy Wilson, Deputy O'Malley and I outlined at some length the sharp difference between our approach to the institute and that of the Government. When the supporters from the other side take up their positions, I should like Deputy Coughlan, Deputy O'Donnell, the Minister for the Gaeltacht who was here last night apparently to give an impression of concern and interest, and Deputy Ryan, to say precisely what they understand the issues to be and, having said that, to say where they stand on the issues. When you are dealing with young educated people you must prove to them that you are not just relying on old political hackery but that you understand the concepts about which they are concerned.  Before you assure them of your support perhaps you would indicate to them on what basis that support has been given.  I want particularly to ask those Deputies who <Col N="307" /> have assured these students and staff of their position&mdash;on the basis that the Minister will not accede to our motion this evening, though I would be very thrilled that he would&mdash;what they propose to do.  I regret to say at this stage I am quite sure they will dutifully troop into the lobbies after the Minister and the other members of the Government irrespective of what they have been saying outside of this House.  If they do, then let them forever keep their peace about what is their stance about the institute and the students concerned.</P>
    <P>In the remaining five minutes I want once again to outline the great concern there is here.  Can one imagine what it must be like for students who have entered on a course of studies in any one of the disciplines of concern at present on an understanding that, at the end of that period of study, the National Council for Education Awards would confer appropriate qualifications on them suitable to the studies they had concluded?  They are left all through their course of study in doubt and indecision as to where precisely they stand and are being deprived now of the level, standard and nature of qualification they always understood would be theirs as of right. It is deplorable that this is the response we show to young people who have shown a great confidence in the whole concept of the institute as it was first mooted and a great determination to achieve its aims.  Equally, I wonder what has happened to the NCEA or what is it intended to do.  I acknowledge that when we were in government that had to be and was established on a non-statutory basis.  It was then only initiated.  I acknowledge that there was more to be done; it would have to be established on a statutory basis.  I acknowledge that it had not reached that point by the time we left Government.  Certainly everything we did was by way of preparation for that very essential step.</P>
    <P>Surely a National Council of Education Awards would be sensitive to our country's agricultural potential, that of the industrial sector and to the country's social development, so crucial to the proper channelling of third-level <Col N="308" /> instruction and education to the national advantage.  As one example, it is no secret that in that area there has been quite a significant development in the mining industry.  I am not at present aware of any very effective school of mining technology within any of the existing universities.  I know there are some studies in that direction at the institute, studies and disciplines that would have to be developed to a very considerable extent.  But having regard to the potential of our mining industry so often spoken about from those benches surely it must be seen that the traditional universities are not the educational establishments to have control and direction in this area.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if we speak in terms of offshore resources&mdash;and all of us have some expectation that there may be some considerable wealth to be derived in that direction&mdash;if we want to exploit them to the fullest advantage, is the Minister going to tell me that the best manner in which that can be done is to have an institute brought in under the wing of the existing universities with their traditional approach to third-level education?  There is a very definite distinction between the practical application of the techniques of technology and training meant to be applied in that institute and the nature of studies at universities.  The Minister must be aware of that.  It shows a sorry lack of awareness of that distinction that we have to bring a motion of this sort before the House this evening.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I say this: our position here happens to be exactly parallel to what the students and staff are seeking.  It is not that we are doing the popular political thing in following what seems to be now a popular political stance.  We have taken this position at all times.  We are glad that the students and staff who first entered that institute saw their role as being the one we planned for them.  We can assure them that we will fiercely defend that concept as we planned it and that whatever others may say with free and casual support, when we say we support it, we say it out of real conviction and understanding.</P>

      <P>In responding to this motion, may I say I was struck last night by a rather sad contrast. I listened&mdash;I think Deputies opposite will agree&mdash;as patiently as I could to an outburst from three Deputies, sometimes literally shouting together, an outburst which seemed to be specially designed to invite me to reply in a similar vein.  Through it all I could not help thinking of the much more dignified and serious attitude of the group of NIHE students who are at the moment at the gate of my office and I want to keep these students and their interests firmly in mind as I have always done throughout this whole controversy and I want to treat this matter with the seriousness it deserves.  I do not want to join the Opposition in a political football match or respond to their cheap jibes about off-side traps which were made yesterday evening. Still less do I want to comment on their unworthy references to &ldquo;so-called degrees&rdquo; of our National Universities. I believe the students and the public generally will see through this exercise in futility on the part of the Opposition.  I want therefore to concentrate in my reply on the facts of our situation and I do not intend to be tempted into irrelevancies in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our common concern in this House should be with standards and their maintenance at a high level.  When Deputy Faulkner was Minister for Education he expressed this well in an <Col N="313" /> address he gave at the first meeting of the NCEA at the end of April, 1972.  He said:</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that you will demand high standards in relation to the qualifications which you will award so that they will merit international as well as national esteem.</P>
    <P>The NCEA itself in its first report indicated its concern that its awards should get the widest possible recognition and set out clearly its conditions and procedures for ensuring this would be achieved.  In relation to degrees in particular the NCEA had this to say at page 11 of its first report.</P>
    <P>In the awarding of a degree the council is required to ensure that the standard of admission to the course qualifying for its degree awards, the standard of the course and the level of achievement are comparable to those of an Irish university.</P>
    <P>In accordance with this concern the NCEA from the beginning asked institutions to submit applications at an early stage and, in the case of degrees, at least one year prior to the commencement of the course. The Department of Education, under my predecessor, Deputy Faulkner, wrote to the NIHE, Limerick, on 5th September, 1972, to express concern that applications from them to the NCEA had not yet been sent on and to ask them to do so as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The historical fact remains that no degree course was submitted to the NCEA from the NIHE, Limerick, until 16th July, 1974, and then only in respect of one area of study&mdash; Material and Industrial Engineering. This is an odd background to the rather frenetic Fianna Fáil suggestions that all would be well and apparently awards, including degrees, would flood out to the NIHE students if only one would turn again to the NCEA.  I am sorry to have to say it but that is really the message that came across to us last night and again tonight and this message can <Col N="314" /> only serve further to mislead the students of the NIHE.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this motion to disallow the statute would appear to be inspired by the somewhat strange reasoning on the part of Deputy Wilson and his Fianna Fáil colleagues that, if they were to succeed in their alleged purpose of preventing the enactment of the provisions of the statute, they would be conferring benefit on higher education. Indeed, I suspect from some of their more melodramatic flights of fancy that Deputy Wilson and his Fianna Fáil supporters imagine themselves to be, or hope to be seen, in the role of knights in shining armour who have thrown themselves in the path of the menacing dragon of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear to the House that the NUI, which has had so many charges levelled at it in recent weeks, did not suddenly advance with evil intent against any non-university institution.  Neither did its constituent college, University College, Cork.  The Government decided in December, 1974, that the NIHE, Limerick, should be a recognised college of the National University of Ireland and, in accordance with its terms of reference, application was made for this status by the governing body of the NIHE to the university. The application was examined by UCC in accordance with the terms of the charter of the NUI and recognised college status was granted to the NIHE and what we have before us this evening is the logical consequence of those actions.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the authorities and officers of NUI and UCC who dealt with this application of NIHE and who, in consultation with other experts, examined its courses did so expeditiously and with the maximum of goodwill and understanding for the special problems of NIHE.  This, of course, was only to be expected and is in keeping with the sentiments already expressed by UCC in a passage from a document already quoted by Deputy Wilson here, the document of July, 1975, entitled <i>Institutional Arrangements for Awarding Degrees.</i> I want <Col N="315" /> to quote now from page 13 a passage which Deputy Wilson did not quote:</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what the institutional framework may eventually be UCC would be very willing to help in the development of co-operation arrangements with other third-level institutions.  We expect the greatest opportunity for this to arise with institutions in Munster... in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Tralee.</P>
    <P>The result of this willingness and this consideration by UCC is this NUI statute which Fianna Fáil so gracelessly here this evening wish to see annulled.  The whole approach of Deputy Wilson and of his colleagues in the points they have raised in this debate has been from a negative standpoint. Let us adopt now a positive approach to the whole matter.  I have already outlined on numerous occasions the sequence of events which led to the making of Statute 178 by the Senate of NUI.  I would like now to direct Deputy Wilson's attention and that of his colleagues to something I said here on 18th February, 1976, when another motion by him was being discussed. At column 362 of Volume 288 of the Official Report I said:</P>
    <P>Our decision that degree awards should be made by the universities has been much criticised and indeed misrepresented, largely I think because of misunderstanding of our intentions.  For example, we have been charged with submerging the identity of the NIHEs by merging them with the traditional universities. There is no intention of submerging the identity of any institution within the system, and when I use the word &ldquo;system&rdquo; here I am referring to the entire area of higher education, encompassing long-established institutions and more modern establishments.</P>
    <P>I note that in a leading article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13th April this vein was continued.  The article says:</P>
    <P>The governing body cannot afford to protest publicity as if there was anything to protest about anyhow, but there can be no doubt that they would prefer independence in any <Col N="316" /> case in view of the unreasonable conditions which the NUI has laid down for the merger.</P>
    <P>What unreasonable conditions?  What merger?  I wish people who use the English language would use it correctly and refer to facts.  I refer to that statement in the debate of 18th February now because from what I have already heard in this discussion its import went unheeded or has been forgotten by politicians and, indeed, by the media.  Lest what I said about degrees on that occasion suffer a similar fate I feel it is of sufficient importance to repeat it again and I quote from the same volume at column 364:</P>
    <P>We hear a lot nowadays about who will award a degree to one group of students or another but we hear little or nothing about the responsibility of the prospective graduate in the matter.  For instance, we hear no reference to the successful completion of an adequate course by the students or to their meeting examination requirements deemed necessary by those who are competent to assess whether their performance measures up to a standard that is acceptable, not alone nationally but internationally as well</P>

      <P>It is Volume 288, column 364.</P>
      <P>The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>Degrees awarded in Ireland have long been accepted throughout the world, because the people whose responsibility it has been to guard their own standards have fulfilled faithfully the responsibility entrusted to them, and they have been alive to the very serious repercussions that would follow from any doubt that might be cast on the reliability of their awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> In fact, in a letter, in today's <i>Irish Times</i> from Patrick J. O'Flynn, Department of Chemistry, UCD, the very same point is made.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>The worth and acceptability of a degree awarded in Ireland, irrespective of the source of that degree, must be guaranteed throughout the world.  We must guard against any deviation from acceptable standards that would devalue, or even risk devaluation of, our degrees.  That must be one of our guiding principles.</P>
    <P>Even if we were not duty bound to do all we can to maintain the high place which our awards have in the world, it would be unfair to our students, to say the least, to speak as if our aim were to give a degree to every student who completed a degree level course as if he had an absolute right to such an award.  A graduate must have a degree that is worth having.  To give him or her a degree that would carry with it the slightest suspicion of inadequacy would be tantamount to playing a confidence trick on the graduate to whom it has been awarded.</P>
    <P>The students of the NIHE, Limerick who acquire a degree on successful completion of their studies will possess a degree of the National University of Ireland.  That is no second rate qualification but one, I am glad to say, which has the highest standing internationally.  It must be appreciated that the values which we are defending in the case of our degree awards have a perennial validity and that the untarnished reputation of Irish qualifications must be and will be jealously maintained.  We must avoid any temptation that may arise to put this reputation at risk by upholding for whatever reason, be it fear of virulent if ill-informed criticism from certain quarters, or genuine sympathy for those who feel disappointed in their expectations in the short term, what might be inadequate in quality when judged by the best criteria.</P>
    <P>Inadequacies can be overcome, deficiences <Col N="318" /> can be remedied and the goodwill and assistance of established institutions with their international reputation, their long standing experience in structuring and updating courses in maintaining their academic standards at the levels which prevail internationally and their vitality in responding to fresh challenges, are available for the benefit of their younger sister institutions.  This assistance generously given in a spirit of mutual co-operation and not, may I stress, out of any desire to eclipse or submerge can help to establish more firmly the national and international standing and reputation of new institutions providing degree level courses.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary to stress that the standing and quality of the academic product in an institution of higher education form the best defence of its identity and that this standing and quality must be established, reinforced and developed if that institution is to win and retain its place in the sun.  In this connection I stated in the House on 18th February last, when I said that there was no need for me to defend the universities against certain allegations that had been made against them in relation to what has been hitherto the non-university section, and I quote from Volume 288, column 363.</P>
    <P>The universities over the past year have shown new eagerness to play a creative and constructive role in the context of the Government's decisions in relation to degree level courses in institutions which have hitherto been outside the university area of validation.  This change is to be welcomed because, and I feel confident that the universities would agree with me in this, for the universities to continue to remain in isolation from the rest of the system of higher education would be damaging to the system as a whole and indeed to the universities themselves.</P>
    <P>In this regard, let me put on the record of the House some of the forward movement that has taken place.  I briefly refer to the achievement announced by me in Wexford at the INTO Congress of 1973 of the <Col N="319" /> initiation of steps towards the award of a university degree to our colleges of education for primary teachers.  It was not the policy of the previous Administration to have university validation of the degrees of our primary teachers.  If there was no annulling motion before this House when this new degree was going through the brouhaha which has arisen in regard to this particular matter perhaps would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the universities for their co-operation with me as Minister for Education in the National Coalition Government in regard to that matter.  I want to tell the House that this is all of a pattern and you cannot take some parts of it and reject others. Earlier this year the Senate of the National University of Ireland accepted the recommendations of a committee of registrars appointed by the Senate in July, 1975, to consider the acceptance of students from regional technical colleges into colleges of the university.  Let me say that the degree of publicity given to this institute would seem to put into the background the other important institutions of higher education which have been set up&mdash;I will concede, it is evident&mdash;by the previous Administration.  These are also important and because of their importance I am putting this on the record of the House.  They are entitled Guidelines for the Acceptance of Students from Regional Technical Colleges and Colleges of Technology into Constituent or Recognised Colleges of the University.  The net point is that applicants who have obtained an RTC certificate may be considered for exemption from the courses and examinations in the certificate subjects in a first university year and applicants who have received and obtained an RTC diploma may be considered for exemption from the courses of examinations in diploma subjects in first and second university years.</P>
    <P>Do the Opposition suggest to me that if the Government had not taken their decisions in regard to higher education that this degree of co-operation would be forthcoming from <Col N="320" /> the universities with their structured binary approach?  I assert confidently that this would not have obtained. The previous Administration, because of their policy, would not have obtained that degree of forward movement.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to the end of 1974 for a moment and see what people were saying then in regard to these matters.  I quote briefly from <i>The Education Times</i> of the 26th December, 1974, from Dr. Edward Walsh, the director of the NIHE.  He says:</P>
    <P>Regarding the Government proposals in general their stated basic objectives must be welcomed.  In replacing the binary system with a comprehensive one designed to stimulate free flow between the two sectors an effort is being made to bridge one of the many barriers which sub-divided our community. In a country where for so long our education system has grouped our students according to sex, religion and social background ... and so on.  These proposals have been attacked for the lack of detail and precision.  In fact, it can be argued that this is their strength.</P>
    <P>I would like to put again on the record of the House a quotation from W. G. Scaife from <i>The Education Times</i> of October, 23rd, 1975, referring to the proposed link between a Dublin university and the colleges of technology, another forward movement under this Government which is conveniently forgotten by those who create all the fracas.  The quotation is as follows:</P>
    <P>A great deal of the comment was adverse and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is in regard to our decisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;once again this was not unexpected, because the Universities have had to reject so many proposals in the past.  Such reflex response was not adequate, however, because this set of proposals contains a novel ingredient&mdash;a proposal for a University-NIHE link.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to attend to this next sentence:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> There is no simple precedent for this and the consequent lack of rigid constraints makes it a potentially very fertile area for development. Doctrinaire judgements on the matter have been shallow and have failed to grasp the possibilities presented.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more.  I could not have expressed my own sentiments in regard to the cacophony of ignorance which has burst on the educational scene in regard to these decisions of ours better than it has been done in the quotation I have given.</P>
    <P>This new departure in higher education which is so full of potential for development can only be welcomed, I suggest.  Put briefly, it means that university values at their best are penetrating into new institutions while these new institutions are, in turn, exerting the valuable influence of their own ethos and emphasis on the universities. May I remind <i>The Irish Times</i> that it is by no means a matter of submerging the identity of one in the other; it is rather a very desirable two-way exercise of beneficial influence, a fruitful combination of high quality academic endeavour with activity which is work-oriented and industrially relevant.</P>
    <P>I have already put on the record of the House, and I shall do so again because it neatly describes our higher education policy, the quotation from the OECD document Current Education: Trends and Issues.  I quote:</P>
    <P>As far as the relationship between the non-traditional and the traditional sectors of education is concerned Governments have so far responded in one of three ways:</P>
    <P>(1) By creating what in the United Kingdom has been called a &ldquo;binary system&rdquo;, treating the traditional and non-traditional sectors as separate entities</P>
    <P>(2) By regarding post secondary education as a totality and creating an integrated but diversified system embodying all its institutional manifestations and co-ordinating them as much as possible; and</P>
    <P>(3) By treating the two sectors as <Col N="322" /> interdependent, for example, Norway, emphasising the development of a new network of regional colleges and a partial reform of universities, with close links between the two.</P>
    <P>It is something that is easily forgotten that I have restructured on behalf of the National Coalition Government the machinery for supervision.  In fact, Dr. Walsh in the article to which I have just referred praised this as a new element in the situation.  I do not want to labour that except to say that the new functions given to the NCEA will in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority in my judgment form one of the best machineries in Europe for the proper superintending of the development of higher education.</P>

      <P>The making of Statute CLXXVIII by the NUI establishing, as it does, new primary degrees by the National University is clear, positive proof of the constructive approach of the universities in relation to non-university institutions.  I doubt if Deputy Wilson, in proposing the motion which he has proposed, fully appreciated its implications.  Does he, as spokesman on education for Fianna Fáil, wish to turn the clock back?  Is he unaware of the changes that have been taking place and which I have just mentioned?  Or, is it one more sorry example of his commitment on behalf of his party to a rigid binary system of higher education?</P>

May I say in regard to this matter that I shall not allow Fianna Fáil to steal my clothes.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;towards the regional technical colleges or towards the NIHE.  I am not prepared to concede to them that the measure of progress we have achieved in opening up the universities, as I have said, would have been achieved if their binary policies had been pursued.  They would not have succeeded in convincing the Senate of NUI to accept certificates and diplomas of our higher technical colleges for the one- and two-year recognition, as I have said. To return to the NIHE, it has been said that if in the case of degree courses being provided there, there had been some other validating body such as the NCEA, the result would have been different.  I want to stress this point: it has also been alleged from time to time that what has been termed conventional or traditional universities lack expertise to deal with courses provided in the non-university institutions.  I have already quoted from Deputy Faulkner earlier in this debate.  It has been suggested that the NCEA should be allowed to award degrees to this year's students and there has been more than a suggestion that with the NCEA validating the degree level courses and making the awards no problem would have arisen in relation to classified degrees.  Is it to be inferred from this that less exacting standards would have been expected from the NIHE by the NCEA?  May I also say that the fact that but one of five degree programmes begun in 1972 had been submitted by the NIHE to the NCEA by July, 1974, would not appear to indicate a burning desire on the part of the NIHE for validation of its programmes by the NCEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the assumptions behind all this talk about the NCEA. The attitude of Fianna Fáil and, as I have just said, their assumption that NIHE problems would disappear if I would allow the NCEA to award <Col N="324" /> degrees, carries the implication that they have a contemptuous attitude to the NCEA.  Does anybody think that an undifferentiated degree from the NCEA would be more acceptable than an undifferentiated degree from the NUI?  Or is it suggested that the NCEA has a view of standards which would allow them to place the threshold at a point lower than the university? I have information before me which would indicate that the assumptions implicit in this attitude have no foundation.</P>
    <P>If time permitted I would go on to deal with other matters that are causing concern such as the question of honours degrees.  Time does not permit.  I say to Fianna Fáil that their policy in trying to pull the kingpin from the Government's higher education policy will not succeed.  The NCEA will not be the validating body for the degrees of the students who are to graduate from Limerick this year.  The logical conclusion from these statements is that the source of the degrees, as I have said publicly on a number of occasions, is the NUI.</P>

I do not want anybody to misunderstand the situation.  I must, therefore, ask the House to reject this motion by Fianna Fáil, a motion which is graceless in the extreme in attempting to disallow the setting up of two new degrees in the National University, the degrees of Bachelor of Technology and Bachelor of Commercial Studies.  I ask the House to reject this motion.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have five minutes when I finish.  I was rather amazed to hear the Minister state in his concluding remarks that he regretted he had not the time to deal with such important aspects of this matter as the honours degree when, in fact, he spent most of his speech quoting from letters to newspapers and from various other irrelevant items, including his own speeches.  In a situation such as this the Minister should have confined himself to discussing the important aspects of this matter which are causing such concern not only to the people of Limerick because the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick is not simply a Limerick matter.  It is a matter for the whole country.  I regret the attitude which the Minister adopted in the course of this debate.  I had to say this on a previous occasion as well.  He began by saying that he did not propose to follow what he called the outburst by the Fianna Fáil spokesman and he then proceeded to use very emotive language in which he impugned the motives of Fianna Fáil in relation to this amendment. I should like to point out to the Minister that the policy on which we are speaking is the policy we followed when we were in office.  The only difference it that when I was Minister for Education I was responsible to the Taoiseach only and not to any other Minister or any sub-committee of the Cabinet in relation to education matters and I made my own decisions.  The Minister quoted from a letter to the NCEA which was written by me when I was Minister. To be frank about it, I am rather surprised that he should have quoted from that letter because the significant words in that letter are &ldquo;which you will award&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood. The Minister then stated that no degree course was submitted until July, 1974.  Had I continued as Minister I would have seen to it that these courses were submitted.  I find it rather significant, as Deputy <Col N="326" /> O'Malley did, that we have had so few speakers from the opposite benches.  I would have thought that the Minister for the Gaeltacht in particular, who has been known to disapprove, at least from his statements in Limerick, of what has been done in relation to the NIHE, has not come into the House and spoken on this motion.  There is a precedent for this because the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke on previous motions in relation to the same matter.  In the previous debate on this subject the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke.  He now appears to be the spokesman for this sub-committee on higher education. It would appear to me that this sub-committee has to all intents and purposes taken over this particular sphere of education from the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of a previous debate on this subject the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that the changeover from a binary system to a single system should be done in a humane way.  I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he regards the present situation and the present effort to impose a particular situation on the students in the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick is doing it in a humane way.  These students who have finished a four-year course in the institute are under very severe nervous strain in not knowing what is to become of them. They have objected strenuously to the action taken by the Minister for Education at the direction of the Cabinet sub-committee in attempting to impose a system on them which they reject.  The students have the support and backing of the staff of the institute in their attitude towards the particular system which is being imposed on them.  Let me further remind the House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is on record as saying that if you want instant action you have to wield the big stick but if you want democratic and humane action you have to be patient.  I assume that the type of action which he would have <Col N="327" /> preferred was humane action.  The action of the Minister for Education and his colleagues belies the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  No patience was shown in this matter but rather is force of an unqualified nature being used to impose a system on the National Institute for Higher Education which the staff, the students and this party, which represents 50 per cent of the electorate, know to be wrong and which we in the Fianna Fáil Party know will destroy the purpose for which the institute was founded.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce had much to say in relation to the binary system and so had the Minister for Education.  They claimed that we supported such a system.  In fact, it is true to say that most of their speeches on the previous occasion were taken up with charges and taunts in relation to the binary system.  I pointed out to them that our record in the development of comprehensive education is second to none.  We were satisfied at second level that this type of education could be made available in secondary schools, vocational schools, comprehensive schools or in community schools so long as they were large enough to provide the necessary courses to cater for the aptitudes and the abilities of the pupils.  We made it clear that our aim was to provide equality of educational opportunity for all.  The various steps we took over the years, including the introduction of free education, brought this aim closer to realisation.  This was all done with no small effort on our part as could be seen from the community schools saga.  Why then should we come to a sudden stop and reverse the policy in relation to higher education as the two Ministers implied in their contributions?  The people can be assured that our objective was, and will continue to be, to ensure equality of educational opportunity for all our children at third level just as it was at second level.  We had charted a course towards achieving this objective, a course which was humane and reasonable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> I again refer to the many references by Ministers, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to the word &ldquo;humane&rdquo; and compare it to the action taken by the Government in regard to Limerick.  Our approach was not only reasonable and humane, it was educationally sound and based on long hours of consultation with all the interests involved.  It is ironic to note that one of the prime articles in the now forgotten Coalition 14-point plan was the promise of consultation with all levels in the educational field.  I wonder where this consultation has now gone.  The Minister for Education and the Minister for Industry and Commerce praised the new found plan for the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick on the grounds that it would add to the stature of that institute and give it an esteem which it could not otherwise achieve.  The exact opposite is true.  This institute has been downgraded by forcing it to accept degrees from an unwilling university and there was no doubt that Cork University was unwilling in the first instance to take any hand, act or part in the awarding of degrees in the institute. It was only after considerable and forceful persuasion that it agreed to do so.  The Minister for Education in the last debate accused me of denigrating university education.  Of course, I did nothing of the kind.  I simply pointed out that I believed the universities had not got the expertise to deal with courses in the NIHE, and this, to an extent, was borne out by the fact that Cork University was unwilling in the first instance to be involved.  I also feared that the involvement of the university would in the long term force the institute into a strait-jacket and this would have the effect of defeating the objective for which the institute was set up.</P>
    <P>I pointed out on a previous occasion that the universities have a profound effect on what is taught in our schools at all levels, far outweighing the proportion of the population who attend universities.  If we ask ourselves why particular subjects are taught in our primary and post-primary schools the answer often is that these are subjects <Col N="329" /> recognised for admission to the university. This was true even at a time when only a tiny proportion of our people attended university.  I, therefore, feel that I have good grounds for believing that the university would ultimately succeed in imposing its own image on the institute.  This, I want to stress again, is not to denigrate university education.  The university has its function and it has fulfilled that function adequately and well, but it is not the same function nor has it the same basic objectives as the national institute. For that reason I am concerned about this involvement with the university.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that I am not expressing these views for the first time.  This was my view when I was Minister for Education.  When I became Minister I was approached by the university committee for Limerick who had as their objective the establishment of a university there.  My predecessor had rejected this.  When I assumed office I studied the whole matter very carefully.  I met the committee and listened to what they had to say.  I sought advice on the matter from many quarters and, having given long and careful consideration to the whole matter, I also rejected the idea of establishing a university there.  I was convinced we had sufficient universities and that to establish what would in effect be another Cork or Galway would not supply a need which was becoming more and more obvious with the rapid industrial expansion which had taken place under Fianna Fáil in the sixties.  More important still, perhaps, I recognised the need for an Institute of Higher Education which would, of itself, help to achieve what I regarded as vital to our future and that was a proper balance between academic and technical education at all levels, particularly at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>I was convinced that an institute such as this, having achieved success in its own field, would give the esteem necessary to convince our people that technical education was on a par with secondary or academic education and <Col N="330" /> that it was no longer the poor relation to be tried only if the child was not considered fit for secondary academic education.  If we could achieve this balance, we would not only advance the economic development of the country, but we would also be assured that the aptitudes and abilities of our young people would be developed to their best potential.  It is accepted that more children can develop through the hand and eye subjects than can develop through the ordinary academic subjects. It was this reasoning which caused me to push ahead with the community schools in areas where there were three small post-primary schools in need of replacement or repair because I was convinced that in such schools sufficient courses could be provided to cater for the various abilities of the students.</P>
    <P>If I could briefly make this point: our educational system at the post-primary level was lopsided because of historical reasons.  We had a ratio of over two to one attending secondary schools as compared with vocational schools.  I found through visits I paid to developed countries in Europe, through discussions at international level and educational books and periodicals from other countries that the ratio there was the opposite, that is, two to one in favour of technical education.  In a country such as ours which needed to develop industrially so as to supply more jobs for our people, it was, in my view, essential that we should endeavour to rectify this imbalance.  It was possible to do this both by extending the facilities and the courses in the secondary schools and by further development on the technical side.</P>
    <P>It was obvious to me that as long as we had only the group certificate course of two years' duration or the intermediate course of three years' duration in the vocational schools, that parents, at that time benefiting from free education, would tend to send their children to the secondary schools, irrespective of their potential. This did happen.  To achieve a greater esteem for vocational and technical education we made the leaving certificate available in vocational schools. <Col N="331" /> We established regional technical colleges for the purpose of providing third-level education on the technical side.  To show young people that they could reach the top in this field, we established the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick, and we proposed to site a similar institute in Dublin.  This had the desired effect. In my last year in office I noticed that of the extra pupils who came into the post-primary area, half went to the secondary and half to the technical schools.  I am grateful to both the secondary and vocational schools who co-operated with a will in this matter.  A large number of pupils from secondary and vocational schools are now attending regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make again is that the growth of technical and technological education in this country is relatively new.  When one compares it with the period of growth of secondary education and university education, it is very new indeed.  Therefore it is only common sense to recognise that if we are to attempt to bring third-level education on the technical and the technological side and the traditional university education together by force at this stage, we are in grave danger of destroying what was built up with patience and care over a number of years on the technical side.  Technical education here has developed rapidly.  It is a sturdy plant but it has not yet the capacity to overcome the pressures of long tradition which will invariably result from the proposals of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I did not think I would ever have to say this in this House, but I feel sorry for the Minister because I feel that, in his heart, he agrees with what I am saying.  It is a fact that he continued to build on well-established foundations for quite a while after he took office.  It was only after the triumvirate of university lecturers took over with their pseudo-liberalism that he was forced to change course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>He should have the <Col N="332" /> courage to resist the peculiar approach of these Ministers of whom I had an expert knowledge, having dealt with them for over three years while I was Minister for Education and they were in opposition.</P>
      <P>The universities have changed considerably over recent years.  While holding fast to their autonomy, which is only right, they have begun to recognise that education for education's sake is excellent but, at the same time, that their students have also to find jobs when they leave university, and these students should, hopefully, contribute to the national economy.  In this sense the universities are moving towards the objectives set for the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.</P>
      <P>Equally by degrees I feel the NIHE would gradually move towards the universities and, ultimately in the rapidly changing world in which we live, much more quickly than one might expect, the two systems would fuse and we would have a natural coming together of the two educational streams.  This unity would be acceptable to all.  It would be very much preferable to the forced marriage which the Minister and his colleagues seek to impose, which is unacceptable to the students, to the staff of the national institute in Limerick and, as far as I know, to the people of Limerick.</P>
      <P>The students and the staff fear the downgrading of the institute and the downgrading of the degrees which it is proposed to award and, I believe, rightly so.  That is no reflection on Cork University.  It is no secret that the university had to take certain steps to include these students, which I doubt they would have taken in relation to any of their own students. If the NCEA had awarded degrees, these steps would not have been necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I set up the NCEA on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis pending the introduction of legislation to set it up on a permanent basis.  This was necessary because I recognised the need for such a body. I saw the urgency of the matter and, rather than wait to bring it before the <Col N="333" /> Oireachtas, I went ahead with its introduction on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The NCEA were established in 1972.  In the same year the first students entered the institute.  The students who were enrolled in the five major study areas were aware that a body was being set up, or had been set up, which would deal specifically with them and which would have power to award certificates, diplomas and degrees&mdash;I stress the word &ldquo;degrees&rdquo;.  With this in mind we ensured that the members of the council would be people of eminence in the fields of education, both at secondary and third levels, from the non-university and university sectors as well as people with wide experience in industry, commerce and public administration. Among them were seven professors in Irish universities.  The members were selected with care.  I had no doubt but that that council, in consultation with the boards and faculties of other colleges at home and abroad, at both university and non-university third level, would be highly competent to vet the courses pursued and to award degrees.</P>
    <P>When the Minister took office he dissolved the NCEA, changed his mind and restored it.  There are new personnel there now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not dissolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for the present body but I have no doubt it is an excellent body.  The function of the NCEA would ensure that the objectives of the Institute of Higher Education were always kept in mind, the function being to promote, to encourage, to co-ordinate and develop the technical, industrial, commercial, technological and scientific education and, in association with them, liberal education, and to award certificates, diplomas and degrees for courses pursued at recognised third-level other than university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had considerable discussion and consultation during my time of office with the universities and their staffs, and I have the greatest respect for them and for the fine contribution they have made and are making to <Col N="334" /> Irish life, but it is ridiculous to suggest that a degree conferred by a university is of itself exceptional. What makes the degree worthwhile is the person on whom it is conferred. If he proves himself, then the degree will help him along the road.  I am convinced that the National Institute for Higher Education is being denied the right to prove itself, a right which the students entering that institute in 1972 believed to be theirs.  The qualification which the NCEA would have awarded would have to make its mark in the world of industry, commerce, business management and so on and if it succeeded in doing that, then the name of the institute was made. If it failed, then the board of the institute in co-operation with the staff and students with external assistance would have to take an objective look at itself to eradicate the flaws.  The institute is not now to be afforded this opportunity by the Minister.  The students attending the institute are being forced to accept what they regard as second-rate degrees.  I am not calling them second-rate degrees but only saying they are regarded as such by the students.  They begin life after receiving these degrees with a lack of confidence in themselves which can easily result in seriously downgrading the NIHE in Limerick, as well as damaging their own prospects.</P>
    <P>In the National Institute for Higher Education we had got an institute of third-level education which had an opportunity never before afforded to a non-university third-level institution in Ireland to develop in a way of its own, free from the restrictions which traditions and usage place on a university.  As I said earlier, it would have got this opportunity had we been in office of achieving an eminence such as that achieved by many non-university third-level institutes in the world.  This is not to be, because the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues who spoke so loudly and so long about consultation in their early days of office, have now reached a stage where consultation to them is a dirty word and they proceed to force on an unwilling NIHE in Limerick the qualifications granted by an unwilling <Col N="335" /> university in Cork and they expect to make progress in Irish education by using such methods.  There cannot be a proper and fulfilling integration of the true strands of third-level education by these methods.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, the universities are changing with the times, and the bleak prospects facing graduates in certain fields will result in a more rapid change.  The NIHE, while maintaining its objectives, would, if it were allowed to grow naturally, also change with the needs of the times, and the differences between university and non-university education would, for all practical purposes, disappear and this way we would achieve a true comprehensive education.</P>
    <P>There are many non-university third level education institutes in the world which have achieved a very high standard and the people of the countries in which these institutes are, including the staff and the students of these institutes, have a very high regard for the qualifications which emerged from these institutes. I am just wondering what the institutes in Holland and in Massachusetts would think if it were to be suggested to them that they had a lower standard than the universities.</P>

      <P>The vote must be at half past eight.  I thought coming in here tonight that we might have had a reasonable discussion, that the Minister might debate this, as befits the university graduate about whom he spoke so much, with balance, that he would speak with temperance, that he would weigh the arguments.  Instead of that he blew himself up like a harvest frog.  He lectured us.  He quoted himself over and over again. It was said of Narcissus that he spent a long period of his life admiring his reflection in a pool of water.  It is not written of him that he had quoted himself, but it is written of him that finally, through admiring himself too long, he fell on top of his head into the pool.  The Minister is in grave danger of the fate of Narcissus.</P>
      <P>The Napoleon of Marlborough Street lectured us about the various duties of students but he did not face up to the arguments I made here last night about technological education. I went to some trouble here to attack the basic thesis of the Government, particularly as given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, in satellite fashion, the Minister for Education, namely, that non-university education was in some way inferior and that consequently Fianna Fáil were tying themselves to an inferior system which obtained only in tottering Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went right around the world and pointed out to this House that in the Soviet Union there was a large and competent non-university third-level education, for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce expressed admiration, that there was a large and competent third-level non-university sector, including the very important sector of engineering, and that there was a system in Germany whereby this engineer qualification, which was not a university degree, gave an opportunity for vertical mobility <Col N="338" /> within that profession.  This was not the education of a tottering economy which the Minister for Industry and Commerce said adhered to the binary system and only to the binary system.</P>
    <P>I switched to Japan, and not even the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make a debating point in this House, could claim there is anything wrong with the technology in Japan.  I pointed out that there was a heavy non-university sector in the Japanese educational system which was highly successful.</P>
    <P>I went to the EEC countries, Germany, France and Holland, and I pointed out the same thing.  The Minister did not face up to the argument here tonight.  He skipped it, as I say.  Narcissus-like, he admired himself in the pools of his own eloquence, kept quoting himself all the time, getting angry, lecturing everybody, but not being constructive in any one way. The Minister indicated to the House that somehow or other we would accept lower standards.  In every statement that I made in this House I said that the most important single thing with regard to the institute in Limerick was to see to it that the standards were very high and highly regarded both nationally and internationally, and that there was no <i>raison d'être</i> for the National Institute of Higher Education if we did not insist on that kind of standard.  I pointed out to him that by maintaining this very high standard by evolution Limerick could do what the cats did.  He seemed to despise on another occasion in this House the University of Strathclyde which was consulted in this matter, if I am not mistaken, by the National University of Ireland. The Technological Institute in Glasgow evolved into the University of Strathclyde.  So did about eight or nine other institutes in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>We, who are making a plea all the time for evolution, for a chance to evolve, are talking about a four-year-old institution.  Why the hurry?  Why the rush?  Why bring in the university on top of them immediately? The policy has no basis in logic, commonsense, sense of history or anything else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> The Minister told us that the National Institute for Higher Education did not apply to the NCEA for recognition of courses.  Why?  Whose responsibility was it?  Upon whom does the responsibility lie that students spend four years in that institute following a course which is deemed not to be an adequate course for them?  It is a criminal lack on somebody's part.</P>
    <P>I remember seeing a play in one of the group theatres in O'Connell Street after the war.  The theme of the play was &ldquo;Where does the responsibility lie?&rdquo; Where does it lie for this, that in one of our institutes on which a good deal of public money was spent, nobody saw to it that the courses were adequate to deal with the situation?  What is the use in saying &ldquo;We are advocating giving them a degree&rdquo; where the degree is not earned?  We advocate no such thing, but there is responsibility on someone to see that the courses of these unfortunate students are adequate.  They deserve that from the Minister and his Department, and from the director if the director is responsible on the <i>ad hoc</i> committee running the institute or the new governing body, but there was responsibility somewhere.  The students were the sufferers and nobody can gainsay that.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what was said by a number of speakers here that the National University of Ireland bears no blame in this matter.  The National University of Ireland had nothing to do with this scene until Friday, 13th December, 1974, when the Cabinet met and made certain decisions and the Minister for Education announced those decisions on Monday, 16th December, 1974.  The National University of Ireland simply applied standards when it was forced to do so by Government decisions.  I repeat part of what I said last night.  The distinction as between diploma approval and degree approval is not clear-cut in that for the purpose of degrees university approval of courses would have to extend to prerequisites.  Prerequisite means first year, certificate year, diploma year, the three years <Col N="340" /> that precede final degree year in the institutes for the prerequisites for the final year courses, and so there would be duplicate assessment and approval of diploma level courses involved.</P>
    <P>We had in the centre a sanctimonious address to the students about their responsibility.  I spent some time at third level institutes&mdash; separate ones.  My experience is that the students are responsible and anxious to achieve standards that are internationally recognised.  I do not think the students of Limerick are looking for anything they will not have earned by serious application to their studies.  I resent the Minister for Education more or less implying that in the speech he made this evening. If the standards were found lacking by people who are assessing, the responsibility does not lie with the students.  It lies on the Department of Education, on the Minister for Education or on the director and the people who are running the institute in Limerick.  Do not let us have this sanctimonious preaching at students that we had from the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>There is no point in saying that Fianna Fáil on this side of the House disregard the regional technical colleges.  We hope they will be built into the system and that students will be able to transfer.  I do not know how much work the Minister has done as yet to transfer the national institute.  I hope that in certain instances they will be able to remain <i>in situ</i> and finish four-year courses in certain exceptional circumstances, that they will be able to remain in their regional technical college and do four-year courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not turning the clock back. We are looking forward to the end of the century.  The whole structuring that Deputy Faulkner talked about was aimed at the end of this century, <Col N="341" /> not around the corner, not having a worm's-eye view of the thing.  We were looking forward, and we need to in this field.  If there is one basic principle upon which we all seem to agree&mdash;I agree in full with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who did the front running in this technological business&mdash;it is that it is more than important to develop our technological side.  I do not think we are doing it by what the Minister is asking us to do here.</P>
    <P>I do not see the Minister for the Gaeltacht here, who was bursting blood vessels for the last six or seven years with his concern for Limerick. Where is he?  Why cannot we get him?  The Mayor of Limerick called on him to act in the interests of this institute but&mdash;silence, silence, silence.</P>

      <P>Another point I resent is that it was indicated that this side of the House would expect the National Council for Educational Awards to accept lower standards than would the universities.  I deny that, and wish to put on record the great admiration I have for the expertise of the NCEA.  The NCEA was <Col N="342" /> so structured that it could take experts from Japan, the US, the UK, anywhere on the Continent, and use them to lay down the standards to structure courses in such a way that we would have graduates from these institutes of which we could be proud.</P>
      <P>I am asking the House to disallow this statute because I believe it was misconceived.  The Government bungled this whole business.  I talked to students on a number of occasions over the last few days and they expressed the view that a reasonable approach would probably get through to the Minister, and to the Members of the Labour Party.  These students felt that their concern was uppermost in the minds of those people.  I am disappointed with the Minister, but I have hope of some support from the Members of the Labour Party, particularly those who have shown an interest in this matter in this House&mdash; Deputy Coughlan and other Deputies, mentioned by Deputy O'Kennedy, from County Tipperary.  I have some hope that they will follow us into the Division Lobby and support us in disallowing this statute.  I ask the House to disallow Statute 178.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to reply to Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Roscommon County Council submitted detailed proposals for the augmentation of the Ballinlough/ Cloonfad public water supply system to my Department by the development of Cloonmagunaun springs.  It is not possible to say as yet when a decision regarding the scheme will issue to the local authority.</P>
      <P>The need for the augmentation work arises because the demand has increased and because tests carried out by the council last summer showed the yield from the existing source was less than originally estimated.  Accordingly the council have decided that they cannot put water into feeder mains laid by them or give a supply to further group schemes from the Ballinlough/ Cloonfad system for the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  The position is that about 12 months ago I approved the relay on the local cable system of programmes produced by the Ballyfermot Community Association subject to certain conditions. There has been no change in those conditions.  Some time ago the association in common with a number of other community associations asked for permission to have their programmes relayed over a large area of Dublin city and suburbs and that the venture be financed by commercial advertising.  I was not prepared to agree to this pending detailed conconsideration of its implications for the future of community television, which I was the first to encourage, and for Irish public service broadcasting. On hearing this, the cable company who had been providing production facilities for Ballyfermot Community Association announced that they were not prepared to continue to do so as from the end of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department pointed out to the firm in question that the notice given for cessation of production facilities&mdash;a little more than a month&mdash;was far too short to enable the question of alternative methods of servicing community television to be explored.  The company have now intimated that they are prepared <Col N="247" /> to continue to service community television but only on a modified and considerably less costly basis. I understand that a meeting between the interests concerned is being held on 30th April.  I hope that these discussions will result in an acceptable solution.</P>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 52, 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>I do not propose at present to allow open cable television if by that phrase the Deputy means permitting the wide distribution over cable networks of programmes produced by local community associations for their local areas.</P>
      <P>No editorial rights have been conferred on ITV and BBC in this State. Licensed cable television operators are, of course, permitted to relay all television services which are available off air in the area they are serving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community television is still at the experimental stage.  The present approved arrangements were settled on the basis that community programmes would be confined to programmes <Col N="248" /> originated locally and acquired material of an educational and informational character only.  The associations are required to comply with the same standards as regards objectivity and impartiality as RTE.</P>
    <P>I hope to set up a study group soon to consider what research would be desirable in the field of community television, who should undertake such research and how it might be financed. The composition of the group has not been decided yet.  I cannot say at this stage when a report can be expected. The Department had already carried out a certain amount of research, particularly in regard to developments in community television elsewhere.  After it received the views of a number of community associations it consulted the Departments of Education and Local Government and the Dublin Corporation on the matter.  Consideration of their replies indicated the desirability of setting up a special study group of the kind referred to above. Because of the recent request by the community associations for a radical change in the existing arrangements, I have decided to set up the study group and to ask them to report at an early date.</P>
