    <P>I wish to explain briefly to the House the reasons for this motion and to say something of the background to it which has brought about its necessity.  We have not had a time allocation motion or a curtailment by the Government of the time allotted to business of the House since about this time last year.  Nor has there been any need for such a curtailment. In the ordinary way, as the House knows, business is disposed of regularly and expenditiously enough in the absence of some kind of confrontation. <Col N="1607" /> We have not had any confrontation in this regard in recent times and, consequently, this is the first time that a motion of this nature has been moved since early in July last.</P>
    <P>The reason for the motion being moved lies in the nature of the Bill itself and in the inability of the Opposition to agree to a time within which the debate on the Bill would conclude.  Through informal talks with the Opposition Whips I understood first that the Bill might not take very long and I had hoped that when it reached the Dáil eventually it would be part only of a normal day's business and that other work also could be undertaken.  I took that to mean that the Bill would be agreed in principal by the Opposition but when it was circulated yesterday they considered it and concluded that they would have to oppose it.  When I heard that sometime in the middle of yesterday afternoon I went to the Opposition and suggested that we might agree a time limit within which the debate would end.  I could not get agreement from them but, then, I very seldom get agreement along these lines.  I suppose they do not wish to tie themselves in regard to time but the House will understand that for whatever reason Fianna Fáil's inability to agree to a time limit leaves the Government in an awkward situation&mdash;either they go ahead not knowing when they will have the Bill they have promoted or they introduce a motion of this kind, the latter being a disagreeable alternative.</P>
    <P>In this instance the Government are well-known to have made their minds up in regard to the necessity for this Bill.  The necessity for its passage in a short time is evident.  I hope that somebody else will explain to the House why the Bill would be no use or why at least its utility would be very much less if it were debated with intervals between the Stages in the way that is usual.  The necessity for the Bill lies in the nature of the dispute concerned.  If the Bill were to be debated in an open-ended way, with the usual week between Second and <Col N="1608" /> Committee Stages, it would be of no use.  Therefore, we had no alternative but to limit the time for discussion of it.  I regret that we have moved into this posture so suddenly after a period of fairly co-operative and civilised relations. However, since we are in this posture the Government consider they have a duty in the national interest to ensure that the Bill is law by the weekend.  That means that it must pass through this House today and through the Seanad tomorrow.  Consequently, we are left with no alternative but to ask the House to approve this time allocation motion.</P>
    <P>Before saying anything about the times mentioned in the motion, I might mention that yesterday evening, having told the Opposition we were obliged to introduce this time allocation motion and that we would extend the time of the ordinary Thursday sitting by five-and-a-half hours so as to minimise complaints that the Bill was being rushed, I inquired about the situation in a regard to pairs and was told that the position which is being asserted now by the Opposition&mdash;whether it has existed in the past, I have not enough experience to say, is to refuse official pairs applied for and to dishonour ones already promised.  The Government were in the situation yesterday evening that several Deputies, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and other Deputies were either abroad or on their way abroad on public business of importance.  I want to emphasise that there was only one absentee from the Dáil yesterday, absent for a personal reason and the Opposition had very generously promised to pair him. But only one of the Deputies on this side of the House was absent for an unofficial reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point, Sir, because I know you do not like discussions on pairing in the House but I must point out the difficulty the Government are in when they find that legislation is essential, and is urgently essential, when arrangements on which they had previously relied&mdash;and had every reason to rely on&mdash;are now being disregarded and dishonoured.</P>
      <P>The national interest is in danger, too, as is perfectly evident.  If the Government were to acquiesce in this new tradition now being asserted, it would be the case that the judge of the national interest from now on would be not the Government elected for this job but the Opposition.  We could not and will not asquiesce in that arrangement whatever the difficulties may be for us if it were going to go ahead.  But I hope it will be understood that, in this moment of acute national difficulty, the Government, after lengthy and mature consideration, have decided that this Bill is the appropriate way to deal with it. We are being impeded by this obstacle, gratutiously and spitefully thrown in our path.  Nobody expects the Opposition to accept legislation they do not like but to leave us in a situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say something brief about the times mentioned in the motion.  The Dáil, if the motion is passed, will sit until 10.30 p.m. this evening, which is 5½ hours longer than its usual Thursday sitting.  I did not consult the Opposition on this because I felt that once the pairing arrangements had broken down, we were for the moment, at arms length.  But I took it that the opposition was based on the principle of the Bill and so I gave the greater part of the day for Second Stage and a smaller part of the day for Committee Stage.  Even now we will willingly change those hours if the Opposition would prefer more time to be given to Committee Stage and less to Second Stage.  The Report Stage, I hope, will not be regarded as ungenerous with an hour.</P>
      <P>That, Sir, is the reason for the motion.  I am sorry that it has been necessary.  I hope that the necessity of it will be understood and that the matters I have just mentioned, which represent a mere spiteful obstacle in the Government's path of doing their job, also will be understood.</P>

      <P>A few minutes ago when I intervened on a point of order &mdash;the point of order being that the mover of the motion was irrelevant in bringing in matter that was not related at all to the subject matter of the motion&mdash;your ruling was, Sir, that &mdash;these are your exact words &ldquo;the mover of the motion is entitled to make his statement in his own fashion&rdquo;.  I take it, Sir, that that ruling applies to those who speak on the motion as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have to be, Sir, because you have created a precedent.  I want to say, first of all, that what the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1611" /> said about pairing is completely without foundation.  As I understand it, pairing is arranged between the Whips on a day to day basis.  There were no pairing arrangements made for today because today had not been reached.  Secondly, even if pairing had been made, it has been the practice of this House for as long as I can remember that, on a guillotine motion, any pairing arrangements are not on.  They are suspended for the purpose of the guillotine motion because a guillotine motion is a restriction of the rights and duties of an Opposition.</P>
      <P>Even though I could talk about the price of fish, as far as I can understand, on this motion, I shall try to be as relevant as I can.  I want to discuss it against the background, firstly, of the apparent desire of this Government to terminate this session of Dáil Éireann next week and against the background of the gross mishandling by the Government, and in particular by the two Ministers concerned, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour, of the whole range of wage increases and, in particular, the national wage negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Ever since January of this year.  I will take the first background first.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach conveyed to our Whips that it was the desire of the Government to terminate this session next week, on the 30th June, next Wednesday, in effect.  We gave the usual indication about an Adjournment debate.  Even though that has been denied to us on several occasions&mdash;let me correct myself&mdash; on a few occasions, when the Dáil adjourned at the end of a session apparently there is a threat now it is going to be denied us on this occasion as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no such statement. It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said it to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1612" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is not the point I am making.  My Chief Whip informed me that the Chief Whip of the Government indicated that, in certain circumstances, an Adjournment debate might be denied the Opposition.  That is my information and it has been borne out just now by Deputy Lalor.  So much for that, Sir.</P>
      <P>We indicated as well that, in the present state of the economy and in particular in the present state of the dispute between the Irish Bank Officials' Association and the Associated Banks, and more particularly in view of the fact that as of now we do not know whether there will be a national wage agreement or not&mdash;because the effective balloting on that will not take place until during the first week of July&mdash;in all these circumstances we indicated to the Government Chief Whip that we thought it was wrong that they should persist in their intention to adjourn the Dáil for the summer recess next week.  I fervently believe that if they do persist it will show a gross degree of irresponsibility in relation to these delicate matters and particularly in relation to the function of Parliament on such grave matters affecting the economy.  It has been the practice of this House to continue up to the end of July, if necessary.  Naturally we, like Members of the Government benches, would like to adjourn as early as possible but we do not believe in shutting down shop and, in effect, the Government running away from the problem or from the exposure that they are entitled to get in the event of the breakdown in the national pay agreement negotiations and, indeed, they are still negotiating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that this motion had to be viewed against the background of the grossly inept handling of the national pay negotiations.  The Minister for Finance in his budget said the object of the budget strategy was based on a pay pause and this was repeated the very next day by the Taoiseach.  Since then the Government have changed feet several times.  The pay pause was abandoned.  A fixed modest sum was suggested, and that was amended as <Col N="1613" /> well, with the result that very few trade unions know exactly where they stand in relation to the national pay agreement on which they will soon be balloting and neither do they know where they stand in relation to Government policy on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is just back from Geneva.  I should like to take this opportunity of publicly congratulating him on having been elected president of the recent session of the International Labour Organisation. As far as I know, the International Labour Organisation, having elected a president, also elects three vice-presidents, one representing employers, one representing trade unions and one representing the Government side.  Any one of the three, or all three in turn, could have presided over the concluding days of the International Labour Organisation session in Geneva thereby permitting the Minister for Labour to come home and, if necessary, process this legislation on a number of days last week and this week as well.  Because he chose not to come we are now faced today with a guillotine motion on a serious Bill, a Bill which was circulated only yesterday and the full implications of which could not possibly be reasonably examined either by the Government or the Opposition, even if the Government had the Bill, as they obviously had, for several days and, for that reason, we are now faced with rushing this legislation through.</P>
    <P>From my own experience I have a fear of hurried legislation.  Time and time again we have seen legislation fully processed in this House requiring amendment in the Seanad.  We have seen amendments properly moved and made in the Seanad and approved of by this House on their being referred back to us.  The whole purpose of the dual chamber is to ensure that legislation is properly examined, amended where necessary and, above all, that a reasonable time is given to a full examination of all the implications.  For all we know, there may be in this Bill constitutional problems.  I do not know and I am not suggesting there are but, for all we know, there could <Col N="1614" /> be and because of the limitation of time, it is not possible for us to get legal advice.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the subject matter of the Bill, which will be shortly before the House, but we indicated yesterday the reasons why we are opposing the Bill.  The main reason is the gross mishandling by the Government and by the Ministers concerned of the whole range of pay rise negotiations. We indicated that we opposed it because we thought it was precipitate, in other words untimely as, indeed, was the intervention of the Minister for Finance on last Thursday, so untimely that it is my belief the Government hastily got together on Friday morning in order to justify the Minister's untimely intervention by introducing this Bill.  This is a contention Government speakers can refute if it is wrong.</P>
    <P>We said also that we regarded this legislation as selective.  I want to say publicly here that we have not been given and neither do we hold any brief on behalf of the Irish Bank Officials' Association or on behalf of the associated banks.  The Irish Bank Officials' Association is a trade union but it is not affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  There have been wage settlements in the past 12 months which in a number of instances clearly breached the then existing national wage agreement.  However, the trade unions involved were members of or affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  No legislative action was taken in those cases.  I suggest, therefore, this legislation is selective for two reasons: no action was taken in respect of other trade unions whose agreements breached the national wage agreement and the Irish Bank Officials' Association does not happen to be a member of or affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in our statement that the parties involved&mdash;the Irish Bank Officials' Association, the associated banks and the Government&mdash; should take no action that would precipitate the closure of the banks and we urged all three to maintain the <i>status quo</i> so that it might be possible to come to an agreement.  We urged the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> until <Col N="1615" /> such time as we knew the outcome of the ballot on the national wage agreement which will be known on, I think, the 4th or 5th July.  I suggest that was not an unreasonable request.  The Government responded with what might be interpreted as a compromise on their position.</P>
    <P>The statement made last night has been interpreted as indicating the Government might have second thoughts on an agreement that may be come to between the banks and their officials, even if it does somewhat exceed the norm it is hoped to set by a national pay agreement.  If that is the case there is every reason why this legislation should be postponed, at least until next week and, preferably, until the outcome of the ballot on the national pay agreement is known.  As of now, we have no norm by which to establish whether or not whatever emerges, if something does emerge from the renewed talks between the bank officials and the banks, will accord to the norm.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, in this hurried piece of legislation what is in effect a pig in a poke because we do not know what this legislation will permit. The Minister will have power to implement the legislation by order and this House will have no means whatever of assessing the Minister's assessment and therefore no means of knowing whether any agreement between the banks and their officials accords to the national norm, if it does accord and, if it does not accord, whether it is reasonably acceptable. This House will have no say on that issue because the Minister alone&mdash;I suppose with the advice and approval, after consultation with his colleagues, of the Government&mdash;will act and we, in the Opposition, will be denied the opportunity of expressing our view on what I believe is one of the most serious issues facing the country.  The Dáil will have adjourned and the Bill will be on the Minister's desk ready for the signing of an order at the Minister's will and pleasure.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons we are opposing this Bill and these are the reasons we are opposing this guillotine <Col N="1616" /> motion.  It is the duty of the Opposition at any time to oppose a guillotine motion.  I cannot understand the whimpering of the Parliamentary Secretary about impediments being placed in his way, about unpleasantness arising.  The Government have created this unpleasantness, if it is there.  They delayed this Bill because the Minister for Labour, apparently, was not here.  They want to rush this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  They wanted agreement to have it finished by 5 o'clock and not having got that agreement we are now obliged to finish it by 10.30 tonight.  The Seanad will be similarly obliged to finish it by some hour tomorrow evening.</P>
    <P>This shows scant respect for Parliamentary democracy and even less respect for the rights of the Opposition in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If there have been any recriminations imported into this debate or if they will ensue in the course of the debate the blame must be laid at the feet of the Parliamentary Secretary for the incriminatory tone in which he introduced this motion and the freedom he was allowed in importing extraneous matter.  We are, therefore, opposing this guillotine motion and we will reserve our right afterwards to what extent we can ensure that today at least Parliamentary democracy will prevail.</P>

      <P>The speech of Deputy Lynch is a complete justification for the Government's time allocation motion because during the time he was speaking he made several statements which are unhelpful in the present very delicate situation in relation to incomes.  It is fair to ask why the Opposition chose this time to oppose a Bill of this nature having regard to the fact that the same Opposition have already supported the Government in two previous Bills dealing with the same group of persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but we have heard a contribution from the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party saying that the Bill was complex, that it was difficult, that it was one on which they might need some advice from Constitutional lawyers and so forth.  I want to point out that the Bill is of a kind similar to previous Bills which received the Opposition's support and that even a person of very limited education would have no difficulty whatsoever in comprehending the Bill.</P>
      <P>The need for the Bill at this time is also obvious.  On other occasions, when Bills of this nature were before the House, the overall national pay position was not as critical as it is at present.  We heard from Deputy Lynch and many others on the Opposition benches repeated contributions over the last couple of years about the need for moderation in incomes.  They have chastised the Government for what they say is a certain lack of control in this area.  They have endeavoured to blame the Government alone for considerable slippage on the incomes front and, yet, when the Government introduce a Bill of this nature, having had Opposition support on two previous occasions for similar legislation, the Opposition change their tactics entirely at the time of the most delicate and difficult incomes situation ever facing this country and certainly the most difficult one of the last three years.</P>

It is <Col N="1618" /> not possible for any person to anticipate what the outcome of that meeting will be.  However, we know that a very responsible union have said that whatever people might think about some of the provisions in the agreement it was unlikely that it would be possible to exceed the cash terms of the national pay agreement as negotiated.  The country is faced with a situation in which one group are insisting on getting very substantial increases above the cash terms.  If people who are not in as privileged and secure positions in our society were to see others using their muscles before the special delegate conference to obtain an enhancement of their incomes well above what is negotiated, it is not unlikely that whatever reason exists in our community might evaporate altogether.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, highly desirable that Oireachtas Éireann should express a sense of collective responsibility, should discharge their obligations to the community, by expressing anxiety about potential developments in the area of remuneration for bank officials.  The legislation is empowering legislation.  We can deal later on with that when we come to deal with the provisions of the Bill.  The party at whom the legislation is directed are free to continue their negotiations. We hope they will do so and that they will conform to the kind of common sense which every sensible person in this country should not only exhort others to practice but should themselves practice as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition are, no doubt, affected by the fact that public support for them appears to be dwindling at a time of considerable difficulties for the country, at a time when an Opposition might be expected to improve their position.  Perhaps that is the explanation for the change in tactics.  Perhaps that is the explanation for endeavouring to oppose this legislation and for trying to complicate the situation.  Perhaps they feel they have not been creating enough mischief and they should try to create mischief now at a time of very great difficulty.  I ask them to consider whether or not they will command <Col N="1619" /> much public respect when they display themselves at the end of the session as a party of contradiction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch spoke about the proposal to bring this session of the Dáil to a conclusion at the end of June. Opposite me I see many faces of people who have spoken to me and to many of my colleagues on this side of the House expressing their delight that at long last Dáil Éireann was going to have the good sense of bringing its summer session to a conclusion at the end of June instead of doing it at the end of July and sometimes in August in such a manner as to prohibit Members who have young families from enjoying even a few days with them during their school holidays.  Would it not be far better for the Opposition to accept that what is happening in relation to the termination of this session is something which was long desired by all Members of the House on either side and, indeed, is also desired by the hard working staff of the Oireachtas and by the press gallery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;both of whom are entitled to have some consideration given to their affairs and their families as well?  The fact that the session will terminate earlier than hitherto will mean that the Dáil will resume earlier than previously.  The real reason, I suppose, for the Dáil session extending to the end of July and into August in the past, is that the financial legislation came before the House in April and May.  Now, with the budget in January and the Finance Bill following shortly after that, there is no need to carry on the proceedings of the Dáil and the Seanad right through July in order to get the Finance Bill passed. Even that old excuse no longer exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The termination of proceedings of this session next week has, of course, nothing to do with the time allocation motion we are dealing with here.  The Government's decision in relation to the Bill is governed by the circumstances in which a necessity has arisen <Col N="1620" /> to introduce the Bill and that necessity is the fact that a large number of people will have to consider between now and 3rd July what should be their stance in relation to the proposed national agreement.  In that situation it is not asking too much of anybody that they would back the Government in this empowering legislation which need not be brought into effect if whatever is negotiated between the parties negotiating at present conforms to what other people are being asked to accept.  Clearly, we have to move now rather than move after 3rd July.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that if we did not move this legislation today and bring it through the Dáil and Seanad, no matter what happens on 3rd July the Taoiseach would receive a telegram from the Opposition asking him to reassemble the Dáil in order to discuss the extraordinary position that could arise in this area, which would not conform to what other people might be disposed to accept.  The much more sensible thing to do is to make it clear at this stage, calmly and without any bitterness, that what is appropriate for everybody in the country should be accepted by all.</P>
    <P>I noted the remarks of the leader of the Opposition which re-echoed the remarks of Deputy Colley and others in relation to my speech of last Thursday. It is an extraordinary thing when a man is accused of making an untimely intervention, of behaving like a bull in a china shop, to use the words of Deputy Colley, because he actually quotes speeches and annual statements of bank directors exhorting the country as a whole to exercise incomes moderation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is considered that was an extraordinary intervention, it seems to me that some people believe that the right way for a Government to rule is to do nothing and to say nothing, to let everything drift. On this occasion, as we have done twice before in the life-time of this Dáil, we are moving the legislation to <Col N="1621" /> prevent a very nasty situation developing. I earnestly suggest that even at this late hour the Opposition might redeem whatever is left of their tattered reputation by thinking again and by giving support to this legislation which is so important and critical. The national interest is at stake and we ought to rise above party jealousies and any personalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer we spend on this guillotine motion the less time we will have to debate the Bill and, therefore, I do not intend to delay the House very long on this matter.  I had intended to confine myself entirely to the motion before the House but in view of what has been said there are two things I want to say now.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to make it clear that in the view of this side of the House in an urgent and gravely important matter of this kind the natural desire for Deputies, staff and members of the Press Gallery to go on their summer holidays cannot take precedence over this measure before us and the implications involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister for Finance has endeavoured to suggest that this party supported two similar Bills to the one now before us and that for some obscure reason we are changing our tactics.  As will be revealed in the course of discussion of the Bill, there is no truth whatever in that allegation. This party supported consistently every effort to sustain national pay agreements.  We allowed and created the climate in which a national pay agreement could be entered into in 1970 and early 1971 in the teeth of the opposition of the Deputies opposite.  We have consistently supported national pay agreements since and we have supported this Government when, contrary to all their former protestations, they brought in measures designed, in effect, to support with the force of law existing national pay agreements in relation to bank employees.  The Bill now before the House seeks to give the Minister for Labour the power, if he makes an order under it, to impose a statutory wage freeze and nothing <Col N="1622" /> else.  That is why we are opposing the Bill and we will spell it out in detail later.</P>
    <P>The matter before the House is the guillotine motion.  I want to point out that in three years this Government have imposed the guillotine on far more measures in this House than was ever done by every Fianna Fáil Government since 1932.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>In addition to having imposed a guillotine on far more measures than any Government in the history of the State, this Government imposed a guillotine on measures that were not even introduced and circulated, of which the House did not know the contents.  It may be of some interest to note that in a discussion on the Bill relating to prices and incomes in 1970, which sought to regulate incomes, prices and other matters by statute, there was a long discussion in this House on Second Stage.  It went on for weeks and in the course of the debate the Minister for Defence criticised the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1623" /> who had spoken for five-and-a-half hours on Second Stage.  In addition, many of his colleagues now sitting on the Government benches took part in the debate at great length.  That was a matter which, to quote the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, was &ldquo;in the view of the elected Government of the day a matter of grave national importance&rdquo;.  However, the Deputies opposite chose to exercise their democratic right to speak at considerable length on it.  Was there any attempt by the Government at that time to introduce a guillotine?  There was not.</P>
      <P>This Government are repeatedly displaying their fascist interests, intentions and insticts.  Whenever there is any sign of opposition their immediate reaction is to impose a guillotine and force it through.  We had a further example of that today &mdash;we have many of them&mdash;from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  His reaction is quite unconscious in the way it comes out.  His reaction which could be heard today would suggest the Opposition were unreasonable&mdash;the idea that we were going to oppose the Bill, that we would not agree to its going through in one day.  It was very naughty of us, considering the record of those Deputies over there who time after time engaged in filibusters.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs prides himself on the number of hours he spent debating one word.  Was there a guillotine imposed by the Government of that day?</P>

So far as we are concerned, that is a disgraceful performance and we intend to record <Col N="1624" /> our abhorrence of it in the division lobbies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of holding up this debate but, in order to clear up a point, and in view of some of the remarks made, it is proper that I should make a contribution.  I want to join with the last speaker in drawing attention to the fact that it seems to be wrong for the Opposition to find any fault with the Government.  That appears to be the approach taken by the Government Whip this morning. The Parliamentary Secretary thanked the Opposition for their co-operation over the past 12 months.  This worries me because being thanked for co-operation which is plunging the country into an abyss, led by the Minister for Finance, is very doubtful praise indeed.</P>
      <P>The impression the Parliamentary Secretary gave was that he had been given the impression by the Opposition Whip that we would not be opposed to the Regulation of Banks (Remuneration and Conditions of Employment) (Temporary Provision) Bill, 1976, and that the Bill would be cleared very quickly.  I want to disabuse him of that idea.</P>
      <P>We were, as we are very regularly now, indebted to the Press and the radio for information which is issued obviously through the Government Information Service.  I tried to get the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach on Tuesday morning last with a view to finding out what the position was about the banks Bill.  Coming up to town I heard on the radio that it was being introduced later on that day, that it would be circulated on Wednesday, that it was hoped Second Stage would be cleared this week, and the final Stages dealt with next week.  I was carrying on on that information and on that understanding.  I got nothing from the Parliamentary Secretary to disabuse me of that view until yesterday when he indicated that all Stages of the Bill would be required.  Now we have a guillotine motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night after one of the votes, the Parliamentary Secretary asked me what our approach would be to pairs today. I said I could not reply to that until I knew what the Government were <Col N="1625" /> doing today.  At that stage he informed me he had been in contact with Deputy Browne and that there would be a time motion.  I said: &ldquo;If there is a time motion, you know what my reaction will be.  Pairs are off.&rdquo;  Deputy Browne reminds me there were none on.  We are working pairs on a day to day basis.  I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary may tell me on a Tuesday morning: &ldquo;A Minister is away.  He will not be back until Thursday.  We will need pairs for three days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This should not be raised as an issue by the Parliamentary Secretary this morning because it is an understood thing.  It has often been stated that a guillotine motion breaks right across the rights of the Opposition, or of any Deputy, and therefore, we have excluded it from pairing arrangements.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary was in any doubt about our views in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made an extraordinary contribution.  I do not know why he spoke at this stage.  It confirms a view we have that he needed to get in with a statement before the Minister for Labour because the two of them might not see eye to eye on this issue.  It was rather remarkable that the Minister for Finance should talk about the summer recess and suggest something about a telegram from the Opposition calling for the reassembly of the House.  At all stages there has been a responsible approach from the Opposition.  I am surprised the Minister for Finance should accuse us of thinking of the gimmickry they used to carry on when we were in Government when during the holidays we had the leader of the Labour Party suggesting the House should be recalled because of a housing crisis, and now we have 5,000 more unemployed in the housing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which struck me about the contributions from the other side is the fact that neither the Leader of the Opposition, nor Deputy Colley, nor Deputy Lalor, referred to the allocation of hours in the motion. There was not a word of complaint along the lines that we were not <Col N="1626" /> allowing enough time for this Bill, or that they were being deprived of an opportunity to speak their minds and let the people know what they felt. Not for the first time I suspect the genuineness of the opposition.  Again, not for the first time I suspect it is merely an attempt to embarrass and annoy the Government which, perhaps, is the Opposition's job.  It is no more than that, and ought not to send anyone running for his headline sized type to cry &ldquo;jackboot&rdquo; or &ldquo;gag&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not one of the things being complained of here this morning.  There has not been a word said about the hours envisaged in this motion, or how anybody is being deprived of a full opportunity to debate this Bill.  What there has been is the usual whinging and whining, and mewling and puling, about parliamentary democracy.  Every time we had a motion about procedure&mdash;and we have had three or four closure motions&mdash;there is this wail about parliamentary democracy, and the end of democracy here as we know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last spring, in February, four of the front bench heavies, low budget heavies, came in and solemnly denounced the Government for introducing experimental sitting hours.  That was the end of democracy as we knew it.  When we had closures, not just of a blanket kind as we had last year, but closures on one item, that was the end of democracy.  That was fascism rearing its head.  That is called crying wolf.  The day a real fascist shows his head in this House, and not just somebody who is misunderstood as that, that vocabularly will be so devalued that the cries from Fianna Fáil will be written off as being just as worthless as they were in the past.  All this talk about the end of democracy when <Col N="1627" /> we are trying to get a serious piece of national business done expeditiously cuts no ice with me and will not cut any with the public.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember this about the way this House works under this Government.  We can be accused, perhaps, of several things but most certainly not of being lazy about the Dáil.  For the first time since 1922, in the last calendar year, 1975, this House sat for more than 1,000 hours. and that is the longest year's business on record.  We have given more time to public debate and infinitely more time to Private Members' debate than any previous Government did.  Therefore, if there is one thing we cannot be accused of it is being lazy about the way we run the Dáil.  But there is such a thing as order and regularity in business, and the Government did decide in early April that the Dáil would, barring accidents, adjourn for the recess at the end of June.  Because all kinds of private arrangements depend on that on both sides of the House, I immediately went to the Opposition, with the Government's permission and told them that.  I said: &ldquo;People on your side of the House who want to make their arrangements can take it as being as good as certain, so far as anything can be predicted, that the Dáil will adjourn on 30th June&rdquo;.  I can tell the House I did not see a single long face or hear any reference to the national interest being prejudiced by any such fixed rising date.  I did not have the same experience as I had last year when there were Opposition Deputies stopping me in the corridor and saying: &ldquo;When are you going to let us go. My wife will divorce me.&rdquo;  That was coming from Opposition Deputies with whom I am on the kind of speaking terms which would enable such a conversation to take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing but jubilation in Fianna Fáil when I told them the Dáil would rise this year on 30th June.  Again, all this sanctimonious talk now about democracy being damnified if we rise next week <Col N="1628" /> cuts no ice with me.  If the national interest requires the recall of the Dáil, the Dáil will be recalled double quick, and this Government is the one to do it.  But unless the national interest positively requires it, or unless Government business on which an important statutory deadline rests is not completed by the end of next week, the intention still is that the House will rise at the end of next week.</P>
      <P>That intention has nothing whatever to do with the banks Bill.  The banks Bill, even if we still had an open-ended rising date, would still be under this closure motion for the reasons I have given.  The Leader of the Opposition made a good effort to confuse the two things, to implant in the mind of someone who would not give it much thought before rushing off to tell others through one medium or another that the reason this Bill was being put through in a day was to let us go on our holidays.  I want to deny that and to say absolutely and unreservedly that the one day we are devoting to this Bill has nothing whatever to do with the intention of the Government to rise on the 30th June.</P>
      <P>The closure motions we have had in previous years were just as much to be regretted as this one is, but we were heartily provoked.  Again, I had people meeting me in the corridors, including Opposition Deputies&mdash;not many, I admit; there are not many who would make so free&mdash;Press people, staff of the House and so on, who would say: &ldquo;Why do you not guillotine this Bill?  We will be here until Christmas otherwise.&rdquo;  We were being invited to close down debates which were being kept going in 1974 by deliberate obstruction, and in 1975 by an insufficient control and a lack of decision by Fianna Fáil as to who was or was not their Finance spokesman. In 1975 one individual backbench Opposition Deputy cost this House, single handed, three weeks' time by immense contributions, sometimes running to an hour-and-a-half on a single amendment.</P>

      <P>Of course he is entitled to speak, but if we on this side were to show a similar lack of control in the way we do our business, there would not even be weekends off for the House let alone recesses.  That is why the House ran so long last year. At the end of June or the beginning of July we introduced a blanket closure which covered 14 or 15 items and which ensured that the business would draw to a conclusion on 31st July.  There were the usual cries about the end of democracy, but I sat through that month and I have a distinct recollection of what happened. Items for which there was a certain amount of time did not even absorb that much time.</P>
      <P>I recall the House having an unconvenanted sos for ten or 20 minutes because the Opposition could not think of enough to say to absorb even the limited amount of time allotted for a particular item.  I remember one front bench Deputy on the other side, whom I will not name, complaining when dealing with a motion on the subject matter of his particular brief that he had been given no opportunity that session to debate it.  He had not been in the House the previous week when the Estimate for the Department he was supposed to be watching was under debate.  But that did not stop him complaining three days later that he had not been given an opportunity to debate the matter when he found himself caught in the vice of a short allocation of an hour-and-a-half for a motion.  That is why I do not take these complaints very seriously and why I invite the House and the public to draw the conclusion that the Opposition, in making these noises, have their tongue in their cheek and do not mean what they are saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition made allegations in regard to the way business is done between the Whips.  The situation in regard to the possibility of an Adjournment debate is&mdash;Deputy Lalor is there and can contradict me if I am wrong&mdash;that the Opposition did not at any stage request an Adjournment debate.  The first mention of it was made by me when I <Col N="1630" /> said to them about a week or ten days ago that the business was going through so smoothly that we might be able to give the 29th and 30th June to an Adjournment debate.  That is the first time those words were mentioned between us this session.  I suggested it; they did not come demanding it.</P>

    <P>On the question of pairing, Deputy Lalor was at least man enough to admit implicity that there was no reality in what the Leader of the Opposition has said about pairing on a day to day basis.  It is true that pairing for personal purposes&mdash;a man may want to go to a funeral or fulfil an important business engagement which cannot wait&mdash;is done on a day to day basis.  However, a Minister who has to go abroad cannot be paired on a day to day basis.  I am tired of all this sanctimonious talk, hoping that the public will not take enough trouble to find out what is going on.  We have been operating here for almost three-and-a-half years with a very small majority, and the smooth and regular operation of the pairing operation is vital to us, and would be vital to Fianna Fáil if they were in Government.  Any question of pairing on a day to day basis does not arise in the case of people on public business who have to go abroad.  At the stage when this confrontation arose we had several Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries abroad or about to go abroad and I had to make what arrangements I could to try to undo that situation at enormous personal inconvenience to them and enormous <Col N="1632" /> public inconvenience in regard to the tasks which they are doing.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Lynch speaks like that about the way we run the business it is as though he were kicking me under the table at a party and then accusing me of spoiling the party when I complained and then resuming the kicking.  It is not worthy of Deputy Lynch.  It is not worthy of the Leader of any Opposition, to take that line in regard to the doing of Government business.  I think Deputy Lynch was once a Whip himself and he must know that no Government could conduct its business in that way, and I do not think Fianna Fáil would have submitted to it either. The motion as I have had to explain is necessary and the necessity is regretted. I note that in the debate which took place not one word was said to the effect that the time being allocated here today would not be enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No other employer/employee relationship has invoked more State intervention than has our banking sector over recent years.  The Bill, at present before the House is, in fact, the fourth legislative measure which has been prepared by both the present and former Administrations to regulate bank pay.  For the benefit of those who may criticise the present legislation, I might mention that the measure prepared by the previous Administration was far more stringent in its possible effects in so far as penalties were imposed on the bank employees and their trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that the banking sector has seen a good deal of State intervention over recent years.  Basically, this has occurred not because of any desire on the part of the State authorities <Col N="1635" /> to so intervene but because it was recognised that the repercussions of settlements in an important national service like banking at sensitive points in the life of national agreements&mdash;either in the preparatory or balloting stage or on later phases of a national agreement, could be decisive.</P>
    <P>The banks and their employees are, of course, not parties to the national agreement.  Most people who have considered the matter will I think agree that no pay settlement of a national character is without followon effect.  I would not maintain that an agreement by the banks and their employees must be a replica of any national agreement because, of course, the banking service has certain unique features.  Nobody in Ireland, however, can deny that unless the remuneration and methods by which we allocate payment to ourselves follow or at least seek to follow common criteria, then we would entrench rather than eliminate the deep inequalities which still divide our society.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are those who feel it is unfair that they should be bound by the terms of a national bargain in whose preparation they did not participate.  But if any consensus is to emerge all of us must accept that increases in our remuneration must relate to a broad pattern.  It was in acknowledgement of what was seen as being in the national interest &mdash;namely, to assist in the strengthening of this consensus&mdash;that Dáil Members who for the most part had no part in the drawing-up of the agreement agreed to be bound by the terms of any national bargain reached.</P>
    <P>While the final decision on whether a national agreement awaits the outcome of the special delegate conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 3rd July next, none can seriously doubt that participants in wage negotiations over the next few weeks must consider the impact that their settlements might have on the outcome of that important meeting.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that balloting <Col N="1636" /> on that national agreement to be decided on 3rd July is in progress. In fact members of the largest union in the country begin balloting this morning.  It will be understood then that it is important to ensure that any current negotiations should not influence adversely the outcome of the national ballot.</P>
    <P>Deputies have legitimately expressed concern at Question Time here every other day on the present high level of unemployment.  It cannot be said too often that the reduction of the present unacceptably high unemployment figures requires that our industrial costs be kept as low as possible so that our economy can participate on the most advantageous terms possible in the export markets with our trading partners in the EEC.  Although wage increases are not the sole cause of cost increases they do form a significant proportion.</P>
    <P>The Bill in no way impedes continuation of negotiation between the banks and their employers for a new 1976 bank pay agreement.  As Deputies are aware such negotiations are continuing within the Banks Joint Industrial Council.  I am sure that I express the wish of all Deputies when I say that a bank strike at this juncture can do grievous damage to the economy at this critical point.</P>
    <P>This Bill is purely a holding operation for a limited period.  It may only come into operation on a day to be appointed by order and will in any event expire on 30th November, 1976, or on an earlier date to be appointed by me.  The aim of this holding operation is to ensure that a pay agreement to be negotiated by the banks and their staffs will conform generally with the pattern of settlements emerging for other workers.  Contravention or failure by the banks to comply with the terms of any orders made by me under the Bill will constitute an offence which would render the banks on conviction, liable to heavy fines.  There are no penalties of any sort directed against bank employees or their representatives.</P>
    <P>I would take this opportunity of asking the IBOA to withdraw their strike notice to allow time for a review of the difficulties which have <Col N="1637" /> arisen in the course of the present negotiations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make an order bringing this Act into operation. Whether I must do so or not will depend on the banks and the IBOA.</P>

      <P>Before I embark on my contribution I should like to ask a question in view of the rather grave departure of the Minister from normal procedure.  He did not make any attempt to explain to us the powers that will be given to him in the order or how the order would take effect. He merely referred to the Bill as &ldquo;a holding operation&rdquo;.  Would the order he is being empowered to make in this Bill be a freezing of wages for a section of the people for a period not longer than 30th November?</P>

      <P>Would it be accepted that on a Second Stage speech it is the invariable practice for a Minister to deal with the major aspects of the Bill and to explain them?  The Minister failed to do this.  Presumably there is some reason for that, but in the absence of his doing so, surely it is not unreasonable for Deputies at this stage to ask him to explain the major provisions of the Bill?  If that were done the debate might be short-circuited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In his very brief contribution on a Bill which has grave significance, the Minister did not explain his and the Government's approach to the principle of the rights of individuals and of trade unions to negotiate.  This demonstrates a major turn about by the Labour Party Deputies in the House, and later I will quote from previous debates in the House and from the speches made by them which bear no relation to the stand they are now taking.</P>
      <P>I was amused this morning to hear some of the points made by some of the speakers on the guillotine motion. They referred to the Bill and to the threatened bank dispute.  May I at this point express my desire and that of my party that this serious situation will be prevented from arising?  May we add our voices to those of other people who are concerned that a bank dispute will not occur at a time when our economy can well do without it? The memory of the last bank dispute is painfully clear from the point of view of its effects on so many Irish people and Irish business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express clearly my party's opposition to the Bill and in doing so I should like to correct the impression conveyed here this morning that our attitude now is a contradiction in terms of our stand on the last two points of legislation introduced by the Minister for Labour in this respect during the lifetime of this Government. <Col N="1639" /> On the last two occasions the legislation was linked to the national pay agreement&mdash;to keep increases within the terms of that agreement.</P>
    <P>I would point out that my party initiated the national pay agreement concept.  We are committed to supporting it and will continue to do so. We realise the necessity for such an agreement at the present time.  Our opposition here is against the principle contained in this Bill which was not in either of the two previous pieces of legislation in this respect.  The Minister is being empowered to bring before the House an order whereby he can freeze wages mandatorily for a certain section of the community. In circumstances which are not yet known to any of us he may well be withdrawing the negotiating rights of a trade union as well as the negotiating rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>The delegate conference of Congress is due to be held on July 3rd when voting will take place on the proposed national pay agreement. Therefore in the present circumstances we see the Bill both in the context of our having or not having a national wage agreement.  I have outlined this party's stand in regard to national pay agreements.  If we consider the Bill on the basis that there will be no such agreement this year we realise that the Minister is being empowered to prevent one group of people from negotiating in an entirely new situation. In addition to that, it is our considered opinion that the farce and the comic opera which was organised here this morning by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was part of the reason for bringing in so quickly this piece of legislation.  Deputy Kelly was telling us all the good things that this Government have done.  He spoke about the national interest but went on to tell us why Ministers and backbenchers on his side of the House need summer holidays soon.  In other words, the national interest was pushed aside.</P>
    <P>Our stand in this regard is very clear.  We, too, would like the benefit of these breaks but let us be sincere about putting the national interest <Col N="1640" /> first.  We are prepared to go along with the Minister for Labour should he wish to introduce legislation tying any group of people to national wage agreements.  We have taken such action in the past and are prepared to repeat it.  In the case before us the obvious solution was to hold the legislation, to make every effort to have postponed any industrial disruption within the banking service.</P>
    <P>Without going into the seriousness of such a situation at this stage, I wish to digress for a moment to compliment the Minister on his appointment to the presidency of the ILO.  I wish him well in that office and trust he will uphold the already high standard set by the two former Irish holders of that office.  It is an onerous office, one which has its difficulties and, no doubt, on returning home to this country the Minister's disappointment was very great.  I refer to the way in which some of his colleagues had behaved in the typical bull-at-the gate fashion while negotiations were proceeding.  Again this is part of the reason why we are opposed to the principle of the Bill.  We are opposed, also, to the Bill on the grounds that it is a continuation of a very badlyhandled industrial relations situation.</P>
    <P>On Thursday night last the Minister for Finance created chaos when at a Fine Gael meeting in a Dublin constituency, and with widespread radio coverage, he launched an attack on certain people.  I am satisfied that that attack hardened the thinking of bank officials and mitigated against their sense of patriotism being appealed to.  These are a very responsible group of people.  I am convinced that they realise the serious economic difficulties we are facing, but when a Minister for State is seen to be adopting an attitude of arrogance, of constantly whipping people, even moderate people can become militants.  This action on the part of the Minister was major contributing factor to the breakdown the following day in the negotiations.  One can assume that the major part of these discussions would have centred around the comments of the Minister.</P>
    <P>When replying, perhaps the Minister <Col N="1641" /> for Labour will tell us what positive and sensible steps were taken before Thursday night and since then to endeavour to avoid a strike that none of us wishes to see taking place. Industrial relations and human relations are very important social factors within our society.  By this tirade the Minister for Finance set an example of how not to win friends or influence people in the way they should be influenced.  We are entitled to ask whether there was a desire on the part of the Minister to escalate the probability of a strike.  Is it possible, knowing the strain and delays involved in the payment of accounts in some Departments, that it may have relieved him and, in the absence of the Minister for Labour, he may well have tried to escalate or speed up the possibility of a strike.  I ask that question because I would hate to think that we would have a Minister for Finance who could be irresponsible enough for anybody to suspect his motives.  But, whatever were the motives, his performance left a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Our objection is to the principles contained in this Bill, empowering a Minister to freeze the wages of a group of people, withdrawing their individual rights, withdrawing the rights of that trade union.  And an order can be made by him.  I am surprised that he did not spell out more clearly what is contained in this Bill. If we assume that the Parliamentary Secretary proceeds with his determination to close this House next week for the summer recess, if we assume that the Minister for Labour makes an order a day, or days, after that adjournment, that order may be placed on the table of this House and can be opposed any time within 21 sitting days.  If one examines that, it means that, first of all, there will be a few months during which there will be no sitting days and no way that an Opposition can oppose the order.  If we assume a return somewhere around late September or early October&mdash;we can only assume when the resumption will be&mdash;then those 21 sitting days would take one almost to the 30th of November.  Why the necessity for <Col N="1642" /> that section of the Bill?  What purpose does it serve?</P>
    <P>May I refer to the Government's rather stupid intervention in this dispute, the threat of legislation on Thursday evening last, the introduction of legislation at a delicate stage? I understand a meeting is taking place this morning.  I said earlier that we hope this meeting will achieve at least the postponement of any industrial action until everybody knows the position of the national wage agreement. Such a postponement would have one result only for all concerned, one of acclamation from a public generally scared of what such a bank strike would bring.  Can one blame them, because it would hit the very root of all businesses, would create a major disruption in agriculture, in industry generally, in retail sales and, at a very important time of the year, in tourism?</P>
    <P>Memories of the last bank strike are still very clear and painful for many people.  There were many individuals who exploited the situation.  There was a jobber of some sorts who succeeded in taking large sums of money from co-operative marts whom we understand is now living in luxury in Australia or elsewhere.  Companies went into liquidation, causing major losses where cheques had been cashed in retail outlets by people who wanted ready cash.  The operation suited both people.  Imagine what chaos there would be on this occasion with the evidence, bearing in mind today's statements by the Garda that the crime rate is on the increase and crime detection on the decrease?  With bank robberies becoming more common, security would be stretched still further with large amounts of money being hoarded in unsuitable places. Probably the most serious consideration of all is that, since that intervention of the Minister for Finance last Thursday evening&mdash;certainly one not designed to help the situation&mdash;there have been enormous withdrawals of money, some of it by people who may be scared about not being able to lay their hands on adequate amounts of money during a strike period, if such occurred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" /> There is another more serious consideration for our economy, that is the huge export to foreign banks of moneys invested in our banks at a time when that money was never so badly needed.  Surely the Minister for Finance, instead of adopting the attitude he did last week, could have adopted another.  What he has done is criminal for a man in his position, particularly when one realises just how necessary is investment at home to be available to our industry.  Furthermore, is there not also a danger that some of that money may never return for use by our banks?  That is another very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I want to point out again the headover-heels attitude of the Labour Party.  It is interesting that there are a number of Labour organisation meetings taking place in Dublin at present, the theme running through them being one of discontent with their members who hold ministerial office.  In other words, Labour grass roots are saying: &ldquo;The Ministers have left us and we want to go our own way.&rdquo;  Basically the party are trying to wear two hats.  I want to quote the Leader of the Labour Party, at column 109 of the Official Report of the 17th June, 1966, in the course of a debate on the Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill, 1966&mdash;there was not a national wage agreement in that year&mdash;when he said:</P>
    <P>I believe that industrial relations should be cultivated rather than legislated for.</P>
    <P>I wonder does he still believe that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I really think the Deputy would be better advised to stay off that piece of legislation, the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act of 1966.  I think, if he takes the advice of Deputy Colley beside him, he will understand that he should have avoided that subject.</P>

Of course, it does not end there.  One of the contenders for leadership of the Labour Party, Deputy Tully, Minister for Local Government, was on the same day assuring the then Minister that: &ldquo;As far as we are concerned in the Labour Party every time this sort of measure is introduced here we shall oppose it tooth and nail.&rdquo;  Interesting.  I wonder did he oppose this?  Was he one of those who shared in the disagreement at Cabinet level?  The Minister was absent and he may not be aware of the divergence of views on this at Cabinet level.</P>

      <P>One thing the Minister cannot do is erase the records of this House.  I repeat what Deputy Tully then said: &ldquo;...every time this sort of measure is introduced here we shall oppose it tooth and nail.&rdquo; Now he is not raising a finger, a nail, showing a tooth or raising any voice against this legislation.  The present Minister for Labour at column 240 of Volume 223 of the Official Report said:</P>
      <P>The Bill brings us a step nearer to the totalitarian concept of the State... This morning the Government took a step towards the totalitarian concept where the State no longer sands neutral in the struggle between employer and employee...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to spell out how emtru <Col N="1645" /> barrassing these words must now be for the Minister who is introducing this mandatory pay pause for bank officials.</P>
    <P>Our party's approach has been consistent and will always be consistent in regard to national wage agreements and in regard to our efforts to see moderation achieved.  Had the Minister and his Government not been tempted by a desire to move so bullheadedly we would, of course, have co-operated in any legislation introduced ensuring reasonable control on national wage agreements.  We did that on two previous occasions and we would do it now if the Minister would exercise a little patience.  Some measures introduced by him already have been retrospective and there is nothing to prevent him making legislation retrospective now.  The national wage agreement has not yet reached finality.  It should have reached finality long ago and would have reached finality but for the Government's mishandling of the situation.  Our leader spelled that out this morning.</P>
    <P>In the last two years we have had two wage agreements, one in March in one year and one in April in another year.  This year we are almost in July and we still have not got a national wage agreement.  We were attacked for comparing the performance of the Minister for Finance with that of his counterpart in Britain and with his efforts there to achieve moderation.  The fact is that the responsible Minister in Britain achieved some sort of reasonable approach by not doing anything to cause further inflation and by not increasing the cost of living.  The workers seem to be the target all the time of the Government. Their standard of living is constantly eroded by more and more direct and indirect taxation.  Only this morning we had another list of increases in the cost of living.  Essentials, like bread and electricity, are going up again.  These people were asked to accept a pay pause and all the time the Minister was raking in the money by way of taxation.  That is one of the reasons why negotiations are persisting right into July.</P>
    <P>We shall be in recess and we are <Col N="1646" /> rushing this Bill through before we go into recess.  The guillotine motion was introduced this morning.  Why should different treatment be given to this Bill?  The Bill was introduced yesterday morning.  It was circulated an hour or so later.  The Second Stage was introduced at 11.30 this morning.  All Stages are to be completed today and the Bill will go to the Seanad tomorrow. That is not the way to introduce legislation which affects the rights of people.  Constitutional problems may arise.  Adequate time should be given between the different Stages. Perhaps the Chair or the Minister would enlighten us as to what the position is with regard to Committee Stage.  According to clause 2 (b) of the motion:</P>
    <P>the Committee Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Second Stage and the proceedings on that Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 9 p.m. by putting from the Chair the Question necessary to bring them to a conclusion; and the Question to be put from the Chair shall be &ldquo;That (any amendments set down by the Minister for Labour and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill) the Bill (as amended) is hereby agreed to...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that only the Minister for Labour is entitled to bring in amendments on Committee Stage?  It was said this morning by Government speakers that we are talking about the same kind of legislation for the third time.  I want to make it crystal clear that we are not.  We are talking about a completely different type of legislation. We are talking about giving powers to a Minister to implement at his whim.  The others referred to the national wage agreement but they had the in-built protection of the Labour Court, which does not now exist.  I cannot say often enough that there is no way this party will agree to giving such powers to any Minister of the Government nor would they look for that kind of power, to make an order to freeze wages.</P>
    <P>This is specifically what is being <Col N="1647" /> done in this House today.  Section 3, which is the most important section of the Bill, refers to the associated banks.  It refers very specifically to the fact that after the commencement of the order the Minister may prohibit the payment.  The same freeze is being placed on the other banks from yesterday. Let nobody be under any other illusion that this is not what it is all about.  Let nobody on the other side of the House try to say that this is merely a holding operation.  No Minister in any democratically elected Government should be given this power. No Minister should be allowed to take from the rights of individuals without in-built protection for them against the whims of a Minister.</P>
    <P>This Bill bears no relation to increases in salaries.  That is only a side result.  The principle is important here, that of the Minister for Labour particularly stepping forward to take those powers from people and having the power to take rights away from a trade union with a negotiating licence.  He will have power to make that negotiating licence inoperable.</P>
    <P>We support the claim for moderation and the appeal for postponement of this strike.  The stature of bank officials and of everybody concerned would be enhanced enormously if they only said: &ldquo;We will put the strike back for two weeks.  We will give people a chance to come again to talk.&rdquo;  I do not blame them for being annoyed with the Government for their handling of the matter.  If they are big enough to ignore that and look for postponement of the strike, then their opportunity of chastising the Government for their handling of this matter will come in its own good time. I appeal to the officials to show their patriotism and their responsibility.</P>
    <P>The definitions in this Bill spell out the difference between it and the previous Acts.  There are three definitions in the Act of last December&mdash;the bank, the national agreements and the Minister. There are two definitions in this Bill, the bank and the Minister.  In section 3 an agreement is referred to. Towards the end of that section we find the definition of that agreement. <Col N="1648" /> I am satisfied there are people on the Government benches who do not think there is any specific difference between the two measures we did not oppose and the Bill before us today. If they read the Bill we are discussing and specifically look at section 3 (7) (a), they will get the explanation. They will be told how the Minister is getting power to freeze wages because that is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>There is no in-built safety of the Labour Court on this occasion, which was a feature of the previous legislation. Penalties are not only imposed on the banks but also on persons, authorised officers, if their functions are hindered in any way.  It is understandable that these officers will have facilities available to them.  I would not like to see them operating the way the Minister for Finance has some of his inspectors operating throughout the country at present in a type of spy ring.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I want to make about the Bill.  I want to state categorically that our opposition is against the rights of an individual and the rights of a trade union being withdrawn under this Bill and the Minister being given power to take over those rights.  Our opposition is not to keeping the earnings, salaries and wages of people to the agreed principle of a national wage agreement. I have already said that we are satisfied that the urgency of this Bill was not precipitated by the threatened banks closure.  It was precipitated by the desire of the Government to get out of the House at the earliest possible opportunity.  The answer was a reasoned, sensible approach to all the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>I have always been a firm believer in keeping people at a negotiating table.  Last Thursday night, when the Minister for Finance made a public attack, he made the negotiations still continuing less meaningful and he hindered any possible progress that could have been made on Friday.  This pay freeze legislation followed on that. What guarantee have we that further measures of this nature will not be introduced?  Personal assurances are not good enough any more.  I have <Col N="1649" /> already quoted what some of the principal Labour Party holders of office in this Government had to say a few years ago.  We did not oppose the two last measures.</P>
    <P>We would not have opposed the measure if the Minister had waited, as he should have done.  We would not oppose a measure linked with the hoped for national wage agreement. All of us hope we will have a new national wage agreement.  If the Minister then introduced legislation linked with increases in that agreement, we would continue to support it but we will not support legislation giving the Minister of the day the power to freeze wages for anyone.  This is what we are opposing.</P>
    <P>In his reply I would ask the Minister to give us his interpretation of the ministerial order.  I want him to tell us how he will wear the new mantle placed on the shoulders of a Labour Minister in an Irish Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that so far as this side of the House is concerned we hope that the talks which I understand are taking place this morning between the banks and the officials will be successful. Deputy Fitzgerald has spelled out some of the potentially disastrous consequences of a bank closure and nobody in his right mind could wish those consequences on our economy. However, it is unfortunate that the whole approach of the Government in this matter has been to have the effect of hindering the possibility of an agreement being arrived at.  When I say that I am talking about an agreement that would and should be acceptable to the Government, not merely an agreement between the two parties concerned.</P>
      <P>The whole handling of this matter highlighted by what I described as the bull-in-the-china-shop approach of the Minister for Finance last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment further on that.  The whole approach seemed designed deliberately to prevent success in the talks.  Insult was <Col N="1650" /> added to injury when it was learned that the statement by the Minister for Finance, supposedly on behalf of the Government, was made at a party political function of the Fine Gael Party or so it was alleged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  It was alleged to have been made there, at any rate.  If the Government thought it necessary to make a public announcement in this regard, one would have thought a more appropriate method could have been found.  That a public declaration by the Government in this regard should have been made seems to have been ill-advised and inappropriate.</P>
      <P>This morning we heard the Minister for Finance say that the criticism directed at his intervention was criticism of his replying to his critics.  Perhaps he believes that.  If he does, it is a very unfortunate situation that the affairs of our country should be in the hands of a man who can be so blind. If he does not believe what he said, if he knows the truth, he might have acknowledged it.  The truth is that nobody was criticising him for replying to his critics but what he said was directed at the Irish Bank Officials' Association.  It was so accepted by them and they reacted predictably to that intervention.</P>
      <P>The whole history of this measure now before the House is very strange. That kind of intervention by the Minister for Finance had led to a fairly commonly accepted view that the Government want to see a bank closure.  Personally, I do not accept that.  I do not believe any Government could be so crazy as to wish that. However, the intervention was so obviously ill-advised that many people believe the Government want a bank closure.  One must take account of the whole mishandling of the situation regarding the national agreement dating back to the last budget which was introduced in the knowledge that negotiations for a national agreement were about to take place and which was apparently designed to ensure that they would not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to develop that theme <Col N="1651" /> now because it is well known but one must take into account the whole approach of the Government in this matter, culminating in the extraordinary situation this morning when the Minister for Labour made a speech introducing the Second Stage that, to the best of my knowledge, was unprecedented in this House.  One can go through the text of the speech but one will not find any reference in it to any section of the Bill.  I do not recall any occasion on which a Minister of any Government on the Second Stage of a Bill he was promoting in the House made no reference whatever to any section in the Bill. This is just more of the very strange atmosphere that surrounds this measure. It adds to the mystery of what is going on.  Of course, the fact that the Government Information Services apparently informed the news media that the Bill was going to be taken yesterday when it was taken today is only a minor mystery.  The fact that the guillotine has been applied to get the Bill through all Stages today is more of the same.</P>
    <P>We have had an effort by the Minister for Finance this morning and also by the Minister for Labour to suggest that this Bill is the same as the two previous Bills which this party supported. To me this is the greatest mystery surrounding this whole Bill, because this statement is demonstrably untrue. One has only to look at the two Bills to see the difference.  It is a bit unfortunate that the Deputies who will be asked to go into the lobby to support this Bill, on the basis that it is the same as the previous Bill, are not here to listen to the arguments to demonstrate why there is an enormous difference. That is unfortunate but, perhaps, it is not surprising in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that this Bill is fundamentally different from the two previous Bills to which we gave our support.  I indicated earlier on the closure motion the attitude of this party to national pay agreements, an attitude which has been absolutely consistent from the <Col N="1652" /> time we fought a major battle in this House against the Minister for Labour, and the Tánaiste, and all the other members of this Government, and their supporters, in order to create a climate in which we could have a national agreement.  We have consistently supported national agreements since.</P>
    <P>Although we in this party believe the best interests of the country are served by free collective bargaining, nevertheless we have been prepared to sacrifice that belief on occasions where the national interest clearly required it.  Occasions where the national interest clearly required it arose in the past in connection with banks and their staffs.  This Government, contrary to their protestations, found it necessary to bring in legislation to apply the national pay agreement statutorily to the staffs of the banks.  This party, consistent with our policy from the beginning, supported that.</P>
    <P>To allege, as the Minister for Finance did, and as the Minister for Labour has done, that this Bill is doing the same thing is so incredibly untrue that one must hope one will get some kind of explanation from the Minister for Labour.  I must say I am not very hopeful, in view of the fact that we sought an explanation from him and he was unable to give us any.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would wish to be less vehement but I was provoked by the inane intervention by a Minister who introduces a Bill here without attempting to explain it.  Is this House to be a total rubber stamp so far as the Government are concerned?  Ram it through and do not bother to explain it.  That is the kind of treatment this House and the country can expect. I want to tell the Minister for Labour that, if that is the approach, the Government will have an even more difficult task than they have had up to now.</P>
      <P>To us this Bill is totally and fundamentally different from previous Bills introduced by the Minister which we supported.  May I, in demonstration of that fact, simply refer briefly to the explanatory memorandum issued with the 1975 Bill.  There is no explanatory memorandum with this mystery Bill.  The explanatory memorandum issued with the 1975 Bill, which the Government say is the same as this Bill, said in relation to section 3:</P>
      <P>The Labour Court will examine the agreement to determine whether its terms are in accordance with the provisions or purposes of the National Agreements; the Court will then furnish a report in the matter to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> May I ask in which section of the Bill now before us is there a reference to the Labour Court?  In which section is there a reference to national agreements?  There is no such reference in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 4 the explanatory memorandum said:</P>
    <P>...the Labour Court determines in a report furnished to the Minister that the increases or improvements are at variance with the provisions or purposes of the National Agreements or this Act, the Minister may by order determine the remuneration etc. in respect of the period to which the order relates. The Minister may also prohibit the payment of increases in remuneration etc. in excess of those determined.</P>
    <P>Again I ask where in the Bill before the House today is there any such provision?  Where is the reference to the national agreement?  Where is the reference to the Labour Court?  That is the provision we supported in the past.  The Minister should not pretend this Bill is the same and requires our support on the same basis.</P>
    <P>If we look more closely at this Bill we find it provides that the Minister for Labour may make an order.  If the Minister makes that order it will &ldquo;prohibit the payment by the associated banks to their employees, after the commencement of the order, of remuneration at rates exceeding the rates of such remuneration provided for by the Agreement.&rdquo;  It also prohibits the making, implementing or continued implementing by the associated banks of any amendments or variations of the other terms or conditions of employment in the agreement. The agreement is defined.</P>
    <P>The agreement is not the national agreements of the past and not the national agreement which it is hoped will be arrived at.  The agreement is defined in subsection (7).  It is the agreement entitled an agreement between the banks' staffs relations committee, on behalf of its members and the Irish Bank Officials' Association. on behalf of its members employed by the banks in the Republic of Ireland, <Col N="1655" /> on the revision of salaries of bank officials which was signed by the chairman of the banks' Joint Industrial Council on 4th July, 1975, signed on behalf of the Irish Bank Officials' Association on 20th June, 1975, and signed on behalf of the banks' staff relations committee on 7th July, 1975. It goes on to say &ldquo;...whose duration was expressed to be a period of twelve months from the 1st day of June, 1975, as modified by the agreement ...&rdquo;  It goes on to give the details of that.  Again it is a bank agreement.  Nowhere in this Bill is there are any reference to the national agreement.  On the other hand, in the 1975 Act which we supported, and which the Minister tells us is the same, we find&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are faced with the situation in which the Minister failed and refused to explain the Bill when introducing it.  We take it as we find it.  We compare it with Bills which we supported, and on that basis we refute categorically the allegation that this party are now opposing something they previously supported.  For the benefit of the Minister, I would remind him that in the Bill before the House there is no reference to a national agreement; there is no reference to the Labour Court.  In the Bill we supported the national agreement is defined and there is provision for referring that to the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>What order can be made under this Bill by the Minister?  One, an order which freezes the pay of bank officials to the level now existing. There is no power in this Bill for the Minister to make an order, for instance, saying bank officials' pay, assuming there is a national pay agreement, may be adjusted in line with the national pay agreement.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that even for a short time we have a few Deputies behind the Minister who may have been misled into believing that this Bill is the same as the two previous Bills the Minister introduced. They may have noticed that the Minister failed and refused to explain the Bill when he brought it in.  His Second Reading speech contains no reference to any section of the Bill, and when he was asked if he would mind explaining, he did not do so. Now we have had a rather supercilious interjection from the Minister to imply that we are misreading the Bill &mdash;this from a man who did not deign to try to explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that this Bill contains no reference to the Labour Court, no <Col N="1658" /> reference to the national agreement. We supported two Bills previously which endeavoured to apply the national agreement to the bank officials' pay and which used the Labour Court as the instrument and agency to determine whether the pay was in accordance with that agreement.  That is what we supported and are still prepared to support.  We are not prepared to support a Bill which gives the Minister power to make an order &mdash;the only kind of order he can make &mdash;which freezes the pay of bank officials to their present level.  This is a statutory wage freeze.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that it is merely a question of trying to hold this over their heads and that he is in the difficult position that, since there is no national pay agreement at the moment, he cannot specify that in the Bill.  Of course, that is not impossible from a drafting point of view.  He can easily get around it, and Deputy Fitzgerald adverted to the fact that it would be possible to apply the matter retrospectively, notice having been given.  This is precisely what he had in mind, the difficulty in regard to the national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose there is a national pay agreement.  Does this enable the Minister to do as the previous Bills did, to insist that the pay of bank officials conforms to the national pay agreement?  It does not.  There is nothing in this Bill to enable the Minister to do that.  Is the Minister implying, by his tut-tutting that there is something in it?  Would the Minister tell us even which section it is in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a national pay agreement, there is nothing in this Bill which would enable the Minister to make an order applying the national pay agreement to the bank officials' incomes.  The Minister tried to imply by an interruption that there was such. It will have been noticed that the Minister was asked to say which section was involved.  All the Minister had to give was one word, but he gave a lot of words and did not mention which section.  There is no reference in this Bill to the national pay agreement or to the Labour Court.  The section that applies says that the Minister may make an order prohibiting the payment by the associated banks to their employees, of remuneration at rates exceeding remuneration provided for in the agreement.  The agreement is specified. The latest date of any such agreement is the 9th June, 1976, but in fact it substantially refers to the agreement entered into on 7th July, 1975.  These are all bank agreements.  There is no reference to the national pay agreement. This Bill enables the Minister to make an order prohibiting the banks from paying to their employees any more than they were entitled to yesterday, 23rd June, 1976.  That is provided for in subsection (2) of section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other possibilities.  Suppose we do not have a national pay agreement, which unfortunately is a distinct possibility, what then?  Will the Minister make an order, as provided for in this Bill, prohibiting the banks from paying to their employees more than they are entitled to at the moment? That is the only kind of order the Minister can make under this Bill.  If the Minister does that, then this is a statutory freeze on the pay of bank officials.  If the Government want to make the case that there should be a statutory freeze on pay, then they should make it; but there is no way they can justify doing that to bank officials only in the absence of a national pay agreement.  If the Government think there should be a pay freeze they should say so and bring in a Bill to provide for it and we will discuss it.  If, on the other hand, there is no national pay agreement, and the Minister makes no order, what is this <Col N="1661" /> Bill about?  What are we wasting our time for?  The fact is that this Government have, for reasons which may be clear to themselves but which are not clear to anybody else, made one blunder after another in relation to the national pay agreement and particularly in relation to this matter of the pay of bank officials.  As a result we now have this Bill before us.</P>

      <P>Actually what I was trying to tell the Deputy and his colleagues was what was in this Bill because I suspect that they do not know.  They are being asked to go in and vote on a Bill which provides that if an order is made, the only order that can be made under it is an order to freeze bank officials' pay.  It does not enable the Minister to do anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note the views of Deputies on the other side in regard to this whole matter of wage control.  I have a few quotations from Deputies opposite when they were discussing this question in this House <Col N="1662" /> from this side of the House in 1970 in regard to the Prices and Incomes Bill of that year.  The Leader of the Labour Party on 28th October, 1970, at column 56 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>As far as this party is concerned and as far as the trade union movement is concerned neither they nor we will ever agree to any measure which takes away the right to free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>I wonder does Deputy Coughlan support that view or this Bill?  He cannot support both, because this Bill enables the Minister for Labour to bring in an order which freezes the pay of bank officials at what it is today irrespective of whether there is a national pay agreement and irrespective of whether there is an agreement between the banks and their staffs.</P>

      <P>In the same debate on 10th November, 1970, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, at column 1051 of the Official Report said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that Governments may make such a mess of things as to make a temporary wage freeze necessary.  I do not believe that such a wage freeze, if imposed, can do anything other than hold off the <Col N="1663" /> danger for a period, while in the meantime building up a head of steam behind it.  The Government which find themselves forced to introduce such a measure are a Government which are defeated.  They are conceding defeat without even trying to solve the problem</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond who also spoke on that debate on 11th November, 1970, at column 1140 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>The Government must place the facts of life before the negotiating parties but it is not their job to interfere directly, as they have done on this occasion, between the trade unions and employers.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same column Deputy Desmond said:</P>
    <P>That is the first principle&mdash;no interference in free negotiations between the trade unions and the employers.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce on 17th November, 1970, at column 1535 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>As a matter of principle, I have objections to any interference with free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>Apparently, his principles have changed or gone out the window because it seems he supports this Bill. Later, at column 1547 on the same day, he said:</P>
    <P>...what is said implicity is that the right of employers to go earning increased profits must be protected but the right of specially situated sections of the working class to use their extraordinary bargaining power, which becomes greater every year, to increase their circumstances must be forbidden by law. That is the sort of bargaining that Fintan Lalor repudiated in very graphic words a long time ago.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister for Labour will bear that in mind if he is tempted to repeat the kind of thing that was said by the Minister for Local Government standing in here for him the other day, when it was suggested that the bank officials are in a special position and they can exercise a special leverage to <Col N="1664" /> take them outside the national law. Apparently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks that is a right they should have; it is &ldquo;the right of a specially situated section of the working class to use their extraordinary bargaining powers&rdquo; and he thinks that any interference with that by law is something that was repudiated by Fintan Lalor in graphic words a long time ago and, clearly, he was repudiating it also.

      <P>I, for one, have no wish to conduct this debate on the basis of a squabbling match across the floor&mdash;I think these were the words you used.  I have endeavoured to deal with the Bill as I find it but I have been subjected to rather sneering remarks from the Minister who, when asked either at the beginning or as a result of his interjections, to explain what he says is in the Bill, has consistently refused to do so.  However, the terms of the Bill make it quite clear that it is proposed to give the Minister power to do one thing only: restrict the pay of bank <Col N="1666" /> officials to what it is at the moment. It does not enable the Minister to make an order confining the pay of bank officials to the terms of the national agreement if an agreement is arrived at.  There is nothing in the Bill to enable him to do that.  It would appear that if there is a national agreement and if, as has happened in the past, the IBOA refuse to be bound by the terms of that agreement and the Minister is obliged statutorily to enforce it, he will have to bring in another Bill.  This Bill will not enable him to do it.  Therefore, the mystery as to why this Bill is before the House becomes greater all the time.  I can make no sense of the thinking behind the Bill.  I have tried to demonstrate that if there is a national agreement this Bill will not enable the Minister to do what presumably he will have to do.  If there still is not, the only order he can make is one that applies to bank officials, a freezing of their pay.  If he wants to do that across the board, that is what the Bill should provide and we would then know what the Government have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have quoted some of the statements made by present Ministers when dealing with this very question of statutory control of incomes and it is clear that their reaction then was totally different from today.  From an intervention by the Minister, it would appear he still misunderstands the position on this side.  We do not pose as champions of the bank officials or of the banks.  In so far as we are posing as champions of anything or anybody it is of national pay agreements.  That is what Fianna Fáil have consistently supported in relation to banks and other workers. That is what we would support now, but that is what the Bill fails to provide for.  It is possible the Minister may produce a rabbit out of the hat and show that this Bill, though it makes no mention of an agreement or of the Labour Court, provides for applying a new national agreement to bank officials.  Miracles happen from time to time but I would say it is unlikely that it will happen now, and we will, therefore, be left as we have been with no <Col N="1667" /> explanation of the Bill, only sneering interventions by the Minister who, when pinned down, will refuse to give any sort of hard information.  That is no way to treat the House, the country or the grave situation with which we are faced, but it is one that will hardly surprise the people who are only too familiar with the lightweight approach we get from some members of the Government and the Minister for Labour in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will intervene but briefly in this rather unique performance of bringing in legislation in this way, which to me is almost nostalgic in its reference to the banks.  There are few people, if any, in the House who had so much confrontation and negotiation with bank officials as I had in my period as Minister for Labour.  I found my temper frayed at times, and perhaps I found myself making statements that at times were over-emotional because one could not fail to be concerned seriously with the importance of holding down incomes and prices in those early days when inflation was beginning to rear its ugly head.</P>
      <P>They were the days when it was essential to cool the economy and hold in check situations that threatened and that have happened since.  They were anxious days when there was a good deal of right and justice on both sides.  We were concerned with the economy.  We were concerned with the banks stepping out of line.  They pleaded they were not part of the national pay agreement and that because the employers were willing to pay and the employees could show they were entitled to a certain remuneration, it was not the business of anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had to insist that the overall effect on the national economy was much too important, and for that reason on two occasions if not more I had to refer bank pay agreements to the Labour Court.  The last occasion was shortly before the 1973 general election and by the time the court had reported the Government had <Col N="1668" /> changed.  In the meantime, the banks were already paying the officials the rates in the agreement submitted to the Labour Court.  I thought it was a bit high-handed: they took advantage of the situation to get under the ropes, so to speak, and the intervention of the election provided that opportunity. It was a time when legislation should have been brought in immediately. However, one is prepared to accept that new brooms tend to sweep clean, and eventually we had legislation brought in by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>The reason the Minister for Labour gave for it was naturally different from the one he gave today, and today's legislation is fundamentally different from that to which we agreed on that occasion.  I have here a copy of the speech of the Minister on the 1973 Bill and he said, and it is typical of his entire speech:</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to do everything possible to preserve a climate in which a national agreement may flourish.  Our economic policy must be directed towards the creation of more jobs and the creation of a higher standard of living.  Our prices strategy will ensure a careful surveillance of factors which will include the cost of living.</P>
    <P>They were very good sentiments from a Government starting out in office and the Opposition were justified in giving the Government their full support on that measure.  The Government apparently were setting out to do what the country would be very grateful for today&mdash;the taking of stern measures to hold down incomes and prices and to prevent the morass we are now experiencing.</P>
    <P>There are certain imponderables which are axiomatic in the economy at all times but at present the economy is in an awful mess and the Government have contributed seriously to that situation.  It is in this climate that we are asked to discuss legislation to freeze the incomes of a certain section of the community.  I am trying to be brief and I will not repeat what has been said, but Deputy Colley pointed out the fundamental <Col N="1669" /> difference between this Bill and the previous Act.  Section 3 states:</P>
    <P>(1) The Minister may from time to time by order&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) prohibit the payment by the associated banks to their employees, after the commencement of the order, of remuneration at rates exceeding the rates of such remuneration provided for by the Agreement,</P>
    <P>The agreement is between the banks' staff relations committee and the IBOA on behalf of their members and signed on 1st July, 1975, modified by the parties and signed on 9th June, 1976.  That is the agreement to which the banks are to be held.</P>
    <P>That is unusual.  When the Minister is replying I trust he will tell us whether, in the event of there being a national wage agreement which could be shown by the Labour Court to be considerably more advantageous than any agreement entered into between the banks and their officials, the bank officials would be allowed go as far as that agreement provides.  There is no provision in the Bill for reference to the Labour Court but the Minister is empowered by virtue of section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act to refer any agreement to the Labour Court at any time.  Despite the fact that there is no provision in this Bill for such reference, I am sure he would be able to have the agreement examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether it was less advantageous to the bank officials than what the national wage agreement generally may be.  On the other hand, if instead of a national wage agreement there is a free for all, will this piece of legislation still hold in relation to the banks?  Already unprecendented demands are being made by some sections of the industrial community. These vital questions remain unanswered.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances we are asking that this precipitate action be deferred for at least another week so that we might know what the situation is likely to be.  In the event of a free-for-all situation, must the terms of the agreement signed last June and modified in June this year remain in relation to the <Col N="1670" /> bank officials or will the Minister make an order prohibiting them from receiving anything in excess of what is provided for in that agreement?  Without prejudicing the ongoing negotiations in both cases, the Minister cannot answer these questions.  Consequently, regardless of how essential it may be even at this late hour to come to grips with the inflationary situation in respect of prices and wages, this legislation is precipitate and ill-advised.</P>
    <P>During the debate this morning on the guillotine motion the Leader of this party told the Government that they would be well advised to wait another week or so and instead of adjourning next week to withdraw the legislation and postpone the recess for a further week at least.  The situation is very serious.  It concerns the country as a whole.  Many people are beginning to despair that any serious effort will be made to stop the uncontrolled spiral of inflation which is threatening to bring into total chaos every feature of our national economy.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred today to the spate of new increases announced this morning.  On this occasion bread is included and we have the frightening situation of a 5 per cent increase in ESB charges, an increase which is aimed at bringing in another £6,500,000.  This amount is to be taken directly from the pockets of the consumers. Yet nobody cries &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  The Government and the State-sponsored bodies are the biggest offenders in so far as the cost of living is concerned. If we were to examine carefully the performance which has led up to the efforts to bring about a national pay agreement, we would find that the Government can take no credit in this respect.  We had a budget which increased prices by 5 or 6 per cent. This was followed by a spate of increases on the part of State-sponsored bodies.  The Government then called on workers to agree to a pay pause. We were told that in the absence of a pay pause we would have a crucifixion of the economy, that there would be additional taxes and another budget. However, when it appeared that it would not be possible to effect a pay pause, the Minister was prepared to <Col N="1671" /> accept a situation of modest increases and, later, to accept anything.  Is it any wonder then, that the bank officials are totally frustrated in the negotiations in relation to their position and especially at a time when a national wage agreement has not been reached?  It is on those grounds that the Opposition are opposing the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many times in the past I had occasion to sit down with both sides in a bank dispute.  They had a highly efficient, professional negotiator employed whose only interest was to further the interests of the people who employed him, and he could do it well.  Against that we had to struggle to get these people to realise that if the country was to get into the throes of a serious, spiralling inflationary situation, it would lead ultimately to heavy unemployment, a decline in investment in production and the erosion of competitive costings of exports on foreign markets.  All of that has happened. Now we find ourselves in the position that prices on foreign markets are beginning to stabilise.  Yet with home costs soaring we are not in a position, nor will we be, to have competitive costs to enable us get exports moving or to compete for a long time to come. The costs are admitted, sometimes mealy-mouthed in the admission, but at least it is conceded by the Minister in his introductory remarks:</P>
    <P>It cannot be said too often that the reduction of the present unacceptably high unemployment figures requires that our industrial costs be kept as low as possible so that our economy can participate on the most advantageous terms possible in the export markets with our trading partners in the EEC. Although wage increases are not the sole cause of cost increases they do form a significant proportion.</P>
    <P>That is a sort of belated admission. They form a very serious proportion, particularly in high labour-content industries. The action with which we are now playing in a rather halfhearted way is the type of action that should have been taken three years ago.  This has been said a thousand times.  There is the question here of <Col N="1672" /> locking the stable door when the horse has gone.  Even at this juncture it would be important.  But nobody, least of all, members of the Labour Party who profess high principles in relation to wage fixing legislation, could condone a measure that selectively puts the Minister in a position of freezing the remuneration of one set of workers and allowing others to go free.  It is true that when we proposed penalties in legislation before it was the funds of the unions that would pay.  I did not see anything wrong with that.  If legislation is to be a deterrent it has got to contain such provisions.  The important thing is to get people to realise that by taking selfish action, with no relation to what other sections are doing, ultimately they are creating a situation affecting the whole economy and in which everybody, but particularly the weaker sections, will be the sufferers. That was the message we were trying to get across in our early negotiations with the banks as far back as 1970. I think they appreciated that that was so because they resorted to making the case, and with some validity, that originally bank officials were poorly paid.  There was a time when a bank clerk had to be supported by his parents for a number of years.  The old theme was that one spent the first 20 years getting into debt and the second trying to get out of it.</P>
    <P>We have seen the complete turn of the wheel in that situation, the complete cycle, and we are now in a situation in which there is not alone security but high social standing and good remuneration available to people fortunate enough to be employed by the banks.  But that does not deprive them of rights.  What we do with them must relate to what is done in other sections of society and other sectors of the economy.  If we are to say to that set of workers now: &ldquo;We will see that you do not exceed what is in a particular agreement; we will freeze you at that point; that will not apply to others&rdquo; I do not think anybody would really support that.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants a bank strike. Nobody in this country knows better than I what it means.  The period of <Col N="1673" /> 1970 from April to November was a trying one for any Minister for Labour.  The stick I had to take from the Opposition at the time is not by any means the reason I am speaking as I do in relation to this proposed legislation.  I appreciated that the Labour Party had a case to make, a stance to adopt and their opposition at the time&mdash;without going over records, as some previous speakers have done&mdash;did not make it very easy for me.  It was a difficult time for the economy.  Many people could not appreciate how the country could have survived.</P>
    <P>I think bank officials now would be mad to go on strike because the same opportunities for employment do not exist.  They do not receive any remuneration from their union and job opportunities across the channel, if they wished to emigrate temporarily, are not as good either. They must have regard to the fact that the economy is undergoing the most serious crisis experienced for a long time.  Somebody at some time has got to say that this is our country, we have to co-operate and do something to pull ourselves up by the shoestrings.  If the Government do not do it somebody else will have to take responsibility and make a move towards real stabilisation of the economy and a sense of realism in a situation that threatens to go on incessantly.</P>
    <P>Increased prices have been announced today.  That will contribute further to the consumer price index which would constitute the criterion for a further increase in wages at a later date.  When wages go up prices must follow; when prices go up wages must follow.  No serious effort to remedy this situation is being made.  We are merely fiddling in endeavours to arrest this spiralling situation, an end to which nobody can foresee.  The Government seem to be hoping, Micawber-like, that something will happen in the international field, that the world recession will eventually leave our shores and in that situation we may hopefully pass from the present serious position in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> Every Government have their own sovereignty and every Government have an obligation to look after their own affairs and play their part.  No matter how much we blame factors alleged to be outside our control we really have it in our own grasp to control the inflationary situation.  We have not done so and we are still doing nothing about it.  Something must be done by somebody.  One becomes nauseated at the attitude of the media to the Opposition.  It is amusing to note the attitude to the jigsaw puzzle of the last three years. The media support the Government and then, when the Government fail, they turn their attention to the Opposition and we find ourselves blamed for the present situation because, it is alleged, we are not a good enough Opposition.</P>
    <P>We could stand here for weeks on end pointing out to the Government the errors of their ways and what should be done and must be done, things any student of elementary economics knows should be done, but we would not change the attitude on the other side of the House because, though the numbers may be small, the decision is taken in the division lobby. What could the Opposition do when the Minister for Finance came in here one morning and by a simple order took about £16 million out of the pockets of those using motor cars? Where is the good in blaming the Opposition for that?  What could we do except point out the injustice of it. We will continue to move divisions.</P>
    <P>What are we going to have?  Are we going to have nationalisation?  Are we going to have socialism?  Are we going to have private enterprise?  Are we going to have collective bargaining or wage fixing by legislation?  Nobody knows the answers to these questions. The Government have produced no programme.  They have produced no blueprint for the future.  The pundits weigh up the figures&mdash;1 per cent down here, 8 per cent up there and 7 per cent up or down somewhere else. Things are holding well and people will be able to stick it out for another while.  But the great mass of the people are suffering all the time.  The value of <Col N="1675" /> money grows less.  There are fewer in employment.  There is widespread frustration.  Students passing out from post-primary and third level education have no guidance and they do not know where the future may lead them. Generally we are in the situation in which we were in 1957, except that the situation now is much worse.</P>
    <P>This legislation tells one important set of workers they must not exceed the terms of the agreement signed in June last and modified in the first week of June this year.  That is not an exercise in coping with the seriousness of the situation.  There are two important points in this legislation.  If a wage agreement emerges and it is more advantageous than the provisions of the agreement referred to in this Bill, will the Minister permit bank officials to move up in line with that national wage agreement?  If there is no national wage agreement and there is a free for all, will the Minister still make an order prohibiting bank officials from any improvement in the terms of their agreement?  It may not be possible to answer these questions and therein lies the proof that this legislation is precipitate, brought in at a time when it is likely to prejudice a delicate situation.  It should have been delayed for at least another week.  That would not be too long in the circumstances. This Bill is like the Sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of the negotiators, a possible guideline to the people balloting in the national wage agreement and a possible threat. Which it is intended to be I am not sure, but it is certainly inopportune.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of talk about the lack of programmes and policies. I have had a good deal of experience in the production of suitable policies and programmes.  One thing is certain: this country will make no real progress unless the partners in society, as they are called now, the workers and the employers and the Government, work in harmony, each determined to play their part in lifting the country out of the rut.  Until we reach that situation we shall make no progress; we will not have that rapid expansion that will create job opportunities for <Col N="1676" /> our growing population as well as for the chronic unemployed that we have had with us for so long.  A policy which does not provide for that cooperation will achieve no worth-while success.</P>
    <P>It is only when we give to the worker a just return for what he does and to the investor a just return for the money he invests and when the Government make it possible for both of them to co-operate with each other that we can look forward to real progress in any sector of the community. It is only then we can have the wealth and the means of generating it so that we can redistribute it to our senior citizens and those unfortunate people in our society, who, due to no fault of their own, are unable to earn their own livelihood.</P>
    <P>That is the simple answer but the programme that will create it is not so simple.  It can be applied if we are given the proper conditions and circumstances. A strong single party Government with the necessary idealism and determination is most essential to that set of circumstances. We have been told that this legislation is in the national interest, which implies that those of us opposing it are doing something against the national interest.  If by opposing it we really rock the Government into a sense of responsibility and force them perhaps to try their luck with the people for a new mandate, then our action in opposing it is really in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that next Sunday we will hear not the Minister for Labour being interviewed on the programme &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; but the Minister for Finance, because some months ago he was interviewed and asked to make statements in relation to a statutory pay pause.  He said: &ldquo;It is not the intention of the Government and nowhere have the Government said they will introduce a statutory pay pause.&rdquo; When the interviewer quoted to him what he had said: &ldquo;Under no circumstance will any increases be permitted this year&rdquo; he replied by saying: &ldquo;Where is the statutory pay pause in that?&rdquo;  I hope that particular interviewer will have the opportunity of <Col N="1677" /> putting those questions to him again next Sunday in relation to this Bill. This again is a complete turnabout.</P>
      <P>The complete lack of understanding by the Minister for Labour of what is actually contained in the Bill shocked me more than anything else. I am convinced he was quite unaware what this Bill really contains. I do not know when he first saw the Bill.  By shaking his head and tut-tutting when Deputy Colley was speaking he denied that this Bill contained a wage freeze.  When he was asked to indicate a passage of the Bill which referred to the national wage agreement or to the Labour Court he would not reply.  I hope, when he replies to the debate, he will answer the points put to him by Deputy Colley.</P>
      <P>Is this Bill the thin edge of the wedge?  If the Government are not successful in achieving what we all hope will be achieved, a national wage agreement, is this the thin edge of the wedge?  Will other sectors have a statutory pay freeze implemented? If not, I see this as discriminating against a section of the community.</P>
      <P>The dangers to the economy of excessive wage increases at the present time have already been spelt out. When this party were in Government we set out the guidelines before wage negotiations took place.  We stated quite clearly what the economy could contain.  If we said 9 per cent, that was the limit at which any national wage agreement could be implemented. When we threatened to introduce legislation to implement this limit on the size of the wage agreement we were pilloried not only by the trade union movement but by members of this Government.  However, the unions stated quite categorically that they did not like this type of legislation going on the Statute Book and they agreed to abide by the guidelines set out by the Government.  That was the way we operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we have a former trade union official, as Minister for Labour, standing over legislation of this kind it makes one realise the hypocrisy of this Minister for Labour.  If he had <Col N="1678" /> any principles at all he would either resign his post or make some gesture. He has no intention of doing that because he is without principle.  Deputy Colley referred to speeches made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Corish, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garret FitzGerald and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Justin Keating, when in Opposition and their statements in relation to pay pauses.  The difference is that we were restricted to the limit but they are coming in and saying that there will be no wage increase and nowhere in the Bill does it say that any wage increases will be tied to any national wage agreement, whatever figure comes from the employers and the employees.  This is the real proof that we now have what is becoming a totalitarian Government, that a measure as important as this is so restricted that very few of the backbenchers of the biggest party in the House are able to get in and say what they feel about this legislation.  It is so confined in time that we are unable to express our dissatisfaction with this Bill.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The gardaí are investigating incidents involving forged notes and a number of prosecutions are pending.  They have also issued warnings about forged notes and will do so when and as often as they think useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the issue of the counterfeit notes dates back for a period of approximately six months?  Will he state what steps were taken to get to the source of the notes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda are investigating, in accordance with normal police procedures, the appearance of these notes in public in an effort to trace the source.  So far they have been unsuccessful in tracing the source but the investigations are still proceeding. A number of people found in possession of them and attempting to pass them have been prosecuted and the prosecutions are pending.  The Garda are satisfied that the publicity the matter got last December when it first came to notice was effective in warning the public of the danger.  While they would like to come on the source of the notes, I understand that the existence of these notes is now so well known as to blunt any possibility of their doing harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what steps have been taken to acquaint the public with the methods used in producing the notes?  For example, what steps are being taken to make the public aware that the serial numbers of the notes are not in order and are at odds with the notes in circulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda issued a notice on 23rd December, 1975, drawing attention to the existence of the forged notes.  Their existence also got publicity in a newspaper at that time. I have no doubt the Deputy's question today will be of considerable assistance <Col N="1683" /> in alerting the public once more to the possibility that some of these may still be in circulation.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the caravan is in as bad a condition <Col N="1684" /> as the Deputy says.  I understand it needs internal and external painting and that a step at the door needs replacement as does glass in one of the windows.  These matters have been brought to the attention of the owner to have them repaired.  The comfort of the men on duty is kept under consideration at all times.  It may be decided, possibly, to replace the caravan by an Office of Public Works hut in the event of the owner not bringing the caravan up to a standard deemed satisfactory.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney knows as well as anyone in this House that there is no right to physically abuse anybody.  I will repeat my answer.  I have no evidence whatever to sustain the suggestion that the rights of persons arrested under the Acts in question are not being observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to allay the fears which are being raised naturally by many and varied rumours that <Col N="1686" /> prisoners are being improperly treated, will the Minister make very specific investigations into the rumours of which he must be just as aware as I am that prisoners are being abused while in custody?</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Blaney I do not like to hear of these rumours. It is unfortunate that they are being perpetrated.  If Deputy Blaney or anyone else has a specific instance in which such allegations are made and can be referred to, if he conveys it to me the Garda will be only too willing and anxious to investigate it.  Blanket rumours and blanket allegations cannot be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the action he proposes to take in response to the call by Cavan County Council for an inquiry into alleged abuse of prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution passed by Cavan County Council called for a Garda inquiry into allegations of ill-treatment of certain persons who were arrested during the investigation into the recent shooting in Cavan town.  As already announced publicly by the Garda authorities, if any person makes a complaint to them that he has been ill-treated while in Garda custody, such complaint will be fully and impartially investigated by the Garda.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner that no complaint has been made to the Garda by any of the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My information in this case is that prisoners were abused physically, that they made their complaints, that they would not be allowed to see their solicitors, that they would not be allowed to see their families.  One prisoner was informed his mother had taken very ill.  Later during interrogation he was informed that his mother had died. Neither was true.  This is what the Cavan County Council resolution was all about.  Since the Minister is looking for specific cases he might <Col N="1687" /> take up this one and follow it to a conclusion to bear out or refute entirely the information emanating at the moment from people immediately concerned in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a specific allegation.  I reject again this blanket allegation made by Deputy Blaney. As I said in reply to the question: &ldquo;I am informed by the Commissioner that no complaint has been made to the Garda by any of the persons concerned&rdquo;.  I might add it is standard practice for certain elements in our society, ill-disposed to the Garda and opposed to the rule of law and the democratic institutions, to shout &ldquo;torture&rdquo; when the gardaí apprehend them for their offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing a grave disservice to the Garda in this case and, perhaps, in other cases. I was asked to raise in this House the matter which Cavan County Council have already brought to his notice by way of a resolution and in respect of which I am fully assured there is ample evidence that what I have said is quite correct&mdash;not only physical abuse while under arrest, but also this further sort of torture.</P>

They are the people to investigate specific complaints made against them in respect of a specific instance.  In <Col N="1688" /> regard to the alleged incidents in Cavan, may I repeat for the third time that no complaint has been made to the Garda by any of the persons concerned.  If they have a complaint to make, it is to the Garda they should make it and not to Deputy Blaney or to newspapers.  If it is a <i>bona fide</i> complaint it will be investigated.</P>

      <P>The Galway Association for Mentally Handicapped Children is supported by the Western Health Board, which I understand has promised a grant of £20,000 to the association for the current year.  The board has still under consideration the association's request for an increase in that amount.</P>

      <P>It is the health board who are entitled to give the grant.  As I have said to the Deputy in the original reply, the Western Health Board are considering the possibility of giving an increased grant over and above the sum of £20,000 which has already been notified to them.  I cannot anticipate the decision of the Western Health Board in that matter, but I hope they will be generous towards this association.</P>

The allocation this year is £20,000, and there is still a shortfall.  The association cannot open the day care centres planned for Glenmaddy and Carraroe unless some assistance is forthcoming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not decide the amount which this association gets. It is the Western Health Board. There was a fair increase in the allocations in 1975 over 1974, and the same allocation has been made by the Western Health Board this year, £20,000, but as I have said before, the health board are considering whether they can increase that allocation.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the provision of educational facilities for these children should be the full responsibility of the state and that associations such as the Galway Association for Mentally Handicapped Children should not be expected to raise this huge amount of money that is necessary to keep the services going?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately I would like to see the State taking responsibility for such activities as are undertaken by this association. There are very many well intentioned associations in the whole country who find themselves in difficulty.  One source of revenue is the health board and the other source is the revenue they can raise by their own efforts. I do not know whether they will be <Col N="1692" /> successful in meeting their commitments from moneys they raise by their own efforts.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that while these organisations are doing extremely valuable work, there are thousands of such agencies who, when they find themselves in financial difficulties, appeal to the Minister for Health.  The allocations made are fairly substantial and even though they may not be quite enough, I could not guarantee that I would be able to allocate any more money to any of the health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of registers of the type envisaged by the Deputy is one of the main recommendations of the report of a Committee on Non-Accidental Injury to Children which was published recently.</P>
      <P>The views of the various health and social services interests involved with this problem of non-accidental injury to children have been sought on the report.  When these views are to hand and have been considered, I intend to issues guidelines on the procedures to be adopted for the future identification of these children and for the management of this problem.  These guidelines will cover the question of the establishment of registers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I do not think the Deputy's supplementary question was necessary because I agree with him entirely.  What he has said has been borne out by the report of the Committee on Non-Accidental Injury to Children.  The main thing the Deputy wants to ascertain is whether or not a register will be kept. A register will be kept but as I have said I have sent the report that was published recently to the health agencies to get their views on it.  I have no doubt that one of the main recommendations, which is the establishment of a register will be adopted by them and I personally would approve of that.  Whether or not it would be <Col N="1694" /> a central register has not been decided and whether or not it would be a register for each health board has not yet been decided but, again, I would favour the establishment of a register in each of the health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the time a register is established, would the Minister consider sending a notice to all hospitals in the larger cities telling them to watch out for these battered babies because we know that the practice is that the people who injure children send them to one hospital one week and to another hospital the following week?  It would probably take a year before the register is ready.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>All these recommendations including the one to which Deputy Moore referred are contained in the report and I have no doubt that the recommendations will be generally accepted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Income guidelines which are used in determining eligibility for medical cards are fixed by the chief executive officers of the health boards.  The chief executive officers keep the guidelines under regular review and adjust them periodically in line with changes in the cost of living.  The guidelines now in use were introduced on 1st January, 1976. I understand that the chief executive officers will review these guidelines, and decide whether any change is now called for, when information on the change in the consumer price index up to mid-May, 1976, becomes available.</P>

Would he not agree that the inflationary trends have not been arrested in 1976 and could he give a good reason why the same should not apply this year?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a programme of summer camp training and consider that it is a pretty full programme.  You cannot take in people today and send them on camp tomorrow.  They should, to some extent, first prove their interest in the FCA and prove their patriotism before they are sent on camp.  I think the present situation is satisfactory. The numbers are large.  The effective strength on 31st May, 1976, was 17,987 while on 31st May, 1975, it was only 17,504.  Also, we have 426 members of the FCA employed fulltime on security duties with the permanent <Col N="1703" /> Defence Forces.  We are in the process of examining the organisation of the FCA.  Whether there will be a decision to make changes when the military authorities have completed their investigation I cannot say because I have not yet got the report.

We have got to look at the other side as well, the fact that there are 200 serving soldiers seeking living quarters.  I am, as it were, on the horns of a dilemma, a desire to help the overholders and the serving soldiers.  The Deputy may take it that we will try to help the overholders.  We have given them their gratuities in order to help them to change houses, to seek other accommodation.  That has happened in a few cases.</P>

If allowances are given to Army men for certain duties such as going to the Border from another part of the country, or for security duties or guard duties in other parts of the country, these are in the nature of <i>ex gratia</i> allowances, which is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Special allowances are payable to officers and men where they are called upon to perform particularly onerous or exceptionally demanding duties. Since 1972, personnel engaged in Border areas involving general disturbances and extended hours of duty have been paid special allowances. The Border allowance was introduced in January, 1972, was increased from 1st November, 1973, and again from 1st November, 1974.  The current rates are: married officers, £1.35 per day; single officers, £1.20 per day; married men, £1.15 per day; single men, £1.05 per day.</P>
      <P>A security allowance was introduced in May, 1974, at the rate of £1 per officer or man in respect of security duties, only one payment being payable to any officer or man in any 24-hour period.  The allowance was increased to £1.50 as from 1st November, 1974.  The security duties include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) Duties in relation to the rendering of aid to the Civil Power, for <Col N="1708" /> example, guards on vital installations, road check point duty, support in arrests, escorting civil prisoners;</P>
    <P>(ii) Guards on military installations, fire pickets;</P>
    <P>(iii)  Barrack orderly officers and barrack orderly sergeants.</P>
    <P>This allowance was introduced as a measure of compensation for the increase in the amount of duties and as many of the duties are over and above the normal peacetime pattern of military duties.  Personnel on duty in the detention barracks, Curragh Training Camp, in which civilian prisoners are held are paid allowances as follows: Governor, £2.70 per day; Deputy Governor, £1.80 per day; other officers, £1.35 per day; men, £1.15 per day.</P>
    <P>The following sums are included in the Defence Estimate for 1976 to meet the cost of the allowances: Border allowance, £633,000; Security allowance and Detention Barracks allowance, £470,000, total £1,103,000.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the similarity in the duties of Garda and Army personnel on Border duty and is this not showing up the Army in so far as their allowances are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has not been my experience.  So far as I know Army personnel are pleased with these allowances and are happy that they operate differently from the payment of overtime.  Because personnel living in barracks undertake guard duty or checkpoint work, it would be difficult to work out a roster of overtime for them and, in any case, it would be wrong to have a system of overtime in the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister not realise the similarity that is developing as between the role of Army personnel along the Border and that of Garda personnel?  In having regard to this similarity one must compare also the question of remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The roles of both Army and Garda personnel are similar <Col N="1709" /> to some extent in some cases but differ very much in others.  For instance, the Army man has only the citizen's power of arrest while the Garda has very different powers of arrest.  So far as I know all Army personnel on Border and security duty who are receiving these allowances are happy with them.  It would be regrettable if a hare raised here by anyone would have the effect of making them unhappy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Questions I was expressing surprise that a former trade union official, the Minister for Labour, would be introducing a measure of this kind.  However I understand that the Minister has no ambition to be a trade union official again at any time in the future and, perhaps, a trade union would not find him very attractive in the light of his supporting this sort of legislation.  One cannot help wondering where stand some of those great defenders of <Col N="1715" /> workers' rights who in the past came into this House to defend the right of free collective bargaining.  I refer to such Deputies as the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government, who said on one occassion that he would fight tooth and nail to prevent the enactment of this sort of legislation.  Also, the newly-elected Deputy for Dublin South-West, who represents a large working-class area.  We have not heard from Deputy Halligan so far.  One would have thought that he would take the opportunity of this occasion to make his maiden speech.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House very long because there are many members of my party who wish to speak to the measure.  This morning both Deputies Fitzgerald and Colley appealed continuously to the Minister to indicate where in this legislation there is reference either to the Labour Court or to a national wage agreement. The Minister refused to comply with such requests but we will ensure that he will have adequate time to reply to the debate.  I trust that when replying he will be able to indicate to us that this is not a statutory wage freeze. This legislation is brought forward at a time when further price increases are being announced.  If my ears did not deceive me I heard on the news this morning that the present spate of increases has been sanctioned by the National Prices Commission.  This is another case of the Government passing the buck.  The NPC can only recommend: it is for the Government to sanction.  This Government have been attempting deliberately to pass responsibility for price increases to bodies appointed by them.</P>
      <P>The bank officials do not want a strike.  At a time when their negotiations were at a very delicate stage the Minister for Finance made his intervention, thereby hardening the attitude of the officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has talked of the necessary for a new budget this year in certain circumstances.  I would venture to say that we can expect a series of mini-budgets of the type we <Col N="1716" /> have had during the past few years. The first of these new mini-budgets for this year is represented in the sanctioning of an increase in ESB charges to the tune of a further £6 million. The ship of State is totally out of control. There is no leadership.  In such circumstances is it any wonder that there is confusion and dissatisfaction among the people?  I trust that by the time this debate has ended the Minister for Labour will understand the full implications of the Bill.  From the denials which emanated from him this morning it would appear that he has no such understanding now.</P>
    <P>No Fianna Fáil Government ever introduced legislation similar to that before us.  The maximum we ever did was to control the amount of a wage increase.  We never imposed a wage freeze.  We merely restricted the limit beyond which wages could not be increased. Where is the so-called national partnership about which the Government love to speak?  There is certainly no partnership in this legislation. I do not know how the Minister for Labour will look trade union members in the face after the introduction of this type of legislation.  It is disgraceful because it is also discriminatory. He has singled out a section of the community.  I would be interested to know whether this legislation is to be carried through to the rest of the community or does the Minister intend descending on one section only with this legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief in my comments on this Bill.  I preface my remarks with a very strong appeal to each and every member of the Irish Bank Officials' Association to postpone the strike threatened to commence on Monday morning next.  I make that urgent appeal because I believe it is vital that it should not take place.  I know a lot of bank staff throughout the country and have friendly and cordial relations with a few hundred of them.  As somebody who has a certain amount of dealings on a dayto-day basis with banking staffs throughout the country, I recognise that they are a very dedicated section of the community who work hard and <Col N="1717" /> are highly efficient.  I make that appeal to them, recognising that they are conscientious people.  If they decide to postpone their strike, I believe the Irish Bank Officials' Association will be giving a lead to the country, a lead in the right direction, and setting an example for other sections of the community.  The precipitate action of a strike has widespread repercussions and a postponement can often be of immense value.</P>
      <P>Ireland, like every other country throughout the world, is beginning to emerge from a recession.  We have gone through a difficult number of years with the oil crisis and other serious problems.  Just as we emerge from this recession, with the economy about to get moving again, the serious damage a bank strike could cause would be so horrible it is something we dislike contemplating.</P>
      <P>I remember the results of the last bank strike here.  I cashed a lot of cheques for a lot of people and was exceptionally lucky in that every person with whom I had business dealings had no difficulties whatsoever. But I do know many honest people who fell during the last bank strike, a lot of whom never succeeded in getting their businesses moving again. The last bank strike was serious and lasted a long time.  I believe that the present dispute, if it leads to a strike, could be equally protracted.  The damage it could do to our economy would take years and years to undo. It could lead to increased unemployment, job opportunities now becoming available being lost and small businesses and firms having to close down because they would be unable to continue.  If the strike takes place it could and will mean that a lot of people who import goods will be forced out of business because the foreign firms from whom they buy would not accept cheques because of worldwide credit facilities being scarce and tight.  For those reasons it is incumbent on us all to ensure that this strike does not come off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not interfere with the rights of negotiation.  At this juncture negotiations are continuing and I hope they will lead to some <Col N="1718" /> satisfactory conclusion.  This threatened bank strike&mdash;and it was threatened prior to the Minister for Finance's remarks&mdash;has led to a lot of money leaving the country.  There are 144 Deputies in this House.  All of us have a responsibility.  For the sake of each person we represent it is sad to see so much money leaving the country at present.  Such responsibility devolves on all of us, on the Irish Bank Officials' Association, the negotiating body and everybody else. If it is necessary that discussions take place between the Minister for Labour, the bank officials and the negotiating body on behalf of the banks, they should be undertaken as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the bank officials to show a spirit of goodwill and cooperation. I would go so far as to say that a spirit of patriotism is needed at this juncture in that the devastating effects of such a strike on our economy cannot be overlooked.  I sincerely hope this strike does not take place on Monday next.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of our spokesman, Deputy G. Fitzgerald, and other speakers from this side of the House who have already outlined clearly our party's position in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to sympathise with the Minister because I believe, that in presenting the Bill, he did not know what it was about.  It is quite clear that this is a Richie Ryan Bill, that the Bill was prepared by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; by the Minister for Finance, merely handed to the Minister for Labour because, in our questioning of the Minister for Labour, he did not seem to understand what the Bill was about.  He gave no indication whatever in his opening speech as to what the Bill was about, and no indication that it was imposed on him by another member of the Government or by the Government as a whole.  One would have expected the <Col N="1719" /> Minister to be able clearly to tell us what the Bill was about and what it was designed to do.  The Minister tells us the banks and their employees are not parties to the national wage agreement so the Bill does not deal with the national wage agreement.  He goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Most people who have considered the matter will, I think, agree that no pay settlement of a national character is without a follow-on effect.  I would not maintain that an agreement by the banks and their employees must be a replica of any national agreement because, of course, the banking services have certain unique features.</P>
      <P>Later in his speech he says:</P>
      <P>The Bill in no way impedes continuation of negotiation between the banks and their employees for a new 1976 bank pay agreement.</P>
      <P>If this is a Bill to correct a trend then a precedent is being established and every Minister will be able to bring in legislation to correct trends being set by some group or other.  Is this a beginning?  Is the Minister testing reaction by introducing a measure like this?  He does not indicate that the Bill will be affected in any way by the national wage agreement.  He says the Bill is similar to Bills introduced some time ago.  This has been disproved by Deputy Colley.  This Bill is completely different from those introduced in 1975.  Admittedly it has some of the undesirable features, but it is not by any means similar.  No explanatory memorandum accompanied this Bill.  Such a memorandum is usual with Bills of a technical nature.  To me this is an indication that those who compiled the Bill did not themselves understand it.  It shows the confusion in the Government.  It is clear this Bill was imposed on the Minister. He did not seem to be able to answer questions asked and he did not try to be in any way helpful when speakers on this side looked for additional information to enable them to debate the Bill fully and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reference to the national wage agreement.  Will the Bill come <Col N="1720" /> into effect if there is a national wage agreement?  In that eventuality what action does the Minister propose to take?  The Minister says the banks and their employees are not parties to the national wage agreement so that agreement is not a factor.  What is the factor?  Is the Bill designed to correct a trend?  Will we have a repetition of this legislation?  It is discriminatory legislation.  Not knowing the real reason behind the Bill it is very difficult to discuss it.</P>
    <P>This is not just a question of how much bank officials should be paid.  A serious situation exists.  I believe that if the Minister and his colleagues were more discreet in their approach to the problem we would not have the present parlous situation.  The Minister is being saddled with the problem of another Minister but, of course, collective responsibility enters into the picture. This is a wage freeze, the first such wage freeze to come before this House for quite a long time in this particular form.  There is no indication that, if a national wage agreement is reached, the Minister will repeal this measure.  This is a very undesirable type of legislation.  The Minister talks about follow-on effects.  Everything that is done has a follow-on effect of some kind.  Nobody wants industrial disruption anywhere at this critical stage in the life of the nation and every effort should be made at ensuring there are no stoppages of any kind.  Irresponsible statements from some Ministers have not helped in this dispute as they have not helped in other disputes.  Perhaps the Minister could give us a little more information so that speakers who follow will be able to discuss the Bill more effectively.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister waiting to find out the reaction of our party?  Is he making up his mind as he goes along?  If that is the position then the Government have no predetermined policy on this. We have reached a low level when the Government are not able to give us the reason for the Bill.  It is a discriminatory Bill.  If the Minister is merely testing reaction he is taking a calculated risk which could have serious repercussions both for the economy and the Government.  Bank officials are <Col N="1721" /> reasonable people, and like all representatives, they can discuss their problems frankly in a favourable climate.  If we had that climate we would not have this undesirable situation.</P>
    <P>This is a battering ram.  The penalties are set out in section 4.  Those who trangress will be fined.  They will not be imprisoned.  In default of payment of the fine property can be seized and the sheriff may dispose of the property seized at the appropriate rate.</P>

There is no reference in the Minister's speech to the principles of the Bill.

The Minister did not do so in his speech today and he did not present <Col N="1723" /> an explanatory memorandum as was done on the two previous Bills. During the Minister's Second Reading speech on those other Bills he referred to particular sections and the effect they would have.  If the Minister referred to sections in his Second Reading speech.  I could refer to them.  As he did not, as he does not know what he is talking about, as he has not come into the House and made the best effort he could in presenting the Bill and has not given us sufficient information, you cannot blame Members of the House for trying to obtain information and commenting on sections of the Bill.

      <P>So far as the sections of the Bill are concerned one cannot refer to them.  What can one refer to? Can I refer to the stupidity of the Minister for bringing in legislation and not presenting us with effective information?  Is that all I can refer to?  That is the situation I find myself in.  Other Members who have spoken have found themselves in the same situation.  There has been a lack of information which is either by design or otherwise.  If it is by design it is done to prevent Opposition Members from expressing their viewpoints fully and effectively.  One needs to have knowledge to deal with this important matter in any depth.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the section dealing with penalties.  We have progressive improvements in employment in many sectors.  Under this Bill the conditions of the people concerned cannot be improved even though they are necessary. If improved conditions are necessary and the employer wishes to provide them the threat of the sheriff is imposed on him.  Section 3 (2) (b) states that the Minister may from time to time by order:</P>
      <P>prohibit the making, implementing or continued implementing by the banks ... of any amendments ... or more favourable terms or conditions of employment for them other than any such amendments or variations agreed to by, or on behalf of, these banks and these employees on or before the 23rd day of June, 1976.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalties are applied to this section. If I agreed with the legislation and with the principles behind it, I certainly would not agree to this low down tactic.  Our spokesman has clearly indicated our position in relation <Col N="1725" /> tion to the national pay agreement, this Bill and other legislation which has come before us on previous occasions, the line we took on previous occasions, the line we are taking on this occasion and the reasons why. This is a Bill of victimisation, one for which there was no explanation given and one about which the Minister knows little or nothing.  I am sure by the time the debate closes he will have accumulated some information on which he can make a dart at replying to some of the matters raised.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not been as forthright on this occasion as he was on previous occasions?  Why has he not given the information to the Opposition?  Tomorrow we will be told the Opposition did not know what they were talking about.  This may well be when the Minister does not tell us what the real meaning behind the Bill is.  I hope this will not be a trend in the House.  I hope, when we get a Bill in the future, we will get some type of explanation the same as we got in the past.  Is there a paper shortage?  Can they not afford it at this stage?  Is there some reason for it?  This can be interpreted as a threat to the freedom of negotiations and if that is the case it is a serious matter. The Minister has stated that this measure is an effort to correct a follow-on effect but this is nonsense.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that more information has not been given.  I want to express my complete and absolute disgust at the way this was treated by the Minister and the Government.  I have great sympathy with our spokesman on Labour for having to deal with the Bill.  It was crudely circulated yesterday without any explanation and the Minister did not offer any explanation in his speech today.  We are not able to refer to sections in the Bill.  The next thing that will happen is that we will be presented with a Bill, the Minister will make no statement and we will get no explanation but the Opposition will be expected to debate it.</P>
    <P>If this Bill has done anything, I hope it has brought to the notice of the Government that we will root out what they are trying to conceal.  We want an explanation about this matter. <Col N="1726" /> I am not going to deal with the other sections because I know that I would be ruled out of order.  However, I shall deal with some of those matters at some length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the bankers will not be jailed but, as was pointed out on a previous Bill, the doorman or the charwoman of the bank can be jailed.  The Minister told us previously that the law will apply, for instance, to the charwoman and if it so dictates she can be jailed.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been produced here as a matter that might be called on to be made use of in a situation of emergency.  I am not going to approach this Bill with the air levity that was attempted by the last speaker.  This is a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>All of us are aware of the fact that there is balloting on and consideration of a pending new national wage agreement.  While the last speaker was not able to understand the principles of the Bill, it is well to look at the heading of the Bill which is entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide, in the national interest, for the regulation, for a limited period,...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> We have got to be responsible people in this House.  People outside the House have got to be responsible when it comes to wages, employment terms and negotiations.  I have heard it freely said in the business world that if we do not have a national wage agreement our business worlds will have considerable difficulties not alone in maintaining their present trading relationships and honouring their contracts but it will be practically impossible to obtain new business.  If we do not have a national wages agreement there is a likelihood of a free for all.  I will show the relevance of that to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Businessmen, if faced with a free for all or unknown terms with regard to a very important element in their costings, will not be able to quote terms for the supply of their goods.  They will not be able to make forward arrangements for finance and they will be virtually hamstrung.  Farmers and others will be disinclined to do business with Irish firms.  Therefore, it is important that every Member of this House should approach this Bill in a very serious frame of mind and have full regard for the very serious consequences if the negotiations at present going on do not come to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>If the negotiations going on today do not come to a fruitful and satisfactory result, I should like to remind the participants that I do not think all negotiation procedures have as yet been exhausted.  I am being very particular in the words I am choosing.  I am also conscious of the fact that the negotiations between the IBAO and the banks were in being on 27th May, 1976, that the first offer was made by the banks on 14th June, 1976, that the offer was rejected, that notice was immediately given of strike action and that the rank and file of the IBAO had no time to consider the situation following on the offer or the terms of the offer.  If we in this House and in this country subscribe to democratic principles, all I can say is they have been ignored in this case.  It is unfortunate that such precipitate action has been taken.  The right to strike is a <Col N="1728" /> very precious right.  It is also a right that should not be abused or wantonly used.  I am not naming any people or any group of people who may be responsible for the strike taking place on next Monday.  All I will say is: he whom the cap fits may wear it.  It is fairly obvious that mistakes have been made.</P>
    <P>It is rather horrifying to me as a normal citizen to see a situation, arising as it has arisen in this case, in such a precipitate fashion.  I do not think there is a single practising lawyer who, when he goes to negotiate with his opposite number before the case comes up in court, rejects it out of hand and goes in and fights the case without first going back and out of hand and goes in and fights the case without first going back and finally consulting his client.  What I am saying&mdash;and I do not think it has been said yet in any single contribution&mdash;is that there is a very large body of opinion in all ranks of the IBOA who do not want this strike to take place, and do not want to be a party to the strike.  That includes all ranks of workers and salaried people in the banking world here.</P>
    <P>I have been informed recently that there was a meeting in a certain area at which 70 per cent were clearly against strike action.  This bears out what I have already said.  There has been a precipitate use of the strike weapon.  I am making a final appeal to those who may take the trouble of reading my utterances in this House. All steps have not yet been exhausted. If the final negotiations break down, in all fairness, and in view of the fact that no ballot has as yet been taken of the rank and file members of the IBOA in relation to this situation, there should be a private postal ballot after the full facts are given to the members of the IBOA.</P>
    <P>I have been informed on too many occasions since this trouble has arisen that the people who will be asked to go out on strike on Monday do not know the actual facts of the dispute.  It is a very frightening prospect.  Our banking institutions are going to be brought to a halt and people brought out on strike and these are all educated people.  Indeed, <Col N="1729" /> many of them are a jolly sight better educated than some Members of this House.  This evolution in circumstances like that, with no recognition of the fundamental principles of natural justice and democracy, is a bad evolution for this country.</P>
    <P>I hope other speakers I see in the House will adopt a constructive, conciliatory and helpful approach to this subject, instead of trying to score points concerning the introduction of this Bill.  Might I give the House one quotation which has often been quoted by Members on the other side of the House?  It is a quotation from the annual report of the Central Bank.  The quotation is: in the interests of fairness, incomes restraint must apply to all sections of the community; exemptions for some would serve only to make the burden heavier for others.</P>
    <P>In his speech introducing this Bill the Minister said due regard will have to be had for certain facets concerning the position of bank employees and banks.  This must be in the light of the national guidelines.  Nobody is entitled to be a law unto himself.  We are all members of the same State. We must all make the same sacrifices, if sacrifices have to be made.  We are all members of the same State. We must all make the same sacrifices, if sacrifices have to be made.  We must all recognise that, if we overburden the national cart others will suffer.  I have always been a strong advocate of free collective bargaining. The dates I have given and the facts I have given, which were given to me, I am afraid to say, virtually make a mockery of collective bargaining if we are to have a strike on next Monday without a ballot being taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): Deputy Esmonde made one statement with which I thoroughly agree.  He said all negotiating procedures have not been exhausted.  All negotiating procedures were not exhausted when the Minister for Finance made his irresponsible statement last Thursday.  The final stages of any negotiations are always delicate and any hindrance or any statement can upset the balance and destroy weeks of work.  I have had some experience of negotiating with trade unions.  I know how damaging it can be for one person <Col N="1730" /> around the table to make an irresponsible statement.  It can do untold damage.  I am convinced&mdash;and bank officials and other members of our society have all stated the same thing &mdash;that the statement by the Minister for Finance last Thursday was completely uncalled for and could do nothing but damage.  The banks were not due out on strike until next Monday.  If the Minister for Labour wanted to reach some decision he had plenty of time to implement any legislation he required.  As we know, only one day's debate is being permitted for this important legislation.</P>
      <P>We are discussing this Bill as if it had something to do with prohibiting the strike.  It will not prevent the strike in any way.  It has nothing good, bad, or indifferent to do with the strike.  Strike notice was given a week ago.  We should know exactly where we stand.  This Bill could encourage the strike and make militants out of moderates, of whom there were quite a number a week ago.  I agree with Deputy Esmonde that a substantial number of bank employees were not keen to go on strike three or four weeks ago.  The Minister's irresponsible statement has made militants out of some of them.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what the purpose of the Bill is.  We were not told the banks would breach the national norm.  The bank officials had gone so far, and I do not know how much farther they would have gone.  What negotiations had the Minister for Labour and his Department, or the Minister for Finance and his Department, with the banks' associations?  What knowledge had the Minister for Labour before he introduced this legislation?  My feeling now is that the strike will take place.  There was every hope of a settlement being reached when the Minister for Finance made his statement last Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House are concerned about the national economy. On two occasions before, as Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy Colley pointed out this morning, we supported such legislation, but it was entirely different from this Bill.  At that time there was a wage agreement and any group of people who were <Col N="1731" /> negotiating knew what the norm was. Now, as far as I can see, the bank officials are operating in a vacuum.  It would be very difficult to know how far they could go.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer if this Bill had never come into the House.  There have been statements on both sides of the House expressing concern about the economy and asking the banks' association to withdraw their strike notice and pointing out the dangers that could be inflicted upon the economy.  If we had that type of a debate here without this Bill, it would show everybody concerned that we were conscious of the state of the economy.  Whether this is the Minister's Bill I am not sure, but I do not think he has helped the situation by introducing such legislation when it could have been avoided.  I believe that many members of the association involved in this do not actually know what this Bill contains.</P>
    <P>This Bill could very well be misrepresented. Many people are wondering if this is the first step towards a wage freeze.  Very shortly people will be balloting on a national wage agreement, and I think it is the desire of everyone in this House that a national wage agreement should be accepted as soon as possible.  If there is one thing damaging to the economy it is longdrawn-out negotiations in any agreement. Many of these agreements expired from three to five months ago and when eventually a national wage agreement is signed there will be retrospective payment.  It is of vital importance to industries to know exactly where they stand.  Everyone knows what effect that will have on costings, which have to be adjusted from time to time.  Therefore, I would hope that agreement would be arrived at as soon as possible.  Unfortunately this Bill contains sections which would lead many people throughout the country to wonder what is in the Minister's mind.  There could be dangerous implications in it which may influence the decision of unions when they come to vote in a few weeks' time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> If a strike takes place it will have serious repercussions on many industries, tourism and various other activities.  What we are considering here is whether this Bill will avert a strike.  What is it doing to stave off the strike which is imminent?  While we are delighted with the new appointment of the Minister for Labour and while it may have been necessary for him to be in Geneva, I believe the Minister should have been in this country over the past four or five days urging both sides to come to an agreement, pointing out the effect a strike would have on the economy. He should have been fully engaged in the affairs of his Department involving a national issue such as this. This is the most important national issue that has come before this House in the past few years.  If the Minister had used his energies fully, this Bill would be unnecessary.  I am convinced that you can never make people work by legislation.  This legislation now before the House has, in my opinion, embittered many members of the banking fraternity.  I would be the last to encourage a strike in any way, but there were many moderates among the bank officials over the past three or four weeks and I believe this Bill has hardened their attitude towards the whole situation.</P>
    <P>If it is the aim of the Government to keep all sections within the norm of a national wage agreement&mdash;and there is nothing wrong with that&mdash;such legislation as this should be introduced when there is no dispute arising. Bringing it in when a particular group of people are involved creates a very difficult situation.  Maybe the Minister for Labour should be updating our whole negotiating machinery and looking at the whole structure of wage negotiations, but what is attempted in this Bill is a dangerous procedure.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if this procedure is necessary.  I do not see at any time that the banks were exceeding the national norm.  I do not believe they had done it up to three days ago. They certainly had not done it when the Minister for Finance made his statement.  This Bill may have encouraged the bank officials to go on <Col N="1733" /> strike, but it is not necessary because the banks had exceeded the national norm where the Minister was concerned. Therefore what is the Bill doing?  The Bill is making it more difficult to come to an agreement.</P>
    <P>With proper negotiations on both sides I believe we would have arrived at a solution.  But we get the Minister for Finance in Rathmines a few days ago preaching the virtues of people he criticised about four weeks ago.  When people at the IMI conference in Killarney and other leading members of industry pointed out to the Minister the incompetent handling of the economy and what was necessary to rectify the situation, the Minister tagged them as profiteers, but he had no hesitation in putting forward their virtues and saying how right they were when he wanted to prove his case.  That is downright hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde admitted the necessity of this Bill in view of the grave national economic situation we have today.  This is a very sensitive area and we should be very careful to ensure that something is not read into this Bill which would jeopardise the whole trade union conference and the national wage agreement we are all hoping for.  I sincerely hope that there is agreement this evening.  We made a responsible statement saying that both the banks and the Government should withdraw their threats and get down to reasonable negotiations.  I hope that can still be achieved.  But I do not believe for one moment that you can legislate to get people working or to regulate them properly.  That must be our last resort if we are to get proper trade and industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I regret that we have to bring in this type of legislation, but I will regret far more if this country is plunged into a bank strike which will wreck our whole economic structure. After the last bank strike, a certain number of people exploited the situation, a number of small companies went bankrupt, and to a certain extent it fuelled inflation.  This will all be repeated.  A bank strike will also damage our tourist trade.  Thousands of people in this country travel with travellers cheques and that would <Col N="1734" /> create a lot of problems.  There are numerous other side effects which it will have on the economy.</P>
    <P>I believe the situation was mishandled. I am convinced that the Minister for Finance should not have made his statement last Thursday.  I also believe that the Minister for Labour should have engaged himself fulltime over the past four or five days in bringing the parties together and pointing out the consequences of their actions.  That would have been more beneficial to the House and to the country than bringing in this Bill, which makes no effort to stop the strike.</P>
    <P>There is confusion in regard to what the Bill contains.  The reason that arose was because the Minister when introducing the Bill at no time referred to any section of the Bill, which is the normal procedure in relation to Bills.  There was no explanatory memorandum.  It was just given to us with a very brief statement from the Minister.  It is a complex but very important Bill, which will affect the future of this country, particularly over the next 12 months.  If a bank strike should occur I would lay the blame fairly and squarely on the Minister for Finance for making an irresponsible statement and on the Minister for Labour for not using all his energies in the past four days in trying to avoid this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have made our case very clear.  The position is that this Bill has been introduced in the middle of negotiations.  That is a very bad way to transact any type of business, especially when negotiations are in progress.  When we brought in a Bill of this nature we were opposed very bitterly by the Labour Party when they had no grounds at all for it.  We feel that the Government should have waited at least another week to see how the negotiations would go in this matter.  From speaking to a number of bank officials I know that they are very annoyed that the weight of legislation is now going to hang over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will not stop a strike.  It is <Col N="1735" /> a Bill to curb incomes, but it does not say what amount of income.  Next week, as far as I know, the ballot will be completed on the national wage agreement and the Government could have waited until that had taken place to see what the position would be.  In fairness I think the negotiators on behalf of the officials did not handle this very well, because some of the officials I spoke to were not acquainted with all the facts.  It seems &mdash;I do not know&mdash;that the executive committee of the Bank Officials Association were given a lot of power. As I see it, there is a lot of room for negotiation, and this should be explored before we are put into a situation where the economy would be in difficulties.  I am alluding to the business community, the companies that are finding it very hard at the moment to keep their heads above water. Companies will have to depend on one another now in regard to honesty in trading, creditworthiness and so forth.</P>
    <P>When the dispute took place some years ago I think it can be said that at that time the economy was not in so critical a situation as it is now.  It then dragged on for months and we saw what happened afterwards.  It took years to clear up the mess.  Companies and individuals went to the wall as a result.  Nobody wants to see this dispute take place but if it does take place the Government must bear a share of the blame especially the Minister for Finance who as usual acted outrageously.  Earlier in the year he said that employees who would look for increases would crucify the country or something to that effect.  Then, when he saw how things were working out he backpedalled. Now most employers and workers wonder what the Government want. They have not told the people what exactly is required.  They did not stick to their policy.  I hope that this dispute will not spread across the board and result in a free for all because that would put the finishing touches to the economy.  It would affect all sections, in agriculture and industry and in all walks of life.</P>
    <P>I trust the negotiations taking place <Col N="1736" /> today will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  I do not know if that is possible in view of the legislation before the House which has aggravated many of the bank officials.  But these officials must also act in a responsible way.  They have secure jobs in the banks while people in other employment do not enjoy the same security.  The bank officials have a responsibility to the nation to ensure that they do nothing that would bring the economy to its knees.  Responsibility lies in many places.  I do not believe the Government handled the wage agreement, or even the negotiations with the banks, in a proper manner. If the strike comes off, the Government will have much to answer for because they have given no clear indication of what they want.  They have bungled everything; one minute you are being crucified; the next you are not&mdash;where do you go?  We must be realistic and know where we are going.  The Government do not know where they are going.  They are all the time waiting for something to happen.  Either they rule the country or they do not.</P>
    <P>Recently some of my colleagues attended the IMA meeting in Tralee where the Minister for Finance heard what was said about the economy.  He had to agree with some things that were said whether he liked them or not: either you rule or you do not.  If you make the policy, you should stick to it but the Government have not done this and that is why we are in the present position.  I hope that the associated banks and the officials will at the last minute be able to hammer out some agreement.  I hate to think of what will happen if the bank employees are called out next Monday. I do not believe that all avenues were explored in the negotiations and I hope a thorough exporation will now take place and that the legislation now before us will not have to come into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not worry.  I shall not take very long and he will be given ample opportunity to reply.  There are valid reasons why this legislation is not suitable at this time.  First, it is being rushed <Col N="1737" /> through after there has been talk of strike and after the Minister for Finance blundered the other night. Also, this legislation contains no reference to any national wage agreement that may be reached.  These considerations, I maintain, make this a potentially dangerous piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>With other Deputies on all sides of the House, I sincerely hope that those involved will pause and consider the very serious possible consequences of precipitate action.  We have had two bank strikes in our history so far but I should like to point to a significant difference between the present situation and the two previous banking disputes.  The last one took place at a time of comparative economic stability and progress.  That was, of course, under the last Administration. Since then we have had more than three years of what I would describe as the frittering away of our financial and material resources by the present Administration.  Second, there are complexities in the banking system now that did not exist then.  One of them is the computer age and another is the widespread number of banking accounts now compared with five or six years ago.</P>
      <P>I would ask those involved to pause and think of the seriousness of the situation.  Previously it was possible for industry and business at least to work their way through the difficulties, but now we know that because of the experiences of some business elements at the end of the last strike, it would be very difficult for anybody to carry on business if there is another bank strike because it will not be possible to cash cheques, to pay wages or, except with considerable difficulty, to provide money to purchase goods.  I was told today of many people in the distributing end who have been informed that if this thing starts next week it will be a case of cash only for goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That makes the situation far more serious than on the previous occasion. The condition of the economy is an added factor.  Therefore, I submit seriously to those who are contemplating bank closures or strike action <Col N="1738" /> that the economic situation here is far too serious to engage in the luxury of a dispute in a vital sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The situation has become overheated and I would put the principal blame for that on the Minister for Finance for his blundering remarks a few days ago at a time when delicate, sensitive negotiations were taking place.  I understand that quite a few of the younger element in the IBOA were incensed by the Minister's remarks. I submit they were entitled to be, but in the circumstances I would recommend to them that they would ignore the Minister's insensitivity, not because the Minister does not deserve censure but in the interests of the welfare of the community.</P>
    <P>I understand a serious situation has already developed, that many millions of pounds have already left the country.  In these circumstances, in relation to this legislation and to any threatened closure, the Government, the banks and the officials should at least await the decision that will be taken on 3rd July.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion, and I think it is shared by many who are engaged in the economic life of the country, that the present reported levels in the agreement to be arrived at in the new national pay agreement are far in excess of what our economy can bear if we are to remain an exporting nation.  They are far beyond the agreement being reached in Britain. Unfortunately, in that situation the Minister for Finance and the Government are not the only but the main culprits in creating a situation where the rates of pay being discussed are far in excess of what the economy can bear.  Because the taxation policy in budget after budget has increased the cost of living, one is naturally driven to ask how can any trade union leader call for restraint when the Minister for Finance has directly increased costs to the individual.  In this area of the development and survival of our economy, I ask one simple question: whom do we think we are that we think we can afford to pay ourselves far beyond the rates agreed on in Britain, and we know <Col N="1739" /> Britain is in trouble?  Why should we think we can get away with it when other countries are putting their economic and fiscal situations in order?</P>
    <P>I repeat that I put the main part of the blame in this area on the shoulders of the Government.  I know there are other circumstances which help to create inflation, but the Government are the main motivators because of lack of direction, of leadership and of determination on the part of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues.  All these elements have created a situation where wage levels are being discussed which are outside our ability to pay if we are to remain in the export business.</P>
    <P>We as a community will have to take a long hard look at ourselves because all around us we have examples of selfishness, of &ldquo;mé féin-ism&rdquo;.  In many areas, particularly monopoly industries&mdash;I refer not only to banks but elsewhere in our economy&mdash;those involved must ask themselves about the morality of taking action not against the old style capitalist but rather against the community which sustains them in protected and secluded employment.  The day has long gone when the strike weapon can affect the position of many employers, of executives or managements.  Nowadays it affects ordinary people.  They are the people whose livelihoods are affected by disputes over which they can have no influence.</P>
    <P>I commend some of the remarks made by Deputy Esmonde who spoke simply and seriously.  I support our opposition to this legislation which I do not think will help at this time.  I ask for serious restraint and reconsideration by those who may become engaged in a dispute next week.  I ask this in the interests of the ordinary people and the economy and future of the country.</P>

      <P>Important but simple to grasp and clear in its intent. The background necessity for this measure on the part of the Government has been to ensure that in any negotiations of a national character, even if they were outside the traditional ambit of the national agreement, the announced settlements should not be such as to further endanger the national consideration of the terms of the national agreement before most of the unions.</P>
      <P>We did this, as Deputies pointed out, at a time when there is no national agreement in existence.  That decision has yet to be made.  In this period when there is no nationally accepted norm, and when the agreements between the banks and their employees is at an end and negotiations are proceeding, it is clear that if one were to stand aside from possible consequences in those negotiations for the national agreement, and for the favourable reception of its terms, any Government could justifiably be criticised very strongly for failure to act. As I said, we have acted in the simplest way possible, wishing our intentions and the consequences of the actions undertaken in this legislation to be as widely understood as possible.  We said that an order would be necessary to carry this out and that on the passage of this measure through the Oireachtas, there would be the necessity to pass the complying order.</P>
      <P>That having been done, if it is necessary&mdash;I have explained already that I hope it will not be necessary&mdash;the effect would be to impose a stay on bank salaries for the five-month period covered by the Bill.  I would have full flexibility in terms of the period covered by that stay.  That flexibility would permit me to impose it, or to remove it, for varying periods, depending on the emergence of an agreement at that level consonant with the possibility and the results coming from the national agreement ballot.  That is the sole intent of this legislation.  It is not very complicated and is very simple in its effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have said that there is no reference to the Labour Court in this legislation.  That is true but reference <Col N="1741" /> to the Labour Court is not excluded here.  I still have powers of reference to the Labour Court.  They are not removed by anything in this legislation. Obviously, it does not need to be underlined that as soon as a norm emerges, and as soon as we can say that there is or is not a national agreement, it would be open to me to refer it to the Labour Court or another acceptable tribunal.</P>

      <P>Presumably we will have to look at the situation after the July meeting and see what appears to be the settlement situation of the incomes question at that time.  The Deputy's question underlines the impossibility in being over-precise at this point on what would then constitute a national norm.  Deputies are quite right in saying that in these technical senses there are differences between this and previous legislation in this area.  On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the principle of legal intervention, which we have seen twice in this House, is also incorporated in this measure.</P>
      <P>We do not have reference to the Labour Court in this Bill and I have explained how that power still resides with us.  We do not have reference specifically to a national agreement for the simple reason that one does not exist at this moment.  Apart from these two respects, the legislation before us is consistent with previous legislation before the House which had the support of all Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been a disappointment to me to note the tenor of certain observations made in the course of this debate.  I wished to ensure that this would not happen in this discussion.  It has been the attempt of the Government side in the discussions today to ensure that our discussions would refrain from exacerbating an already difficult situation.  The powers sought in this legislation are necessary as has been proved from experience of similar problems in this area.  Deputy Colley will know what I mean when I say that the experiences of both he and <Col N="1742" /> the Minister for Labour from 1970 to 1973 underlined the necessity for the measure we had to take, and made it all the more difficult to understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has spoken about intervention and the reactions of the Opposition to various measures produced by him in this House.  There has been a great deal of carelessness in the examples cited by the Opposition to prove the inconsistencies of present Members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equation of the provisions of the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act with the powers of this legislation is extremely careless.  These are totally different types of legislation and we know the different objectives which were sought under the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act.  Yet we heard the Opposition spokesman for Labour, the man who apparently aspires to be a Member of a Government holding that position, apparently without understanding any of the differences between them, citing the remarks of Members of the then Opposition to that legislation.  For his information&mdash;he was not in the House at the time&mdash;I will again, for the record&mdash;and I have to put it on record because great play was made of it today&mdash;that Act made it unlawful for any person to initiate, take part in or assist in a strike in the ESB.  It sought to make it a legal necessity for people to remain at work.  At that time our criticism, and it is still valid, was that we did not know of the existence of a law in a democracy that can force people to go to work.  We do not believe in its efficacy, desirability nor are we aware of its success in any democracy in the western world.  We know the result of that legislation: it was a complete failure.  The strikers on picket were summoned, fined and imprisoned for refusing to pay the fines. As we know, the fines were paid by the ESB.  It was a farcical situation. Yet that was quoted here today as <Col N="1743" /> though we were talking about the same kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>In the same vein of supreme carelessness of what I can only designate as a deplorable descent in demagoguery by leading Members of the Opposition at a time of serious national difficulty, we had similar carelessness exercised when it came to talking about the attitudes of the then Opposition to the general incomes legislation prepared in 1970.</P>
    <P>This was legislation of a general character seeking to hold down the income of every man and woman at work.  Perhaps a party who had been in opposition for many years might be permitted the licence of a little carelessness and inaccuracy, but the attitude adopted here by a man who is a former Minister for Finance and by another who is aspiring to the portfolio of Labour in a Government of the future is an attitude of supreme carelessness.  These are people who, only three or four weeks ago, were preparing for their advent into Government.  How can we suggest adherence to a national pay agreement when no such agreement exists?</P>

      <P>The Opposition neglected to note that the strike notice which is due to expire had already been served at the point at which the Minister made his remarks. Briefly, our position has been to permit negotiations to continue.  It is my genuine desire that they would continue <Col N="1744" /> and to this extent I appealed this morning to both parties concerned to permit time for a review of the difficulties that have arisen in these negotiations.  In the event of such a genuine review I would not see any necessity to utilise the authority being granted to me on foot of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Action such as that proposed here has been proved necessary in the past. There are spokesmen opposite who know from personal experience what happened in the past when such legislation was lacking.  In the period 1970 to 1973 the then Ministers for Finance and Labour, Deputies Colley and Brennan, had several fruitless meetings with the people concerned in this area.  At one of those meetings Deputy Colley stated that if it came to a choice between maintaining the national wage agreement and the closure of the banks, the banks could close.</P>

      <P>Knowing that the discussions are now in progress we would propose to put this necessary measure through this House today and, hopefully, from that position consider how the negotiations are proceeding. Legislation of this kind has had a constructive result before now.  It is possible, even at this late stage, that some kind of reasonable conclusion will be reached in the negotiations.  The Opposition say that if the legislation had been tied to the national wage agreement it would have had their support, but how could this be possible when no such agreement exists? It would be unwise to spell out any such provision in the legislation.  Those Deputies opposite who are acquainted with the negotiations will appreciate that our task must be to permit the maximum flexibility in present circumstances and to ensure by everything we do here that we avert the real possibility of a strike from Monday next.  This factor must be prominent in our considerations in anything we do.  While we must ensure that the results of the negotiations would not damage further the overall success of the national agreement ballot, we must realise that nothing we do would result in a more likely close-down of the banks.</P>
      <P>If Deputies opposite appreciate these two objectives they will understand how every clause in this Bill has been selected to meet the needs of these objectives.  Again I appeal to the Opposition to consider the national interest.  To this extent I appeal in particular to those Deputies who have had many years in government and who from their own experience know the problems we are facing in this case, know the number of meetings that was necessary in the past in order to get agreement on this sort of contentious question, which arises in this instance because settlements in this area have been arrived at outside the ambit of the national agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said this morning, I do not seek of the people concerned in these negotiations actual and absolute replicas <Col N="1746" /> of national agreements.  We simply seek of them a desire that they should not depart too drastically from the criterion of what other people in our community accept.</P>
    <P>I would repeat my call made this morning to the men and women in the banking service: certainly a close down of that important national service at this critical time cannot help the economy and I would seriously doubt that it can help their own wage claim, the case they feel they need to put in the banking service.</P>
    <P>One last point: it has been repeated many times this morning that this was a mandatory wage freeze.  This is a complete travesty of the facts.  We have sought in this Bill simply to do one thing to ensure that whatever bargain would come forth from the discussions between the bank officials and the banks would merely conform to the increases sought and given to what everybody else in the community will get this year.  In God's name how can anybody with any fidelity to the facts describe that as a mandatory wage freeze?  I would ask the Opposition to come to their senses at this hour of very grave national peril.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

The Parliamentary Secretary has informed us that the Dáil will adjourn next week.  If the Minister makes an order under this section that order can be opposed within 21 sitting days from the date on which it is tabled.  That would probably take us close to 30th November.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to that.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> In pages 2 and 3 to delete subsections (1) and (2) and to substitute therefor the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister may from time to time by order prohibit the payment by the Banks to their employees of remuneration at rates exceeding the rates of remuneration provided for in the proposals for the National Wage Agreement 1976 and the making or implementation of terms and conditions of employment at variance with that agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments refer to a section of the Bill that we feel affects the rights of individuals and could well affect the right of a trade union to negotiate.  The Minister tried to say at the end of his Second Stage summing up that this was not a wage freeze.  There is no other term that can be applied to section 3.  This section bears no comparison with the other two measures which were before the House in 1973 and 1975.  This is where the major difference arises.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being empowered to produce an order preventing an increase in remuneration and affecting conditions of employment.  If he brings in that order he can at his discretion freeze wages to the 30th November in line with the agreement reached between the banks' staff relations committee and the Irish Bank Officials' Association, which was drawn up in mid-1975 and modified, for the most part downwards, in June, 1976.  We believe, despite the fact that the banks have operated outside the terms of the national wage agreement, that they should be contained within any proposals presently carried under the national wage agreement.  I am satisfied that the Minister agrees that this is the way to approach this.  I am also satisfied that he was critical of the methods the Government employed, in his absence, to handle this situation. I believe, despite his statements to the contrary at the end of the Second Stage, that he obviously has no desire to be given power to introduce an order freezing wages for a selected section of the community.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage debate I, along with other members of this party, <Col N="1751" /> said that our objection was to the principles contained in the Bill.  There was no inconsistency.  The Minister failed to prove any inconsistency on our part.  There is a distinct difference between this and the other regulations and this is what we want to change. If this is changed we are prepared to accept the terms of the Bill tying it to the proposals of the 1976 National Wage Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to us as a responsible party always concerned about the national interest.  That is true.  Our consistency in this field has been proved in the past and there is no need to spell it out in any great detail.  Our commitment to the national wage agreement has always been without question.  That is why we put forward this amendment.  In order to do this it means deleting subsections (1) and (2) of this section, that is, eliminating from the Bill the authority giving the Minister power to freeze the wages of these employees and also the authority, if he so wishes, to withdraw from a union facilities to negotiate.</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental position. Amendment No. 2 is to delete subsection (7), which introduces the agreement between the Bank Officials' Association and the Banks' Standing Committee, the agreement that has been referred to and adhered to in the previous two measures on bank pay, that is the national wage agreement. We want to restore this.  We believe it is in keeping with what should have been introduced in the first place.  If the Minister wishes at any stage, before or after the 3rd July, to make the legislation retrospective we would co-operate in that respect.</P>
    <P>We oppose this section, and we are suggesting amendments, because it is a complete somersault for the Labour Party despite the weak arguments the Minister for Labour tried to make. It is interfering with the free rights of certain people and with the free negotiating rights of a trade union. We are prepared to agree to any other adjustments that may be necessary if the Minister accepts these amendments.  We had a difficulty <Col N="1752" /> imposed by the guillotine.  As I pointed out earlier, the reason for urgency on this Bill was not the situation that existed in the banks.  There should have been an effort, through quiet negotiations with all the parties concerned, to postpone the threatened withdrawal of services next week until after a decision was taken on the national wage agreement.  It was a cardinal sin on the part of the Government that they did not take every step in their power to advise all the parties concerned, use their influence and encouragement, and appeal to the patriotism of those people to prevent a strike taking place.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand that no approach was made by the Government from the time of the statement by the Minister for Finance&mdash;a week ago&mdash;until the first placatory and conciliatory noises were made last night.  It may only be a coincidence that the Minister for Labour was missing during that period but it is disgraceful that the Government did not move in that vital week.  Instead of that we had a new move by an Irish Government, we had the mailed fist approach.  The attitude of the Government was that they would impose orders, freeze wages, interfere with the rights of individuals and withdraw the opportunity to negotiate from a licensed trade union.

      <P>These two amendments go to the root of our objections to this Bill.  If they are accepted by the Minister, or at least the principle, we will have no further opposition to the Bill and we will support it fully as we have with regard to two previous Bills of this nature which the Minister introduced.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendment No. 1 and, therefore, I do not think it is necessary for us to argue the case for amendment No. 2 which follows automatically if amendment No. 1 is accepted.  However, it is necessary to make crystal clear what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> Section 3 of the Bill as it stands entitles the Minister to make an order. The only order it entitles him to make in the first instance is an order freezing the pay of bank officials to their present level.  There seemed to be some confusion about this, whether deliberate or otherwise I do not know, when this was referred to at the end of the Minister's speech concluding Second Stage.  I should like to get it absolutely clear because it is not a matter on which there should be any doubt.  Therefore, may I ask the Minister if he agrees that under the section as it stands if he is to make an order in the first instance it must be one freezing the pay of bank officials to their present level?  Is that a correct interpretation of the section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A simple Yes or No is all that is required; the Minister can elaborate afterwards.  So that we will not be at cross purposes I appeal to the Minister to tell me if I am interpreting correctly the section.  I do not understand the Minister's approach to this.  When he was introducing the Bill on Second Stage he did not refer to any section.  When he was finished we asked him if he would do this but he refused.  Does the Minister want us to spend all the day at cross purposes?  If we are not at cross purposes, we could quickly pass the Bill, the House could adjourn and all of us could go home. If we understand the position clearly, then I think it is in the Minister's interest, in our interest and that of the public generally that what is involved here should be clearly understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the Minister does not want to answer the question at this stage.  I put it to him before and we got a peculiar answer.  However, I am putting the question again and we and many people will note his reaction with considerable interest.  Section 3 as it stands provides that if the Minister makes an order under the section in the first instance&mdash;having regard to the provisions of subsection (3)&mdash;the only order he is entitled to make is one freezing the pay of bank officials at their present level.  We say that is wrong.  It is not the kind of power the <Col N="1754" /> Minister should have and it is not the kind of power he needs.</P>
    <P>As the Minister quoted, when we were in office the attitude we took was consistently one where we said that in so far as there has to be legal enforcement it should be enforcement of national pay agreements and this amendment is designed to do that.  We have consistently supported this.  The difficulty is that there is not a national pay agreement in force at the moment and one has to get some norm.  In this amendment we have endeavoured to provide that.  We do not suggest that technically the amendment meets all the necessary criteria but since the Bill was only produced yesterday and the guillotine has been applied to it, it has only been possible for us to produce an amendment which illustrates the principle of what we have been trying to achieve and what our opposition to this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to read amendment No. 1 again.  It states:</P>
    <P>In pages 2 and 3 to delete subsections (1) and (2) and to substitute therefor the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister may from time to time by order prohibit the payment by the Banks to their employees of remuneration at rates exceeding the rates of remuneration provided for in the proposals for the National Wage Agreement 1976 and the making or implementation of terms and conditions of employment at variance with that agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposals for the national pay agreement are known and published. That is a norm that exists.  We are saying that if the Minister considers it necessary to intervene in this matter he can make an order providing that the banks may not pay more to their employees than would be allowed by that known standard, the published terms of the national wage agreement proposals.</P>
    <P>If the national wage agreement goes through on the basis of these proposals such an officer will conform precisely to what we wish to see and what the Minister says he wishes to see.  If, on the other hand, the national wage agreement proposals are rejected, <Col N="1755" /> then the Minister would be entitled under subsection (4) to make an order revoking that order.  What steps he would take in these circumstances is another matter that we will deal with on the section but one thing is clear.  In the event of no national wage agreement and in the event of the Government proposing to lay down certain norms, they cannot be applied only to the banks and not to anybody else.  That would be intolerable. I suggest that this amendment meets precisely the criteria required. If the national wage agreement proposals are accepted, any order made by the Minister in pursuance of this amendment would be exactly what would be required.  If the proposals are not accepted, the Minister may reject the order.</P>
    <P>I trust by now it is quite clear to the Minister and to everybody else that so far as this party are concerned our opposition to this Bill is based on the fact that this section we are trying to amend does not provide for the making of an order tying the remuneration of bank officials to the national wage agreement.  It provides for the statutory freezing of pay of bank officials to their present level. We believe that is wrong in principle and in practice.  We believe also that, consistent with the two previous measures introduced by the Minister and supported by this side of the House, it is necessary and essential to spell out that it is the desire of this House to ensure as far as it can that people conform to the national wage agreement.  In the event of there being no national pay agreement, that is a different situation.  Presumably this Bill is being introduced on the assumption that there will be a national pay agreement.  If the assumption is that there will be no such agreement, then we should not be wasting our time on this Bill.</P>
    <P>We would have preferred to have been able to include in this amendment detailed provisions such as exist in earlier legislation with which we concurred providing for reference of these matters to the Labour Court. It was not physically possible for us to produce the detailed amendment <Col N="1756" /> necessary to cover that.  I was interested to hear the Minister say, in replying to Second Stage, that he still has power to refer these matters to the Labour Court even though there is no reference to the Labour Court in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear him saying that, because he seemed to imply he has that power under other sections, not the ones dealing with the banks, but the general ones dealing with the Labour Court.  That was my understanding of what he said.  If that contention is correct, I wonder why was it necessary, for instance, in the 1975 Act dealing with the remuneration of bank employees to provide specifically for reference to the Labour Court by the Minister.  If that power exists anyway, I do not understand why it was necessary to include it in that Act. The non-inclusion of it in this Bill, on a well-known legal principle suggests and implies, until the contrary is proved, that the intention of the Oireachtas was not to give power in this case to refer to the Labour Court.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's views on that when he speaks on this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some importance but it does not affect the basic principle involved in this amendment.  I do not wish to delay the House unduly.  I merely wish to say as succinctly as I can that this goes to the root of our opposition to the Bill.  We believe an order made by the Minister should have the effect of ensuring that the pay of bank employees conforms with the national agreement and it should not be designed to freeze the pay of bank employees at their present level.</P>

      <P>We are becoming slightly confused about what the basis of the Opposition's case is.  The first information we got that the Opposition would be opposed to this measure was when we got a statement yesterday from the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  A reason cited in that statement for their opposition was that the Bill was precipitate, selective and introduced at a time when a national pay increase norm has not yet been established.  Now we are told the Opposition's case will be <Col N="1757" /> settled if we substitute for the section in the Bill an amendment which ties the pay rates in the banks to the national pay agreement.</P>

Circumstances made it necessary as they make it necessary in this case.</P>
      <P>It would be unfair of the Opposition to members of the Irish Bank Officials' Association to insist that they should accept the terms of an agreement which has not yet been concluded.

Faced with an imminent strike on Monday, having declared that they have appealed to the parties concerned not to go ahead with that strike, they ask the Government to buy their cooperation and get us home earlier tonight by accepting this amendment.

      <P>The amendment refers to &ldquo;... rates of remuneration provided for in the proposal for the national wage agreement ...&rdquo;.  There are no rates of remuneration provided for in the national agreement.  There are increases but not rates of remuneration. It would be impossible to incorporate an amendment of that kind in the Bill.  I appeal to the Opposition to reconsider this amendment and to reconsider their entire approach to the Bill.  We have had a long debate.  The Bill has been explained to them over and over again. For the reasons put forward, I could not accept the amendment.  I do not think it would be helpful to us at the present juncture.  On reflection, I think the Opposition will see it does not improve the situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley asked why there was no reference to the Labour Court. Again, this relates to the absence of a national agreement.  On previous occasions the court could be asked to take on a specific task.  The option is certainly there to refer to the court but it may be desirable, should circumstances dictate that course, to take the option of referring the matter to a commission rather than to the court.  The power is there to refer to the court and it may well be that the court would be the ideal body on the other hand, circumstances may suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For the reasons I have mentioned, I think it would be unfair to the members of any association to ask them to be bound by the terms of an agreement which have not yet been accepted by those who drew them up, and it certainly would not be helpful in the present troubled situation, some days or a weekend, as we are, away from a bank close-down, to ask the Government to accept this Opposition amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that whatever is in subsections (1) and (2), there would be power to revoke whatever order is made?  Therefore, the choice between this amendment and the Minister's draft is that, under the Minister's draft the order makes a freeze, and under this amendment the order allows an increase to the rates of the national pay agreement proposals. The Minister is saying, if I understand him correctly, that, from the point of view of the bank officials, it is preferable to impose a freeze than to allow an increase under the proposals of the national pay agreement. Is that what the Minister is saying to us?</P>

      <P>What I am saying is that the Bill is seeking very simple powers.  The overall objective of the Bill is to hold for whatever period is required bank salaries at their present rate to ensure the emergence of an agreement which will give bank employees an increase of the same pattern as was given to others.  That is the objective of this Bill.  It was kept as simple as that.  The objective is to give them the same as other employees. <Col N="1761" /> The amendment put forward by the Opposition relates to a national agreement which has yet to be agreed upon. There was a banks JIC meeting today, resuming tomorrow, and I am asking the Opposition to withdraw their amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's thinking on this issue is so confused that I am convinced he did not study the Bill before it was introduced in the House this morning.  Again, to pursue the point made by Deputy Colley, the Minister is saying that it is desirable to impose a wage freeze on a certain group of people.  Despite what the Minister would like to have contained in this Bill or what he may have meant to have contained in it, what is contained there is the power for the Minister to make a statutory order maintaining bank officials' remuneration at present levels.  He goes on to say that our amendment is less acceptable than the proposal in the Bill.  The actual wording of our amendment is not important; it was a rushed one, of necessity, because of the Government's imposition of the guillotine.  Everybody knows what is meant in the reference to remuneration. However, on the proposals for a national wage agreement, is the Minister saying to one group of workers: &ldquo;It is not enough to have you kept within the proposals of the national wage agreement,&rdquo; while he and all of us are hoping the majority of workers will accept the national wage agreement in a few weeks' time or less.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>There are two possibilities regarding the national wage agreement, acceptance or rejection.  First of all, if it is accepted, it is then reasonable for the Minister to see what he would do by way of order.  If it is rejected, what would he do by way of order, would he just impose an order for one section under this legislation and deprive one union of the right to negotiate in a free for all situation?  Or do the Government and the Minister intend to introduce this type of legislation across the board?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, there is something slovenly about the drafting <Col N="1762" /> of this measure.  If, as the Minister maintains, the object of this Bill is to achieve a certain purpose, why not write that purpose into the Bill?  As it stands, there is no guarantee that, if the people who are negotiating negotiate the national wage agreement terms or even less than those terms, the Minister will not change his mind in the meantime.  They would have to depend solely on what was enacted regardless of the <i>obiter dicta</i> of the Minister on it. As I see it, there is only one thing in this legislation, that is, that the Minister is fixing the remuneration of bank officials under the present agreement.</P>

      <P>For the information of Deputy Gibbons, I will explain for the tenth time today that a national agreement does not yet exist, and that in the actual negotiations we are faced with at present it would not be helpful to ask for adherence to an agreement not yet accepted by any of the parties.  In industrial relations to demand of participants in a bargain that they should accept something, the spirit and the letter of which they do not adhere to, does not generally ensure a great deal of progress.  I was careful to say this morning that I did not demand a replica of the national agreement in the bank situation.  I accept from the bank officials and the bank authorities that there are certain unique features in the Irish banking system.  All we have, at any time sought of them is that there should be conformity of a general character with the terms accepted by other workers.  I think it would be unwise to depart from that path to which we have adhered.  It is the most constructive way of proceeding.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister has stated that the whole purpose of this Bill is to bring the bank officials under the norm of what the national wage agreement would be.  The amendment in the name of Deputy G. Fitzgerald ensures that.  If there is no national wage agreement and the Minister invokes subsection (1) of section 3, which, in effect would freeze bank salaries, there is no obligation in this Bill on the Minister to remove that order.  This could place the bank officials in an invidious position in comparison to the rest of the community. If there is a national wage agreement, subsection (1) of section 3 having been signed, what redress have the bank officials in relation to what the Minister would do?  The Minister might say to the bank officials that because they made him sign the order he will not remove it for another six months.</P>
      <P>These are factors that would worry a person reading this Bill.  The amendments ensures that when a national norm and a national wage agreement are established the bank officials are assured of receiving whatever increases were given under the national wage agreement.  I believe that there is a lot of substance in this amendment and that it would reassure bank officials.  In effect, when the Minister invokes section 3 the wages of the bank officials will be frozen until such time as this section is revoked.  I am not sure that the Minister may take that action, and for that reason this amendment should be accepted.  The bank officials would prefer to see that amendment there than subsection (1) of section 3 where the Minister has exercised his rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the Minister when he rejects this amendment.  I thought that the whole purpose of this Bill was to ensure that the bank officials would not step out of line, would not exceed the national norm, when the national wage agreement <Col N="1765" /> emerges.  As far as I can see, that is what this amendment contains.  In relation to this section the danger is that when the Minister has made an Order he might be reluctant to revoke it afterwards and that is the merit I see in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has any intention of replying to these points.  I think that indicates his reluctance to accept this amendment.  It is typical of his totalitarian view in relation to this legislation. This legislation is discriminatory. If the Minister were to accept this amendment it would remove to a large degree the discriminatory element existing in the Bill as it stands.  As far as technicalities of the wording of it are concerned, as the Minister well knows that is neither here nor there.  It does not take away from the sense of the amendment whatsoever.  As has already been stated by other speakers from this side of the House, if there was no national wage agreement this amendment would not change anything.  But it changes things if there is a national wage agreement allowing a certain increase, which the bank officials would not be entitled to except at the discretion of the Minister.  This is a very reasonable amendment and there is no reason why the Minister should not accept it.  It does not overturn the Minister's Bill completely, but it brings sanity and reason into it.  That is all we are asking the Minister to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always taken the view that Bills are not solely the property of the Executive, that they are the property of the House.  I have been consistent in any legislation that I have introduced in accepting any worth-while amendments and at no stage have I felt that certain clauses were sacrosanct because they were the product of consultations between my officials and myself.  My behaviour in this area has been in marked contrast to what was my experience when in Opposition, but let that be.  That has been my form in regard to legislation: I have always been open to suggestions from <Col N="1766" /> the Opposition and I consider any that are made in a spirit of improvement and accept them without hesitation.</P>
      <P>It is for very weighty reasons that I reject the amendment in the form put forward.  We are in a serious strike situation and I do not think the suggestion incorporated in the amendment would be helpful in the circumstances. I have explained why it would not be helpful.  The background history of relations between the officials and the banks suggest it would not be helpful and members of the Opposition who were aware of this problem when in Government should know from their own experience that it would not be helpful.  I accept the direction of the amendment, and the spirit of the view that whatever terms emerge for the majority should also apply to bank employees.  I have made it clear that this legislation is directed towards the very same goal.  But this amendment would not help us to reach it.  It certainly cannot help the present troubled situation.  There is no difference between the Opposition and the Government, as I understand it, in our joint feeling that people working in the banking sector should get broadly the same as other groups in the community.</P>

      <P>There appears to be no difference on that question.  I ask the Opposition to withdraw the amendment not in the spirit of wishing to maintain the clauses as they stand but because I think that as it stands the Bill is the most effective instrument in the situation with which we are dealing and I do not believe this amendment would help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to agree but it appears to me that either this Bill got out without the Minister's approval or he is not entirely in agreement with the content of it.  There can be no going back on the powers being given the Minister as Minister for Labour and this is what we object to.  We object to powers being given to freeze wages in any area or in the case of any group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> I want to go back on two points, and refer to what the Minister said about our oposition as a result of yesterday's party meeting.  The Minister said our opposition suggested it was selective.  It still holds good despite any interpretation that may be put on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>You also said you opposed it because no norm had yet emerged and now you wish in this amendment to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also said we referred to precipitating a situation.  We still maintain that it did do that.  Of course, we would prefer not to see this legislation introduced. The efforts should have been devoted to seeking a postponement of industrial action so as to give everybody time to cool down, to keeping the sides meeting.  This is why we believe that the intervention of the Minister for Finance did tremendous harm.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied&mdash;and this was mentioned by some speakers here today&mdash; that the approach by bank officials for the most part was one of concern for the economy, of reluctance to take strike action, of responsible patriotism at a serious time like this.  But when that explosion came on Thursday night there was a marked difference in the attitude of those people.  It made militants of normally moderate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now endeavouring to take away from the Minister the stigma of being a Labour Minister in this Government seeking these powers. This morning I complemented the Minister and wished him well in all sincerity but I do not think this is the type of power the Minister in that position should get whereby, if he wishes, he can bring in an order irrespective of what might happen saying: &ldquo;We hold your wages from now until November 30th.&rdquo;  The sensible remedy would have been an absolute appeal for the postponement of industrial action.  Then at least the Minister would have the national norm or wage agreement or he would <Col N="1768" /> not and we all hope he would.  At least, he would have a decision and would not be legislating in a vacuum, with action taken by a Government eagerly retreating into recess and hurrying to get away, but legislating with full knowledge of the facts.  This is the mistake I have seen.</P>
    <P>The phraseology of the amendment, we agree, may need correction and improvement and the Minister is aware of the spirit behind it.  Basically, it is in line with what we have not opposed in the Minister's two previous measures.  We are asking the Minister to accept this and basically it would end our objection to the Bill.  It does not completely clear our criticism of the handling of the situation&mdash;which is deplorable&mdash;nor does it lessen our belief and that of the vast majority of the people that certain steps, the bullin-the-gate attitude, did cause hard line feelings.  Even at this stage we will withdraw or not pursue any other objections.  We will, perhaps, be critical of certain aspects of the handling of the affair but our objection to the Bill will be withdrawn if the amendment deleting the prohibition and asking that the bank officials be kept in line with the normal national wage agreement is accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I think about this the more I am inclined to the view that the Minister is using this Bill to try to persuade the people concerned to accept the national wage agreement; that he will be able to indicate to them that the Government are so anxious to have this national agreement accepted that they are prepared to tie the banks to it.  But, in fact, the legislation as drafted leaves the Minister and the Government in a position to accept an agreement by the banks and their officials which will, in fact, be higher than the national wage agreement but, perhaps, somewhat lower than they are now seeking.  The Minister having decided that the national wage agreement should be accepted at this stage &mdash;he just says this without embodying it in law; he knows well that if he puts it into legislation he has no way out&mdash;is leaving a way out for an eventual settlement with the banks <Col N="1769" /> which will be higher than the national wage agreement at a time when that agreement may have been accepted by a majority of the other workers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my appeal to that of Deputy Fitzgerald to the Minister to take the opportunity now presented to him to demonstrate the quality which he says he has of having an open mind and not being tied rigidly to the brief he is given.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated on a number of occasions that the objective of the Bill is to ensure that the pay of bank officials&mdash;I am not quoting him exactly&mdash;conforms generally to the terms of whatever national norm emerges, but he is overlooking the fact that to proclaim what the objective is is one thing but to provide differently in legislation is another.  I understand very well what the Minister's difficulty in this is.  I want to make it clear that we are not trying to tie his hands or those of the negotiators in the dispute rigidly in any way.  The formula which might be used is that which was used in previous legislation on this matter.</P>
      <P>I notice that section 1 of the 1975 Act refers to general adherence to national agreements, among other provisions.  If the Minister were prepared to do so, we are prepared to agree to a short adjournment of the House to enable the Minister's officials to draft an amendment which would conform with the Minister's requirements but which would also ensure that the order to be made in the first instance under the Bill would not be one freezing the pay of bank officials to its present level, possibly up to the end of November.  The object which the Minister has proclaimed time after time is the same as ours.  We are under no illusions that the members of the IBOA would welcome being tied to the national pay agreement, if it is accepted.  Consistently they have made it clear that they object to being tied in that way.  Indeed, I understand they have legal proceedings under way in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> That is not the issue.  The issue is that this House has twice in the past recorded its view that the terms of the current national pay agreement should in general be applied to the remuneration of bank officials.  That is still the view of this House, as demonstrated in this debate.  Why is it not possible for us to ensure by amendment of this section that that purpose is achieved, that that purpose and agreement of this House are demonstrated without tying the hands of the Ministers or the negotiators rigidly? I am quite sure it can be done, particularly by reference to previous Bills on this matter.  We on this side have consistently demonstrated our support for this approach.  We have not sought to play politics in the past as we might have done in regard to previous legislation brought in by the Minister, and we are not seeking to do so now.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way want to appear to be offensive but the Minister has been abroad and has come back and has had to face this problem and the terms of this legislation which must have been prepared in his absence.  I appreciate that he has particular difficulties about which he cannot talk at the moment but I suggest to him strongly that it would be better from the point of view of any action he may have to take subsequently in the context of the dispute if it could be demonstrated that in that action he had the unanimous support of the House, which he can have without being in any way rigidly tied down.  I urge him to give serious consideration to what I have said, that the House might adjourn briefly to enable his advisers to draft an amendment to this section which, having regard to the terms of the debate, would meet the requirements of both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to appear to be ungrateful to the Opposition when I say I do not see much point in adjourning the House.  I have already explained my opinion of the amendment by the Opposition, that it would not be helpful in present circumstances, that it would not assist the objectives of the legislation <Col N="1771" /> the Government have brought before the House.  I assure Deputy Colley that his remarks were not taken as being offensive&mdash;that I have been away for some days and that I might not be acquainted with the terms of the legislation.  I accept that we might say about an opponent that somebody may not be aware of certain things&mdash; this is conventional and appropriate&mdash; but I assure the Deputy that I have kept a very close interest in this matter, that I have been very closely in touch with the officials of my Department, though I was away.  I am not trying to score a point when I say that I am satisfied that at the present juncture this is the best instrument available to assist in the present difficult situation.</P>
      <P>I do not think the amendment would serve the interests of any Members of the House in our united desire to ensure that the banks do not close.  I do not think the Opposition, on reflection, can believe this amendment would avert the closing of the banks or, indeed, that the acceptance of it would bring nearer the objective set out in the Bill, that whatever terms are finally agreed on in the banks would conform with the terms of the national pay agreement.</P>
      <P>Though I would accept and always have accepted any reasonable comment from the Opposition, I do not see much advantage in accepting this amendment.  I thank Deputy Colley for his offer of an adjournment but I do not think it would be helpful in present circumstances to spell out such a suggested provision in legislation of this kind when one has to take into account that we have not as yet got a national agreement.  The JIC negotiations are still continuing and will resume tomorrow at 11 a.m.  It is important that we get through this legislation as rapidly as possible and I would, therefore, ask the Opposition to withdraw their amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <P>Therefore, the Minister takes full responsibility for the terminology of the Bill.  We endeavoured to moderate what we considered to be an extreme action in an extreme Bill.  We consider that the amendment would moderate what we consider to be extreme in the Bill. When a Government take extreme action they can create a reaction, and that is why we think the Bill in its present form will not be helpful.  Our amendment would ensure that an extreme reaction may be avoided.  When extreme action is initiated by a Government, there is a tendency towards an extreme reaction.  It is my feeling that the framing of this Bill is an extreme action by the Government and we are asking that they moderate it so that the reaction will be moderate and co-operative.  We fear that this Bill will make the solution of the problem much more difficult. It was with that in mind that this amendment was put forward.</P>

      <P>May I comment briefly on the Minister's statement about tomorrow's talks?  I welcome the fact that they are continuing and sincerely hope they will be fruitful.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my disappointment at the Minister's nonacceptance of this amendment.  I find it difficult to understand his nonacceptance because he appeared to convey that this was the kind of end product he desired.  To me this seemed a far less tough approach than that adopted in this legislation.  Deputy Colley offered the rewording of the amendment and everybody knew the spirit in which it was offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Minister say on every measure we debated since I became spokesman for Labour that he was always willing to accept amendments from the Opposition, unlike his predecessors who are now on this side of the House.  I have yet to see his sincerity in that respect.  I am sure he will forgive me for questioning his sincerity because when he did accept the <Col N="1773" /> amendments he gave the credit for them to his backbenchers.  I accept that that is irrelevant, but I wanted to answer the point he made which sounded so sincere.  I hope he will even yet accept these amendments.  If <Col N="1774" /> not, we are not prepared to withdraw them and want to put them before the House.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our main objection to this Bill is built into the powers being given to a Minister under section 3.  The fact that a Minister may from time to time between now and 30th November order a prohibition of the payments by banks to their employees and prohibit the making, implementing or continued implementation by the banks of any amendments or variation of the other conditions of employment basically means a mandatory pay pause.  Power is being given to a Minister whereby he can freeze wages in a certain section of the community for a given period.  The Minister has put in a section to cover the employees or officials of banks other than the associated banks.  There seems to be an injustice here in the sense that those working with the associated banks and those working in the other banks are not on a pay parity.  Yet he may avail of the same powers in that regard.</P>
      <P>This is dangerous legislation.  Earlier today we pointed out that this Minister and his party have shown a complete departure from the stand they have consistently taken when in Opposition.  I quoted the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, as saying that he would oppose with tooth and nail, any legislation repressive to workers.  He has used neither tooth nor nail on this occasion.  If he wishes to achieve anything, he must make an order holding wages at the 1975 agreement level with the modifications carried out in June of this year.  These modifications were a reduction in the phased increases allowed under the 1975 agreement.  There is no way this Minister can say that this order is anything other than a wage freeze.  This is our basic objection to section 3.  We submitted an amendment which the Minister did not accept.  In the circumstances, our opposition to this section is outright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the discussion we have had on the amendment to this section and of the Minister's persistent refusal to accept even the principle of the amendment, we have to view this section in the light of what it says.  I pointed out that the Minister has talked about the objectives of the Bill on a number of occasions and, in particular, the objectives of this section.  The Minister says that the objective is not relevant in any way to the manner in which this section will be interpreted.  What the section contains is relevant.  The section contains a provision for the Minister to make an order.  The only order he can make under this section&mdash;and he has confirmed this&mdash;is an order which freezes the pay of bank officials to their present level.  The section does not allow him the flexibility to make any other kind of order as we had sought to give him.  He insists that, if he makes any order under this section, the first order must be one freezing the pay of bank officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in this debate the Minister, by making some vague references to other legislation, endeavoured to suggest that he and his colleagues&mdash;in his own party, at any rate&mdash;have been consistent in their approach to matters of this kind.  Indeed, he suggested that he and his party accepted the principle of legal intervention in free collective bargaining.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Earlier today I quoted a number of statements made by members of his party on the Bill which was before us in 1970.  The Minister seemed to think that because the Bill included provisions not alone in connection with prices and incomes <Col N="1777" /> of all kinds but incomes across the board it made a difference.  I will tell the Minister the difference it makes. That legislation did not propose a wage freeze.  In this Bill the Minister is providing for a wage freeze.</P>
    <P>In the context of that legislation which provided for increases, unlike this section, I should like to refer once more to what was said by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce at column 1535 of the Official Report of 17th November 1970.  He said: &ldquo;As a matter of principle, I have objections to any interference with free collective bargaining.&rdquo;  Other of his colleagues said the same thing.  Where are those principles now?  Does the Minister suggest that this section is not interference with free collective bargaining?  If words mean anything, this section is going much further than interference with free collective bargaining. It is giving power to the Minister to impose an actual freeze to prevent any increase by power of law in the remuneration of bank employees and to enforce that up to 30th November next.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister bringing in amending legislation to extend that period, as has been done by his colleagues in relation to a number of other matters.</P>
    <P>In this section the Minister is asking us to approve that he should be given power to impose a pay freeze up to the 30th November next, at least, in relation to the remuneration of all bank employees.  There is no point in telling us that is not the Minister's intention; that it is not the objective of this section.  That is what this section provides.  In our amendment we gave the Minister an opportunity to ensure that there could be no misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the purpose of this section but he refused it.  We made it clear to him that acceptance of that principle would have removed all objections to the content of this Bill, not, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, to the manner in which the matter has been handled.  It would have made this Bill conform to the previous Bills which we have supported.  We are left, therefore, with this section which goes to the root of our objection to this legislation.  I hope it will be <Col N="1778" /> made crystal clear to everybody concerned that we primarily object to this section because it gives power to the Minister to impose a wage freeze.</P>
    <P>It is true that a subsection of this section gives power to the Minister to revoke that wage freeze but so far he has not answered the reasonable question put to him which arises acutely on this section, that is, that if there is no national pay agreement and if the Minister has made an order under this section imposing a wage freeze on bank officials what, then, does he propose to do?  When I asked him earlier on subsection (1) the significance of the date, November 30th, he said its only significance was that it was expected by that date that the national norm for wage increases would have arisen. That suggests that it is by no means unreasonable to envisage that under this section the Minister would make an order freezing at their present levels the remuneration of bank officials and that he would make no order to revoke that freeze prior to November 30th next because, according to him, it is conceivable that it will take up to then for a norm to emerge.</P>
    <P>Whatever view the Minister may hold in relation to this section and whatever he or his colleagues may say about their attitude to free collective bargaining, we on this side of the House cannot accept a proposition that this or any other Minister should be entitled to impose by statute a wage freeze on one section of the community.  Consistently, by our words and our actions, we have made it clear that while we wish to see free collective bargaining we recognise that the national interest will sometimes require interference with that situation.  This is a proposition which the Minister and his colleagues have never acknowledged publicly.  If we had been obliged to bring in legislation of this kind, there is very little doubt but that the Minister and the Government would have opposed it tooth and nail on the grounds that it was an interference with free collective bargaining.  However, we <Col N="1779" /> have never sought and never will seek to impose statutory control by way of a wage freeze on the remuneration of one section of the community.  We consider it wrong in principle for the Minister to be imposing such a wage freeze.  It is wrong in practice, too, and the Minister may find himself faced with further legal proceedings in regard to this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has pointed out that the freeze provided for here applies not only to employees of the associated banks but also to the employees of other banks.  I understand that employees of the nonassociated banks in the main are not members of the IBOA.  The point is that the level of remuneration sought to be enforced under subsection (7) is determined by agreements entered into by the IBOA.  In these circumstances it would appear that we are to have a further extension of the situation in which people who are not parties to an agreement will find themselves bound by statute to such agreement.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances the national interest requires that people who are not parties to a national agreement be bound by statute to that agreement, that is, an agreement to provide for an increase in their remuneration but an increase which is related reasonably to the requirements of the economy.  That is the view we have taken in the past, the view we have supported by our votes and by our voices but it is not the proposition which the Minister is asking us to accept in this section. Rather, he is asking us to accept the proposition that he should be given the power to make an order, when he so decides, to freeze at their present levels the pay of all bank officials and that he would not be obliged in any circumstances legally to review such an order.  He will tell us it is his intention to deal with the situation when national norms emerge but he has not spelled out what he would do in such circumstances. Would he revoke the order or would he amend it?  Subsection (4) gives him power to amend it but to what extent <Col N="1780" /> will he have power legally to amend it?</P>
    <P>What kind of amendment does the Minister think would be made having regard to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) that the order prohibits the payment of remuneration beyond present levels?  What advice has he got on this question?  Is he advised, for instance, that subsection (4) will enable him, if necessary, to make an order which would specify a certain level of remuneration and of conditions of employment?  I have some doubts in this regard in so far as the terms of subsections (1) and (2), which are specific, are concerned. The meaning of the word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; in subsection (4) may not be as wide as it would have been if these two other subsections provided for some level of increase but since they provide for no increase the meaning of the word &ldquo;amend&rdquo; in subsection (4) may well be restricted.  In any event, the Minister has not given any indication so far of what would be his intention in the event of a national norm emerging.  He has not told us precisely how he would propose, under the terms of this section, to deal with such a situation.</P>
    <P>Even more important, perhaps, is the question of what he would propose to do in the event of there being no national pay agreement.  This phrase of a national norm emerging in the event of there being no national pay agreement may sound a feasible proposition but the Minister must know that the term covers a multitude of difficulties as to how such a norm would emerge.  Is it to be on foot of a free for all or is it to be determined by the success attending the industrial action of the strongest groups in the country?  Is it to be related to the weakest groups or is it to be a norm prescribed by the Government? We are entitled to have some indication of the thinking of the Minister and of the Government in this regard when we are considering the very detailed and serious provisions of section 3 before us.</P>

      <P>It is not quite fair, certainly not accurate, to remark on speeches made by Deputies when <Col N="1781" /> in opposition, on measures proposed at that time totally different to the measure before us because the measure before us simply seeks to ensure that one section gets the same as all other sections.

      <P>The measure here simply seeks to bring about a situation where the figure arrived at for this section of people corresponds to that arrived at for others, seeks to be in conformity with that achieved by others in whatever bargaining situation exists at the time.  That is the objective of this legislation.  I do not think it profitable either to follow Deputy Colley into the future as to what may or may not be the situation after consideration of the terms of the national agreement because all of these are matters in respect of which, at this time, it is better that we rein our speculation and simply stick to the job in hand.  The job in hand and with which we have been dealing today is one in which we seek, in an area in which there has been a good deal of difficulty in the past, to ensure that the terms negotiated and gained by the people in that sector should correspond to those gained by others in whatever circumstances obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked questions about the way this would operate.  I thought its overall simplicity was one of the points in favour of this legislation which, being a temporary measure, simply holds a situation in that area, that situation having been defined, until the point was reached at which that conformity to the general pattern would apply.  Therefore the only power <Col N="1782" /> sought under the section is to hold the situation until that conformity would have been freely negotiated.</P>

      <P>That is conceivable. It certainly holds the position for the present and allows the parties to continue negotiations.  Despite present difficulties I have no doubt that a number of people on both sides of these negotiations have regard to the national interest and would seek to ensure that there is conformity to what others might seek.  This section gives me, at any rate, all the power I need to ensure that this happy event should take place.  Our recent experience would suggest that these possibilities for free settlements can be assisted in this area by a measure of this kind.  That has been our experience in the recent past and I have no doubt will be under this section as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contributions to date the Minister has ignored completely the position arising under subsection (2) of section 3 where an entirely different situation prevails.  If he tries under subsection (1) to get away from what is being imposed here &mdash;that is, a wage freeze&mdash;then it becomes ever more clear under subsection (2) because then there is an entirely different situation.  There is a group of people not catered for under the agreement defined in subsection (1).  They are a group who are, as far as I am aware, represented by a Congress union.  They are a group of people whose remuneration&mdash;and probably the terms as well&mdash;are considerably less favourable than those covered under this agreement.  Perhaps the Minister could explain, because I am not quite sure, how their increases or remuneration have operated in the past, if their increases have been in line with the <Col N="1783" /> agreement mentioned in the section; or have they been in line with the national wage agreement?  I am inclined to think that they have been in line with the national wage agreement within the framework of Congress.</P>
      <P>Under this section the Minister may from time to time by order prohibit the payment by the banks, other than the associated banks, to their employees after the commencement of the order of remuneration at rates exceeding the rates of such remuneration agreed to by or on behalf of these banks and their employees on or before the 23rd June, 1976.  If in the past these people got their increases within the framework of the national wage agreement, are they being debarred completely or can the Minister now, by order, impose an absolute wage freeze on them?  What stage have negotiations reached regarding their present agreements?  It appears to me that from yesterday the Minister has power to prohibit any further negotaitions by a union which operates within the framework of Congress.</P>
      <P>This is dangerous legislation; it is dangerous power to give a Minister. I want the Minister to explain briefly to me the position of those people, the relationship to those involved in subsection (1).  I believe that the powers being given to the Minister here are even more dangerous than those given in the other subsection.  If the Minister does impose an order will it be a case of imposing one or two&mdash;an order covering those people under subsection (1) and a separate order for those under subsection (1)? It would appear to me that one order covering both of them in a blanket fashion could prove to be very unjust to those under subsection (2).  I should like the Minister to elaborate somewhat on the position of those people.</P>

      <P>From what I can gather it was the draftsman's suggestion that it should have this division. It was important to include the associated banks because the bank officials' association of course is also <Col N="1784" /> organised in that area and it would have been impracticable to consider legislation of this character which did not include the associated banks.  For the Deputy's information, two orders would obviously be required here, the reason being that there is this common organisation in some of the associated banks.  The Deputy also asked whether there could be a difference in time between the orders.  Certainly we have to be a bit flexible in regard to the order being imposed and revoked. It is conceivable in certain circumstances that an order might be imposed and then revoked and there is a great deal of flexibility in relation to the imposition of the order under this section.</P>

He is demonstrating either that he does not know what section 3 is about <Col N="1788" /> or that he is not prepared to explain it. He has got every opportunity to explain it.  We have put to him what we think section 3 is doing.  If we are wrong the Minister could get up and point out that because of the wording of this section that it is not so; but he is not attempting to do that.  He has simply made bland assertions.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister is adopting this attitude may I draw his attention and that of the House to the actual wording of subsection 2 of this section? It states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may from time to time by order&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) prohibit the payment by the banks (other than the associated banks) to their employees, after the commencement of the order, of remuneration at rates exceeding the rates of such remuneration agreed to by, or on behalf of, these banks and these employees on or before the 23rd day of June, 1976, and ...</P>
      <P>That, in the main, would appear to relate to non-members of the IBOA. It would appear to give the Minister power to make an order freezing the pay of non-members of the IBOA at the level which obtained on 23rd June, 1976.  Maybe it does not do that.  If it does not would the Minister tell us why it does not or that it does not?  Let him stop this nonsense of making bland assertions of, first of all, his intention and, secondly, his inability or unwillingness to answer questions on these very serious and grave powers he is seeking from the House.</P>
      <P>I suggest, if the Minister wants to have any semblance of retaining the reputation for reasonableness which he believes he has, he has an opportunity now to do so, but he is fast casting that away from him.  I ask him once more to tell us does subsection (2), in conjunction with the rest of the section, mean that the Minister is seeking powers by order to freeze at its present level the remuneration of bank employees who are not members of the IBOA?</P>

We had an absolutely unresearched contribution from the Minister at the opening of this Stage where no effort was made at all to explain what is contained in the Bill.</P>

He has continued to make those attacks whenever he is cornered on a section of a Bill that he either knows little about or has not researched.  We are, for the first time, discussing in Committee section 3 of this Bill.  When doing that we are surely entitled to ask questions.  If it is a ridiculous piece of legislation it is not Deputy Colley's fault, Deputy Moore's fault or Deputy Fitzgerald's fault.  The Minister said we are introducing ridiculous things.</P>

      <P>They may be ridiculous points but we did not put them in the Bill that the Minister introduced today.  The Minister is taking powers for himself.  This means that if the members of ASTMS who represent some of the non-associated banks get a wage increase within the terms of the national wage agreement there is nothing to prevent the Minister from freezing such an increase because it was after 23rd June.  That is the position, ridiculous as it might be.  We did not put it there.  If I am wrong the Minister should tell me but he should not tell me I am irresponsible or ridiculous.  I am sick hearing that from some of the most incompetent Ministers.  If I am wrong the Minister should explain how this is so. It appears to me that the Minister is taking powers for himself.  Power can go to a person's head.  It can be dangerous to give power to people and I certainly would not like to have such power given to me.  The Minister should explain the position; he should not display such brashness and arrogance. If we are wrong we will admit it.  It is not important whether the Minister uses the power.  He should not get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not replied.  This is the arrogance one can expect from this Government.  They have applied the guillotine far more often in three years than have all Fianna Fáil Governments since 1932. The Minister knows that all he has to do is to keep wasting time instead of answering the questions and automatically the Bill will go through with the aid of the Deputies behind him, including some decent Deputies such as Deputy O'Sullivan whom I suspect may not be fully aware of what the Minister is doing in this <Col N="1793" /> section.  Of course, there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that the Minister himself does not know what he is doing in view of his inability to answer the reasonable questions put to him.</P>
      <P>I will ask the Minister once more, and this time let us hope we will get a reasonable answer.  It is possible to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this question, but the Minister has failed to do so up to now.  For the Minister's benefit I will put the question to him again.  Is he seeking power in this section to make an order that will have the effect of legally freezing the remuneration of members of a Congress union employed by the banks even though their union and Congress have accepted the terms of the national pay agreement?  That is a simple straightforward question that can be answered by &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If the Minister wishes he can elaborate on it.</P>

      <P>The section will enable me to ensure that settlements arrived at in this area conform with those obtaining elsewhere.  That is the answer to the Deputy's question. If that does not satisfy him I am sorry that he must remain talking between now and 10 o'clock but that is his problem, not mine.</P>

      <P>Are we to be subjected to this perennial incompetence and arrogance by the Minister for Labour just because he rushes home unprepared for this and apparently fighting with his colleagues, judging by the statement he issued last night, over what was done?  Is this House to be subjected to this kind of incompetent treatment?  It is utterly inexcusable that a Minister should come in here with a Bill like this seeking powers of this kind to impose a statutory wage freeze which he and his colleagues said they would never have anything to do with.  The Minister is not even able to explain what is in the Bill.  It is utterly incompetent, irresponsible and unacceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no wonder that this country is sinking when we see the approach adopted by the Minister.  Before I came into the Dáil I heard of charges of arrogance being made not only by the Minister in this House but also by members of the press against some of our members. There has never been anything like the same kind of arrogance displayed by any individual as we have witnessed here in the last 15 or 20 minutes. We may ask why this is so.  It is simply an effort to cover incompetence or the fact that the Minister has not studied his brief.</P>
      <P>I will answer the question we put to the Minister but I will not answer it in the confused, half-truthful way the Minister has tried to answer it.  The Minister is having powers conferred on him.  He may have set out with the objective of getting through a piece of legislation.  The legislation the Minister is trying to bulldoze through the House, with his silence and refusal to answer questions truthfully, may contain powers that may be unconstitutional. As Deputy Colley pointed out, the Minister is probably leaving himself open to this measure being taken again, as happened with regard to the measure we supported. If the Minister wishes we will amend the legislation now but he will not admit he is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is typical of the Minister.  One would think from some of the Ministers that they have a divine right to attack, ignore and snub public representatives who have been elected by their constituents. One would think nobody had a right to query points of legislation let alone offer a solution or a correction. <Col N="1795" /> In this section the powers that the Minister said were ridiculous are being given to him.  The Minister is making every effort he can to camouflage the fact that we are talking about a pay freeze.  No subsection in the Bill proves it more than does subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House for long because it is clear at this stage, either for reasons of arrogance or incompetence, that the Minister is unable or unwilling to answer reasonable questions on the details of this section.  That being so there is no point in our pursuing the matter or trying to deal with the legislation before the House in the way it is the duty of an Opposition to deal with any legislation and, indeed, in the way it is the duty of the Government to deal with it.  I do not intend to waste further time on the matter.  I want to say one or two things before I leave this section to the tender mercies of the Minister and the courts in due course.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to point out is that the Leader of the Minister's party, the Tánaiste, spoke, as did many of his colleagues on matters of this kind on another occasion.  As reported at column 56 of the Official Report of 28th October, 1970, he said:</P>
      <P>As far as this party is concerned and as far as the trade union movement is concerned, neither they nor we will ever agree to any measure which takes away the right to free collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>The Minister thinks it is unfair to quote that, that it is related to another Bill. The words are clear and unambiguous. He said: &ldquo;... will ever agree to any measure ...&rdquo; not just that measure &ldquo;... which takes away the right to free collective bargaining&rdquo;.  It is the consciousness of that situation and the total breach of all the things the Labour Party said they stood for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I may know a little more about it than the Minister thinks. What I have to rely on in this House is what is said by Members of the Labour Party.  I quoted the Leader of the Minister's party.  Perhaps the Minister wishes to repudiate what was said by the Leader of his party, which would not be surprising considering the Leader of his party repudiated himself. He said he would go to the back benches if there was a Coalition in which his party took part.  He said it would be a democratic decision of his party but he would go to the back benches.  He did not do that.  He repudiated that, so I suppose it is no great problem for the Minister to repudiate another statement.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a reference to our amendment a short time ago and he did not think much of it.  We have striven as hard as we could, within the time limit imposed on us by the Minister and his colleagues, to amend this legislation to ensure that it provides that the national pay agreement, when it emerges, will apply to bank officials.  On the other hand, the Minister is seeking in this section to apply a wage freeze to bank officials whether they are members <Col N="1797" /> of the IBOA or members of the Congress and unions concerned.  That is the difference and, if the Minister thinks his position is superior to ours, he is welcome to his view.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the penalties to be imposed on those found guilty of offences under the Act.  Penalties will be in the form of fines.  Those found guilty of an offence under the Act will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £400, while those found guilty, on indictment, of a more serious breach of the Bill's provisions will be liable to a fine not exceeding £10,000, together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a fine not exceeding £10,000 for each day upon which the offence is committed.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to Deputies that a feature of this legislation, which was not in previous legislation in this area, is that if a person convicted under the Act fails to pay the fine imposed on him he will not be liable to imprisonment.  It is proposed instead that the court which convicts him may direct that payment of the fine be secured by the sale of property of the person concerned.</P>

      <P>We have clearly indicated what the offence would be in this piece of legislation and here the section lays down the penalties. It is set out that it will be in respect of officers as officers of the bank and the section sets out some of the typical examples of the way this fine will be exacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but there is a vast difference between that legislation and this in that we have already found section 3 to be repugnant, to be objectionable, to be imposing very severe penalties, and giving new powers to a Minister, some of them ridiculous powers on the <Col N="1802" /> Minister's admission.  In view of that we are concerned that there may be other faults, and we are concerned for the officers' personal position in the bank. Is there any way that an officer, acting in his capacity as a pay clerk or otherwise, who commits an offence under this Bill can have his own personal property affected?  Paragraph (b), which describes the property that can be taken, includes even securities of any local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <P>The Bill will be published and the banks will be made <Col N="1803" /> fully aware of the contents.  If an officer of the bank insists on paying employees beyond rates set down here after the passage of this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas he will be liable to the fines set out in section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question here is whether &ldquo;person&rdquo; in this section means the person <i>simpliciter</i> or whether it is the agent of the bank. If &ldquo;person&rdquo; means the person himself, it is not attached to his office, and therefore on the reading of this it is his personal property that is in question.  On the other hand if the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; refers to him as an agent or officer of the bank, it is really the bank which is being penalised.  There are probably precedents in regard to this kind of thing in company legislation, but I think it important to get clear in what capacity the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is used here.  Where it is the individual as a citizen that is committing a crime before the law he is in an individual position and his office is not affected. If on the other hand it is as agent of the bank that he is convicted, then in reality it is the institution which is involved.  That point should be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Where in the Bill does it state that it is as an agent of the bank that the person is to be penalised?  We all know that, irrespective of what the Minister might say in the House when the Bill is passing through and irrespective of what interpretation the Minister might put on any section of the Bill, when it becomes law it will be decided by a judge in court what exactly it means.  Therefore, unless we are clear as to what is involved here we will have difficulties afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If it should ever arise that these provisions would require to be invoked, if an officer of the bank decided to break the law, the subject matter of his contravention of the law would be his decision that certain employees should be paid over a certain level <Col N="1804" /> and presumably he would not be making that as a personal decision. It would relate to a category of employees.  Presumably, it would be a decision of the bank of which he was an officer and in these circumstances it is the bank that would, of course, pay the fine.  It is inconceivable that an individual acting on his own would make such a decision which would lay his own personal property open to seizure. Obviously, he would be acting as an officer of the bank and it would be on the bank that directed him to make the decision that the fine would be imposed and it would be the bank in question that would pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Companies Act, for instance, certain penalties are applicable to and collectible from a company in certain circumstances. Penalties also apply to certain officers, say, the secretary of a company.  If the secretary is convicted&mdash;Deputy Esmonde will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;under such a section and fined £200 it is the secretary who is liable for it.  In practice the company will probably pay this fine but there is no liability on the company.  As I read this section, unless we resolve the question specifically as to whether &ldquo;person&rdquo; refers to an agent or to the citizen personally, the liability as distinct from the practice under section 4 will be confined to the citizen, that is to the person.  Whether or not the bank pays will be a matter of grace.  The bank's assets will not be captured by the section at all.</P>

      <P>I am prompted to comment on the section when I see the enthusiasm of no less than seven Fianna Fáil Deputies in expressing concern about the terms of this section with special reference to the proposed confiscation or seizure of certain assets, property or funds of bankers.  It is no surprise to me but it must cause some surprise or some astonishment to people throughout the country coming from a party which showed so little concern about the proposed seizure of the property of landowners and farmers for certain breaches of the law some time ago. There was no stampede by Fianna Fáil Deputies to defend farmers or others at that time against their assets being acquired by the courts for a breach of the law.  Here we see that party able and ready to step in in defence of the bankers.  This causes me some concern because it leads me to believe that there must be a motive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a reason for Fianna Fáil's anxiety about this section.  I believe that they have a certain personal concern and fear because they feel that under this section Taca funds might be interfered with in some way.  They are expressing fear and concern because it is well known that there are certain bankers associated with Taca.  That is one reason why we have seven Fianna Fáil Deputies querying this section. Everybody knows that is so.  They are afraid Taca funds will be confiscated or interfered with.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan's intervention at this stage is further evidence of the disgraceful filibustering and guillotining that is going on in this House.  He knew when he stood up that we had only seven or eight minutes left to discuss this Bill on Committee Stage.  There is nothing one can do when we have only two minutes left for this Stage. In other words, for the second time today we have the guillotine introduced by the Government.

      <P>If the Minister had the common decency to sit back and listen, he would have seen that we were not ridiculous.  Section 3 empowers the Minister to impose a pay freeze on a legitimate member of congress, the ASTMS, members of the non-associated banks.  At the moment they can go through the normal channels of the national pay agreement but the Minister is now giving himself power by order to stop that.  Whether he uses that power is not important.  The fact is that the Bill gives him that power and that is why we describe it as ridiculous.</P>
      <P>We have pointed out our many reasons for opposing this.  We were prepared to offer an amendment in Committee&mdash;it may have needed rehashing&mdash;and we still believe it would have improved the section.  Of course, the Minister said our amendment was not good enough to meet the situation.  I do not need to spell out again the comments of the Minister for Labour.  We did not oppose the two previous Bills dealing with bank remuneration.  Indeed, we supported them because they were tied up with the national pay agreement. Neither would we have opposed this one if it had been aimed in the same direction.</P>
      <P>If our amendment had been accepted, it would have tied this legislation with the 1976 national pay agreement.  No matter what the original objective of the Minister was, the fact is that this Bill imposes a pay freeze on selected groups of people, members of unions both inside and outside congress.  That is the only interpretation one can put on the power being given to the Minister.  It is not enough for him to say this is not what it will do. Excessive powers are being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I renew my appeal to those involved in the bank negotiations which will continue tomorrow. I appeal to them in the interests of the Irish economy to refrain from the action they propose.  There are painful memories of the last occasion and I suggest that as a matter of patriotism they would at least postpone their threatened action <Col N="1809" /> for a few weeks.  I have referred often to demonstrations by the Government of how not to use an industrial relations situation.  I have spoken about a bull at the gate and a bull in a china shop to relate to the measures taken by the Government. Their action here virtually encourages the development of a strike action and this was triggered off by the recent speech by the Minister for Finance.  It was highly significant that we had no attendance or contribution by that gentleman today.</P>
    <P>I have said I hope the bank strike will not take place.  I have expressed the hope that at least there will be a postponement and that, perhaps, this will lead to peace.  What is important is that some members of the Government saw fit to come in here and talk ráiméis instead of realising the serious damage that had already been done to the economy by the millions of pounds which have already left the country.  The desire of the Government to rush this legislation was prompted more by their anxiety to get away on annual leave than by the closeness of the bank dispute.</P>
    <P>Our opposition to this Bill has continued. We regard the measure as being directed against a specific group of people and is doing something which the Labour Minister when on this side of the House, piously said should never be done.  There are no kudos for any Government introducing repressive legislation in 1976.  They have nothing to gain by guillotining measures they realise are not popular. I am satisfied that there are many backbenchers, especially on the Government side, who, if they realised the full implications of the power being given to the Minister, would not move into the division lobbies behind him. There has been a somersault by the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very strongly provoked to intervene in this <Col N="1811" /> debate when I hear the observations of the Fianna Fáil Labour spokesman expressing his concern on a Bill, which, as the Minister pointed out this morning, was for a limited period. Deputy Fitzgerald did not refer to that fact not that it will expire on 30th November, 1976, or maybe earlier.  We all hope that this threatened strike will not take place and that wise counsel and common sense will prevail to ensure that the measures taken in this Bill will not have to be implemented.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald and his colleagues when speaking about the economy say one thing but what they feel in their hearts is different.  Not alone are they hoping there will be a bank strike but that there will be a prolonged bank strike that will cause considerable inconvenience to the public.  Fianna Fáil can then point the finger of blame at the Government and cause considerable confusion to the economy.</P>

We should emphasise the fact that the implementation of this shortterm emergency legislation will not be necessary if common sense and intelligence prevail.

      <P>If there are no penalties against bank employees in the Bill, where do Fianna Fáil's sympathy <Col N="1813" /> and concern lie?  If the bank employees have nothing to fear from this Bill Fianna Fáil must be displaying concern for the bankers, the same people who were asking everybody to tighten their belts and accusing the Government of spending too much, making an appeal to the Government to spend less and to restrict to a greater extent spending in the interest of the economy.  The same people who are asking the Government to pay out less and who are asking the public, in the interests of high efficiency, to accept less are the ones who are involved in this Bill.  We hope to bring a degree of common sense and understanding to their minds.</P>
      <P>Those people had nothing and have nothing to offer in relation to the economy, only to make suggestions. Some of them when speaking at dinners, parties and bankers' exhibition events could only say that the Government were responsible.  The bank directors saw fit to point the finger of fault at the Government for everything that happened in connection with the economy and because of that here is their payment, their compensation, their recognition by a united stand of Fianna Fáil behind the bankers.  It is the bankers that Fianna Fáil are so concerned with because there is no reason to display any concern on behalf of the bank employees.  This Bill does not concern the employees.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not concern the bank officials or their trade union, it is directed towards the bankers.  The Opposition to the Bill from Fianna Fáil is coming because of their sympathy for the bankers and <Col N="1814" /> because of their agreement with certain bank directors who saw fit to be critical of the Government's handling of the serious economic situation. This is Fianna Fáil's method of showing recognition and appreciation to bank directors who have shown a high degree of recklessness in so far as the handling of this situation is concerned. They have brought about the necessity for a Bill of this kind.  It is clearly out of the bag that Fianna Fáil are the rich man's party, the big man's party, the director's party and, particularly, the party defending the bank directors.  They are the only people they are showing concern for.</P>
      <P>No penalties are directed against the employees of the banks.  Deputy Fitzgerald said he was concerned about the economy and the serious position the economy is in.  He expressed the hope that there would not be a bank strike because he felt that if there was the economy would deteriorate. Does he know&mdash;if he does not he should be told&mdash;that when he makes reference to the Minister for Labour or to the policy of the Department of Labour that the root cause of the deterioration of the economy was brought about by Fianna Fáil when they gave more pay and greater profit at a time when it was not recommended, or demanded. They gave more pay and greater profits for the purpose of winning two by-elections in Cork and Kildare.  That is the cause of the deterioration.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was brought about by Fianna Fáil purchasing votes in Kildare and Cork with complete disregard for the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of that we have people like Deputy Fitzgerald taking over the role of Simple Simon and telling us that he is concerned about the economy. Fianna Fáil could not and never did give two damns about the economy. There was an intervention in relation to the Department of Labour at a time when Fianna Fáil wanted to win two by-elections and they offered the workers more than the trade unions had asked.  In fact, they insisted that <Col N="1815" /> the workers get more than the trade unions asked because it was on the eve of two important by-elections. They knew the way they could win those by-elections was to obstruct, cause confusion and wreck the economy. They played a big part in that.</P>
    <P>The bankers have not shown the concern for the economy that is expected of responsible people.  If the directors of the banking institutions were serious in their efforts in so far as the economy is concerned there would be no need for the Minister to introduce this Bill.  Not alone did they not show any concern for the economy but they showed a high disregard for people who were primarily and principally concerned with seeing that the economy was kept on the rails and on the right line.  Bank officials need not think that Fianna Fáil, because of their opposition to the Bill, are expressing sympathy with their efforts, wisely or unwisely, rightly or wrongly. Fianna Fáil's concern is with the directors of the banks.  It is well known that many directors of the banking institutions are the custodians of the Taca funds which were used in the recent by-elections.  That is the reason Fianna Fáil are so concerned with this Bill, the big man's party.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I must direct your attention to the allegation made by Deputy Lalor that I blackmailed the Taoiseach. I would ask the Chair to insist that Deputy Lalor withdraws that statement.  Deputy Lalor knows that this allegation was published in a certain newspaper last October and that it is the subject of High Court proceedings. The date for the High Court proceedings has yet to be fixed.  I am satisfied that Deputy Lalor's allegation justifies my action in taking proceedings.</P>

Fianna Fáil do not want this legislation because it will impose severe penalties on people who are supporters of that party. Fianna Fáil have been sent in here by certain bank directors to obstruct the effort of the Minister for Labour to get this Bill through the House and to misrepresent the terms of the Bill. They cannot misrepresent the terms of this Bill.  As the Minister and I have pointed out and as the Bill clearly indicates, there is nothing in any section or subsection of this Bill that any bank official in Ireland need fear.</P>

      <P>We are now concluding this Bill and it appears that nobody on the other side wishes to speak. Although I did not ask Deputy Flanagan to intervene in the debate, I am very grateful to him for his contribution. During the day we have heard much unwarranted criticism of the provisions of this measure and I am surprised that the Opposition did not find it possible to listen to many of the points made by the Parliamentary Secretary, points which deserved to be put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that we have had the sort of contribution that emanated from the Opposition.  A short while ago we had the fines section of the Bill.  This was the subject of much of the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution. <Col N="1824" /> For the record I would advert to something to which I did not refer before today, that is, that in the legislation prepared previously in this area by the Fianna Fáil Administration they envisaged the laying down of strict penalties in respect of employees and their trade unions.  That legislation was on my desk when I went into the Department in 1973.  One can realise the inconsistency between the legislation prepared by the previous Administration and their attacks today on our legislation which does not include any provision for penalties in respect of employees or their unions.  The object of this Bill is simply to ensure that any pay agreement negotiated by the banks and their staff will conform generally with the pattern of settlements emerging for other workers.  This is the sole objective of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On section 3 the Opposition tabled an amendment which sought to suggest that they would drop all their objections to the measure should we include a reference to a national wage agreement.  Again, this is inconsistent with the position adopted by them yesterday when they declared publicly that their opposition to the Bill was based, among other factors, on its being introduced at a time when a national pay increase norm had not been established.  The Opposition should decide exactly where they stand in the midst of all these inconsistencies. What has been remarked on during the day is that they have indulged in a blend of personal bullying and inaccuracy.  It is obvious now that any reputation they may have had for responsibility in matters of this kind is in shreds.</P>

      <P>They have taken pieces of this legislation totally out of context.  This is the same party who, in legislation to deal with the ESB sought to prevent men going on strike.  The result of that legislation in 1966 was that employees of that board were sent to jail but that within a very short time there was the farcical situation of their being bailed out and <Col N="1825" /> sent home in taxis which were paid for by the enterprise concerned.  It is this Opposition who have the hypocrisy to criticise the legislation we are enacting today.  Fianna Fáil are the casualties of the stance they have adopted in this instance.  We are working for a peaceful settlement of the present industrial impasse in the bank situation.  We are working for a solution that will avert the banks' <Col N="1826" /> closure on Monday.  It is my belief that the measure we are proposing here will not be necessary, that it will be possible to bring about a settlement which will ensure that the remuneration of bank employees will be in conformity with the rates of pay of other groups of workers.  That objective of the Government will be rendered easier of fulfilment once this measure has been enacted.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service Commissioners have furnished the following information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competition for technician trainee, Department of Posts and Telegraphs, consists of written tests and, for those placed highest in them, an interview.  Some candidates' completed answer papers in two of the tests were stolen in a train robbery while being returned from the examiners. The Civil Service Commissioners therefore decided that such of the candidates affected as had done well in the other written tests and would probably have been in the running for <Col N="1710" /> the interview, should be asked to resit tests in the subjects the papers for which had been stolen.</P>
    <P>All school principals and guidance counsellors were informed accordingly.</P>
    <P>I should add that no candidate from the west of Ireland had his answer papers stolen.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed maternity allowance from 7th June, 1976.  One of the contribution conditions to be satisfied is that not less than 26 employment contributions have been paid or credited in respect of the claimant in the governing contribution year from 1st July, 1974, to 6th July 1975.  In that year the claimant has only 23 contributions paid and credited and accordingly is not entitled to benefit on her claim.  Contributions paid in respect of her employment by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from 1st July, 1974, to 24th January, 1975, were for the purposes of widows' pension and occupational injury only and are not reckonable for the purposes of other benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>An application for a transport service to Kilcorney national school has been received in the Department from the board of management of the school.  In order to warrant the establishment of a service to a national school under the terms of the free transport scheme there must be a sufficient number of eligible children in a distinct locality who are attending or propose to attend their nearest national school to ensure that the average daily number of eligible children being conveyed each term shall not be less than ten.  The application received from the board of management of Kilcorney national school has been investigated and it would appear that there is not a sufficient number of eligible children in a distinct locality to warrant the establishment of a service.  In the circumstances the Department have no option under the terms of the scheme but to refuse the application.</P>
