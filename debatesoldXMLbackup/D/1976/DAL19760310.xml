      <P>On Thursday last I replied to a question from Deputy Dowling asking me if I would supply the United Nations reports relating to the action in which members of the Defence Forces were killed in action on United Nations service.  In reply to a supplementary question by Deputy Dowling referring to reports on the situation in Elizabethville and the Kamina Airbase, I said that all available information had been placed in the Library of the House.  Deputy Dowling then asked me when I had placed these documents in the Library.  My recollection of my reply to this supplementary is that I said &ldquo;presumably immediately following the Deputy's last question&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil record, however, this appears as an unconditional statement &ldquo;immediately following the Deputy's last question&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have since discovered that the course of events in respect of these reports was not as I had understood it to be.  Deputy Dowling did not ring my Department to identify the reports in which he was interested until November of last year, six months after his initial question on the subject and the reports were not, in fact, secured and made available until shortly before Deputy Dowling's most recent question.</P>
      <P>I should like to apologise to the House for having unintentionally misled it.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to participate in any type of witch hunt when I asked that the matter be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges yesterday.  I fully accept the Minister's explanation. I should like to point out that in May, 1975 I did ask the Minister a question as this was a very sensitive area, a particular area for which I have some responsibility and I intend to ensure that however sensitive the problems are in relation to the Defence Forces I will probe them and ascertain the facts in relation to many of the matters so that I will be in a position to speak with authority as time will permit.  I waited a reasonable time after the question believing that there would be difficulties in compiling and obtaining the information. I then rang the Department and did not even receive an acknowledgment. I again raised the matter on 3rd March and I was informed then by the Minister, as stated, that the volumes were in the Library.  I ascertained that the volumes had been placed in the Library the day the question was to be answered.</P>
      <P>Having read the Minister's reply&mdash; he indicated at the end of the reply that I should have been more open with the House as to what I was getting at, rather than adopt a process of insinuation&mdash;it conveyed to me that the matter was of a most serious nature.  I was appalled yesterday when I got the letter from the Ceann Comhairle to be told at the same time that the Ceann Comhairle was releasing the letter to the Press.  I should like to know now from the Ceann Comhairle if I am in a position to mix this matter in public with the Ceann Comhairle on this issue.  The whole question of releasing the letter to the Press by the Ceann Comhairle will be in question and will be dealt with now. It has not happened before that I know of.  I have received many letters from the Ceann Comhairle in relation to demands and never before has one been referred to the Press.</P>
      <P>Again, I would like to say to the Minister that I am thankful to him for the information supplied now and I fully accept his explanation that there was a mistake in his Department.</P>

      <P>Normally, there should be no comment arising from a personal explanation of this kind except by the Member directly involved but since Deputy Dowling has brought the Chair into the matter I feel I should explain the position to the House.  Deputy Dowling pressed me yesterday to take action in relation to some alleged misbehaviour on the part of a Minister in answering a question last week.  I tried to explain to him that the way a Minister answers is not a matter for the Chair but on being pressed further by the Deputy I promised to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy had raised the matter without giving me the courtesy of prior notice and thereby the opportunity of looking at the Minister's answer.  When I did subsequently look at the answer I did not find anything in the way of a <i>prima facie</i> breach of privilege on which the Chair should act.  I wrote accordingly to the Deputy, the text of my letter being as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Right">9th March, 1976.</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
      <P>Earlier today you pressed me to consider allowing a matter of a Minister's answer to a question to go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I tried to explain to you that the nature of a Minister's answer was not a matter for the Chair but on further pressure from you I agreed to consider the matter since I was not clear as to the nature of your complaint.</P>
      <P>I have now had an opportunity of looking at the Official Report of the Minister's answer and I find there is nothing therein which would warrant action by the Chair.  If you are dissatisfied with the Minister's answering, as you seem to be, it is open to you to pursue the matter by normal Parliamentary Procedure e.g. you can consult with my office in relation to putting down a further question, you can seek to raise the issue on the adjournment or you can submit a motion for debate in the House, etc.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> Since the Deputy raised the matter as one of privilege I dealt with it as a matter of priority at all stages and published it having informed Deputy Dowling beforehand.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Chair is entitled to defend itself.  The Deputy has accused me of protecting the Minister. I reject that charge as totally untrue and contemptible.  I also reject any charge of collusion with the Minister or Government.  Neither I nor my officials had any communication directly or indirectly with the Minister or Government at any time prior to the issue of my letter.  Indeed, I did not know what the Deputy was charging the Minister with.  If it is inaccuracy in answering a question, that of itself would not constitute a <i>prima facie</i> breach of privilege and would not be a matter on which the Chair should act.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling was put out of the House on 4th March as a result of his protest about the untruthfulness of the statements in the House of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Deputy Dowling's protests have, I suggest, been fully vindicated today by the manly apology &mdash;for which we are all grateful&mdash;of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Deputy Dowling.  I think the matter might be happily concluded now if in all the circumstances, the Chair was prepared to apologise similarly to Deputy Dowling for what happened on 4th March.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling left the House as a result of an argument which arose out of Deputy Dowling's statement that the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this matter were untruthful. The Chair refused to allow that matter to be pursued and in the circumstances it was perfectly understandable that Deputy Dowling and many other Members of the House should have the feeling that there appeared to be some element of protection by <Col N="1577" /> the Chair of the Minister in the difficulties in which he was.  I think the fact that that feeling was held is vindicated and justified by the apology of the Minister for Foreign Affairs today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last night I was referring to the people who were exempt.  I pointed out that this is the section which makes provision for reference to the Labour Court of agricultural workers.  I have no intention of making a Second Reading speech on the section.  I prefer to say something on some of the following sections.  However, I would like to emphasise again to the Minister that in this area he is dealing with a category quite different from those engaged in industrial employment. The reference to the Labour Court of any disputes in relation to agricultural workers should be handled by a section of the Labour Court who would have the necessary knowledge from both sides of what is involved in agricultural work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that in agricultural work very often wet conditions play an important part in the working week of any particular person.  Many farmers do not keep records like business firms do.  There is usually a very good relationship between the farmer and his employees and there are perks attached to the employment in many cases that are not available in other <Col N="1581" /> types of employment.  When weather conditions do not permit particular work to be carried out this is usually made up when the weather is fine. The old motto in farming is to make hay while the sun shines and the farmer has to take advantage of weather conditions.  Any reference to the Labour Court of disputes arising in relation to agricultural workers would require to be handled by people having the necessary knowledge of what is actually involved in agricultural work.  I suggest to the Minister that the setting up of a section in the Labour Court to deal with those disputes should be absolutely impartial. The people selected should have the necessary specialised knowledge of the peculiarities of employment in agriculture generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As this section deals with the definition of a worker at least by exclusion of certain categories I would like to hear the Minister's views on the definition of an agricultural worker.  The word is used in the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936 and as has already been said, conditions on farms have changed.  At that time if one could use a spade reasonably well one could be defined as an agricultural worker.  There are still a few agricultural workers around who are not skilled in the full sense.  Fully skilled agricultural workers have to have considerable expertise with various forms of machinery.  At times they have to be able to repair machinery and act as fitters, and so on. There are some people who are slightly incapacitated by mental retardation and I am wondering whether this legislation might not harm them rather than help them.  On all sides of the House we are concerned with the dangers of the exploitation of such people.  This is a very important point.  There are some people who would not have any chance of a job in competition on the labour market but who are provided with board and lodgings on farms.  They should be covered in some way in such an important Bill as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various other points I will take up on the different sections but I should like to see a firmer definition <Col N="1582" /> of an agricultural worker for the purposes of the Act.  This carries with it also the onus of the definition of an agricultural employer because there is a grey area at the moment in the agricultural industry field in which legal people find it very difficult to define the status of an employer, whether he is an industrialist or a farmer.  A man may be totally involved in the production of broiler chickens.  His farm is used solely for that purpose and it has a considerable labour content.  The reason I am raising this is that I know some legal people are having difficulty in defining in this field.</P>
    <P>In my area there is a movement towards heavy development of the pig industry.  The biggest piggery in the country is in my constituency. Is this an agricultural industry or is it a farming operation?  What blurs the edges is the fact that it is exclusively the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries that deals with such people rather than the Department of Industry and Commerce.  To many people, some of these enterprises seem to be purely industrial.  This may produce a certain amount of confusion and a field day for lawyers later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on the point made by Deputy Brennan about the type of people who will investigate disputes which may arise.  There are various types of agricultural workers.  Some of them would almost be called industrial workers. They come in to work at a certain hour and they have no connection with the family.  It is fairly straightforward to deal with their wages.  In my area there is hardly any such person. The agricultural worker is practically one of the family.  He has lunch in the house and he gets a cup of tea in the field.  Many people dealing with agriculture know nothing about such matters.  People investigating the payment of wages should know something about them.  A number of these people have a small farm of their own.  They may have the use of a tractor.  They may get certain things in the house.  We need to have somebody on this board who understands <Col N="1583" /> the value of the work done by tractors and the provision of meals and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the weather.  As I said on Second Stage, you might be idle for a couple of hours because of the weather and you might work another couple of hours in the evening.  As Deputy Brennan said, you have to make hay while the sun shines.  That applies to corn and everything else on a farm.  Very few people understand how we farmers live.  I am talking about a reasonably sized farm, not a factory farm.</P>
      <P>A good deal of dirt has been thrown at the old board, but the old board set a minimum wage which no skilled man was working for.  The man we want to protect is the unskilled man. No skilled man would work for the minimum wage.  We must have somebody in the Labour Court who knows the value of the use of tractors and the provision of meals.  It is entirely different dealing with an industrial dispute where the employee never sees his boss.  He clocks in in the morning at a certain hour and he goes home in the evening at a certain hour.  Hail, rain or snow, it makes no difference to him.  He can work away.  You cannot work on a farm hail, rain or snow.  That is the difference.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson spoke about poultry outfits and piggeries.  The work is done there whether it is wet or dry.  I am talking about the ordinary mixed farmer who needs an employee.  The people who adjudicate in disputes should know something about him. The old board consisted of people from regions all over the country and were representative of workers and employers.  They all knew what they were talking about.  They set a minimum wage which was never worked for except by the unskilled labourer. This is the man we want to protect. The Minister is now setting up a new board and he is adding to the Labour Court.  They must be people who understand the country as a whole and not just industrial disputes.</P>

      <P>The points made by the Deputies are valid.  Deputy Callanan referred to the flexibility and <Col N="1584" /> the knowledge and the understanding of the situation which can vary so much between different areas, the different farming operations which are carried on, and the different approaches there can be to the agricultural worker.  These are all very important points and they will have to be borne in mind.  Despite any legislation which is introduced, there must be an appreciation and knowledge of the situation to make this a satisfactory and successful exercise.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the apprenticeship contracts.  This is an area we must look at very carefully.  In the past agriculture has been our bulwark, our basic industry, and it will continue to be that.  On section 1 yesterday Deputy Brennan referred to the departure from intensive tillage, the flight from the land generally, the industrial development of the 1960s and the current setback in that development.  Now we must turn our eyes to agriculture at all levels.</P>
      <P>We must consider not only the agricultural worker who is working in a different climate from that of the past but we must also encourage more intensive farming and the creation of more jobs on the land.  The resultant creation of jobs in industries based on agriculture is very important.</P>
      <P>We must consider seriously the necessity to train farm workers who are serving their apprenticeships.  As has been pointed out by some Deputies, we are no longer talking about outdated methods because the agricultural worker today is a man of many skills. We must give attention to vegetable growing and horticulture and in the southern part of the country there is room for development and encouragement here.  A group of people have grown tulips in parts of County Cork in an experimental project for the Dutch who are regarded as the experts in that area.  In addition, through the efforts of a local community there is a daffodil export operation in that part of the country.  Admittedly these are very small areas but they could be nursed and encouraged with a view to the creation of employment in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> The training of farm workers is essential, not only in the ordinary day-to-day chores but in the more modern intensive types of farming.  I would ask the Minister to discuss with the Government, and particularly with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the possibility of encouraging the types of agriculture that will give employment. At the moment there are many farmers' sons and daughters seeking employment with little prospect of success.  Perhaps they could be trained to develop certain projects on their own farms.  If a small sum of money or some assistance was given to them it would encourage private enterprise and effort by these young people in their own areas.  There may be a few great people among them.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Minister will not agree with my theory; he may be of the opinion that private enterprise should not be encouraged in the young people but in the nation's interest this is very desirable.  I would urge him to consider this matter and the apprenticeship aspect with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and get schemes into operation in order to give employment.  This is with regard to the basic agricultural industry, to work on the land and in the area of more intensive horticulture.  What is done in this area will affect the industries based on agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the position where a farmer could afford to pay an apprentice, perhaps his own son, a certain amount but not the full statutory wage?  Would it be possible to introduce something corresponding to the employment premium scheme for farming in order to increase the numbers employed on farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Many people are educated with the assistance of grants but unfortunately they cannot get employment. If a person has gone through secondary school and is going on to further education having all the qualifications for a grant, would the Minister's Department consider making some of that grant available to a person who had a small project in mind in the area of agriculture or <Col N="1586" /> horticulture?  They could create a job for themselves, admittedly with certain ties, and in some instances it might expand and provide employment for others.  Perhaps the Minister would give his views on this?</P>

      <P>It is a little outside the scope of this Bill but I would favour a system of agriculture where people who wished to make it their career could eventually be charged with management of an area of land. In other words, I should like to see the situation where a person's knowledge of working in agriculture would be the essential qualification rather than the ownership of land.  It would be my preference to make that the test.  However, that lies outside the scope of this Bill and the whole question of training in agriculture is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. There are schemes for farm managers and I know the Minister would like to see them extended.  As far as I am aware, there is not as yet an adequate scheme for those who wish to make their career in agriculture and to have further training in the techniques of farming as distinct from the ownership of land.  As I have pointed out, that lies outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson raised questions about the definition of farm workers. He is right in saying that in recent years there has been a large extension into what is referred to as the &ldquo;agri&rdquo; business, something that was not there when the original Agricultural Wages Board was in its heyday in the 1930s. The ancillary services and industries that have grown up around the increasing mechanisation of agriculture is a new development.  This question was examined in 1969 when an interdepartmental committee examined the question or redefining an agricultural worker and agriculture in general. This was done under the aegis of the Agricultural Wages Board to see whether the board should not apply to a wider net of employees and whether the definitions should not be redefined to relate more closely to the modern developments in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The upshot of that inter-departmental study was that it was quite <Col N="1587" /> impossible to define clearly those grey areas.  It would be better left to the discretion of the board itself.  In this Bill we have provision, under the joint labour committee arrangements, that where a worker felt his work properly belonged to the area of agriculture, there is discretion left to the court to see whether he does not come under the Joint Labour Committee arrangements.  That possibility is under section 57 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, where the court has power to decide in regard to the applicability of a joint labour committee or an employment regulation order to particular work.  Under that section a worker may appeal to the civil court on the question of the applicability of a particular employment regulation order to him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about the widening boundaries of the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;.  We say that this Bill in a very exact sense makes it clear that anybody working in some of the areas listed in section 1 is by definition in agricultural employment. Outside that in the borderline areas there is the right under this Bill for an individual worker to require application of its provisions to him.  Under the old Agricultural Wages Board there was the tradition that the wages of certain workers who were not defined closely within the wages board kept pace with those decided upon by the wages board, and that negotiating situation will continue under this Bill.  In industrial relations when one legislates for a particular section of workers there are equally important repercussions and consequences for workers whose wage rates have been tied over the years to the categories of workers defined under the legislation in question.  The same appertains to this question of agricultural workers under this Bill.  Under the wages board the wages rates of other categories either analogous to agricultural employment or related to it in some way were tied to the wages board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan said that, whatever one might say about the old board, it had a regional composition which ensured overall that, whatever <Col N="1588" /> its deficiencies, lack of knowledge of the realities of agriculture was not among them.  That may well be and certainly I am not questioning the knowledge of agriculture of the representatives of the old board.  What I am questioning is this.  The reason for this legislation is that the old board did not over the period of its operation succeed appreciably in breaking down the vast difference which had grown up between the conditions of agricultural workers and those of industrial workers in general.  I am not saying that that was entirely the fault of the old board.  There were objective factors involved in their lack of success in this area.  I am not entering into the general debate as to whether they ever tried.  There is a sharp division between the conditions of one category of worker and another.</P>
    <P>I regard the occupation of agricultural worker as an extremely skilled one.  The nature of his job was always skilled, but if it is possible to be more skilled in a job in recent years it is possible to say of his job that the increase in mechanisation of agriculture makes it a totally different job, one that is much more difficult even than it was in the past.  In the interest of agriculture itself it is essential that the division which has grown up between agricultural and industrial workers be ended.  If this is our most important national industry it must be assured of a contented and skilled workforce.  One of the ways in which one contributes to contentment in a workforce is to ensure that their standards of employment are kept as much as possible at the same level as those of other industrial workers. Even though agriculture may be increasing its mechanisation, it will require a workforce in the future which will be as permanent as possible, because one of the curses of the agricultural workforce was that so bad were the conditions in many cases that workers did not remain in their jobs.  This was not true in all cases. Deputies are as well aware as I am that in many cases workers were paid above the level laid down by the wages board.  We are trying to legislate for cases where this did not obtain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Deputy Callanan spoke in defence of the old board's knowledge of agriculture. I do not think we need fear that there will be any lack of knowledge under the new arrangement.  I will be coming to the section, a Cheann Comhairle, but one may say in advance in relation to this question of Deputy Callanan that the agricultural organisations would have the right to nominate their representatives to this joint labour committee.  Presumably they would have close regard to the regional nature of agriculture, because the problems of agriculture are different in the west, the south, the midlands and the east.  To make sure that there is a representative board it would be for the agricultural organisations to see that they get representatives who understand and are acquainted with the varying conditions obtaining in agriculture over the entire country.  The same would go for the workers' side.  There are regional differences in their situation, and it would be for their organisations to nominate representatives from around the country.  Therefore, on the score of knowledge of conditions obtaining in agriculture our new arrangements can ensure that this weakness or lack of knowledge will not exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question, quite properly, about the special problems of agriculture.  I can see his point that it is true to say that this group of workers is the largest additional group of workers to be put under the Labour Court's care since the establishment of that court in 1946.  At no previous period have we by one piece of legislation added something like upwards of 30,000 workers to be catered for by the court.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment which we discussed yesterday evening we are making arrangements for an additional division of the court.  The tenor of Deputy Brennan's remarks would suggest that he is conscious of the need for an extra division to be attached to the Labour Court. Whether that division should be specifically charged with dealing only with agricultural matters is a question <Col N="1590" /> I would prefer to leave open at present.  I think it is always more appropriate for the court to make these arrangements itself.  We should not here set down in statutory form the final arrangements on how the court should discharge its responsibilities. It could be said that we would be preserving under another form the separateness of agricultural workers were we to say to the court that there must be a division to deal with nothing else except agricultural workers. The intent of this legislation is to end the separate treatment of agricultural workers and to put them on the same level as everyone else.  We place them under the same legislation as all other industrial workers and we end that status which was theirs, if status it can be called, whereby a different kind of legislation applied to their occupation. Previously they could go to the Labour Court only in the event of a trade dispute.  From now on the Labour Court will be the final appeal body, the appointing body for the joint labour committee.  They will be under its care as interpreter of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  They will be treated the same as everyone else, no better and no worse, and no worse is the important point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald took up the point about farm apprentices, with which I agree, and Deputy Wilson also raised the necessity for having better training and facilities for those engaged in agriculture. Again I fully agree.  Quite a lot has been done through the farm management scheme but possibly more could be done.  However, it is not primarily my responsibility but that of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and he has discussed this with the farming organisations, who are very anxious to see properly qualified personnel coming into farming. This measure is concerned solely with one important aspect of those working in agriculture: the conditions and pay of farm workers.  Under this Bill we cannot discuss the whole field of training in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see in the proposed new court a section dealing with agricultural matters.  I appreciate that it might be impracticable <Col N="1591" /> to have such a section but I do not think it would be beyond the capabilities of the court to enlist persons with specialised agricultural knowledge who, when occasion arose, would deal with special problems of agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill substitutes a subsection for subsection (1) of section 4 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, thereby giving access to the Labour Court to agricultural workers and right of access to the JLC like industrial workers.  They are being put on a par with other workers with the exception of those specified.  This gives them the right to have agreements registered, like national wage agreements. Such agreements have in them provision for dealing with anomalies which are usually dealt with by the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>I can easily visualise in the special circumstances of agricultural workers that there are many anomalies which would not arise so often in relation to other types of employment and therefore there is need in the proposed new institution for people with knowledge of agriculture who would be able to ascertain what would constitute anomalies and discern when these anomalies should be the subject of a decision by the court.</P>
      <P>It has frequently been pointed out here that many agricultural workers enjoy certain facilities or &ldquo;perks&rdquo; which are not available to other workers, such things as farm produce, sometimes use of dwellings on the land on which they work, sometimes some meals, not all meals.  These things may or may not be provided and they could pose anomalies that would not be easily apparent to the average man dealing with industrial cases in the Labour Court.  We will be dealing with another section later to which Deputy Fitzgerald has an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of great importance that this legislation does not impose an extra strain on employers who already experience many vicissitudes because of the special nature of their work. People who have no knowledge of <Col N="1592" /> what living and working on a farm means very often think they understand all the difficulties and the precarious nature of living on the land. Of course they do not.  Unlike any other employer, a farmer cannot easily budget for the year ahead.  The outcome of his labours depends on many factors including weather, markets, the old supply and demand factor.  Weather conditions almost entirely dictate the success of his efforts in regard to tillage and there are animal and crop diseases to be contended with, all posing a continuous battle with imponderables.  I appreciate that modern methods and technologies have eliminated many of these hazards but the farmer nevertheless has to contend with drought on the one hand or too much rain on the other, and of course storms of one kind or another still take their toll. The employer of agricultural workers still has no such thing as a nine to five day&mdash;it is still dawn to darkness and sometimes beyond it.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about what we should do to tax the farmer and about the great wealth people think he is enjoying, but we still do not see a great rush into farming.  Indeed the figures show that the movement is in the other direction.  In recent times the farmer has succeeded in getting his position better understood, in getting people to realise the importance of the agricultural employer, who is slowly coming into his own at last. For many years he produced food for the nation and for export and was working for a few pence an hour.</P>
    <P>That does not mean we should be too ready to rush in to see what we can take from the agricultural employer, and for that reason I hope that the good relationship that existed on the land between employer and employee&mdash;almost a family relationship&mdash;will not be destroyed by this legislation the success of which will depend to a great extent on the manner in which it is administered.</P>
    <P>Agricultural workers with whom I discussed this Bill did not seem in the slightest degree concerned about whether or not there was this legislation. Neither did they seem to think <Col N="1593" /> there was any demand for it.  They believed they were always able to come to reasonable arrangements with their employers without any involvement in the rough and tumble that takes place in the industrial relations arena and many of them feel this legislation will merely make them part of the tussle that goes on in connection with registered wage agreements and so forth.  They are conscious of the fact that their employment is of a peculiar type and does not really compare with industrial employment.  It is a specific type of employment with many peculiarities that do not apply in other employments.  It is argued this Bill will benefit those, if there are any such, who are not getting the full benefit of that to which workers are entitled.  I question if there are any such.  However, if there are, this will simply ensure their being able to make a legal claim to their entitlement.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Board set a minimum wage.  Wage fixing is almost invariably fixed at a minimum. Higher rates can be paid and that applied in agriculture.  Where wage agreements are concerned, if it is known that a firm is paying higher than the fixed rate there is an inducement to others to seek the same rate and that can start a general wage demand spiral.  I am not too sure agricultural workers are all that anxious to become part of the rough and tumble of industrial relations.  They are working happily and they have adapted themselves to interesting work and I trust this legislation will not act as a disincentive to farmers to employ more.  Other Ministers, particularly the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, could come to the rescue by creating incentives, such as we had in the past, like the relief of rates in respect of male employment on the land.  Incentives would encourage farmers to employ more and they might possibly go in for more tillage because that is labour intensive.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister is in a position to tell us whether the insurance contribution, the weekly stamp, as it is called, will be increased and <Col N="1594" /> brought up to the level of the industrial stamp as a result of this legislation. It has always been at a lower rate and there is a feeling abroad that this legislation will automatically mean an increase in the stamp.  Can the Minister tell us whether or not this will be the case?</P>
    <P>This legislation will effect a dramatic change for a large section of workers, workers from whom we had no trouble in the past and with whom there was no difficulty.  I do not think they were downtrodden.  They may have been in the days of the hiring fair in Letterkenny when men went into the Lagan Valley to work for £7 per year.  That was immediately following the famine and writers like Patrick Magill and Peadar O'Donnell and others have found ample scope for writing about those bad old days.</P>

        <i>Children of the Dead End</i> by Patrick Magill.  Those days have long since gone and the agricultural worker has entered an era of comparative contentment and peace, away from the turmoil of the industrial world where strikes take place and there is jockeying for parity, differentials and relativity.  These are things unknown to agricultural workers and I sincerely hope that, as a result of this legislation, they will not be dragged into the same turmoil that has bedevilled industrial activities over the past 20 years.  The one thing that will ensure that there will not be such an evolution will be the putting on the joint labour committee and on the Labour Court people who understand the peculiarities of the agricultural worker's job, the environment, conditions and so on to which he has become accustomed.  This would ensure the harmony and peace that has existed continuing into the future.  In the recruitment of personnel we must ensure that there is no interference with the smooth running of the agricultural industry.</P>

Deputy Brennan has said most of what I want to say, but I want to stress that we must have people with practical experience. Theorists forget that nature plays a very important part in agriculture. They forget the weather plays an important part.  We must have people with practical experience who understand what is involved and not somebody who has read all about whatever it is in some book because that does not work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan raised again the unique problems met with in agriculture when he queried whether it would not be advisable to have a particular section of the Labour Court specialising in the agricultural industry and the problems relating to it because they are so different from those obtaining in industry generally.  We should not get the two things confused.  There is the joint labour committee.  That is the kernel of this legislation, the provision of a joint labour committee which would be representative of the employee and management interests in the agricultural industry.  These two sides of the joint labour committee will presumably have all the specialised knowledge necessary to avoid the charge that the committee would be over-theoretical, would lack the requisite knowledge of the problems of agriculture.  The joint labour committee, in its structure, with this representative arrangement, will be well equipped to know the problems of the industry, to know the conditions that obtain in the industry and to know the arrangements that are best made in the interest of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, I have made the point that I do not think it wise that we should charge a particular new division of the Labour Court with a specific area of investigation and confine it to that area.  The Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are the designated nominating bodies for members of the Labour Court, and <Col N="1596" /> while one side might be capable of nominating specialists in agriculture or those who are acquainted with its problems, perhaps the same thing could not quite be said of the employers' side in an arrangement which would charge a particular division of the Labour Court with the responsibility of dealing only with agricultural matters.  If we pass this provision here I would prefer to see the new division of the court operate the same as any other division of the court, with the court &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; making their own arrangements about its area of investigation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan says he hopes we do not see the same difficulties that are evident in industry in general erupting in agriculture.  I hope we do not.  I see no reason why we should.  I would not quite agree with him when he refers to a Garden of Eden situation in which the workers in that industry were content with the old arrangement and this new legislation disrupts that peace.  If there was peace and contentment, that should not be changed under the new arrangement. But the new arrangement will ensure that, if there is to be peace and contentment in the industry, it will not be a peace and contentment that is bought at the expense of someone in that industry, that it will not be on the basis of low wages and poor conditions for a minority in the industry, and that all employed will have a certain standard in their conditions, hours of work and salaries.</P>
    <P>That is all I envisage under this legislation.  It is simply asking for agricultural workers the same conditions and the same legislative provisions that apply to workers in industry. There is no reason why this cannot be arranged under the representation I have outlined.  In addition to that, the joint labour committee will draw up its own arrangements which will be subject to the scrutiny of the Labour Court and the Labour Court will, if necessary, refer back any proposal to the joint labour committee. However, the joint labour committee will be the initiating body, and they will have within their ranks adequate representation from both sides.  This <Col N="1597" /> will ensure that the problems which the Deputies are apprehensive of, such as lack of acquaintance with the industry, will be dealt with and secondly, that the conditions of the workers will be catered for under the general legislation that applies to other workers in that the Labour Court itself is the final arbitrating body for interpretation of their conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for a number of things.  First, it is appointing the joint labour committee to replace the Agricultural Wages Board.  The Agricultural Wages Board have given long service.  They have at all times established minimum wage rates and, despite any complaints the Minister may have made about the out-of-date methods they may have used, they were very familiar with the field of agriculture and the differences that applied in counties like Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Cork and so on.  There are of course regional differences that do not apply to any other industry: different farming activities, different sizes of farm, different quality of land, different conditions applying to farm work generally.  For that reason, the <Col N="1598" /> Agricultural Wages Board deserve to be complimented by this House for the contribution they have made to the agricultural industry.  Perhaps we should be critical of them in certain respects, but on the whole they did good work.  We have agreed that there is now a necessity for bringing agricultural workers in line with industrial workers.  We have to be very careful here because it is important that the joint labour committee understand, in the same way as the Agricultural Wages Board did, the type of arrangements that have existed in the past and the happy relationships that have continued between employer and employee.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that there is no such thing as exploitation and that all employees can negotiate and have redress in the event of mistreatment or unfair payment and so on.  Equally important is the fact that the relationships that have existed between agricultural workers and agricultural employees must be continued and must be seen to continue.  There is unanimous agreement in this House in that respect.  The joint labour committee will be tremendously important and must understand the differences that exist between, for example, the big farms in Kildare and Meath and the smaller farms, particularly in parts of my own constituency in Cork, and, indeed, in the west of Ireland generally.  In the Kildare-Meath area there would probably be a less personal relationship between employer and employee than there would be in the smaller holdings.  I would never support the idea that &ldquo;perks&rdquo; are a substitute for wages, but they do help to promote good relationships and this structure must be seen to continue. This seems important to me. The success of this joint labour committee depends on not approaching agriculture in the same way as it may approach an industry which, wherever it may be based, has basically the same conditions going for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of this joint labour committee means, of course, the ending of the Agricultural Wages Board.  I want to know from the Minister how long-serving some of these members have been and <Col N="1599" /> whether he feels they should be entitled to any redundancy payment or to any entitlement due to length of service.  I understand that some of them have given quite a considerable period of their lives to it.  At all times I am sure that their approach was one of doing their best within the limits of the guidelines available to them, but certainly contributing their share to the peace that has existed in agriculture. They may not have been as effective as one would like them to be, but that does not take away from the fact that the Agricultural Wages Board has contributed to the successful relations which existed in agriculture over the years.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the position regarding these officers.  I understand these agricultural officers based in different parts of the country belong to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Will they continue as officers under the new joint labour committee or what will their functions be generally?  I should also like to know what the position of the administrative and secretarial staff of the Agricultural Wages Board will be now that we are passing legislation here appointing the joint labour committee?</P>
    <P>In later sections we will be coming to other aspects of this committee, but I do believe that one of the real kernels of this piece of legislation is this joint labour committee.  The members who will form this committee must be familiar with agriculture, must have an understanding of agriculture, and must know the variables that exist in agriculture. There must be more flexibility because of the different regions.  It must work.  We all want it to work.  I see no reason why good relations in the field of agriculture should not continue. I believe they will continue. Our part in ensuring that good relations continue only stresses for all of us the importance of the people who will form this joint labour committee. I accept the point of the Minister that this is putting a very large number of workers under the Labour Court at one time.  I am referring to the importance of the composition <Col N="1600" /> of the joint labour committee, the replacement of the Agricultural Wages Board, and the fact that there should be some compensation for the people who have served for a long period on that board.</P>

      <P>Any inspectors who worked in an enforcement capacity under the wages board will be absorbed into the inspectorate that will operate to ensure that the decisions of the joint labour committee are implemented around the country. That will look after their jobs and careers.  Their conditions will be unchanged and their seniority will be looked after.  They will simply carry out their old jobs under the new joint labour committee.</P>

      <P>Yes.  They were in agriculture, but they will now become attached to an enforcement agency of the joint labour committee and part of the inspectorate of the Department of Labour.  The secretarial staff will, of course, be absorbed in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The functions of the board will come to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if there was any other question of substance raised. Again, Deputy Fitzgerald stressed the necessity for a knowledge and acquaintance with the problems of agriculture continuing and the hope that this knowledge will continue under the new arrangement.  I see no reason why it should not continue. The representative nature of the joint labour committee will ensure that this will be the case.  A point was raised earlier which refers again to this knowledge and acquaintance with the problems of agriculture by, I think, Deputy Brennan.  Deputy Brennan referred to the difficulty of anomalies in industry and similar difficulties arising in agriculture and therefore the necessity of understanding the different circumstances obtaining in agriculture. In this connection, he spoke about the desirability of having a special division of the court to deal with agriculture.  I make the general point that I doubt if this is advisable <Col N="1601" /> in the circumstances of the court's working operations.  There must be flexibility in the court's operation. There must be flexibility to allow a division to be sent by the authorities in the court to deal with a particular case in any area and to deal with any category of workers who come under the same common legislation.  I would prefer that to continue rather than to have a division of the court to be charged specifically and confined to one area of investigation.  I would point out to Deputy Brennan that, of course, the court always has the right to appoint assessors under the Act. The most frequently quoted example of the court's use of this right was their appointment of assessors in the footwear industry last autumn to examine the possibility of job losses in that industry.  They would have a similar right to appoint assessors to examine a particular case in agriculture or anywhere else if there was this feeling among their members that there were some extra facts to be understood.</P>
    <P>Again, the general question was raised of the necessity of having a regional knowledge of agriculture in order to be able to appreciate the different scales of work and the problems involved as between east and west, south and the midlands in agriculture. The joint labour committee which will be national in character will, in common with other joint labour committees, have always the right to appoint local sub-committees and these can be located in different regions.  In examining the regional nature of agriculture it will be for the overall national joint labour committee to reach a decision as to whether local sub-committees should be appointed.  There is no reason to think that they would not consider making such a decision and they may very well adopt that procedure in their work.  Deputies need not fear that the new joint labour committee will lack the essential knowledge required before reaching decisions in relation to agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's assurance that the full-time officers will suffer in no way as a <Col N="1602" /> result of the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board, there are a few questions I wish to put to him.  I understand from what he said that the personnel will be taken over by the Department of Labour.  At present their rank is that of supervisory agricultural officers.  Since the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is much bigger than the Department of Labour I would like an assurance from the Minister that promotional outlets for these people will not be less in his Department than they are at present in the other Departments.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the office staff were being assured on this point but it is usual in a replacement Bill of this nature to have that assurance stated explicitly at the end of the Bill.  To my knowledge there are four supervisory officers involved and I should like to hear from the Minister on the question of residence in so far as they are concerned.  Will they be allowed to continue to live in their present locations?  Obviously, to move them to other areas would create great problems of a personal and family nature.  While some officers may wish to move, others have their roots in an area and are contributing to the social life of those areas so that they may wish to remain where they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question, too, of the man who has been acting part-time as chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board for the past 12 to 14 years.  He is well known for his punctilious attention to his duties, for his diplomacy and his wide knowledge of the whole situation and of human beings generally.  He is a man who has a distinguished national record and I should like to hear something from the Minister in regard to him.  I assume that the Minister in his strictures on the operations of the Agricultural Wages Board did not intend to reflect on the officers, such as the part-time chairman and the supervisory agricultural officers who are living in different areas of the country, giving of their knowledge and expertise to their respective localities.  He might tell us, too, whether these people have a choice <Col N="1603" /> to remain with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated already the position with regard to office staff.  I share the Deputy's concern that the inspectors' promotional opportunities not be limited by the change in their immediate employing body.  In my general remarks about the necessity for the change from the old system to that of the new joint labour committee, there was no intention of any criticism or slight in regard to the work of the inspectors of the Agricultural Wages Board.  These people undertook a very difficult job which they carried out to the best of their ability.  It was their responsibility to ensure that the board's decisions were implemented in full and in this regard they did a creditable job.  Nobody is endeavouring to take that away from them.  Their promotional position will be considered carefully and no action will be taken to imperil their opportunities in this regard.  Indeed, the contrary would appear to be the case &mdash;that their promotional position would seem to be improved because whereas up to now they have been isolated in a section of four in their Department they will now become part of a larger inspectorate in the Department of Labour.  Their living arrangements in the various areas will be carefully considered, too.  There is the necessity for the joint labour committee to have a regional element in their work and, obviously, the nature of the inspectors' work requires a degree of mobility.  If any area calls for some decentralisation it is the area relating to agricultural activities, so I see no reason why there should be any change in the residential position of these inspectors when the new arrangements come into existence.  Because of this new legislation the functions of the chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board whose activities were always part-time, are at an end.  This happens when the law changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the succinct statement of the Minister regarding the chairman was meant as a discourtesy but it sounded a little too curt.  However, I may be misreading <Col N="1604" /> the Minister.  Perhaps he will tell us if there is any possibility of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment from either the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or the Department of Labour for this man as an indication of the appreciation of the work he has been doing for the past 12 to 14 years.  It seems a rather cavalier thing to say: the law has changed, you are out of a job, that is it; goodbye.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be discourteous but I have stated the position as it is.  We do not have an arrangement in the State services for a part-time chairman to be given any financial grant at the end of a period of office.  That is not usual and it is not for me to decide to allot such.  It is not done in any part of the State services.  There are cases of chairmen of many State boards coming to the end of a period of office after a number of years of chairmanship and part-time chairmen of such boards cannot expect any reimbursement from the State since their full-time occupations lie elsewhere.  They have been paid over the years for their chairmanship and that applies in this case.  I do not intend any discourtesy but I was describing the position as it is.  This is a new Bill and the Agricultural Wages Board, and the activities of that board, are at an end.  Those who have full-time occupations under that board will continue to be employed under the new arrangement but for those who had some part-time functions related to that board, their jobs and functions are ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, in lines 22 and 23 and lines 30 to 32, to delete &ldquo;from a panel prepared and presented to the Court by the Minister&rdquo; and in lines 25 to 27 and lines 34 to 36 to delete &ldquo;as the Minister thinks fit and with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the constitution of the joint labour committee. In this section there is a distinct departure from the principal Act.  We are at a loss to understand the necessity for this departure in view of the fact that we are basing the introduction of this Bill on the fact that it is a logical development to put agricultural workers on the same level as industrial workers.  We have three different categories of people being appointed to the joint labour committee under this section.  In the first instance we are told that the chairman and not more than two independent members of the committee shall be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I fail to see the necessity for the inclusion of &ldquo;Fisheries&rdquo; there.  It implies a permanency of that section being tied to the Department of Agriculture at a <Col N="1606" /> time when our fishing industry, and the needs of the nation, demand that &ldquo;Fisheries&rdquo; be given special attention. I believe a future Government will appoint a Minister for Fisheries. However, I appreciate the necessity for discussions with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>This section shows no change from the principal Act of 1946.  My amendment refers to the next two groups of people being selected to take part on this joint labour committee.  I have asked in the amendment that the Minister should not interfere in these appointments.  Subsection (b) of this section states:</P>
    <P>the representative (employers) members of the committee shall be appointed by the Court from a panel prepared and presented to the Court by the Minister after consultation with such organisation or organisations representative of agricultural employers as the Minister thinks fit and with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>We want to allow the court to consult with the organisations concerned and then appoint the members to the committee and not as proposed in the section which is a distinct departure from the 1946 Act.  It is an interference by two Ministers with the structure of the joint labour committee.  I believe the Ministers, and their successors, if we do not accept this amendment, will have powers that they can use to the detriment of a joint labour committee, a committee that must at all times be independent and be seen to be independent.  If the Ministers for Labour and Agriculture have the right to interfere with the structure of the joint labour committee such a right can be abused.</P>
    <P>We have evidence of political appointments being made on many boards over the past few years.  We have the recent example of the Bord na gCapall situation.  In that case the members of that board, after giving excellent service, were removed and replaced at the whim of a Minister. The chairman of Bord na gCapall gave much time, energy, effort and dedication to the service of that board <Col N="1607" /> during his term of office but he was lifted off that board without any prior notice.  He was not even given the courtesy of a place on the new board as an ordinary member, despite the fact that he and many of his members had travelled the length and breadth of this country on behalf of Bord na gCapall and the horse industry. Having used that example, is it difficult to understand why we suspect that the same might apply here, that this Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, will do the same to the joint labour committee?</P>
    <P>The section specifically states that members of the committee shall be appointed by the court from a panel prepared and presented to the court. In other words, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries come together and form a panel having consulted with the organisation or organisations representative of the agricultural employers and workers.  It appears that members of this panel may not be acceptable to the Minister for many reasons.  One has to be suspicious that maybe they will not be acceptable because of political reasons.</P>
    <P>It would be disastrous for the agricultural workers if this major step facilitated this kind of interference which could defeat the purpose of the joint labour committee before it began a new and difficult task.  We want to see this committee perform fairly and effectively, particularly on behalf of the agricultural workers.  I see no reason to depart from the 1946 Act in this case.  The Second Schedule, section 2 (b) reads:</P>
    <P>Members (in this Schedule referred to as representative members) appointed by the Court being&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) such number, as the Court thinks fit, of persons (in this Schedule referred to as representative (employers) members) who, in the opinion of the Court represent employers in relation to whom the committee is to operate, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> (ii) an equal number of persons (in this Schedule referred to as representative (workers) members) who, in the opinion of the Court, represent workers in relation to whom the Committee is to operate.</P>
    <P>There is no need to depart from those guidelines.  In proposing this amendment we are asking that the court, after consultation with the organisation, or organisations, representative of agricultural workers, appoint their members to the joint labour committee.  The same applies to workers' representatives.  I cannot understand the reason for consultation with the Minister.  Perhaps he will outline in detail his reasons for doing this.  It appears to be the thin end of the wedge.  If it applies to this joint labour committee, what guarantee have we that it will not apply to future committees?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and show his fair approach to this matter.  It will make his task easier during his term of office and will not give any opportunity to a Minister who succeeds him to avail of a specific situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This method was chosen because Deputies referred to the exceptional circumstances of agriculture and the fact that agricultural workers have been dealt with by separate means for the last 40 years. Deputies have been making the point that those differences should still be taken into consideration in this new legislation.  It is agreed that agriculture has special problems and interests which require acquaintance by all those working in it, if their decisions are to be correct and will not lead to unforeseen circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When setting up this joint labour committee in substitution for the Agricultural Wages Board it was obvious that agricultural organisations would be cautious about the necessity for such a step.  A good deal of discussion had to be gone through before we introduced this Bill.  In the area of industrial relations the point can be made that any legislation which emerges here has to be the <Col N="1609" /> product of many months of consultation and discussion before it even reaches the House.  This is not an area of legislative intervention where one can sit down with one's officials, draw up a blueprint and introduce it to the House with the best advice available, because if the legislation is intended to be applied by those who work in industry one must go as far as possible, even before coming into this House, to gain their agreement. That is the position in relation to this section.</P>
    <P>It would not have been possible to introduce this Bill were these slightly different procedures not adopted in the setting up of the joint labour committee.  I say &ldquo;slightly different&rdquo; because the difference is very slight from the position obtaining in the establishment of the committee as set up under the 1946 Act.  It is true that under that Act the panel goes to the court direct and there is no intervention by the Minister of the day. The intervention of the Minister in this case is necessary because he must be involved in the setting up of the committee taking into account the special conditions obtaining in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Of the bodies who will be nominating representatives to this committee on the trade union or agricultural sides, neither raised any objections to this procedure.  They both agreed that this is the common sense thing to do.  I want to assure Deputies that no one from either side objects to this approach.  On the contrary, they accept its necessity.</P>
    <P>There is no departure from the Act because the final authority still rests with the court to nominate.  In other words, if the court object to the appointment of anyone suggested to them arising from consultations between the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and myself, under the 1946 Act they have the power of veto. Deputies need not be over-concerned that anything untowards is suggested here.  It is true that there is an alteration in that there is consultation between myself, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the nominating bodies&mdash;the panels come <Col N="1610" /> to us initially and we forward them to the court.  The reason for this alteration arises from the anxiety of agricultural interests that the special conditions of their industry be reflected in the legislation chosen to set up the joint labour committee.  In this connection the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries requires to be consulted because he has overall responsibility to the House for the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Therefore there must be reference to the Minister on this section.  Otherwise our choice was that there could be no departure, no question of abolishing the Agricultural Wages Board and setting up the joint labour committee&mdash;hence the necessity for the section.  There is no objection on the part of unions or farming interests to this section.  They recognise the necessity for it and finally, the court itself has a veto of appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I gather from the Minister that were it not for this section there would not have been agreement to the setting up of the joint labour committee?  I gather that the setting up of the joint labour committee was conditional on this section being part of the Bill.  I see absolutely no reason why a Minister or Ministers should interfere in appointments. As I said on the Second Stage, it implies a serious lack of confidence in the ability of members appointed to the court to perform a task.  This is consistent with the approach of the Minister to that court in recent times. That implication is very strong.  It also implies that if the court are not fit, after consultation with the organisations concerned, to nominate people to the joint committee they are not fitted to judge the cases coming before them.  It also appears to me that if the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries have to intervene and select a panel they should be involved in the deliberations of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has argued the necessity for setting up a joint labour committee and for putting agricultural workers on the same footing as industrial workers under the 1946 Act.  He is showing distinct weakness <Col N="1611" /> in this section if he is saying that the setting up of this committee was conditional on this section, and I submit the advantages to be gained from it may be far less in the long run than the dangers that can be created by its introduction.  Is there now a further danger that because it is being introduced the Minister and his colleagues &mdash;his colleague in Industry and Commerce, for example&mdash;would be inclined to introduce the same type of interference in other joint labour committees that exist already and that we would be asked to change legislation so that this would happen? This is an area where the Minister should not take for himself or any successor the power sought in this Bill because of the danger of abuse of it.</P>
    <P>What will it mean if a person is allowed on the panel?  Will he have to be a card carrying member of the Minister's party or of his colleague's party?  It appears they may not be members of the panel if they are not such persons.  This danger is there.  I believe this to be grave interference by any Minister.  It is a slight on the capabilities on the members of the court to perform a duty.  It is a weakening of their power.  It is saying to them: &ldquo;You are not fit to make these appointments.&rdquo; How then can they be fit to make decisions or judgements?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in his own interest, to accept our amendment.  I am satisfied that the members of the court are competent.  If they are competent to make decisions I believe they are also competent, after consultation with employers' and employees' organisations to make appointments to the joint labour committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also urge the Minister to accept the amendment because otherwise the Bill will be very much suspect and the whole effect of it will be spoiled.  The modifications he seeks in regard to the appointment of the joint labour committee make it suspect.  The Minister may argue that the Minister should have his finger in the pie, that he will not abuse the right, that he will do what is right but <Col N="1612" /> this comes fairly close to eroding the independence of the Labour Court, an institution that has withstood a good deal of buffeting since it was established. Its decisions may be accepted or not; they are not legally binding; the number of rejections is quite large; I do not know the present percentage, but the court's hope of establishing a reputation, a prestige and standing lies in its being and appearing to be absolutely independent of any political motivation or interference.  If the court could not establish that absolute independence and make it obvious to everybody its reputation would be diminished and its standing generally impaired.  It is its reputation for independence and impartiality and freedom from political motivation that give it any standing and right to have its decisions accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my time as Minister for Labour I had frequent complaints about the court being housed in the same building as the Department of Labour.  It was suggested frequently that it should be moved to a separate building&mdash;and this would have been done but for the lack of accommodation&mdash; so as to stand out as a completely unattached institution capable of dispensing impartial decisions with absolute independence and free from interference of any kind.  This section represents a serious erosion of principles which the court is seeking to have established and maintained in order to give it the reputation and standing it requires and which can only be built up with the years.  It has been moving rapidly in that direction. The Minister may argue that it is essential that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should have his finger in the pie.  Many will suspect that there are other reasons for that. There are many who will impute motives to the Minister for seeking this right.  If we look at other boards that have been reconstituted, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, in recent times, the suspicion will be well grounded.  That is all the more reason why we should in this legislation keep our hands completely off the Labour Court.  The tendency should be to <Col N="1613" /> emphasise that it is an absolutely independent institution completely free from any manipulation or interference whatever.  The Minister would be well advised to leave the Labour Court to appoint the joint labour committee, which they are capable of doing.  They can consult directly with the IFA, the ICMSA and any other bodies they may wish to consult with to get the necessary personnel from the two sides of the agricultural industry in order to have a suitable joint labour committee.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section state:</P>
    <P>(a) the chairman and not more than two independent members of the committee shall be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries;</P>
    <P>(b) the representative (employers) members of the committee shall be appointed by the Court from a panel prepared and presented to the Court by the Minister after consultation with such organisation or organisations representative of agricultural employers as the Minister thinks fit and with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister can constitute any panel he likes, submit it to the Labour Court and say: &ldquo;Take them from that&rdquo;.  He may or may not select the best people but whether he will or not it will appear to people that there is something suspicious about the appointments. This will have a diminishing effect on the growing stature of the Labour Court.  Paragraph (c) states:</P>
    <P>the representative (workers) members of the committee (to a number equal to the number of representative (employers) members) shall be appointed by the Court from a panel prepared and presented to the Court by the Minister after consultation with such organisation or organisations representative of agricultural workers as the Minister thinks fit and with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries;</P>
    <P>I take it there is a typographical error <Col N="1614" /> in relation to the bracket around &ldquo;members&rdquo; in this paragraph.  This legislation refers to a particular section of workers to whom we are giving equality with industrial workers and we are giving them access to what industrial workers have had for a number of years.  When doing this we should take the opportunity to ensure that what we do will stand out as completely free from any interference whatever by the Minister or any person who would in any way bring suspicion on the impartiality, independence and high reputation of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court is nothing if it has not a reputation and is known to have a completely impartial approach to all its work.  It is necessary for the Labour Court to be completely free from interference from any source.  The Labour Court may only make recommendations.  They may be accepted or rejected.  The extent to which they will be accepted by both sides will depend on the high reputation and standing which the court can maintain.  What the Minister is doing is a blow which does not tend towards improving the necessary image the court should have.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I said, the final appointments are made by the court. I made that clear at the start of my contribution on this amendment.  The necessity to consult the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries arises from the desire of the agricultural organisations. They were not initially too favourable to the entire conception of the establishment of a joint labour committee and the abolition of the wages board.  It was necessary to disarm any criticisms they might have to make that the new arrangement would be to the detriment of the agricultural industry.  It was necessary to assure them that this would not be the case. It was necessary to further reassure them that the arrangements for appointments and so on would ensure that the representative character of the joint labour committee would be such that it would be fully cognisant of the problems faced by agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point that those who <Col N="1615" /> are rightly jealous of the independence of the court, namely the trade unions, are in full agreement with the arrangement set out here.  The Federation of Rural Workers, which is the premier body dealing with farm workers are in full agreement with the measures suggested here.  They have a better record of fighting for the independence of the court than any Deputy in the House.  Deputies, therefore, need not concern themselves that the independence of the court is being interfered with in any way by this arrangement.  The court have the final right to make the appointment.  All that is sought here is the alteration of the 1946 provision whereby there is some consultation. In this case it is suggested that it should be between the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and myself prior to the submission of names to the court as to whom will be the final authority for making appointments.</P>
    <P>This arrangement is specific to this joint labour committee.  It does not suggest that this power be undertaken in respect of other joint labour committees.  This step was not necessary in other joint labour committees. We did not have the conditions which appertain to agriculture, so it does not apply to other joint labour committees.</P>
    <P>There is the further comment that under existing arrangements, those that have applied for 30 years to the establishment of joint labour committees, a Minister always appoints the chairman and two independent members of the joint labour committee. It has not been suggested in the past that this is an interference with the structure of the joint labour committees.  This is a far more fundamental right of a Minister.  He can appoint, as I will appoint, under this joint labour committee, the chairman and two independent members. Quite apart from the workers and employers' representatives and farming representatives I will appoint those people.  Is it suggested that this is some interference?  Is it suggested that there is something wrong in an arrangement which has obtained for <Col N="1616" /> 30 years?  That suggestion was not made in the past.  When we were on the other side we did not make that suggestion and it is regrettable if such a suggestion is made now.</P>
    <P>The necessity arises from the suggestion by the agricultural organisations that this is the procedure which would meet their desires most closely. It is not objected to by the trade unions.  It does not constitute an interference in the workings of the court, because here we are talking about the joint labour committee.  If the argument is accepted that it constitutes ministerial interference, we have had ministerial interference for 30 years now in the appointment of the chairman and two independent members. No one has suggested that was wrong up to now.  I would be surprised if Deputies opposite object to it now.  It is a procedure which has worked down through the years.  I do not propose to alter it in any respect.</P>
    <P>All that is suggested here is consultation with agricultural organisations. Nor am I aware of any objection from the Labour Court to this arrangement.  How could there be, if the constituting bodies do not object? If the trade unions objected to this procedure I would certainly have to look askance at it.  There is no such objection because the trade unions are aware, as I am, that this is an essential condition for the establishment of the joint labour committee.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that suggestion has been made in this debate this morning, which was otherwise related strictly to the issues before us.  I am sorry the element has been introduced of card-carrying members of a party.  This kind of nonsense should be discarded by Deputies opposite.  It is not my fault, or the fault of anybody on this side of the House, if Deputies opposite are the heirs of 16 years of nepotism, and worse, nepotism which rewarded mediocrity.  If that is their heritage, that is not my responsibility.  Deputies should not bring into any debate related to a specific problem, that odious inheritance which is a problem their party have suffered from.  If the party card became the passport to a job when they were in Government, they cannot <Col N="1617" /> inflict that bad inheritance of theirs on every measure brought in here to meet a particular problem.</P>
    <P>I do not care about anybody's politics.  What I am concerned about on the part of people who work with me is their ability.  I judge people on their ability.  I do not care a curse about their politics, Labour, Fine Gael or anything else.  I am concerned about the ability of people who work in my area of work.  The sooner we agree that ability is the criterion for any job the better.  I regret that Deputies opposite should bring that element into this debate.  One of the main reasons why Deputies are on the other side of the House is that the electorate concluded they are the party who made the possession of the party card the passport to a job.  With that inheritance around their necks, they will stay over there.  I regret that they should bring that element into a debate on a section in which I am proposing, with the agreement of the nominating organisations, that there should be consultation between myself and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the reason we had to bring in this alteration had something to do with the party card.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to that insincere lecture by the Minister who would not even concede an obvious omission by him and tried to make cheap political gimmickry out of the fact that a Deputy from his own party whispered in his ear and told him something which he was not aware of up to then had been omitted from the Bill.  That Deputy was not aware it had been omitted until I raised it in this House.  Then we heard this contribution, this pulpit preaching, with its obvious lack of sincerity, in an effort to cloud the real weakness in the introduction of this joint labour committee, and to bury the problem to which he referred at the beginning of his statement.  Fewer lectures of the nature which the Minister has just given, and concentration on the problem facing us in this and other areas would be far more befitting, and far more useful to the people we both represent&mdash;fewer lectures on past history <Col N="1618" /> and past performances.  The Minister referred to mediocrity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government of which he is a member could even be termed as mediocre, perhaps some few of the many thousands now unemployed might still be working. Having said that, I want to get back to the real kernel of the section and the reason why the Minister lost his &ldquo;cool&rdquo; this afternoon.  He started off by telling us he succumbed to the pressures of the employer organisations in the field of agriculture in introducing section 5 and that, as a result of pressures from that area, he has thrown a sop to somebody and said: &ldquo;I want to do the big thing.  I want to introduce my joint labour committee.  I will do it at any cost.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Neither Deputy Brennan nor I said we had any objection to the Minister nominating the chairman and members. We object, and we will continue to object to interference by the Minister and his colleagues within the two areas which are so important if the joint Labour committee is to function successfully.  The Principal Act is the 1946 Act.  The experience of joint labour committees has been reasonably satisfactory.  Why?  Because there must be three parts to those committees if they are to function properly.  The three parts are the nominated members and the chairman, independent members, the workers' representatives' group, and the employers' representatives' group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint labour committee in this case has a completely different structure.  We have the appointment of a chairman and independent members, the selection and control of a panel of workers or trade union representatives, having consultations admittedly with two Ministers, and the very same set up on the employer side.  In other words, we have a major departure from the joint labour committees as we knew them.  This will be a joint labour committee in name but basically a committee set up by the Minister to replace the Agricultural Wages Board. There is no way this party will agree <Col N="1619" /> to ministerial interference in the vital field of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister to say there is no objection from the trade union side.  It is obvious to me that, because of his having succumbed to pressures from one side, the effort had to be made to set up this joint labour committee which we all support. It loses its usefulness if this type of interference is allowed.  It is not enough either for the Minister to say no objection was raised by the court. This is an interference with the court. We referred to this earlier.  It is an interference with the functions of the court.  It is an allegation of a lack of confidence in the court.  If it is saying that, after consultation they are not competent to make appointments, how can they be described as being competent to adjudicate on any case which goes before them?  The logical follow up to that is interference by the Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the decisions being arrived at on particular problems which come before the joint labour committee.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in this House the Minister has referred to &ldquo;we on this side&rdquo; and to the Opposition &ldquo;on that side&rdquo; and he has mentioned reasons why we are on these benches and he is on the Government benches.  The politician who talks in this way could be regarded as childish and I will not reply in detail to what he said.  However, I will reply to the allegation about card-carrying members. I feel very strongly about this matter because I know the worth, integrity and the contribution of the man I referred to.  He was not a Fianna Fáil man; in my opinion he was a man without politics who had an acute and keen interest in horse breeding and in Bord na gCapall.  He was chairman of the board and he travelled the length and breadth of the country, often at his own expense and always in his own time and at great personal inconvenience.  He did this because of his dedication and interest.  He and most of his colleagues were removed from that <Col N="1620" /> board a few weeks ago by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries at one fell swoop.  Yet the Minister tells me we should not make allegations of this nature.  I do not know the people who replaced this man and his colleagues.  However, I am absolutely satisfied the man involved was removed because he had been appointed by the Minister's predecessor.  In view of the contribution he made on a personal and dedicated basis he was entitled to be appointed a member.</P>
    <P>I do not want the same kind of situation in the joint labour committee. It is not enough for the Minister to say that there is nothing in the Bill to interfere with the other joint labour committees, although I accept it.  He has a habit of trying to put words into a person's mouth.  He said there was no objection from us to the chairman and nominated member, nor had there been from them.  It appears to me that was a lack of experience and knowledge by him in the area of industrial relations and negotiations.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious reason why the members must be there because they are regarded as the balance of power between the two more important units at the employee and employer levels.  I accept that the Minister must have a certain balancing power but when he interferes with the two more important sides we have to be careful.  No Minister is as competent, or should be as competent, as the court.  For a long time we have supported the independence of the court, its functions and its officers.  There have been times when difficult decisions had to be taken and when they were not accepted generally but there has never been interference with the officers of that court to the extent that was evident last autumn.  This interference is being continued in this Bill.</P>
    <P>During the Dáil recess because of pressure we saw dismissals, appointments and reappointments in a matter of weeks.  Here we are telling the court that they are not competent to make the appointments from the employer and the employee sides.  The Minister is saying that he and the <Col N="1621" /> Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will be competent to draw up a panel from which the court may select.  The Minister is saying that ultimately the court will have the power of selection but it will only be from a limited group whom the Ministers have selected.  The Minister may say that this is preserving the right of the court to appoint members but it is from a very limited field.  Surely I will be forgiven for asking the valid question: &ldquo;What qualifies one for forming part of the panel?&rdquo; Obviously the Minister has succumbed to pressure.</P>
    <P>The joint labour committee is conditional on this section being passed. Despite any cross words the Minister and I may have had from time to time, I appreciate his interest in the working people.  I realise his past connections but I do not think he will be fair to those connections or to those loyalties if he does not accept the motion I have submitted to the House. First, it will continue to preserve the independence of the Labour Court and, secondly, it will prevent interference by him or any of his successors in the vital field of joint labour committees. The Minister has said there is nothing in this Bill regarding other joint labour committees and I agree with him, but there is a danger that this could be regarded as the thin end of the wedge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the curt camaraderie that manifested itself at the end of Deputy Fitzgerald's statement, I agree with everything else he said.  The Labour Court has not had an easy passage.  It required years to build up its reputation for integrity. Under the Principal Act the Minister had the right to appoint the chairman and two independent members of the joint labour committee.  If there is going to be any derogation from the principles of the 1946 Act dealing with industrial relations it should be in the opposite direction.  Now that the court has established itself and in the interests of asserting its complete independence, it would have been more understandable if he had changed the legislation to leave the appointment of all the committees to <Col N="1622" /> the court.  What he is proposing is a step in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there was consultation with the employers and the employees.  I should like to know with whom he had consultations?  Was it with the Rural Workers' Association? If so, how many of the 30,000 agricultural workers are in that association? With whom on the employers' side were consultations conducted? Was it the ICMSA and the IFA? What was their opinion about joint labour committees?  Have they approved of this taking from the Labour Court the right to appoint a committee and put it in the hands of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Fianna Fáil, due to their nepotism, were now on this side of the House, that Deputy Fitzgerald made the accusation that card-carrying members of the Labour Party would get preference.  The Minister accused us of following that system, thereby implying that those joint labour committees that have already been appointed were appointed as card-carrying members of Fianna Fáil.  The joint labour committees that are in existence and seen to be working, with whom the people have practical experience, will bear witness to the fact of the impartiality in their selection, and certainly contradict any suggestion that political leanings are brought to bear on the selection of these suitable personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' organisations were all asked to submit names.  There was no interference whatever.  The very nature and success of the committees will bear witness to the fact that what the Minister says with regard to Fianna Fáil's nepotism is wrong.  It should be completely isolated, even from any suggestion of it, from any part of the Labour Court's work.  For that reason we are concerned that our amendment be accepted.  It will make this legislation better, because I can assure the Minister that the agricultural community are not enamoured of the intrusion of the Minister for Labour in their affairs.  The Minister would be foolish not to import this amendment into this legislation and <Col N="1623" /> thereby take the opportunity of doing something that will further enhance the reputation of the Labour Court and add to its prestige and integrity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the intrusion into this debate of references to party cards.  When we are having a debate related to amendments on certain points we agree or disagree, but all our remarks are addressed to the Bill before us.  Remarks relating to party cards are irrelevant.  It is not my fault if Deputies opposite have bad consciences arising from the conduct of their party when in office, or from the possession of influence and membership of the Fianna Fáil Party being synonomous when they were in office.</P>
      <P>My preference is for the appointment of people with ability in all cases, uncaring about the political persuasion of any individual.  The sooner we adopt that approach the better.  I am impatient when I hear Deputies opposite, after I have explained at tedious length why there is this reference to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and myself in this section.  It arose because of the fears of the farming organisations that their interests would not be adequately catered for.  Therefore there had to be a place for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the consultative process.  That is why it arose.  It is no slur on the competence of the court, on the independence of the court.  It arose simply from the necessity of setting up of the joint labour committee.  This was one of the conditions which had to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will leave Deputy Fitzgerald to his imagination and his interpretation of why this condition devalues, as he sees it, the whole idea.  I cannot understand his reasoning.  Consultations have been very complete, held with all organisations, to establish this joint labour committee.  They were held between the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the farming organisation, including the IFA and the ICMSA, and on the trade union side with the Federation of Rural Workers <Col N="1624" /> and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Irish Countrywomen's Association were consulted.  Perhaps they were but I have not got them on the list.  There was full consultation held with all concerned. Deputy Brennan is right that the Federation of Rural Workers, or any trade union, do not fully organise agricultural workers.  One of the basic reasons why the law is necessary here is that many workers do not have the protection of any union.  Deputy Brennan and other members of his party may say they do not need such protection.  He painted a picture this morning of a wonderful world, a veritable Garden of Eden, in which tranquillity and peace reigned and there was no rough intervention of industrial disputes, no discontent, no disagreement. He suggested that that peace may be ended for ever as a result of the intrusion of the same kind of conflict that we see reigning in industry.  I do not know whether it is some lost valley in his imagination that Deputy Brennan is referring to, but if that is the position it should not change.  I am not aware of any such condition of happiness on this earth as he has painted here this morning, but if it was as happy it should not change under the new arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that the Labour Court finally would have the ultimate authority in the appointment of anyone <Col N="1625" /> nominated to the joint labour committee. When we understand the nature of the joint labour committee, its relationship with the Labour Court, we see it is a wild charge without substance to say that the alterations sought from the 1946 Act and the consultative procedures with agriculture and myself constitute an interference with the independence of the court.  This leap between the alteration sought here and the references to the independence of the court are quite unsustainable.  When one considers the relationship of a joint labour committee&mdash;the committee can only make proposals to the Labour Court which is completely independent and which has power to amend any proposals&mdash;how can it be suggested with any sense of reality that the alteration we suggest constitutes an interference <Col N="1626" /> with the court?  For these reasons I will not accept the amendment proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal again to the Minister, to accept it.  The reason we say this interference or danger of interference in the court is that the Minister is not giving them the powers they have of appointment of members of other joint labour committees.  They do not have that power now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the fact that one of the consistently reaffirmed aims of the Common Agricultural Policy is to ensure an adequate supply of foodstuffs at reasonable prices to Community consumers, he has any specific proposal in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In fixing agricultural prices for the Community regard is had to all the objectives of the common agricultural policy as set out in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome. These provide not only for ensuring that supplies of food reach consumers at reasonable prices but also for ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, improved agricultural productivity, the stability of markets and the availability of supplies within the Community.</P>
      <P>When fixing prices, therefore, the Council of Ministers endeavours to achieve a fair balance between these various objectives and, of course, in order to ensure adequate supplies of foodstuffs for consumers, it is necessary that producers, like workers generally, be given a fair reward for their labour after allowing for rising costs of production.  In certain cases the full impact of agricultural price increases is reduced as in the case of consumer subsidies for butter and premiums for beef.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that a female employee of a county committee of agriculture can be paid a substantial gratuity on marriage and still continue to work under his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a female employee of a county committee of agriculture can obtain a gratuity on marriage and subsequently through the Local Appointments Commission secure another post with a county committee.  The period in respect of which she had received the <Col N="1637" /> gratuity could not however be reckoned more than once for pension purposes.  The matter is governed by the provisions of sections 10 and 22 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, and is not one in which I have any function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that this gratuity was only intended for those who were retiring on marriage and that as it operates at the moment it is an incentive to employees in one county to change to another county, being reimbursed for doing so, and the county that must reimburse them is the one that suffers by their departure?  Would the Minister initiate inquiries into the case where a former employee of County Kildare County Committee of Agriculture indicated to the committee that she was retiring on marriage, got a golden handshake through this loophole and was in a position to take up employment on the very next day with Carlow County Committee of Agriculture?  Does he not feel there is something very wrong here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly fair to describe it as a golden handshake. This woman, in common with others, subscribed 5 per cent of her salary for this gratuity on marriage.  She got that and she cannot get it twice.  She is eligible as a married person to apply for any job that comes up.  She applied for one in Carlow and got it. Anything that was done was done perfectly within the law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The premium arrangements to operate in the 1976-77 marketing year were the subject of considerable discussion during last week's meeting of the Council of Ministers.  In the discussion I opposed the provision of a premium for Italian home-bred calves unless a similar premium were applied to this country.  The final settlement, however, had to be a compromise and in this the Italian calf premium was continued for 1976-77 but at only half the rate applicable during the past year.  Given the satisfactory market outlook for beef and having regard to the monetary changes also decided upon by the Council, I see no reason why competitive prices cannot be paid for calves by Irish farmers engaged in the rearing and finishing of cattle.</P>

People had to sell pregnant cows in 1974 because of the price of calves and that is the reason for the scarcity today.  Would the Minister agree?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is being misrepresented.  We will have as many cattle to go through the processing factories this year as we had in 1974. This is a seasonal shortage of cattle that has occurred year in and year out.  There is supposed to be something abnormal about it this year. Last year we had abnormal slaughterings. <Col N="1640" /> Never in our history did we reach the point reached last year.

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the damage being done to the Irish apple industry by the importation of over £2 million worth of foreign apples annually; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The present production of apples in this country amounts to only about 35 per cent of annual needs and it is accordingly necessary to have substantial imports.  Output from the home crop will increase in the coming years as recently planted orchards come into full production. Provided adequate attention is given to storage and marketing there is no reason why our growers should not obtain an increasing share of the <Col N="1652" /> market and a satisfactory price return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware that the sale of Irish apples is being affected on the home market at present by coming into competition with imported apples?  Is he aware that the Agricultural Institute have stated that the Irish apple is of better quality and is not getting a fair deal from the retailers on the home market?  The sale of Irish apples is being depressed</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to explain to the Deputy that the national consumption of apples is about 40,000 tons per annum.  The home crop in 1974 was 14,000 tons so that there is an enormous import requirement.  In addition to this we had to drop our quantitative control for countries within the EEC.  There are a lot of French apples coming in here.  We have an MCA against those so we should be able to compete.  I agree with the Deputy that the quality of our apples is better than the quality of any imported apples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has given me figures for the amount of apples imported and the amount of home grown apples is he aware that at present the home grown apples are meeting unfair competition from imported apples?  I am not talking about the past year or the previous year. This is a matter of urgency at the present moment.  If the Minister will look into it he will find that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is competition from countries within the Community, from France, I have told them I can do nothing about it.  The MCA we were permitted to operate is being operated against French apples and we cannot stop the quantity.  They can send in any quantity they like with this MCA. That is the handicap they have to come in under.  Everything that it is possible to do within the law is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware of the need to protect the home market for Irish growers and also those employed in the apple <Col N="1653" /> factories throughout the country?  If it is not protected this industry will be severely affected.  Some steps must be taken to protect this industry.  This is an urgent matter.  As I said, some retailers in particular and some of the outlets are giving preference to the foreign apple and pushing it over and above the home grown apple.  That is the situation I asked to have remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In further explanation to the Deputy the MCA that we could operate against the French apples up to December, 1975 was £35.7 and £23.8 from the 1st January to the 15th February, 1976.  We cannot exceed that.  They are coming in with that handicap.  As long as they pay this we can do nothing to keep them out within EEC rules.  As I said, our home production is a very small percentage of total consumption here and imports must be permitted. Consumption is 40,000 tons and production is 14,000 tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>A State grant was approved in 1974 for harbour improvement works at Inisturk.  Because of the failure of the Mayo County Council to lodge their share of the cost however, the works were not proceeded with.  A subsequent inspection of the harbour revealed that the condition of the pier has deteriorated considerably and a detailed engineering survey will now be necessary before a satisfactory scheme can be prepared.  I am awaiting particulars of this survey and an estimate of cost from the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the position.  The cost of the work was £4,850.  The work was the type of work recommended by the survey team in their report.  Then, apparently, the local people, including the fishermen, were anxious to change the scheme and change the plans.  Hence the work was held up and we did not get the 25 per cent contribution from Mayo County Council.  I think the council now have it in mind to change the scheme.  Possibly that is why they have not paid their contribution.  From the Department's point of view, there is nothing further we can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

That is the simple answer.  I assume the Deputy is a member of Mayo County Council and he can ascertain locally what is the cause of the delay.

In paragraph 20 (b) of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, an officer of the old Agricultural Wages Board had power to enter at all reasonable times any premises or place for the purposes of inspection or for the enforcement of that Act.  I should like to know from the Minister if the officers who are being retained will have this power, or will they derive such powers from the Labour Court because, although it is a power an official would use <Col N="1665" /> with discretion and sparingly, the people who have been involved in this work have found it was a very important power to have in reserve because at times an employer might be tempted to chase an official from his premises and give him no hearing.

      <P>It was an offence not to display notices setting out the hours, wages and conditions and if such notices were not displayed the employer&mdash;the farmer in this case&mdash;could be fined.  It would be an unenforceable situation to insist that every farmer would display such notices in every farmhouse, possibly in the kitchen or in some out house, throughout the country.  It is one of those regulations that could not be enforced and obviously the most expeditious way of informing workers of their rights would be to advertise in the local papers or elsewhere or to post notices in local employment exchanges.  By these means we will ensure that agricultural workers will be informed of their entitlements. Of course the inspectorate will be at work throughout the country and will be in touch with the local JLCs to ensure that the regulations are brought to the attention of both the workers' and farmers' representatives and that they are carried into practice throughout rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>We think it is enough.  The employer has to keep records&mdash;that is the realistic objective. Obviously it would be a serious matter if there was failure to keep such records because then we would be depriving the inspectors of any basis on which to make a decision on whether the regulations were being implemented.  That would be a more serious offence than not posting notices, which can be done by the insertion of advertisements, but we could not absolve the farmer of his obligation to keep records because we would then be depriving the inspectorate of any possible means of discovering infringements.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy I have listened carefully to every query he has put, and I will do my best to give adequate answers and I in no way resent the Deputy putting relevant questions.  I hope he is not oversensitive.  He can rest assured we will put notices into all local newspapers where that is necessary. The reason why items of this kind are not covered in legislation is because there is a whole area of legislation which is more properly a part of regulations and this is more properly a part of regulations.  It is common practice for all joint labour committees to advertise fully in newspapers settlements reached.  Since we are not going ahead with public display in public premises obviously there will be need for even wider dissemination locally of settlements.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact there is only one thing that would oppress me if I were that type of person and that is the state of our economy as a result of the mishandling of it by the Minister and his colleagues. That is by way of an aside.  Where are the regulations, for my guidance and the guidance of the House generally? The Minister talked about common practice and procedure.  The Minister must remember that in this particular joint labour committee we are departing in a rather important way from established practice.  There is the danger that an employer may deliberately avoid becoming aware of a certain situation.  Remember all the workers will not be organised.  There <Col N="1668" /> must be a safeguard with regard to publicity to avoid any possibility of a worker in a remote rural area being penalised until such time as an inspector calls.  That could be a long time afterwards and that worker may be unaware of any increase in wages or improvement in conditions.  Surely there should be some provision to cover widespread publicity in provincial newspapers.</P>

At the moment joint labour committee notices are published in factories and so on and the information is available to the workers.

There is a distinct difference. Joint labour committees already operating deal with specific types of industry.  This is a new venture. Deputy Brennan made the point this morning that there were workers who were not aware that legislation was being introduced, who were not concerned about its introduction and who were not aware of any need for <Col N="1670" /> it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I referred to the increasing burden of work imposed on the Labour Court as a result of new legislation passed in this House in recent years and the extra legislation we have in prospect. There is the legislation on unfair dismissal, anti-discrimination and the equal pay legislation.  There is also the equality of opportunity legislation which has already had a First Reading in this House.  In addition, there is the burden imposed by the involvement of the court and its personnel in the arbitration bodies of the public service. All of these duties involve the court in additional work, and there has been a demand for some time now by those who use the court that the court be given an extra division in addition to the three already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us gives us an opportunity to ensure that, parallel to the work we do for the agricultural worker, we also provide the court with an additional division.  This legislation here adds to the workload of the court significantly.  This is the largest number of workers to be covered by industrial legislation since the Labour Court was founded in 1946.  Approximately 30,000 additional workers will now be dealt with under <Col N="1675" /> the common industrial legislation which applies to workers in towns and cities.  This means additional work will be thrown onto the court itself and that is why I am looking for this fourth division.</P>
    <P>The normal provisions as to the appointment of members of the court will operate in respect of this new division.  Appointments will be made by myself, the workers' and employers' representatives being nominated by their respective organisations.  That is the fundamental reason for this new division.</P>
    <P>It was suggested this morning that we should give this extra division the responsibility of dealing solely with agricultural workers, but in my view this might not be the wisest thing to do.  I would prefer to leave the court to make its own arrangements, to leave it the maximum flexibility in apportioning their various divisions to categories of workers as they see fit.  This is a better system than nominating an extra division for particular work.  In my opinion, the Oireachtas should interfere as little as possible in the actual operation of the court.  Therefore, I would not be in agreement with that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Although we are adding extra numbers of workers and there are exceptional conditions obtaining in agriculture which should be respected under the new joint labour committee arrangement, having workers and farm interests involved in its decisions will ensure that the decisions will relate closely to actual conditions in agriculture. I do not think we require the extra assurance that the court will need a division which will be solely concerned with agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 which amends section 2 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, and which describes the membership of the Labour Court, is consequential on my proposal in amendment No. 6 to take power to provide for the appointment by order of additional divisions of the court. This section requires modification in the light of the proposal to take enabling power to appoint additional divisions of the court.</P>

      <P>There has been relative peace and harmony in this section of the industry up to now.  Agricultural workers were reasonably happy. As the Minister knows their wages are frequently the criteria used for county council workers' wages.</P>
      <P>Now that this new section of the court is being set up, does the Minister anticipate that these workers will have recourse to the court?  It cannot be denied that there has been very little industrial unrest in this section of the community.  Does the Minister anticipate an increase in industrial unrest in the future?  We are making provisions for workers who may be exploited.  I doubt if there is any worker anywhere who is exploited today in this section.  Does the Minister anticipate that these workers will have recourse to the Labour Court for wage demands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why there should be any disruption of the close harmony the Deputy assumes exists in agriculture.  The basis of representation on the joint labour committee will ensure that farm and worker interests work together for the benefit of the industry.  The Deputy said there has not been trouble in the past and asked will there be trouble in the future.  All I can say is that I do not think that enlightened agriculturalists want their prosperity based on the kind of peace where people have no recourse but to accept a wage lower than that being given to comparable workers.  The undoubted result of the setting up of the joint labour committee will be to close the gap by agreement between the conditions obtaining in industry generally and those obtaining in agriculture.  I have no <Col N="1677" /> reason to believe that that development will lead to a great deal of unrest. Those interested in agriculture will welcome this legislation.</P>
      <P>I would be sceptical of the Deputy's contrasting the state of harmony and believing this was the position we should always live with.  He must remember that in many cases in the past workers had to accept a very low rate for the job and were left with very little money for their old age.  The Deputy knows that in a minority of cases agricultural workers led broken lives and received very little compensation in the course of their working lives.  This Bill is a small measure to right that neglect.  It is a bad comment on our Legislature that in an agricultural country there has been no recorded debate and no substantial legislative measure to deal with their condition since 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agricultural workers were discriminated against by omission in many Acts.  I refer to conditions of employment, safety of employment, which apply to factories and workshops, the use of machinery and so on.  When I left the Department I considered that one of the priorities for legislation was to ensure that the wages of agricultural workers were kept in line with the rapidly rising cost of living.  If the Agricultural Wages Board were doing their work they should have ensured that that was happening.  I hope that, now they have been made part of the Industrial Relations Act, any of them who may feel they are exploited will find themselves protected by this.  I hope that many of the traditional means of employment, many of the old systems will not be interfered with and that the joint labour committee and the Labour Court will comprise personnel with understanding of the peculiarities of agricultural employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think of casual labour where a farmer employs a man on one or two days a week, of the swopping of days among farmers, the co-operative system, the meitheal, where ten or 12 go together to do a piece of work. These traditional systems had a social side as well as being useful working arrangements.  I trust these will not <Col N="1678" /> now be brought into the realm of industrial day-to-day thrust and parry and be given new meaning and that the peculiarities attached to agricultural employment will be recognised by the personnel whose duty it will be to deal with it.  When I advocate this I am sure they will be conscious of that need.</P>

      <P>The reasons put forward by the Minister for a further division of the Labour Court are understandable, but what is not understandable is why it is only at this stage that the necessity for legislating in this respect was discovered. The Minister outlined a number of developments as a result of which extra work will be placed on the shoulders of the Labour Court.  For that reason the necessity for an extra division is understandable.  Mention has been made of the composition of that extra division and the possibility of relating it entirely to the agricultural joint labour committee.  I understand why this may not be possible but I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is an agricultural slant and knowledge and understanding of the agriculture situation by the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this morning that assessors could easily be appointed, as was recently done for a report on the footwear industry.  I hope the assessors appointed to advise on agriculture would not mislead the Minister in the same way in this area as they misled in regard to the footwear industry.  Therefore, one must be a little doubtful about the complete dependence by Labour Court members on reports of assessors.  I would prefer to have a proper knowledge and understanding of agriculture among members of the court itself.  The appointment of assessors will serve a purpose, of course, but I would also encourage, and I presume I am pushing an open door here, that the appointees&mdash;I will not quarrel with them; this is completely different from the joint labour committee&mdash;would be of people with knowledge of industrial relations both on the workers' side and on the employers' side.  That is extremely important in this division <Col N="1679" /> which will cover not only the agricultural workers and problems from the joint labour committee that we are now setting up but will also cover many other areas.  I know that would be the Minister's wish and I would give my full support to these appointments being from people who have the capacity to create good industrial relations and to understand the human problems of the situation which will probably be more relevant in this area than perhaps in others.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there were people who were to an extent exploited.  This is to be condemned and I trust there are few if any of them left today.  In certain areas there are people who would be affected by strict following of regulations and orders and for that reason I am concerned about the human and flexible approach.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1680" />&ldquo;10.&mdash;Section 5 of the Act of 1969 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (8):</P>
    <P>`(8)  The Minister shall grant and pay to Joseph Stapleton Quigley, upon his retirement without re-appointment from membership of the Court, a gratuity of an amount equal to one year's salary at the date of his retirement.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the payment to Mr. Quigley of a gratuity of one year's salary on the date of his retirement from the Labour Court.  The Industrial Relations Act of 1969 provided that a gratuity of £3,000 be paid on retirement.  This sum represented approximately one year's salary at that time.  The amendment is necessary to ensure that Mr. Quigley, who retired on 31st January, 1976, receives a gratuity of the same proportion as was envisaged in the Act of 1969.  Mr. Quigley served as an ordinary member of the Labour Court from 23rd September, 1962, representing the employers and retired on 31st January, 1975, I hope that we can quickly agree to this provision without too much discussion. I do not think it is a matter of contention.</P>

      <P>Again this is typical of the way we are being treated by the Government.  We are being told part of the story.  From the beginning I was given to understand by the Chief Whip, who is always pretty reliable, that we were taking Committee Stage of this Bill. Of course Report Stage would follow. I asked for certain information from the Minister on Committee Stage and I wanted that information prior to Report Stage.  I also asked if he would look at a possible amendment before the Report Stage and at all times he conveyed to me that there must be a time lag.  He conveyed this to me by his promise to let me have the information which apparently he did not have available to him at the time. He has it now.  This is rather surprising. From the tone of the debate it appeared to me that there would be a time lag of a day or an hour or something like that between Committee Stage and Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of fair play we on this side of the House are entitled to be informed exactly what is happening. As well as saying it was his <Col N="1687" /> understanding that we were now taking Report Stage, the Minister said he was taking Report Stage now with the usual jackboot tactics.  The Minister has not used those tactics before and I am surprised at him.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to misunderstand the position. It was my understanding that I was to proceed to Report Stage.  The Whip understands otherwise.  I do not claim any authenticity for my understanding of the position.  I understood that I was to go through as many Stages of this legislation as possible today.  There is no great matter of disagreement between us.  The legislation is designed to assist a large number of people.  The longer we delay on it the greater will be the delay in setting up the joint labour committee. I see no reason why we should not go ahead to Report Stage but, if the Deputy objects to that procedure, on the basis of our discussion, I cannot see what there is to object to in this procedure.</P>

      <P>I have.  I undertook to get the court to communicate with the Deputy in an effort to meet the Deputy's wish to know what the actual situation is and what is the exact meaning of &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;.  My officials have located the Statutory Instrument, 1950, 258-1950 which, as a minimum requirement refers to the necessity for publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and one national newspaper.  In practice, the court publishes in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> in national newspapers and, I am informed, provincial papers.  My information is that there is pretty full dissemination of the regulations of the joint labour committee.  I have no doubt that the composition of this joint labour committee is such that there will be full dissemination.  The <Col N="1689" /> Deputy has made the point that, since there is no requirement that notices should be put up on farmhouse walls, there is a greater necessity to ensure even wider communication in this instance. I am sure the joint labour committee will consider that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>In page 2, in the definition of &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;who carries on the trade or business of agriculture and&rdquo; and to delete &ldquo;for the purposes of that trade or business&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that yesterday afternoon the point was made that there was no specific reference to stable lads.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to delete the words &ldquo;who carries on the trade or business of agriculture and&rdquo; and to delete &ldquo;for the purposes of the trade or business&rdquo;.  I should like to discuss amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together because they are related.  With regard to amendment No. 1, I am advised that the reference in the definition of &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; to a person who carries on a trade or business in agriculture might in turn be restrictive in excluding from the Bill some agricultural workers employed by agricultural employers who are not engaged in a trade or business.  Amendment No. 1 is designed to remove that difficulty.</P>

      <P>I should prefer to do that.  Yesterday evening we discussed the definition of agricultural worker and I explained that an interdepartmental committee was set up in 1969 to examine whether a wider definition should be used in this area and it came down on the side of not extending the definitions.  Therefore, the definitions of agricultural worker and employer used in the wages board were not altered.  We have taken over those definitions from the Agricultural Wages Board almost intact.  As we discussed yesterday, there is no reference to stable personnel or those who have responsibility for the care of horses, for instance, at stud farms and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I informed the House, there is a close relationship and always has been between the wages and salaries paid to those personnel and the wages and salaries paid under the Agricultural Wages Board and that situation will continue.  I made the point that if there is any doubt that the legislation would not apply to such personnel in order to remove such doubt I would include it by way of amendment on Report Stage or at the appropriate Stage.  We had some discussions on this matter yesterday.  The decisive contribution that persuaded me that it was as well to be specific in this matter and to point up the absolute right of such personnel to salaries, wages and conditions that would follow on implementation of those measures was that made by Deputy Bermingham.  His contribution persuaded me that it would be wiser to have a specific reference even though that relationship obtained in the past and will continue in the future.  I did not receive any representations from workers' organisations that this reference was regarded as necessary.  Such personnel are organised by some unions who will be <Col N="1692" /> represented on the joint committee.  In Deputy Bermingham's constituency there are many people who work in this area.  Other Deputies also said it would be advisable to have such a reference but they did not speak with the knowledge and experience of Deputy Bermingham.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of an amendment to include people engaged in the caring of horses&mdash;stable lads and groomsmen&mdash; and I raised the matter last night.  It was I who suggested that Deputy Bermingham from Kildare should interest himself in it.  I am glad somebody in the Labour Party is aware that this area needed attention.  The Minister has consistently denied me credit for having initiated this subject of rearing, caring and training of animals. Perhaps this has become a wider issue than was envisaged.  I am always worried about hasty legislation.  Is a greyhound trainer included as a result of this amendment?  If a man is breeding pet rabbits at home, is he included? Has the Minister now widened the scope of the Bill in these respects? Is it possible there is a reluctance on the part of the Minister to refer to the horse industry because some of his colleagues have such an interest in it?</P>
      <P>People throughout the country are aware of the problems in this area and are concerned they should be included in this Bill and now, as a result of our representations yesterday evening, we have included what Deputies Bermingham and Wilson and others, including myself, believe to be desirable</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is a result of the draftsman's definition of the intention suggested here yesterday evening.  I would point out that under section 57 of the Principal Act the Labour Court is given discretion. It is the court which in the last resort decides on questions of interpretation, application and demarcation. Section 57 of the Principal Act makes that clear when it states in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>The Court may at any time on the application of any person give its decision on the question whether a particular joint labour committee operates as respects a particular person or whether a particular employment regulation order applies to a particular person.</P>
      <P>There must be this area of discretion open to the court.  The court will always have, as the principal industrial relations institution, reference to the bargaining practices and the relations that have grown up between one service and another.  There is a growing relationship between the wages and conditions obtaining in the animal caring business and those obtaining under the old Agricultural Wages Board.  The rates we are talking about are in all cases minimum rates and in many of the areas the Deputy thinks might be included the rates of pay would be far in excess of any rates that might be laid down by any JLC.  We cannot make legislation of this kind watertight&mdash;there must be a grey area left after the draftsman has completed the job and this is an area in which the court will exercise its discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, amendment No. 1 means that we are now dependent almost entirely on the definition of &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo;. According to the Bill, agricultural employer means a person who carries on the trade or business of agriculture and who employs other persons as agricultural workers.  We come then to the definition of &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; and the Bill states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; means a person employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship whose work under the contract is or includes <Col N="1694" /> work in agriculture, but does not include a person whose work under any such contract is mainly domestic service;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; includes dairy farming and the use of land as grazing, meadow, or pasture land, or orchard or osier land or woodland, or for market gardens, private gardens, nursery grounds or sports grounds.</P>
    <P>That is transplanted from the Principal Act.  Deputy Wilson referred last night to intensive poultry keeping and intensive pig units and I wonder if they are now industrial or agricultural by definition.  We are very specific in our definitions and I suggest that we would leave over the Report Stage until tomorrow, if that is convenient, to have another look at the definitions.  It all hinges on the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;.  It all appears very confused.  Agriculture is defined very specifically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been protracted over quite a long period. It has been broken up and so there is really no continuity.  It is rather a headache because a considerable time has passed since the budget was introduced. Much of the criticism levelled at the budget on its introduction has in the interval proved to be well founded.  The bad effects forecast by speakers critical of the budget are now plain to be seen.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some indication when he comes to reply as to what, if anything, he proposes to do to relieve some of the difficulties his new taxation has thrown up.  Bad though the taxes are, ill-calculated as they are in effect, in that respect the budget is less faulty than in another aspect, mainly, in the huge borrowing that is proposed in it.  The first question one may well ask is whether we are creditworthy to the degree that we will be able to raise the £300 million required in addition to the outturn of the new taxation plus what was already there.  Secondly, if we are <Col N="1697" /> able to raise this sum, what about the £350 million already borrowed by this Government since coming into office in 1973?  Are this Government going to continue in Government and face up to what must be chickens coming home to roost when the next budget comes in January?  My belief is this Government will never introduce another annual budget.  Of course, there are mini budgets every other day.  I cannot see this Government facing up to the situation with a grand total of £650 million of borrowed money, all of which is housekeeping money.  There might be some excuse if this borrowing were for capital and productive purposes.  That is not the position.  All this borrowing is being used to meet day-to-day expenditure. We are spending over and above what we are earning by way of taxation.</P>
      <P>Consider that £650 million borrowed money at very inflated interest rates in conjunction with the decline in the value of the £, which must have been foreseen by our financial advisers. This has placed the country in a very, very serious financial position, so serious that I am quite certain this Government will never face the prospect of bringing in an annual budget next January.  Neither are they likely to take the obvious, decent, honest course and go for an election on the basis of the budget introduced last January, but rather are they likely to hang on as long as they can during this financial year and then scuttle to the country towards the end of the year, say, between mid-October and mid-November. No matter which way they go they will be on a winner.  If, by any stretch of the imagination, they get a mandate at such an election, then they will have the opportunity given by a new term of office sufficiently long, they may feel, to apply the remedies that are obviously needed if we are not to sink the country financially in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, they are on a winner if they lose the election, because they can say: &ldquo;What about it? Let the people who follow after us try and straighten out the country.&rdquo; They would hope that as a result of the painful remedies that would have to be <Col N="1698" /> applied to rectify their reckless and wanton destruction of the economy the then Government would meet with the displeasure of the people at the following general election, so that this Government could come back for another spree for a number of years, regardless of the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>The decline even in the last couple of days in the value of the pound, to which we are tied, has meant, according to some published calculations, that we have lost another £30 million, which is, strangely enough, the additional amount which it is hoped to raise from VAT on alcohol. It appears that £30 million has gone down the drain on the exchange ratings between sterling and the dollar and other hard currencies over the last few days.  I have no doubt that that reckoning is true and only highlights all the more the disastrous financial situation into which the country has been brought by the Government.</P>
    <P>How, I would ask the Minister to indicate in his reply, does he hope to offset this loss of up to £30 million, this additional burden that is being placed on our resources and our creditworthiness?  If there is a further decline in the value of sterling how do they hope to make up the difference that has already been created and any further differences that may arise and are likely to arise?</P>
    <P>Our deficit this year on day-to-day expenditure is £300 million, which we propose to borrow.  Even in the short experience since 28th January it is clear that the increase will be greater than the £300 million indicated in the budget.  That situation would be serious enough if it were in isolation, but each of the Government's budgets has shown a progressive amount of borrowing, so that for running the country we are £650 million in the red as against our current income from taxes.  That, added to our overall borrowing in the past, is calculated to be of the order of £2,250 million.  For a country of our size, with an economy of the outturn we have, the impact of the interest on the volume of borrowing must make for continuing difficulty for this and for future Governments <Col N="1699" /> and must almost ensure that, far from taxes being capable of being eased, they will have to rise continually in order to try and meet the heavy interest charges on this relatively huge volume of borrowing that has taken place in our name.  All of this is merely to service the debt not to mind raising sufficient resources to begin paying it off.</P>
    <P>That is all against a background of a continuing deteriorating employment situation.  No doubt the Government will be very quick to point out that while they have been imposing taxes and borrowing money for running the national housekeeping account they have been providing additional pay-cuts for those who are unable to provide for themselves.  This would be very satisfactory if the situation were normal, but when we consider that these additional payments are being paid to more and more people, particularly unemployed people, with every prospect that there will be many more thousands unemployed in the near future, and taking the converse of that, that many thousands fewer will be in employment and therefore in a position to contribute by way of tax to the Government's coffers, we find ourselves facing a disastrous prospect.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister now, after these weeks since the introduction of his budget, point to any upturn that is likely to be showing in the immediate future?  If he cannot, then we are truly in a crisis situation and cannot get through without getting things much worse if the Government continue to indulge in self praise for what they are doing in other aspects of their activities.  How long can we continue to borrow for our day-to-day expenditure? How long can we continue to spend more than we are collecting by way of taxation?  How long could any individual expect to be solvent if he continued to spend substantially more than he was earning?</P>
    <P>That is the situation the Minister must clarify.  Are we going to continue borrowing?  Are we going to continue running down the economy? Will we continue to stand aside and <Col N="1700" /> allow, without making any effort, more and more of our work force to become redundant and unemployed? Will we continue to stand aside and see more of our production units and factories going on short time or closing altogether?  Will we continue to stand aside and see more of the business community going into liquidation?</P>
    <P>In the memory of a number of us there used to be one sheriff for the city of Dublin.  I understand there are now 24 such people, with all the attendant officials necessary for their operations.  I am not suggesting that they are not doing any work or that these jobs were merely created for some of the boys.  These jobs are a necessity because of the activities sheriffs must engage in.  My information is that these men are overworked at the present time trying to get back from those who found that, under this present method of operation, their businesses are going to the wall.  These firms are going into liquidation and the sheriff has the unpleasant job of trying to salvage whatever is left of the wreckage.  As I said, there are 24 men today doing a job which was done by one man and an assistant not so very long ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply must address himself to this subject, not just to satisfy those who are critical of his operations as Minister, but to try to allay in the public mind the very great disquiet that things will get much worse because the people can see no light at the end of the tunnel. Unless there is some way the Minister can show us that the picture is not as bad as it appears, then he and the Government must seriously contemplate a very fast, progressive, deterioration of the economy and the real disaster situation in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>If he has any basis for an optimistic view, he has a duty to tell the public and so allay to some degree the fears and disquiet in the business and manufacturing communities.  In this way they will endeavour to hold their ground in the hope that something better is around the corner.  This is a serious situation for the whole country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> The taxes imposed in the recent budget were ill-conceived, brutal in their application, and will have disastrous consequences.  The consequences can already be seen to such a degree that a great deal of the additional income the Minister had hoped to get will not be forthcoming unless there is a vast change in the downward swing in business, particularly those businesses he hit so savagely on the 28th January.</P>
    <P>I remember not so very long ago listening to the caterwauling of the Minister in this House telling us the Arabs had screwed things up and the energy crisis was such that we had to take all kinds of steps not only to minimise the impact of the brutal Arabs in their application of new increases for their products, but we were taxing petrol further in order to try to make the public use less.  It was supposed to be a two-pronged attack&mdash;one, to get more money and, two, to try to limit and reduce the demand for petroleum products of all kinds.  That we were loath to swallow but we had it rammed down our throats, as did the public who have had to pay the piper since.</P>
    <P>At that stage the price was increased by 15 pence per gallon in one jump.  Now, without any provocation whatever and on top of those and other increases which took place in the intervening period, the Minister is increasing the price of petrol again. At the same time, as if he had a vendetta against motor users, he slams a tax on cars.  This is totally inexplicable to anybody who looks at the picture in a fair way.  Who is the Minister trying to penalise?  What is he trying to do?  He is hitting the dispersed workers of this country, of which there are thousands, who are endeavouring to participate in gainful employment instead of sitting by their firesides in rural Ireland, drawing assistance at the expense of the taxpayer. These workers are prepared to travel far from home to their places of employment.  To do this they must provide their own transport because public transport could not serve them. Is there any Deputy who will concede that those people are using small horse-power cars which the Minister <Col N="1702" /> seems to favour?  Are these men travelling to building sites, which are getting scarcer as time goes on, in six and seven horse-power cars?  Of course not.  They are grouping together and using higher horse-power cars in the 14 to 20 horse-power range to travel 20, 30 or 40 miles daily, five or six of them, to and from work.  They could justly stay at home and claim unemployment benefit or assistance from the State; but the Minister for Finance, who should bear that in mind, slams those people not only in respect of petrol, the cost of which is substantial for high horse-power cars which most of these people use, but also selects them for increases of up to 100 per cent in road tax.  He has given no indication to them, as I think he should, that they are entitled to claim tax free allowance for the expense of getting to work in circumstances where they would be entitled to go unemployed and draw from the State if they so wished.</P>
    <P>These people who must necessarily use their cars as part of their job should be properly treated by the income tax code.  They are not being so treated at present.  Instead, they are encouraged to go on the dole or draw unemployment benefit and let the State pay more to them than they would ultimately gain from their work when they have to travel long distances to it and pay exorbitant prices for fuel and road tax.  They also have to bear other increases about which the Government seem to have nothing to say but which are occurring each year such as insurance.  All this additional expense falls on those who can ill afford it, people for whom the car is essential in their daily work routine. They are ignored as regards the granting of relief to which they are properly entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;If you have a car over eight horse-power we will really nail you and the higher the horse-power the more you will be nailed&rdquo;.  He forgets that the higher the horse-power the more tax he gets on the petrol that car uses because it burns more petrol per mile than the smaller car.  There is no justification for the double increase&mdash;petrol and road tax.  This is ridiculous and vindictive, <Col N="1703" /> or else it is crassly stupid, which I doubt because the Minister's advisers are far from stupid.  I take it that it is the Minister and some elements in the Government who have devised this penal taxation.  I cannot understand why; because they are hammering people who would be justified in refusing to work at such distances and justified in signing at the employment exchange and drawing money from the State, as much or more than they have left from a week's wages after paying expenses.  They prefer to work, but the Government do not want them to work.  That seems to be the message.  This can, and may well have a further very serious effect on the employment situation in the country generally.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, who, no doubt, has had a very rough feedback from his supporters and his Deputies since 28th January, to try to justify this double, penal below against people who must use cars as part of their work.  How can it be justified?  How does he justify the progressive increase in tax with horse-power rating?  How is it that some baby cars are enjoying a decrease in tax?  What sort of people are using these cars of under eight horse-power? Will anybody assert they are used by those who must have them for their daily work?  My experience is totally to the contrary.  If there are luxury cars, quite a proportion of them are in the under eight horse-power class. There are second and third cars in families; that is where you find them, but outside the workman's home you find the 14 to 20 horse-power car, bought second hand at a fairly chancy price to take himself and his pals to work.  These are the people who are being hammered unmercifully by a Minister who, in our present circumstances, should be leaning over backwards to encourage such people to continue to seek work and travel far for it.  Instead, he is discouraging them and rather encouraging them to draw the dole and unemployment benefit. That is the effect of the budget in regard to this essential private transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> Apart from those travelling to work there is the farming community who must be considered while agriculture remains our primary earner, but the Minister, entirely disregarding the present situation, is lambasting these people who, of necessity, must use cars because they live in rural areas in isolated circumstances.  If they could do without their cars it would be unfair to ask them to do so.  The cars they use are very much dual purpose vehicles, general work-horses on the farm, with a towing hitch on practically all of them for use with a trailer for many purposes.  Naturally, these are cars from 12 to 20 horse-power as they must be to fulfil their functions and do all the jobs necessary and make farm life bearable in rural communities. These people are also being walloped unjustly and unnecessarily. If a man is a marginal farmer he is discouraged by being singled out to be hammered by this special tax that hits the horse-power rating of the car which uses more petrol and he is being slammed on that score also.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have completely lost touch with the general community in the country and must be getting the feed in of information which allowed him to do this stupid thing, in the wrong way.  This Minister is a very sharp and observant man.  That has been my experience of him over the years.  I am amazed at him misleading himself to the degree he has on this particular aspect.</P>
    <P>There are other various types of people, such as doctors, nurses and vets whom the Minister may say are well able to bear this extra cost, but they are not.  If they have to bear it they will in turn through the services they provide pass this on to the community they serve.  They must surely get increases in return for their labours.  Their costs are being increased substantially by those two particular taxes of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have all this against the background of the campaign and the propaganda of the Government trying to develop an atmosphere in which there should be a pay pause and in which there should be no increases sought, never mind granted during the coming <Col N="1705" /> year in order to give us breathing space to try to pick ourselves up from our knees where we now are.  While making that plea and propagandising the reasons why we should make that effort the Government are the prime offenders, the prime movers, of operations which will defeat what they claim publicly they want.  How can any Government, who on the one hand impose additional taxes which will increase everything every member of the community uses, make a big plea that workers are not to look for any increase?  The Government are primarily responsible for making it impossible for our work force of all descriptions, whether professional, manual, skilled or unskilled, to face the prospect of the continual rise in the cost of all commodities.</P>
    <P>How can the Government with any basis of honesty accept a pay pause and refrain from granting new demands for increased wages when they have irrevocably created a situation wherein the basis for wage claims is justifiably there to such a degree that those people must get increases?  It is a conundrum to me what way the Government are thinking about this matter.  On the one hand, they are seeking a pay pause, seeking to limit any increases during the year and, on the other hand, they are making certain by their actions, by increased taxation, that the very claims they are asking to be withheld must be met in order that the people in various walks of life can keep up with the increased costs they are asked to bear.  The community are being asked to do that on a frozen wage packet and escalating daily costs.  It cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately for the country, this is the sad situation as it stands at the moment.  If the Minister cannot admit how wrong his budget has been, and his financial concept for the coming year, perhaps he can at least give us some explanation which might go part of the way to explain to the public just how we are in the mess we are in and how he is creating further demands for wage increases on the one hand and crying out on the other hand to the workers not to make such wage demands, that it is <Col N="1706" /> wrong, that it will ruin the country. The Minister owes the House and the country an admission of his wrong in doing this or an explanation, which is so difficult to see that nobody must be aware of it except himself, as to why he wants this.  Things are far too serious for the high handed financial operation the Minister seems to be indulging in at the moment.</P>
    <P>Have the Government and the Minister taken into account the impact on tourism as a whole of the increase in petrol tax and road tax on cars and vehicles?  Surely the Government are fully aware that tourism, which has been going through a bad time in recent years, has been showing fair signs of recovery in recent times?  The Minister has dealt tourism a body blow again.  While he and his other colleagues in Government are justly looking for greater activity on the tourist front and while we are spending many hundreds of thousands of pounds that we can ill afford through our State-sponsored transport bodies to go abroad to try to whip up custom for this country, the Minister is imposing those taxes.  The Government members must be as fully aware as I am of the impact of those taxes on the tourist industry.  Is there any explanation why the budget should be geared in such a way that it contradicts the efforts made at some considerable expense by other elements of the Government to try to boost our tourist influx while the Minister's taxes are virtually saying: &ldquo;Stay away.  We do not want you.  Go somewhere else&rdquo;?  That is really the message this brings to our tourist potential outside the country.</P>
    <P>This is certainly the story we are telling to our people of the six northeastern counties.  We are telling them to stay where they are or go somewhere else.  We are telling them to use their cheaper petrol in the Six Counties, get their cheaper liquor in the Six Counties and not come across the Border because we want to take extra taxes from them.  There are exceptional circumstances in relation to cross-Border traffic.  We are imposing those taxes to the detriment of our Border counties which depend <Col N="1707" /> heavily on cross-Border traffic, which has been traditional so far as those counties are concerned.  In my county we are saying to the people: &ldquo;Do not come in here.  If you do we will charge you more for petrol than you will pay at home.  If you come we will charge you more for liquor than you will pay at home&rdquo;.  Those are the everyday things which our people have to face up to and they are the contradictions which are being clearly made by the Government.  We are telling the people outside the country to come and see Ireland but at the same time we are telling them: &ldquo;Do not come because if you do we will charge you more for doing it.  It is cheaper to go elsewhere&rdquo;.  No matter what part of the budget we look at we will find these contradictions. The contradictions are consistent. That is about the only consistency there is in the Minister's and the Government's financial operations. Consistency in contradictions is evident in every aspect of the budget.</P>
    <P>We have a particular economic difficulty in the Border counties.  Are the Government aware that before the budget, and particularly since 1st March, our towns in the Border counties are becoming ghost towns? In the matter of prices for all sorts of materials and foods, the Six Counties are beating us to such a degree that excursions are being run daily from 50 miles and more from the Border into the Six Counties on a regular basis.  Ten, 12 or 14 housewives are going in minibuses to do their week or month's shopping in the Six Counties.  Who can blame them when you see the disparity and the difference in the prices of the everyday things we use?</P>
    <P>More astounding for the south Border county people is it to find well-known products selling in the Six Counties at anything up to 33? per cent less than they can buy them on this side of the Border where they are manufactured.  There are all sorts of explanations for this, but the impact and the effect of it on our people cannot be eradicated.  They are continuing <Col N="1708" /> in ever-increasing numbers to cross the Border to buy southern Ireland products at anything up to 33? per cent less than they can buy them in the towns in which they are manufactured. You can explain all you like about export profits being tax free, and about British Government food subsidies, but the fact still remains that, with all the difficulties and troubles and bother they have had along the Border in recent years, by virtue of Government action we are adding to their difficulties in these towns and, in a very short time, we will create a situation in which every Border town south of the Border will be a ghost town.  I am not exaggerating. I know it.  I see it.  I observe it day in and day out.</P>
    <P>We are now saying to them: &ldquo;You will have the benefit of the cheap foods and the cheap goods you have been crossing the Border for in recent months, and we will give you a bonus of getting petrol so much cheaper that you can make the journey at no cost because you can fill up with petrol out of a pump in the Six Counties&rdquo;. I do not believe the Government are fully cognisant of that situation.  If they were, they would not behave as they have behaved.  If they were blind to it when they were doing it on 28th January, they should remedy the situation and not add to the difficulties and the problems in the Border counties south of the Border these additional economic hazards and difficulties which will wreck our towns which had been building up from a very bad start since the Border was first put there.  They are now being walloped back into the ground again under the present mode of operation.</P>
    <P>All I can say in regard to liquor prices is that the Government really went to town with their liquor tax increases.  I am afraid they will not get what they are expecting to get, but they will create quite a problem within the liquor trade and those associated with it.  Redundancies and unemployment are bound to be created as a result of the lesser volume of throughput arising from the brutal and penal taxes which have been added to our liquor prices.  Everybody in this House <Col N="1709" /> except the youngest Members will remember when a penny on the pint could change a Government in Dublin city.  I remember members of the present Government at that time lashing the then Government for putting a penny on the pint.  The same outfit now put five new pennies on it which is the equivalent of 12 of the pennies I am talking about.</P>
    <P>Only 20 years ago they lambasted the Government and made such propaganda that it was recognised that a penny on the pint was capable of putting the Government out of office. Now they put on 12 old pennies, plus what has been put on since as a result of the VAT change on 1st March, together with the increases allowed to the brewers, all of which will bring the increase up to something like 10 new pence.  To be conservative we are talking in terms of an increase of 20 pennies, 20 times the penny of the late fifties.  If an increase of a penny in the fifties could change a Government, what should 20 pennies do in 1976 to the Government? They should put them into space, permanently circling the earth, far away from it where they could not do any more harm.  That is the sort of operation in which the Government have engaged.</P>
    <P>We have to borrow three times as much as the optimistic estimate made by the Minister will give us from the increased stupid vicious and penal taxes wrongly placed on the main heads he has had a go at.  Even on his most optimistic calculations of the various penal taxes, £3 will be borrowed in addition to every £1 he hopes to raise.  That is the manner in which our country is being run at the moment.  Obviously it cannot continue for very much longer.  He has already done such damage that even if the Government change and remedies are applied the damage has been done irrevocably and irretrievably.  The progress the country was making has been set back for years.  To put a number on those years is beyond me, but there can be no doubt that progress has been set back for many years regardless of what steps may be taken and will have to be taken in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> We are in a mess.  There are no two ways about it.  We are in a bad way. One thing that seems to be keeping the wolf from the door in one sense in so far as the Government are concerned is that they have been adding to the benefits going to those who most need them.  I do not think that is done on the basis of their increasing need in a deteriorating situation.  It is a matter of feeding the dog with its own tail.</P>
    <P>We continue to give to the growing number of unemployed increases each week.  The Government justify and laud themselves on the very fine sentiment that those who are out of work and who cannot help themselves are entitled to the help of the community through the Government and the Exchequer.  They laud themselves on that basis but it is not an honest basis. It is merely a method of trying to keep quiet those who in normal circumstances would have risen up to such a degree that the Government would have had to go to the country.  The dog is being fed with his own tail, not for the love of the dog but in order that he does not bite his master.</P>
    <P>The Government are doing this to such effect that the country will suffer for many years to come as a result of this wanton spree.  The Government do not seem to know where they are going. They do not know where they have come from or where they are going; in fact, I doubt if they know where they are at this moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>By now a number of people who did not realise the full effects of this budget know a good deal more about it than they did on budget day or a few days afterwards.  By now most people know what has been the effect on prices and their reaction is one of undiluted hostility towards the Government for what they have done. However, I do not think that many know about the full effect of this budget with regard to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that this budget not only is deliberately fuelling inflation with all that implies but it has and is continuing directly to bring about unemployment.  It does so under various headings.  I will mention just one or two but they will illustrate what <Col N="1711" /> I have in mind.  Deputy Blaney mentioned one heading with regard to the impositions on spirits and beer and all the consequences of the charges. However, we might also consider the imposition with regard to cars.  It is clear that the effect on the assembly industry and in garages throughout the country has been to cause lay-offs. Within a short time of the budget I had information regarding commercial firms with fleets of vehicles who had plans to make replacements.  Instead of that they now have fewer vehicles and they are laying-off staff who had been engaged on maintenance work. The effects of the budget on tourism must be severe, with a consequent effect on employment.  There are other aspects that have a bearing on employment but I am mentioning these merely to draw attention to the fact that the most obvious consequences of the budget, those relating to prices, are not by any means the only damaging and deleterious consequences.</P>
    <P>It is true that most people would accept, reluctantly of course, heavy tax increases if they were satisfied such increases would help employment and would get the economy moving again.  By now people realise that in this Government we have a collection of incompetent amateurs who are running our economy into the ground and who have no idea of how to remedy the situation.  They are simply scurrying from one crisis to another, hoping as they go to cover up the worst effects of what has happened.</P>
    <P>There is very little dispute now as to the appalling state of our economy; indeed, almost daily we hear from the Taoiseach and other members of the Government about the serious state it is in.  They are not exaggerating when they describe the state of the economy. In some instances they might reasonably be accused of not spelling out sufficiently fully just how bad is the situation.</P>
    <P>We know that inflation is rampant, that unemployment has reached a figure of more than 117,000, that we are borrowing way out of line with any of our EEC partners and that there has been a drop in sales and production. <Col N="1712" /> All the indicators show just how serious is the state of our economy. The evidence was there in the past that this was the way we were heading; we pointed out this was happening but there were disputes at that time about whether we were correct. Now there is no dispute about the state of the economy.  The only points of dispute now are, first, why the situation is so bad and, secondly, what should be done about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to why the situation is so bad, the Government are still trying to plead world conditions but that tune is becoming discredited by now.  It is interesting to recall that virtually all the economic indicators show that the deterioration in our economy began in the second half of 1973, not after the oil and energy crisis and not after the Arabs had caused considerable disruption in world trading conditions.  It happened before that, in the second half of 1973.  All the indicators show that this was the case and I have referred to a number of them.  They are on the record of this House and I do not propose to go over that ground again. However, it is interesting to recall that that was when the deterioration started.</P>
    <P>Of course, we can measure the performance of the Government against the performance of our EEC partners who have had to face the same problems of world conditions and the same problems arising from the energy crisis.  Indeed, for some of those countries the problems were more acute than for us because of the nature of their consumption of energy.  We find when we make that comparison that our position is considerably worse than that of our partners under almost any heading one can think of.  It is probably true to say that at the moment we are not the worst in relation to inflation&mdash;I think that doubtful distinction belongs to our neighbours across the channel&mdash;but in regard to the effects on employment, which is of course crucial for all of our people, we leave our neighbours far behind.</P>
    <P>Worst of all and most significant of all, our borrowing in relation to GNP is this year likely to be in the <Col N="1713" /> region of 22 per cent.  Britain and Italy have a corresponding figure of about 10 per cent and most of the other EEC countries are half or much less than that, so we are far out of line in that respect.  The only possible justification, if there can be a justification, is that as a result of that kind of borrowing and consequent spending we would shield ourselves from the worst effects of the international disruption of trade and the general recession throughout the world, but unfortunately the evidence is we have not shielded ourselves but are worse off than our partners to the extent that all this enormous borrowing is virtually going for nothing and we are now saddled with an enormous dead weight of debt which is such that it is difficult for us to grasp the significance of what is happening.  If we consider that with all the savage taxation imposed by this budget the total amount of extra taxation being brought in by the budget will not be nearly sufficient to service the increase in the national debt, we get some idea of the extent to which the situation is getting out of hand and has got out of hand.</P>
    <P>This Government to an amazing degree have displayed one particular characteristic, and that is an unwillingness and inability to accept responsibility for what they do.  I do not want to speculate on the psychological make-up that this discloses&mdash; each person can do that for himself or herself&mdash;but I want to draw attention to the fact because I think it is important not to misunderstand what is happening and the Government's reaction to it.  It will be recalled that at one stage all our difficulties were being blamed on the Arabs, but there is another phase when all the other Governments, particularly the Governments of major industrial countries, were at fault because they were not reflating their economies fast enough, and we had the Minister for Finance giving a lecture to those countries on their failure to discharge their obligations to us.</P>
    <P>Of course no Government will act in any way other than what they conceive to be in the interests of their <Col N="1714" /> own people and if that happens to assist the rest of the world that is a bonus, but if it does not, the interests of their own people will come first, and anybody who thinks that any Government or any country owes us a living is gravely mistaken.  The approach that it is the other person's fault is one we find in various aspects of this Government, and perhaps a good example of it lies in the approach to the question of equal pay.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the Government boasted of their social conscience, their social concern.  They said they were in the van internationally in regard to the implementation of equal pay and the rights of women. Up to the last moment the Minister for Labour was maintaining that of course the legislation would be enforced&mdash;it was unthinkable that we would do anything else, not a Government of social conscience such as we are blessed with&mdash;until in December the announcement was made that such was not to be the case.  Then we had the Minister for Finance having the nerve to say that if we were to have equal pay the EEC would have to pay for it, if the EEC were to issue a directive they would pay for it, this from a Minister for Finance who knew the Exchequer had benefited to an enormous extent from EEC membership, a Minister for Finance who with his colleagues had maintained the alleged social concern of this Government, a Minister who was well aware that strong representations had been made continuously by the private sector that the legislation should not be implemented and who had rejected such representation.</P>
    <P>But suddenly the boot was on the other foot.  I suggest that the Minister for Finance and his colleagues were not in the least concerned with the private sector, that their concern arose solely when they found the implementation of equal pay would present some problems for the Exchequer in regard to the public sector. Suddenly the whole position changed. Are we to believe that the consequences and the cost of the implementation of equal pay suddenly emerged with clarity for the Government last <Col N="1715" /> December and that in the whole period from the enactment of the legislation until then the Government were unaware of the consequences which they now say will flow from its implementation?  Somebody was bluffing somewhere and I think few people have the slightest doubt that the bluffing was on those benches and that it was exposed eventually, and, in the process of its exposure, we were treated to a disgraceful performance by the Minister for Finance in relation to both the EEC Commission and the Commissioner from this country. I do not want to pursue the matter any further except to make it clear that my view is, as I have stated, that the Minister's performance was disgraceful and was certainly not in the interests of this country.</P>
    <P>In this whole saga of equal pay we had yet another example of this Government's inability to accept responsibility for their own actions and their apparent congenital necessity, when things go wrong, to blame somebody else.  In this case it was the EEC.  Whenever there is difficulty it is always somebody else's fault.  It is never a question of the Government saying: &ldquo;Look, things are difficult and we did, perhaps, let things go too far here and there, but this is where we stand.  We regret it, but it has to be this way&rdquo;.  We get sounds like this on occasion from the Minister for Finance and from the Taoiseach.  Then we get the opposite sounds from other members of the Government so that, whatever happens, they can say they took this line or they took that line.  The real test is not what the Government say.  It is what the Government do and, on that test, this Government seem to fail in almost every single instance.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that will arise for the Government out of this budget is not alone the estimated huge deficit but the fact that the deficit is likely to be considerably greater than estimated. I say that even on the assumption that expenditure is kept precisely to the estimated figures because, to take one example, namely, the revenue expected from beer and spirits, <Col N="1716" /> the position is that there is no hope of the Minister's estimates being realised.  Indeed, there is likely to be a substantial shortfall in revenue from beer and spirits.  Certainly all the indications are that there will be a substantial fall, perhaps 20 per cent, perhaps considerably more than that, and that is in only one area.</P>
    <P>Prior to the budget the estimates were that inflation this year would run at about 11 per cent or 12 per cent. I am afraid it is more likely to be far closer to 20 per cent by the time this year is finished.  The bulk of that extra inflation is a direct consequence of the budget and of increased taxation. There are other factors, such as the impact of the agreement in Brussels on the price of agricultural products, but by far the most important are the other items that have been increased, though not in the budget.  I refer to fares, social welfare contributions, telephones, postal charges, the TV licence and so on. The list is huge.  Added together these will bring us to a situation in which we will be closer to 20 per cent and not 11 per cent inflation this year, and this in the context of the Government seeking a pay pause.</P>
    <P>I have found it extremely difficult to understand the mentality of the Government and the Minister for Finance in their approach to this question of incomes and national pay agreements and the impact of his measures in the budget on such agreements.  I am more mystified than ever now because I recall what happened last year.  I recall the extraordinary ineptitude of the Government in bringing in a budget in January, 1975, knowing a national pay agreement was about to be negotiated, as a consequence of which the cost of living increased by four percentage points.</P>
    <P>The Government allowed a national wage agreement to be negotiated on that basis and then said the country could not afford it and brought in another budget introducing subsidies of various kinds, subsidies which had been advocated by us the previous autumn and ignored.  The net effect of all that was to reduce the cost of living by four percentage points but <Col N="1717" /> there was no corresponding reduction under the national pay agreement.  I find it very hard to understand that ineptitude.  Here we are faced with a situation in which the Government are not calling for a restrained national pay agreement but for a pay pause, no increase on the conclusion of the existing agreement, no increase for nine months from that time.</P>
    <P>I know that anybody speaking on these benches is in danger of being misrepresented in regard to his attitude towards this matter.  Let me recall that it was we in Fianna Fáil who pioneered national pay agreements. We believe in them.  They have many difficulties but we believe they are in the national interest and we want to see them maintained.  When we were in power we tried to gear policies to facilitate the conclusion of national pay agreements.  This Government seem to go out of their way to produce policies that will make it more difficult to get a national pay agreement. There can be no doubt but that the consequences of the budget and the other measures taken by the Government accelerating the rate of inflation is to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for trade unions and employers to act responsibly in negotiations in regard to what should happen at the conclusion of the existing agreement.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to sabotage negotiations or the position of the Government in this regard.  I have made it clear and the Leader of this party has made it clear that we fully support the necessity for income restraint at the present time.  But it is impossible to ignore the realities and it is impossible not to point out that the actions of the Government and, in particular, their actions in this budget, have made it extremely difficult for the employers and the trade unions to act in a way that would be regarded as responsible and certainly in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that at a time when there is a fall of, I think, 3 per cent in our GNP, it is not possible for everybody to get increases.  In fact, somebody has to have a lowering of his standard of living in circumstances <Col N="1718" /> like this.  If it were a one-off situation it would be possible to cushion the effects of this borrowing, but because of the extent to which borrowing has gone on under this Government, that option is not really open.  The sheer cost of servicing the increased borrowing is wiping out any cushioning effect we could have.  Therefore there cannot be any real improvement in the standard of living of our people until we get growth again and get the economy moving.  It is all right to ask people to recognise this fact and to exercise restraint and self-discipline, but there is a limit to what you can reasonably expect people to do.  If we get inflation this year approaching 20 per cent, then the extent of the sacrifice that is being sought is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that this is not the time when one can do very much about that.  The time to consider these factors was when the budget was being prepared, but it would seem that little or no consideration was given to that, and so we are faced with the situation that whatever course is adopted it is going to be the wrong course.  Clearly if a national pay agreement is entered into and it provides for substantial increases that will have the effect of causing even further unemployment. If, on the other hand, we have no national agreement and have a free-for-all, the position may well be worse. If we are to have the pay pause the Government seek, we cannot realistically expect to have one with inflation likely to run at the rates that are now being projected.  I do not know what the answer to this problem is, because the answer was in the hands of the Minister and his colleagues when they were framing the budget, and to deal with it now is trying to lock the stable door when the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>The nature of the increases in this budget, too, the way they were implemented, has annoyed people very considerably, the two tier increase, people recovering from the shock of the enormous increases imposed in the budget and then finding on 1st March a huge range of commodities increasing in price again.  None of this has helped the kind of climate that is required to have any realistic negotiations and <Col N="1719" /> results in regard to incomes in general. The art of government consists, in part, of the creation of the right climate for such negotiations, the right climate for growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that the Government have pursued the line they have. We have in the past pointed out to the Government the manner in which they were putting the national pay agreements at risk.  I had hoped by now the Government would have learned the dangers of that course, but it would appear that they have learned nothing, and the consequences for our whole economy, and particularly for employment, could be extremely serious.</P>
    <P>One sometimes gets the impression that members of the Government, especially the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, imagine that sermons are substitutes for policy.  We have had many sermons from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  Some of them have been quite sensible, true and sounding the right warning notes to the people.  However, the Minister will have to realise that such sermons totally lack credibility if they are not accompanied by action.  If you look at some of the recent speeches by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach on this theme and compare them with what has been said about 15 months ago, you find they are very similar. I am thinking of the time when the white paper entitled <i>A National Partnership</i> was issued in the autumn of 1974.  I may be wrong in the date, but it was introduced a considerable time ago.  All the warnings that were given then are being given now.</P>
    <P>People ask reasonably what is the point in all this?  It is one thing to tell the people what the situation is, to warn them of the consequences of this course or that; it is another thing to regard it as a substitute for policies implemented, which is what a Government are for.  By this time and long before this time, this Government ought to have determined on what their policy was going to be in regard to incomes, what their policy in relation to the requirements of the economy were, to have spelled out clearly what that policy was and taken <Col N="1720" /> responsibility for implementing it, and not to be subjecting us now, 15 or 18 months later, to the same sermons we have been hearing in the past. That is not really what government is about.</P>
    <P>Speaking of sermons, I notice that the General Secretary of the Labour Party has been giving another of his sermons on the link with sterling.  I have spoken about this matter before and I do not want to waste too much time on it again.  It is about time the Labour Party made up their minds where they stood on this.  The Labour Party are in this Government and are as fully responsible for the actions of the Government as are the Fine Gael Party.  If it is a matter of policy for the Labour Party to break the link with sterling, it should be implemented by the Government or they should get out.  If it is not something they think should be done, or is not something they think is of any great importance at this stage, the general secretary of that party, a nominee in the other House of the Taoiseach, should stop talking about it as though he meant it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance knows, as I do, that Senator Halligan is talking through his hat.  The balance of advantage as far as this country is concerned till lies with maintaining the link with sterling.  The advantage is getting smaller and smaller, but it still lies there.  This is what annoys me about Senator Halligan's repeated sermons; if we were to break the link with sterling now, the immediate consequence would be a devaluation of the Irish £ relative to the British £. Furthermore, anybody who is serious about breaking the link with sterling would have insisted on the Government's following policies designed to strengthen our economy and to enable it to stand on its own two feet.  If ever there were policies designed to ensure that we could not break the link with sterling, they are the policies which have been followed by this Government for the past three years.</P>
    <P>We are now in a totally dependent situation as far as our economy is concerned.  We are borrowing all over <Col N="1721" /> the world.  Even with the huge taxation raised in this budget we cannot raise enough money to service the increase in the debt we are bringing about.  That is not the kind of approach that would be required from any Government even remotely thinking of breaking the link with sterling. The discipline that is required to maintain one's own currency, even tied to another strong currency, is enormous. The first man who would squeal at having to be subjected to that discipline would be Senator Halligan. I urge Senator Halligan to stop talking about this.  If he means it, he should not be general secretary of the Labour Party who form part of this Government, and he should not be supporting the policies of the Government which are having the effect, even if they are not designed to do so, of weakening our currency and our economy far more than anybody could have conceived possible when this Government took office.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, has received representations&mdash;I too have received representations&mdash;about one matter he announced in the budget, that is the acceleration of the payment of income tax by the self-employed.  The consequence of what he announced could fairly be stated in this way.  In the period between 1st July, 1976, and 1st July, 1977, a self-employed person will have to pay four half-yearly payments, that is, two years' tax.  When the Minister referred to this in his budget statement he accompanied it by one of his usual bland clichés about equity and talked about the PAYE taxpayers.  He knows that when PAYE was introduced certain concessions were rightly given to taxpayers in order to phase in the new system. No such concession is proposed by the Minister at the moment for the self-employed.  It also appears&mdash; although we do not have the full details&mdash;that for the public service who are being phased into the PAYE system, certain concessions are being given.  I want to point out to the Minister that whatever else he is doing, he is not giving anything like equal treatment to the self-employed as was given to PAYE taxpayers and <Col N="1722" /> as is proposed to be given to public service taxpayers.  I want to urge him strongly between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill to rethink his proposals and to try to ensure that some form of proper phasing-in is given.</P>
    <P>There are some general aspects of budgeting by this Government to which I referred before but I shall briefly touch on again.  The first is the whole question of deficits.  I have gone into this before and I will not go into detail about whether deficits are good or bad, and the sheer nonsense to which we have been subjected in this House and outside, until very recently, about expansionary budgets and the more you spend the greater the expansion in the economy.  It has been demonstrated that this is simply not true.</P>
    <P>As far as this side of the House are concerned, we do not object to deficit budgeting.  In fact, we introduced deficit budgeting in this country.  I do not want us to be misrepresented in that regard.  We say that a deficit in the budget should be used productively. If it is not, it is very likely directly to fuel inflation and will have other ill consequences, but it will not help our economy.</P>
    <P>We have consistently urged on the Minister for Finance the necessity of curbing Government spending.  He has used various devices to try to deal with this argument but he came up with a new approach in his budget speech.  However, I want to make it clear that the real mistake the Minister and his colleagues made in their successive budgets has been their failure to curb spending.  By that, I do not mean that they should say: &ldquo;Expenditure as it exists at the moment has to be cut by one-third and that is that.  We do not care what happens&rdquo;. That is not the way.  If you do that, you create the most enormous misery.  The key is not to allow expenditure to grow at too fast a rate. Every Minister for Finance is tempted to allow expenditure to grow more than he knows it should grow, and more than the economy can bear at a particular time.  He is tempted because there are some very worthwhile <Col N="1723" /> things he can do and he is tempted for purely political advantage.  If he lets spending grow without regard to the capacity of the economy to pay, he can have short-term political advantage but, as sure as night follows day, he reaches the situation we are in today.</P>
    <P>It is no answer for a Minister for Finance who has allowed that to happen and who has not exercised the discipline he should on himself and his colleagues in successive budgets to say now: &ldquo;But what would you cut? What are the consequences of cutting?&rdquo; His failure began with the first budget he introduced in 1973 and it has continued since.</P>
    <P>When we criticise him for failing to curb Government expenditure we are not talking only about this budget but about his whole course of action, his lack of discipline and control and his failure to do the fundamental job of the Minister for Finance&mdash;ensure that he does not yield to the temptation, for a purely short-term political advantage, of running his country into pawn, which is what the Minister has done, as was done by some Coalition predecessors of his also.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when speaking on the budget, made reference to our claim that we had been advocating food subsidies, cuts in VAT rates and similar things in the autumn of 1974, that the Government had rejected this advice in the budget of January, 1975, and had only adopted it belatedly in the budget of June, 1975.  In referring to this the Minister said, as reported in column 932 of the Official Report of 29th January, 1976:</P>
    <P>.... diligent research has so far failed to elicit any published statement to this effect, but I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil speakers will direct our attention to what we have missed.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a fair measure of the diligence and the competence of this Government&mdash;&ldquo;diligence&rdquo; is the word of the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash; that they failed to find any such reference because first, I advocated these <Col N="1724" /> matters on a radio programme, &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; on Sunday 6th October, 1974; I advocated fuel and food subsidies. The following day reports of that interview appeared in the national newspapers. In <i>The Irish Times</i> it was reported on page 13 and was referred to in an editorial in page 11.  In <i>The Irish Press</i> it appeared on page 3 and in <i>The Irish Independent</i> on page 7. In addition, some weeks later, I made a speech in Cork in which I spelled it out in more detail and advocated cuts in VAT rates also.  This was reported in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of 19th October, 1974, under the headline: &ldquo;Aid on Food, Fuel Bid by Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  It was also reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> on the same day under the heading: &ldquo;Colley Again Urges Fuel, Food Subsidy&rdquo;.  Despite all that the Minister for Foreign Affairs says &ldquo;Diligent research has so far failed to elicit any public statement to this effect&rdquo;.  That is a fair comment, I suppose, on the diligence and competence of this Government.</P>
    <P>On a purely personal note I must confess that there are times when I wonder just what will happen to this country under this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are closer to it. We can see what is happening and see the degree of incompetence shrouded in public relations and bouncy attacks by the Minister for Finance, but we suspect deeply that perhaps the Minister for Finance does not know how bad the situation is. One wonders if he could live with himself if he knew just how bad it was and what he had allowed to happen and what he was failing to do to remedy it.  Perhaps he has an excellent poker face and that he knows&mdash;he is in a better position than anybody else to know what the situation is.  But whether it is a tribute to him or a condemnation of him he certainly does not give the impression that he knows what is really happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the strange situation of the Tánaiste, speaking with very considerable publicity, calling on the Government <Col N="1725" /> to produce an economic plan. Unfortunately, I suppose the age of Dean Swift has passed and nobody today can do justice to the kind of situation in which the Tánaiste, Deputy Leader of the Government, makes a speech which could have been made&mdash;in fact was made many times &mdash;from these benches, calling on the Government to produce an economic and social plan.  I do not profess to understand the situation.  I can speculate; we know that the Minister for Finance on many occasions poured scorn on the whole idea of such a plan and said it was nonsense in this type of situation with various uncertainties even to think of it.  Subsequently, somebody twisted his arm and he did make noises indicating that perhaps there would be a plan. Then he became very definite and we were going to have a plan by the end of 1975.  All of this is on the records of the House.  We do not have that plan yet but we have been told in the Minister's budget statement that we shall have a green paper.  We have not had the green paper yet either and it is now nearly the middle of March, 1976.  Apparently, sometime we shall get a green paper.  That means that the Minister for Finance will be committed to nothing in it and, I suppose, the Tánaiste will not be committed to anything in it either.  At least he will be able to say: &ldquo;We have produced something on those lines&rdquo; and the Minister for Finance will be equally able to deny that any such thing has been produced.</P>
    <P>All this could be very amusing and interesting politically, but our people do not have time for this kind of nonsense.  This country is sinking. This country needs now more than it has ever needed before a Government that knows where they are going and what they are doing.  Even if some of the steps they are going to take are wrong, if they know where they are going and go at it, at this time the people will follow a lead if the Government are seen to know what they are doing.</P>
    <P>The Government are clearly going around in circles.  They do not know <Col N="1726" /> where they are going.  They are going from one crisis to another.  &ldquo;Ad hocery&rdquo; reigns supreme.  We have all the talk about a social conscience, a Government of concern.  Apart from the obvious public relations aspect of it, which is obvious to anybody who knows the score of what is going on, the reality is that you cannot hope to implement any kind of ordered social programme unless you have an economic programme that will pay for it, that you can gear one to the other.</P>
    <P>While the Government talk about social progress our economy decreases by 3 per cent.  Think about that for a moment.  If you continue on on that road where do you end up?  How do you pay for social progress?  Is it not by an expanding economy?  Is it not by a Government who create a climate in which people want to invest, in which people want growth for themselves but with a proper share being taken for the community?  If you do not create that climate and if you do not create that growth you are just fooling people and perhaps fooling yourself if you talk about a plan for social development.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have yet another budget from this Coalition which is doing virtually nothing to tackle our unemployment problem&mdash;in fact it is making it worse&mdash;but which is clearly making our inflation problem worse, which is adding to our enormous national debt, which is not reducing our deficit and which is giving no inspiration to any of our people to make their contribution to the growth of our economy, to getting this country going again and enabling us to bring about the kind of social reform we all want to see.</P>
    <P>Once more we have a budget of that kind.  Whatever hope people may have had, be they supporters of the Coalition, be they neutral, even be they on these benches&mdash;there were some on those benches, and I was one of them, who hoped that by now the Government would have learned something&mdash;unfortunately this budget proves that if you start with the basic amateur inabilities of this Government there is nothing you can do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been the most disappointing budget debate I have yet experienced in this House, as a Member now in my seventeenth year of membership.  Never had we to debate in that period economic problems of greater depth and greater impact than those we have this year because never during all that time or during the last 45 years has Ireland been afflicted by a world crisis of the dimension or the depth of that which now afflicts us.  I would have thought, as I appealed in my budget address, that it would have evoked some sense of responsibility, some depth of thought and some degree of uniformity of approach by the Opposition to the problems of today because the problems which face this country are not the problems of the Government or of the Opposition but the problems of the people.</P>
      <P>I thought it might have been helpful if they had responded to the appeal which I made in my budget speech for an adult debate on this occasion and not the kind of debate, which Oppositions can be tempted to engage in, of scoring petty points. Unfortunately the Opposition did not rise to their responsibilities and we have had one of the most tardy, contradictory and futile debates ever.  It has been useful, perhaps, in identifying the massive confusion which exists in the Fianna Fáil Party that they cannot even produce one common thought, not merely between one another but indeed even in one speech.  As they have called for massive additional expenditure they have condemned the Government for the current level of expenditure.  They have complained about the high rate of tax.  They have complained about the broadening of the tax base.  They have criticised every form of expenditure and saving in which we have engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of this debate perhaps the only thing that is now apparent is that the Fianna Fáil Party are the chameleon of Irish politics.  The chameleon everybody will recall, is the lizard, distinguished by a prehensile tail, long tongue, eyes moving <Col N="1728" /> independent of one another, distinguished especially by his power of changing the colour of his skin, varying through different shades of yellow, red, grey, brown and dull inky blue according to background.</P>

If people had witnessed the debate in the last five weeks they would feel that the Fianna Fáil Party were living on more than that.  &ldquo;What is the prehensile tail?&rdquo; some people might ask.  I would like to explain that Oxford says that &ldquo;prehensile&rdquo; means having a capacity of laying hold of anything. That is what we had throughout this debate from the contributions from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Every speaker got up and spoke like an irresponsible Independent.  There was no cohesion, there was no unity; there was total conflict.</P>
      <P>We had the Leader of the Opposition saying that the Government's efforts in relation to the dole for the small farmer were commendable and Deputy Haughey saying they were atrocious.  We had demands for cutbacks in public expenditure and we had, after criticism of the size of the budget deficit, the increases in taxation and Government borrowing, from the Fianna Fáil Party, that want to parade themselves as being responsible, demands for an addition to publish expenditure of £222 million.  That was their contribution in the last five weeks &mdash;additional expenditure of £222 million. They criticised the size of the deficit of £327 million.  Their demand would have made the current deficit £549 million.</P>

      <P>They presumably would not tax us because they have criticised our taxation so they would have borrowed it.  That would have meant borrowing £728 million.  That was the collective wisdom of the Fianna Fáil Party or, to give them their due, maybe they would have taxed for some of the additional £222 million they wanted to spend.  How might they have collected some of that tax?  I will tell the House.  These are the only options which would be open to them. The people should know that what the Fianna Fáil Party in their collective confusion believed should be done is this.  According to Fianna Fáil, income tax should be raised by a further 10p on every rate.</P>

      <P>I am trying to point out the inevitable, inescapable and realistic consequences of weeks of total confusion and independent recklessness from the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have not a common thought or a moment's consistency, either collectively or individually. I am being fair to them.  I have not added to these figures the millions of pounds they demand at Question Time every day in this House.  Question Time never passes without every one of them currying favour from his own narrow parish, and looking after his own skin, not giving a damn about his own party colleagues, and still less for the nation, <Col N="1730" /> demanding more and more money to meet the demands of parish pump politics.  Leaving all that miserable politicking aside, we find they want to add £222 million to public expenditure.</P>

      <P>They know we recognise what they were at.  They were adding up the sums and so were the people.  How would they get this money?  They rule out borrowing so they would not have £900 million of borrowing.  They do not like a deficit of £327 million, so presumably they do not want a deficit of £549 million.  Therefore, they would have to put an additional 10p on every rate of income tax to produce £80 million.</P>
      <P>They have criticised the petrol tax. They would have to add at least another 10p to the petrol tax which would yield about £16 million.  They would have to add at least 5p on the packet of cigarettes, in addition to what has already been put on it, to produce about £5 million.  They would have to add on double what we put on spirits and beer.  This would produce only about £22 million extra. They would also have to double the recent rates of car tax, which they said were catastrophic, to produce £8.5 million.  At the end of that, they would have obtained only £131.5 million towards their additional expenditure of £222 million.  According to Fianna Fáil they would still have to go out to the world with the begging bowl looking for an additional £100 million to meet their extravagant schemes, as they try to beg and borrow their way back to public popularity.</P>

That is what the Fianna Fáil Party have proved themselves to be over the past five weeks.</P>
      <P>They have also been very anxious throughout this debate to reject their own think tank.  They are getting tens of thousands of the taxpayers money to assist them in Opposition to finance their &ldquo;think tank&rdquo;.  We know their think tank is leaking brilliant ideas. Their think tank is suggesting a cut in social welfare of £30 million and a slashing of the pay of every policeman, of every nurse, of every soldier, of every civil servant, of everybody in the public sector, by 10 per cent. They are holding back to their golden jubilee, no less, the revelation as to whether or not their economic plan will include drops of wisdom from their think tank.</P>
      <P>Is it not a reflection on the Fianna Fáil approach to things that the man who was the chief economic adviser to the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in power believes that were they in power today they should be taking £30 million from the weakest members of our community and taking 10 per cent back from the public sector, not simply having a pay pause such as we are asking for but taking 10 per cent back from everybody in the pay of the public sector?

    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> I want to draw attention to the development of public expenditure and not only over the past year or two in which there have been very substantial increases, increases which I might point out received the endorsement yesterday of the European Economic Community.  They pointed out that if these increases had not taken place in Ireland in the past two years the economic recession in Ireland would have been far more grievous than it has been.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They point out that the Irish Government in the particularly difficult circumstances of the past few years adopted correct financial, budgetary and economic policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This must not blind us to the realities that face Ireland and the community.  For many years there has been a steady and accelerating increase in Government current expenditure and in the public capital programme. Both have increased at a much faster rate than gross national product.  Ten years ago, total public expenditure came to 35 per cent of gross national product.  Five years ago this figure had increased to 41 per cent.  In 1975 it was 51 per cent.  In 1976 it is 55 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public expenditure and gross national product ratios provide a crude indication of the extent to which the public sector is absorbing national resources. Whatever the reservations attached to the measurement the trend is unmistakable and it is very marked.  We have now reached the stage at which the public sector accounts for more than half of total national resources.  If we take the expenditure of local authorities into account as well as the expenditure of the Exchequer, the figure is around 60 per cent.  While the <Col N="1733" /> individual social and economic policies underlying public expenditure may well be desirable, as they are if considered in isolation, we must seriously as a community ask ourselves whether the present overall balance between public and private expenditure is desirable.</P>
    <P>What is even more important is whether we are prepared to allow a continuation of present trends to permit the public sector to account for an ever greater proportion of national resources. Even when account is taken of the extent to which public expenditure was deliberately increased in the past few years in order to meet the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances in a world recession which necessitated special measures to reflate the economy, it is indisputable that the factors responsible in the past for the increases in public expenditure will, if not checked, automatically lead to a still higher expenditure ratio in future. If the growth were to be maintained within five years it could reach a figure of 65 per cent, including local government and national expenditure. It is questionable whether present and prospective levels of public expenditure and the taxation and borrowing that is inevitably involved are compatible with the working of a mixed market economy and of the allocation of national resources best suited to meet national objectives.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, the present ratio is considered too high&mdash;there are many who think it is and their thoughts are valid&mdash;and even more so if the present ratio is considered excessive, then we will have to change this direction. This will involve difficult decisions.  It will entail the kind of unpopular decisions the Government had to take in relation to this year's budget where we reduced the initial estimates by around £500 million and where we have been lambasted by the Opposition and others because we dared to keep down the level of public expenditure. It will also entail a reduction in a number of items of current expenditure, many of which have existed for decades past and have been built into the income expectations of people but which are not necessitated today either by their own social circumstances <Col N="1734" /> or by the economic needs of the last quarter of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the current budget deficit accounted for 7.3 per cent of GNP and in 1976 this deficit will account for 7.9 per cent of GNP.  It is to be hoped that in the latter half of this year we will move back again to a significant growth path which may reduce the percentage of the current budget deficit as a proportion of GNP. The figures I am giving are according to present estimates.</P>
    <P>The corrective measures we have had to take in the economic recession of the last few years have necessitated massive deficits but this will certainly not be necessary as we move back to a world of growth, internationally and domestically.  This contrast means that just as the deficits were necessary, totally justifiable and certainly most desirable in the recession of the last two years, they must be eliminated when growth begins once again.  Like any borrowing, a deficit has to be repaid and, therefore, we would be wrong to mortgage the future of our people by having deficits which are unnecessary to the circumstances of our time.  That is why I indicated in the budget statement that it is the Government's determination to eliminate the present deficit over a three-year period because during that time we will be moving back into a period of most significant growth which will make it possible for us to eliminate the deficit.</P>
    <P>Today we face a problem that the world is still in comparative recession. Some economies, such as those of the United States, Japan and Germany, are accelerating once again.  However, as they are accelerating at a pace that is now much faster than they thought possible six months ago they are becoming worried and are applying the brakes.  It is extremely difficult to forecast with accuracy the developments in the next three years, and it is even more difficult to do so over the next ten years.  However, as we endeavour to prepare a national plan we have to make some assumptions in relation to the pattern of economic behaviour in the world outside and in <Col N="1735" /> our own country for the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>I have heard criticisms from the Opposition about the failure to date to produce a plan but I would direct the notice of objective and fair-minded persons to the remarks of Deputy Haughey who spoke in a sensible and adult way when he said that the production of a plan would be meaningless unless it were acceptable to the community as a whole.  He said that more important than the forecasts of the experts was the willingness of our people to commit themselves to whatever sacrifices or decisions that were necessary in order to achieve particular targets.  He was quite right in what he said and in speaking in that way he reflects entirely the Government's thinking.  That is the justification for the publication of a Green Paper which we hope to produce soon and which will spell out to our people the realities of our time and the options open to them.  Those options will involve a postponement of ambitions unless people are prepared to pay the cost of achieving them.  That may mean not achieving a level of educational standards, of housing or of industrial or farming investment unless people are prepared to pay the cost of meeting their investment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said with truth that we cannot expect the rest of the world to support us.  We cannot expect it; it would be nonsensical to do so, it would be futile and in the end we would be disappointed.  As a community we cannot continue, as we have so often tried to operate in the past, as though we can achieve all our ambitions without paying the cost. The cost is not going to be prohibitive but it will involve a little patience, a little prudence and the kind of sacrifice that any responsible parent will gladly make for the welfare of his or her child.  This means that, as a nation, we will have to put aside all the sectional bickering and all the foolishly imported class conflicts from other societies.  They are strange to our people, most of whom were not born with silver spoons in their mouths and every one of whom has <Col N="1736" /> a common interest in achieving a better Ireland and a reasonable standard of living for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what the Deputy is referring to.  No member of this Cabinet has ever criticised that noble order.  There is a fundamental need for a reappraisal of public expenditure.  We have to look at what has been achieved by the growth of public expenditure in the past.  In the last 20 years&mdash;this involves the Opposition as much as this Government&mdash;public expenditure as a proportion of GNP increased from 29 per cent to 55 per cent.  The objective of that increase was to produce jobs and to increase the number employed. What has been the end of that 20 years?  What has been the result of increasing the public sector expenditure? A decline of 3,000 people at work.</P>
      <P>Increases in the industrial and service sectors, including the public service, have been more than outweighed by the number of people leaving agriculture.  Although it might be argued that the fall in employment would have been greater were it not for increased public expenditure, it would be very difficult to justify a substantial increase in public expenditure by the results achieved in employment alone.  Far too much of the increase has gone towards redistributing resources rather than increasing them, and this is not a pattern which it would be safe for us to continue any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This conclusion gains added force when account is taken of the increased employment required to attain full employment ten years from now. <Col N="1737" /> If full employment is defined as a situation in which the unemployment rate is reduced to about 4 per cent and there is no net emigration, then an annual net increase in non-agricultural jobs of 23,000 would be required between 1976 and 1986 as compared with an annual average of 1,500 achieved in 1972 to 1975.  The greatest number ever achieved was an increase of 9,000 a year, and yet in order to get back to the rate of unemployment which we experienced in easier days we will have to generate 23,000 new jobs per year or else live with the present rate of unemployment and more, or see once again a return to the draining sore of emigration, if indeed that release, that safety valve, is available to us.  As everybody knows, there is no assurance of that now because so many of the communities to which our people traditionally went are today suffering massive unemployment themselves and there are other areas in the world where the growth of populations is so massive that peoples are leaving their homes and are going to secure their livelihoods elsewhere, and they would be in competition with our people if our people were forced to leave our shores.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in terms of gross job creation, when you take the number of people leaving the agricultural sector into account, the annual requirement could be as high as 38,000, because we may continue, as we had in the past, in this highly advanced technological age, when changes in fashions and techniques are also changing job possibilities, to face in the next ten years the creation of 38,000 new jobs per year.  That is more than four times as much as we achieved in our best year to date and as high as 25 to 30 times greater than we achieved on average in the last three years.</P>
    <P>That is the scale of the problem ahead of us and it is a pity there was not more attention given in the budget debate to the years that are ahead of us than to the temporary reaction, which there inevitably is, to the ups and downs of the current budget.  That is the problem that faces the country <Col N="1738" /> and we have not yet as a community even started to think about it.  The Government have been endeavouring to draw people's attention to it because it is a scale of the challenge that faces us and the sooner we take it up the better.</P>
    <P>How do we face this problem, how do we meet the cost of doing it, how do we provide the sustainable jobs, the investment necessary to create the employment opportunities and at the same time provide a social structure which is inevitable if our population is increasing? That again is a problem to which too little attention has been paid, but the problem of providing the resources cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The taxation and GNP ratio has increased from 25 per cent to 36 per cent in the last ten years.  About 80 per cent of income tax receipts comes from wage and salary taxpayers.  It is reasonable to assume, and no reasonable person can deny it, that the limit of direct taxation has been reached.  It is unarguable that the scope for further increase in the rates of any taxes is limited and even to the envious I should like to point out that even if the top rate of income tax of 77 per cent was to be increased to 100 per cent&mdash;there is nobody daft enough to suggest that&mdash;it would yield only £2 million.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have clearly touched the limit of taxable capacity as far as direct taxation is concerned, and despite the increase in direct taxation, indirect taxation still accounts for a relatively high proportion of total tax receipts.  Indeed, as a percentage of GNP, the Irish figure is much the highest in the Community.  The heavy reliance on taxes on beer, spirits, tobacco and petrol and the fact that one-third of our personal consumption is exempt from VAT, limit the room for increasing direct taxation.  We have had to increase indirect taxation, we have had to increase the excise taxes on the old reliables and the non-essentials to the levels we did in this budget because we as a Government deliberately had taken taxation off foodstuffs, off clothes, footwear and oral medicines.  We do not apologise to anybody for doing that.  If we had not done that we would not have had to <Col N="1739" /> increase the tax levels on fur coats and on motoring and on the other items which are still subject to VAT. We could have left the injustice that Fianna Fáil believed in and which some of their spokesmen have said they will restore if they get back to office&mdash; that they will put VAT back on food again.  That is not our policy and no matter what difficulties we may face we do not believe that the necessities of life should be taxed.  Fianna Fáil not only believed they should be, but actually ensured that they were.</P>
    <P>As regards capital resources, our national debt now represents 70 per cent of our GNP.  It is among the highest in the world, although we as a country have not had to accept the burden of war debts.  Between now and the end of the decade, more than £1,000 million of national debt will mature for payment or conversion.  In 1976 public sector borrowing, which some people are arguing we should increase but we in Government are not disposed to increase, will amount to about 19 per cent of GNP as compared with 8 per cent five years ago and 6 per cent ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Our objective must be to reduce that figure rather than to increase it because if we increase it all that will happen is that more and more current taxation will have to be put aside in order to repay debts previously incurred and we could very soon end up by having to devote all our borrowing towards meeting our annual debt-servicing cost or to having hypothecate one-third or more of our tax revenue for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length on these matters because I considered it necessary to spell out these realities so that our people will not delude themselves into thinking that there are easy options ahead for them.  I heard with interest what Deputy Colley said about the link between the Irish punt and the pound sterling and generally I find myself in agreement with his conclusions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with his criticism of Senator Halligan or others who believe that this issue should be openly and maturely debated. We have nothing to lose by discussing this&mdash;at one time it might have caused panic but nowadays the strength of our economy, the capacity of this country to look after its own affairs independently of Britain, our EEC membership, the much broader base which we now have under this Government for our external reserves, allow us to discuss this problem in a sensible way.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, the material question is not whether we sever the link with sterling but, if we do sever the link, what will we do afterwards? Will it be a revaluation or a devaluation of the Irish £?  Naturally when the £ sterling has fallen below the two dollar level this leads to renewed questioning of the one-for-one link between the Irish £ and sterling.  I want to assure the House and the country that this matter is under constant and mature scrutiny by myself, by my Department and by the Central Bank. There are a number of basics that are inescapable and that are overlooked, I am afraid, whenever people react to the fluctuations of the international money market.</P>
      <P>A revaluation of the Irish £ would not be feasible unless and until we had a pay and incomes pause implemented and unless and until it was seen both at home and abroad that incomes moderation was succeeding in reducing both the rate of inflation and the increase in unit wage costs below those of Britain and the other countries with whom we trade.  The usual conditions for a revaluation of currency are that one's balance of payments is in credit, that it has an excess of exports over imports and that it has a lower rate of inflation than the people with whom it trades. None of these conditions operate in relation to Ireland at the present time except that, as Deputy Colley said, in relation to some of these we are in a healthier condition than Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The orthodox practice is that devaluation becomes necessary if inflation is higher, production costs are <Col N="1741" /> higher and if there is an excess of imports over exports.  That situation does not exist in Ireland at the present time.  But, even if the preconditions for exchange rate change did exist, it is unlikely that exchange rate policy could make any dramatic contribution to overall economic policy and certainly nothing as significant as the pay pause which the Government are seeking.</P>
    <P>A revaluation of the Irish £ at the present time would have adverse effects on output and employment in the economy.  There certainly has been, as we know, a decline in the value of sterling of about 32 per cent compared with the exchange rate set in December, 1971.  The reason for that continuing fall in sterling against other world currencies has been the failure of Britain to reduce its rate of inflation to the rate experienced by other countries and, in particular, by the United States and Germany.  The fluctuations in the market in the last week are not entirely related to this particular aspect but fundamentally and over the longer period that is the reason for the fall off in sterling.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that if there were a severance of the link maybe the circumstances of Ireland might dictate a devaluation of the Irish £.  In certain circumstances that certainly would be true and, if we start behaving here with the prudence and wisdom which our circumstances require &mdash;in other words, if we moderate our income demands and improve our competitiveness, and if we bring down our costs&mdash;then we can answer the desire that many of us feel to sever the link and have our own independent currency.  But you cannot sever the link until we put our own economic house in order.  The fall in the value of the £ affects both the cost of servicing foreign debt and the total size of the debt.  The cost in 1976 of servicing government foreign debt outstanding at 31st December, 1975, is estimated at £60 million. That was based on the exchange rates prevailing in January.  Because of exchange rate changes between then and March, and on the assumption that no further net <Col N="1742" /> changes occur, the cost will rise by some £2.8 million in 1976.  Against this extra cost, if it materialises&mdash;and it cannot be said yet it will materialise because there could be further fluctuations in the £ before the end of the year which could lead to restoration of the exchange value of the £&mdash;it would have to be set against the effects on the earnings of the Central Bank, on its foreign currency holdings which, of course, will rise in terms of Irish £s and, as the major part of the foreign currency holdings of the Central Bank are now held outside sterling, there would be a gain in these holdings.  The bank's surplus income is payable to the Exchequer in the year after which it is earned.  The State bodies with foreign debts would of course also be affected.  Some of them, however, are earners of foreign currency and their income would benefit from the exchange rate changes.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that if money were raised in sterling or Irish £s the interest cost would be much greater than on foreign currency.  The yield on Irish Government stocks ranges from 9¼ per cent on stock maturing next August to 14.4 per cent on longer dated stocks.  This affords a considerable margin, about 3 per cent upwards, on Eurodollar credit facilities to meet changes in exchange rates.  The cost of six months dollars is now about 6½ per cent and this rate applies to dollar credit facilities of which there are £410 million outstanding. The external Government debt as at the end of 1975 stood at £566 million based on the exchange rates then operative.  As a result of the exchange rate movement since this figure has increased by some £25 million.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the economy, however, account must again be taken of the rise in the value of the Central Bank's official external reserves.  The non-sterling foreign exchange part of the reserve had risen to £565 million by the end of January, 1976. The increase in their value, therefore, would be of the same order of magnitude as the increase in the size of <Col N="1743" /> the Government's foreign debt so that the overall effect on our economy is neutral.  The foreign debt of the State bodies has risen by some £8 million due to exchange rate movements.</P>
    <P>I thought it desirable to spell this out in detail and with precision so that some misunderstandings might be avoided.  About half of our trade is with Britain and consequently that trade will not be directly affected by the recent exchange rate movements except to the extent that other suppliers to the British market will be disadvantaged as against ourselves because their goods in Britain will be dearer than they were before sterling slipped in the way it did whereas our goods will be able to maintain their present price because of the £ for £ relationship between the Irish £ and the £ sterling.  Our exports will be comparatively cheaper which will certainly help to increase their volume in the British market.  Imports will, however, be dearer&mdash;that is, imports from the non-sterling area&mdash;but this should provide an assistance for Irish manufacturers who will gain an advantage over the foreign supplier into the home market.  There is, of course, an offsetting factor in that much of the raw materials required for Irish industry has to be imported and where they originate outside the United Kingdom they will be dearer.  But we could hope to benefit from any general improvement in the British economy and such an improvement can be anticipated as a result of the recent moves in sterling.  As I said, people who believe that in the long run Ireland's best interests are in severing the £ for £ link with sterling and revaluing the Irish £ upwards should be outspoken and determined and resolved in their own individual and collective actions in supporting the Government's call for a pay pause and prudent policies in incomes for some years to come.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions by Deputy Colley that the Government have been acting in a hamfisted way in relation to the plea for a pay pause. This is a proposition which must be totally rejected.  The Government <Col N="1744" /> have a responsibility to look after the general welfare of all the people and in exercise of that obligation the Government as far back as December last had a meeting with the social partners.  That was on 10th December, and on the day on which the Government Ministers, headed by the Taoiseach, had the meeting with the social partners when he asked in the Government's name for a pay pause at least to the end of 1976, he went on television and radio and also addressed the people of the nation through the newspapers to make this appeal. Again the Taoiseach reiterated his appeal on 17th December when he opened the Adjournment Debate before the Christmas recess.  On 19th December the trade unions said that, while they were unable to recommend at that stage the particular formula that the Government had put before them, they recognised the economic realities that faced the country and they were open to discussion, and again on 29th December when the Government met the trade unions, the same case was reiterated.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that incomes in 1976 for those who have been fortunate enough to receive the national agreement increases of 1975 will be 11 to 12 per cent higher than they were in 1975, and apart from those elements of indirect taxation which were necessary in order to meet increased levels of welfare which were demanded by our community and other essential costs, the level of increase in prices in 1976 should be of a similar order.  It may be a little more but not much more.  It is interesting to observe, as I am sure many people have observed, that within the last few days OECD anticipated that Britain, which is our main competitor and which is the community with which we are most involved financially and economically, is expected to have a 10 per cent increase in income and a 15 per cent increase in prices in 1976.  As we try to correct the imbalances of the last few years, it is not unreasonable to ask that people would make the adjustments necessary to correct the wrong trends which developed, and wrong trends <Col N="1745" /> did develop, for instance, in 1975 when pay rates rose by 28 per cent and prices by only 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government are not making an extraordinary request.  Similar requests were made by the Governments of Denmark, Britain and the Netherlands within the last few years. When the Governments' requests were responded to and when there was moderation in incomes, when a pay pause was granted, then the economies improved very significantly.  For instance, in Denmark, following a pay pause which was introduced last year, the rate of inflation was brought down from 15 per cent in 1974 to under 10 per cent in 1975, and a continued improvement is expected in 1976.  The Netherlands Social and Economic Council in 1972 recommended that wages be determined within the framework of the Government's economic objectives, and this too resulted in a very significant moderation in the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Is it not significant that these economies are now on very substantial growth paths?  This has followed directly as a result of the communal wisdom in accepting the Government's recommendation that a pay pause was the easiest, fastest and surest way to economic salvation. That is what we have argued and we believe the facts that we have produced in support of that argument are not capable of honest contradiction.</P>
    <P>In 1975 we experienced a 21 per cent increase in the consumer price index, and of that increase about 8 per cent was attributable to the income increases which we awarded ourselves.  I put very bluntly the question to the House and to the country: which would people prefer to see, an end to the crucifying increases in our inflation rates or a continuation of such increases and nominal pay increases? I think there are very few people indeed who would not opt for an end to the speed with which we have increased inflation, would not see the wisdom of having a pay pause which, by producing real reductions in the cost of living would, in the long run, have greater material benefit for individuals and would quite clearly <Col N="1746" /> substantially improve our own competitive position internationally.  If we want to safeguard the jobs that we have and to provide more jobs, they can only come out of increased exports, and competitiveness can be achieved most speedily and with least pain and difficulty by having the pay pause which the Government have been seeking.</P>
    <P>We believe our people have a right to prefer employment to nominal or even real income increases, and we believe that people who are working are anxious in these days.  We have seen in our economy and in other societies a tremendous lack of consumer confidence and investment confidence in recent years.  Even in our own environment when the rate of pay increase was 7 percentage points higher than the consumer price index, we nonetheless had a slump in consumer demand; we had a fall-off in investment, because people were afraid, people were uncertain, people were anxious.  Nothing is more destructive of human society than human fear, and this fear which has eaten into our society and which has eroded our stamina and our willpower, just as it has also hurt other communities, will remain unless and until we improve the situation by having the wit to exercise income restraint.</P>
    <P>People will have noted that the European Economic Community yesterday exhorted Ireland to exercise income restraint and have a pay pause in 1976.  I think I can fairly say that those who consider that all wisdom lies in Brussels and went there recently in order to get a decision in support of their attitude ought now to be consistent and abide by the recommendation which Brussels has recently issued.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept, nor is anybody on this side of the House, any criticism from Fianna Fáil on the issue of equal pay.  They were in power for 35 years and did not move one fraction towards equal pay.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely true. They did absolutely nothing to move <Col N="1747" /> towards equal pay, and it was left to us in a period of the worst economic recession experienced by the world in 45 years to close the gap in equal pay by 60 per cent in a period of 2½ years and to do it ahead of the target that the Commission on the Status of Women recommended.  We thought it reasonable and we still think it reasonable that people who themselves wanted to forgo their right to equal pay in order to maintain their jobs should be able to exercise that right.  There are those, however, who think that procedures are more important than survival.  I do not think that is right.  I take no comfort out of seeing somebody sinking according to the correct procedures when reasonable steps can be taken to save them from sinking.  That is what the Government suggested but, as I say, other procedures have now intervened to make that reasonable policy less achievable than it might otherwise be.  We accept that that is the world in which we now live.  All we say is that those who believe that the correct procedures should be followed should apply that in all sectors and realise that an incomes pause is the simplest and least uncomfortable way to achieve again the competitiveness which is so essential to our survival.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a tribute to Deputy de Valera for a very fair comment he made yesterday.  It was a refreshing breath of honesty from the Opposition benches.  He said that through the fault of nobody in this House or in the country, Ireland had suffered a rapid deterioration in her economic circumstances and environment in recent years.  That is the truth and our people know it.  That, I suppose, is a disappointment to the Fianna Fáil Party, because they have not been able to make capital out of the difficulties our country experienced in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great tribute to the people that they have shown their understanding of the problems.  They have realised that we in Government with a commitment substantially to improve the employment opportunities and the standard of living of our <Col N="1748" /> people, were afflicted with the most severe storm to strike this country, or indeed the rest of the world, for 45 years.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, we had to carry out continuous repairs and maintenance to the dykes to prevent the country from being flooded by the economically dangerous forces operating outside.  We have come through the worst of the storm.  There are calmer times ahead and we are moving back to a growth path that will enable the Government to resume the growth which we achieved in a dramatic way in 1973, when we took over from a Government which, unlike the rest of the world, had our economy working about 20 per cent below capacity and we brought it up to 100 per cent capacity within a few months.</P>

We did that because we increased our public capital programme in this year's budget by 27½ per cent, well above what is required to meet increases in cost, and that on top of the massive increase in the public capital programme for which this Government have been responsible and which would not have been conferred on this country if the Opposition had been in power.</P>

We have helped them by a 10 per cent increase in their benefits instead of resorting to the Fianna Fáil think-tank of cutting them by £30 million.  We do not think it is unreasonable to say to people who are better off to be patient a while and to let us come through the worst of the difficulties so that growth can again begin.  The chances of a general recovery in economic activity are now favourable.  The climate of confidence among consumers and firms is improving steadily.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised this matter last week&mdash;the problem of the emigration of young people to Britain&mdash;the Minister gave me a very comprehensive reply but towards the end of it he became somewhat political and said that it is only in the last three years under the present Government that we had net emigration, that while people went away just as many, or more, came back. This is the kernal of the whole matter. The problem of emigration is that the Government have become so complacent about it that they cease to think there is any problem.</P>
      <P>The Irish Centre in Camden Town, London, issued a report.  If anybody who reads that report becomes complacent, I suggest there is something wrong with our attitude to the problem of emigration.  The number of people who went to the Irish Centre is recorded there.  Among them were two young girls, one of them 14 years of age.  These young people are leaving because employment is so hard to obtain at the moment.  Last summer over 52,000 young people left the three stages of our educational institutions, primary, secondary and university.  We know it is impossible for the vast majority of those to get any kind of employment. They either stay at home in idleness or in the spirit of adventure they emigrate and become social casualties in the London scene or in other parts of England.  The Irish Centre report is a very comprehensive one.  I want to compliment the Irish people in that centre who are doing so much good work for our emigrants.  This is only one centre, not even the biggest one, in London.  What is happening to the young people who go to other parts of Britain and further abroad?</P>
      <P>We have to try to bring the Government to their senses in this matter and try to get them to introduce some kind of new policy.  If our young people must emigrate&mdash;I do not accept they must&mdash;for a temporary period then I suggest the Government could at least make sure that they have some kind of training, whether it is through AnCO or through extended educational services.  We have all some responsibility in this matter but the Government must bear the greatest responsibility because they are the only people with the power to curb this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's answer to my question last week was frightfully complacent. He indicated that he could not expect very much from the Government in relation to this matter. The figures given in the Irish Centre booklet contradict the Minister's suggestion that emigration is declining. Each figure given shows an increase. If we look at the figures for the number of those who went to the Irish <Col N="1753" /> Centre in London looking for accommodation we find that in 1973 the figure was 1,459, in 1974 it was 1,475 and last year it was 2,015.  The figures in this booklet do not show the actual casualties in London.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the Government to provide some kind of welfare service are practically non-existent.  Some years ago, to our eternal shame, people had to draw attention to the plight of some of the young people. The Government have promised a youth policy but we are still awaiting it.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, who are backed to some extent by the State, have continually called on the Government to produce some kind of youth policy.  We want to show our youth that we care for the future of those unemployed and that if we can provide good employment for them in this country we will do so.  We should also show them that if some of them must emigrate we will see that they are properly trained and have a good education to enable them to obtain jobs when they go to England.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago two Labour Ministers in the Government called for radical action in relation to our economic ills.  I suggest that this is the first area where radical action could be taken.  This would then ensure that our young people are given employment here if possible and that we would provide extended educational services for them.  We could very easily provide in the primary and secondary schools, as I suggested some time ago, an extra two-year period of vocational training.  We should do this in conjunction with AnCO and the educational authorities.  We all know that many young people leave primary schools at 15 years of age.  If they were given two years' extra training and paid some money during that period it would encourage them to avail of this training.  Male students leaving school at the moment get some money but the girls do not.</P>
    <P>The Government make a boast of their law-and-order policy.  I suggest it should be part of any democratic Government's job to ensure that a law-and-order policy exists.  Many of our <Col N="1754" /> neglected young people find themselves in the hands of subversives who promise them that if they succeed in their violence we will have a different country.  Some of our youth have become the victims of this terrible policy.  The Government must bear responsibility for this.  I do not want to blame the Government unfairly in this matter because I know we have all some responsibility.  However, the Government are failing our youth who are losing faith in their country and going abroad.  The Minister may say that they are coming back again. I know some of them do but many do not.</P>
    <P>We have a new type of emigration now, that is youth emigration.  Some of them have their parents consent when they leave but many of them do not.  The Minister last week criticised the parents for not exercising control. I am loath to do that because the vast majority of parents do the best for their families but when the young people are at home without jobs they cannot stop them from going away. The Government should be able to say that they will give them jobs, or that they will give them extra training so that if they must go away they will not go as hewers of wood and drawers of water but having some expertise.</P>
    <P>The British economy is depressed at the moment and this makes it all the more essential that we should keep our young people at home if possible. When the British economy was buoyant there were good opportunities for young people and many of them could better themselves in England but that is not the case nowadays.  Irish boys and girls going into the British labour market are in competition with thousands of young English, Welsh and Scottish boys and girls.  Their chance of good employment is, therefore, very much reduced.  It may be said that because we are in Opposition now we criticise.  We have always criticised the cause of emigration and tried to do something to curb it.  No doubt the Minister will tell us what the Government are doing.  Then we will see what a pitiful effort this is.  Perhaps they think there are no votes to be got from exiles and once they are gone they can <Col N="1755" /> forget about them.  Their very existence is embarrassing.</P>
    <P>If we have any faith in the future of this country we must take the radical action called for by the Tánaiste and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey.  They called for it even though they are members of the Government. They are not in Opposition now.  If they took radical action to cure our economic ills, they would get backing from the vast majority of the people.  If they sit back and say they are giving a few thousand pounds for welfare and that they will repatriate a certain number of people, that is not tackling the problem.  To tackle the problem they must provide gainful employment.  That is the first essential step.  This book which was published in November last gives our unemployment figure as 103,000, but the figure is 120,000 now.</P>
    <P>The greatest casualties in our faltering economy now are our young girls and boys who are forced to leave the country.  Some of our best go because they will not remain idle here.  Perhaps they are lost to us for ever.  They are spending their formative years in the streets of London and other British cities, the victims of a vicious social system.  We stand by and blame the parents.  This is not good enough.  We must take the radical action called for by the Tánaiste to arrest this haemorrhage of the youth of the country.  By radical action I mean providing employment and training.  Let us not fall into a complacent mood and ignore the fact that our young people are leaving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to what has been said by Deputy Moore.  I worked with a voluntary body the members of which often had to travel on the emigrant ship with our young people emigrating to Great Britain.  They inquired whether they had employment and whether anybody was waiting for them at the docks.  Such sadness and frustration. It is sad that we are now returning to that position.  The Government have a definite responsibility in this area.  On a number of occasions I have <Col N="1756" /> appealed to the Government to deal with this matter.  Nobody should say that we cannot provide some employment for our young people.  Young people could be employed on worthwhile services for the community.</P>
      <P>The week before last I put down a question asking the Minister for Labour to introduce some emergency scheme to create employment.  This year 38,000 young people will do their intermediate certificate and 48,000 their leaving certificate.  I say without fear of contradiction that very few young people can continue with their education.  Because of unemployment, parents are unable to pay for them to continue with their education.  I hope the Government realise the frustration which is building up in young people.  We hear talk of vandalism, and bank robberies, and so on.  We are encouraging this.  Imagine a young boy or a young girl walking the streets from early morning until late at night in search of employment. Imagine their frustration.  I have warned the Government.  I have warned the parents.  I have warned everybody.  This frustration is building up and will be of great danger in years ahead unless the Government are prepared to face their responsibilities. Deputy Moore pleaded with the Minister to ensure that the Department of Education will release their policy document on youth development. On a number of occasions I have asked the Department of Education to release this document.</P>

      <P>I know the terrible dangers which are building up in our young people.  I want to compliment the Irish organisations in Great Britain on their dedication and their efforts to help our young people in Great Britain.  What are we doing to help such organisations?  I would ask the Minister what he has in mind to <Col N="1757" /> help the organisations who are helping our young people and advising them.  Many of the organisations I know are trying to get our young people to continue with their education, or trying to make some provision to send them back home when they are on the streets of London with no place to go and no one to turn to.  I should like to pay tribute to them because I know the tremendous work they are doing to help our young people.  I say this because somebody must plead with the Government to deal with this matter.  We cannot turn our heads away from it.  Before it is too late I would ask the Minister to use his influence with the Government to have a definite policy to provide employment for our young people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore was good enough to say the reply I gave him was frank.  At the same time he said I was complacent in what I said.  I should like to reject that.  In that connection, may I quote what I said in reply to Deputy Moore's last supplementary. I said:</P>
      <P>During the last three years the statistical evidence is that there is not net emigration to Britain.  Certainly some are going but as many are coming back.  It is only in the last three years of this Government that net emigration to Britain has come to an end.  This does not resolve the problem.  There is still a problem of young people.</P>
      <P>These are the facts.  Net emigration on the basis of the official figures furnished by the Central Statistics Office has ceased to exist as a problem. It is important that everybody should understand that the fact that there is no longer a net outflow from Ireland, that in fact for the past three years under the Coalition there has been a net inflow, does not mean that the problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of young people leaving this country unprepared for the conditions they face in England or elsewhere does not exist.  There can <Col N="1758" /> be no complacency about this but it is right that we should see it in context. The facts are that in the five years to 1971 the total net emigration from Ireland&mdash;these are figures derived from the census so that they are absolutely accurate and reliable&mdash;were 53,000 people, or more than 10,000 per year.  It was a continuing haemorrhage of our population each year.  During the first three years of the Coalition there was a net immigration averaging just over 3,000&mdash;the figures were 2,073, 4,074 and 4,075.  From a national point of view it is important that the tide has been stemmed but it does not mean that there is not still a problem of young people leaving this country ill-prepared for the conditions they face elsewhere.  Deputy Moore was quite right to draw attention to this point.</P>
      <P>It is interesting in this connection to see the actual figures for one year in respect of which we have accurate information&mdash;that is for April, 1970, to April, 1971.  In that year during the Fianna Fáil Government there was net emigration of 4,000 but that small figure masked a gross outflow of 29,000 people, offset by a gross inflow of 25,000 people.  Of course, a large proportion were students going away for brief periods during the summer and others may have been people who were involved in long-term strikes.  It was a practice in those years when Fianna Fáil were in Government that people went to Britain to work when they were on strike.  Only a proportion of the figures given were people going to work for any length of time in Britain but the quite small figure of 4,000 masked a very large number of people who had to leave here to find work in Britain.</P>
      <P>There is a problem and Deputy Moore was right to draw attention to it.  Nonetheless, Fianna Fáil are in no position to criticise the Government for failure to deal with the problem of emigration in view of the fact that there was no year when they were in office when there was not a substantial net emigration.  Since the Coalition took office there has been a net immigration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is useful to draw attention to the problem.  We know that there are real problems and the report indicates their gravity.  From a national point of view, the fact that more people are returning to Ireland than are leaving is good but it still leaves a real difficulty and some of the comments in the report should be taken to heart by all of us.  They reflect the failures of our society over the last 20 years, and we know who was in Government for most of that period.  There is the problem of young people leaving the country who are illiterate.  As the report states:</P>
      <P>Many boys who were interviewed for jobs were sent back to us because, for example, they were unable to read the labels on the guests' luggage at hotels.</P>
      <P>That is the heritage we have from a long period of Government during which educational problems were neglected.  It is a serious problem.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of psychiatric illness.  Reference was made in the report to the remarkable increase in respect of psychiatric illnesses for which it was difficult to account.  The disorders include a variety of depressive and schizophrenic states and psychoneuroses. The point was made that three cases came to light during the year where people were discharged from institutions here without notification to their immediate relatives.  They were encouraged to go to London with vague directions about contacts there. In one case they were brought by the police, and in two other cases by the railway police, to the attention of the centre.  This is not good enough.  It is a problem we must tackle to make sure it does not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the problem of single mothers and this is a matter our society has not tackled adequately. However, in the last few years there has been a realisation of our duties to people who find themselves in this position.  That realisation is reflected in the Government's policy to provide allowances for single mothers, something that was long overdue.  The <Col N="1760" /> concern shown by the Hierarchy at their current meeting at Maynooth with regard to this problem, and their concern to change the climate of opinion so that young girls who find themselves in this situation will not feel compelled to leave out of fear of the attitude of their families, friends and society, is a most encouraging development.  It will help, together with what the Government have done in this matter, to diminish this very serious problem.  It is all the more serious now because of the growing propaganda in favour of abortion and the increasing number of young people who are deluded into seeking this solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>There are these social problems in our society and we should not blink at them.  They need to be tackled and Deputy Moore was right to draw attention to a report which highlights the problems.  The mere fact that we have reversed the tide of emigration does not resolve the social problems. There are many individuals who still have to emigrate.  They may have to do so only for a period but during that time they may find themselves in grave difficulties because we have not prepared them adequately for the situation they are facing.</P>
    <P>The problem is one that may be somewhat aggravated at present in Britain by anti-Irish feeling and this is referred to in the report.  It mentions two organisations that complained about the so-called limitless social security and special privileges allegedly available to Irish citizens.  It refers more directly to the question of feeling against Irish people and it makes it clear that this has been intensified by the political activities of the IRA which have certainly made life much more difficult for Irish people in Britain.</P>
    <P>We have to face this problem.  I mentioned in the House the other day the kind of action we were taking to deal with it and it may be worth while to recapitulate these points.  We have a repatriation scheme funded by the Department so that people who find themselves without resources can be brought back to their families in Ireland.  This operates on a quite significant <Col N="1761" /> scale and any funds necessary are made available by the Government.</P>
    <P>There are grants to emigrant bureaux in Ireland which advise persons proposing to emigrate to Britain. These bureaux do very useful work and it is important that they be assisted.  Our staff in the London embassy are available for assistance and advice and the National Manpower Service of the Department of Labour assist by advertising among Irish emigrants in Britain about job openings here.  This is increasingly important because during this period when net immigration rather than emigration is the pattern a growing number of people are coming back to this country to take up jobs.  It is important that when jobs are available here that Irish people in Britain should be alerted to them and should have an equal chance with those who have remained at home.  The fact that they had to emigrate because of deficiencies in our society should not deprive them of the chance of finding out about jobs here and applying for them.  The work we do in this regard is important.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of what happens when people return here and in this connection there is a scheme for the resettlement of emigrants.  It provides very effective benefits for those returning permanently to Ireland. However, I do not think we have resolved this problem completely because there are still problems with regard to housing.  I am sure Deputy Moore is familiar with the problem of people returning here who cannot get accommodation until a certain period has elapsed.  The Dublin Corporation, of which the Deputy is a member, are looking at this problem to see if they can alleviate the somewhat stringent terms that apply in these cases.  There have been some instances where mothers with families have come back here where the father has deserted them and they have to lodge in terribly overcrowded conditions with their in-laws.  They have to wait for quite a time before they are entitled to go on the corporation housing list.  There are some things that we <Col N="1762" /> and the local authorities can do to help with the resettlement of those people.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of whether extra assistance is required in London by way of social welfare officers&mdash;perhaps Irish social welfare officers assisting social welfare officers in Britain.  At the moment we are examining this matter to see if such a need exists and whether such people would be useful.  If so, the Government will take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with these matters but that is at the British end of the problem.  Deputy Moore and Deputy Wyse are right to say that we have to tackle it at this end also.  We must try to ensure that jobs are available here. We have not figures for 1975 but we have them for 1974.  From the Department of Labour survey which covered 84 per cent of the 1974 school leavers, we know that only 3 per cent had to emigrate in the first year of the greatest economic crisis the western world has faced in half a century.  That is a remarkable figure and it shows the extent to which we are providing employment here.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Moore and Deputy Wyse pointed out, the problem can be resolved. Training courses provided by AnCO involved training for 7,000 people in 1975 and this year it will be 9,000.  There is also the new community youth training programme and a pilot scheme was inaugurated in the eastern region in 1975 for 100 persons.  We hope to increase that to 1,000 in 1976. This is action by the Government, action on the lines advocated by the Deputies opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>After only three years in Government we have been able to reverse the overall tide.

I am grateful to him for having raised the matter because it is a serious problem and it would be <Col N="1764" /> quite wrong if there were any suggestion of complacency on the part of the Government in regard to this problem.</P>
