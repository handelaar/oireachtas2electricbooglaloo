      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 10: In page 9, subsection (2), line 27, &ldquo;(at the time of the making of the order or at any time thereafter)&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;person who&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> The purpose of this amendment is to put beyond doubt that an attachment of earnings order will be effective against second or subsequent employers without the need for a new order to be made in each case.  It was always the intention that when an attachment order was made against employer A, and the employee left to take up work with employer B, the order would be effective against employer B.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 22: In page 15, after subsection (6), the following subsection inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Where, by reason only of an order under subsection (1) of this section, a person is not residing at a place during any period, he shall be deemed, for the purposes of any rights under the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1931 to 1971, the Statute of Limitations, 1957, or the Rent Restrictions Acts, 1960 and 1967, to be residing at the place during that period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to section 22 which is the section giving the District Court power to exclude a violent spouse from the family home.  The amendment provides that his period of exclusion shall not break any period of possession or occupation that he might have been enjoying for the purpose of establishing rights under the Landlord and Tenant Acts, the Rent Restrictions Acts or the Statute of Limitations.  The amendment provides that if he is excluded by reason of an order of the District Court, any rights that have been accruing to him under those Acts will not be affected. If the position were to be otherwise, the wife and the rest of the family could be prejudiced in so far as the rights of the husband are concerned under the statutes in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>Section 23: In page 15, line 28, &ldquo;£40&rdquo; be deleted and &ldquo;£50&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    <P>These amendments are for the purpose of meeting a point raised originally in this House and raised again in the Seanad, namely, that the amounts that can be awarded by the District Court are arbitrary.  There is a limit of £40 per week in respect of a spouse and of £10 per week in respect of each dependent child.  Both Houses considered that, having regard to the movement of inflation, these figures might be inadequate in a few years' time.  It was suggested that power be taken by the Minister for Justice, subject to approval by both Houses, to fix by regulation the limits of the District Court's jurisdiction.  I am advised that there is a constitutional problem involved in such a procedure and that it would not be safe to adopt it.  However, in order to meet the apprehension expressed in both Houses, I introduced this amendment in the Seanad to raise to £50 the amount of maintenance that may be awarded in respect of the spouse and £15 in respect of each dependent child.  I do not believe that there will be any doubt that these maxima will take care of the vast majority of cases coming before the District Court for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments.  I am glad the Minister, as he said, has been able to meet the wishes of Members of both Houses. While the increases which are now incorporated in the amendments are generous in the present year, with inflation running as it is, would the Minister possibly consider keeping an eye on that section of the Bill and if it is necessary come before the House with an amendment to increase the amounts?</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Redundancy Contributions (Variation" RHead="of Rates) Order, 1976: Motion">
    <Title>Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1976: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1976,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 10th March, 1976.</P>
      <P>As and from 5th April, 1976, it is proposed to effect an increase of 20p in the present rates of redundancy contributions and the draft order is for the purpose of effecting this increase. The increase will be apportioned as follows: 12p on the employer and 8p on the employee.  The new rates of redundancy contribution will, therefore, be 38p in aggregate for a male worker and 37p in aggregate for a female worker.  The employer will carry 25p or two-thirds of this rate and the worker's share will be 13p and 12p respectively for a man and a woman.</P>
      <P>The social welfare stamp includes elements in respect of social insurance, health, occupational injuries and redundancy contributions and the ordinary stamp for a male worker will be £6.49 from 5th April next.  The redundancy element comprises less than 6 per cent of that face value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1975 an income of approximately £4.5 million was derived by the redundancy fund from redundancy contributions.  This income was not sufficient to meet the demands on the <Col N="557" /> fund and it became necessary to rely on Exchequer borrowings to help in financing the fund's statutory operations. Up to the present repayable advances totalling £4.18 million have been made by the Minister for Finance to the fund.  The new contribution rates are designed to repay these advances while dealing with continuing redundancies.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the large scale borrowings from the Exchequer have to do with the scale of redundancies in 1975 and the increased demand made by unemployed workers for redundancy weekly payments.  Notwithstanding a decrease in the rate of notification of redundancies this year to date&mdash;they are being notified at a rate of about 13,500 per annum as compared with 19,000 last year, so there is a decrease in the number of redundancies being notified&mdash;the present income of the fund is inadequate to deal with the existing levels of redundancy.  I ask this House, therefore, to approve of the increases outlined in order to restore solvency to the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On my party's behalf we intend to oppose the increase in redundancy contributions as imposed by this order.  We do so for very many good reasons.  First, we are concerned about the approach there has been to redundancy as distinct from work creation, productive jobs, retaining of jobs and the efforts to create new jobs.  An increase of this magnitude&mdash;when I refer to magnitude I refer to the percentage increases involved&mdash;brings hardship to everybody.  In the case of the employer his contribution now goes from 13p to 25p, an increase of almost 100 per cent.  In the case of the male employee it goes from 5p to 13p, an increase of almost 200 per cent, and in the case of the female employee it goes from 4p to 12p, an increase of a full 200 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases of those magnitude reflect the inadequacy of this Minister and the inadequacy of the Government to handle the economic situation facing us.  It is the easiest step that one can take to rely forever on <Col N="558" /> continuing payment from one fund or another fund.  The time comes when a halt has to be called here.  Who is now being asked again to compensate financially for the many mistakes made by the Government and the many failures by the Government to save jobs?  It is the working person and the employer.  When one listens in the House and elsewhere to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare talking about the privileged classes I have no doubt that as far as he and his colleagues in the Labour Party are concerned the privileged classes are the people who are still in employment.  Every increase is a direct charge on them, a direct attack on them for the inability of the Government to tackle the most serious problem facing us, that of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We are told that in 1975 19,000 redundancies were notified by employers compared with about 11,000 in 1974.  These figures tell their own story.  I am sure I do not have to spell out in detail the serious implications here.  It is frightening to think that in 1975 19,000 were notified.  I feel particularly concerned that in very few cases were positive steps taken to prevent many of those redundancies. It is becoming easier all the time for employers and management to use this fund as a means to an end.  We have throughout the country, in almost every area, firms who want to cut back and employers encouraging the older people particularly to avail of this fund and create redundancies.  This is fine but by doing this these employers and managers are closing a gap to opportunity and because of the availability of it it helps employers to reduce the numbers at work.  While I have no objection to the payment being made, the problem created is that there are no replacements for very many people in many industries in many areas.</P>
    <P>One could go on at length in that vein.  We are now told that the solvency of the fund is in question.  If that is so, one body of people must bear responsibility for it.  They are the people who have been handling <Col N="559" /> the fund, and handling it so miserably for the past three years.  At times charges are made that there is a certain amount of inefficiency about the handling of the fund, and that certain loopholes are there to be availed of by people if the inspectorate are not on their toes.  Recently we have seen carelessness in the Department of Social Welfare with certain documentation.  I hope the Minister is absolutely satisfied there are no loopholes within the working of this fund to be availed of by people to abuse the fund at the expense of others who are genuinely and legally entitled to redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>When this fund was first set up by a Fianna Fáil Minister, and when the Redundancy Act was first introduced, the intention was to cover jobs which would be lost.  At no stage was it ever envisaged that in one year we would have 19,000 redundancies.  The Minister said that in 1975 approximately £4.5 million was paid into the fund.  He went on to say that up to the present time repayable advances totalling £4.8 million were made by the Minister for Finance to the fund and the new contributions were designed to repay the advances while dealing with ongoing redundancies.  The Minister's Department are constantly charged with delays in the payment of redundancy benefits.  I have ample evidence of this and I am sure he has also.</P>
    <P>This is caused by a number of factors.  It is caused by the huge number of people becoming redundant&mdash; 19,000 in 1975.  It is caused by the dictatorial attitude of the Minister for Finance who will not give the Minister adequate staff to cope with the rising problems.  In fact, he cannot afford to give him adequate staff.  The reality is that the structures are crumbling because of mismanagement.  The people who are asked to pay for this mismanagement are the working people of Ireland.  The price of the stamp has now gone to £6.47, between employers and employees.  This is an enormous increase.</P>
    <P>We have become so used to very big increases that an increase of 8p or 12p is small.  Daily and weekly we are <Col N="560" /> having an increase of 8p or 12p.  These increases are all aimed at the one body of people.  The last straw breaks the camel's back.  The people who have been completely neglected over the past few years are the workers who have seen their standard of living continue to drop and their incomes being eroded by increases in prices on Mondays and Tuesdays and more increases on Thursdays. In this way, their standard of living has been whittled away.  This has become a fact of life.  Increases are absolutely uncontrolled.</P>
    <P>What would be the attitude of the National Prices Commission if a request was made for an increase in the cost of a service or commodity of 100 per cent?  In the case of a male employee the figure was 18p.  Now it goes to 38p.  That is an increase of more than 100 per cent.  What would be the attitude of the National Prices Commission if an industry or a company asked them to sanction an increase of more than 100 per cent?  This brings me back to the inability of people not only to provide for the future but to forecast developments within our industry generally.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Labour on many occasions that we were moving out of the recession period and that we had seen an upturn in some economy far away.  First the recession was to end in 1974.  Then this date was postponed to 1975 and then to 1976.  Now I understand it is 1977.  What the Minister is saying, in fact, is that he has not got a clue what the position is or when we will get out of the recession.  I am sure he realises that his Government have taken no positive steps to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>The 19,000 redundancies reported in 1975 cover many types of industries. The textile industry has been affected on a large scale.  We pointed out at length on many occasions the necessity for some type of control on imports of cheap textiles from Third World countries.  Our efforts were constantly ignored by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He pleaded inability to do so because of our EEC entry.  I understand that controls have now been introduced which may help <Col N="561" /> to bring it within certain proportions because the value of these imports was getting completely out of hand. It is like closing the stable door after the horse has gone because for many of our textile industries it is too late.</P>
    <P>There have been many redundancies in the building industry.  The Minister for Local Government has refused to accept the fact that the building industry is in serious difficulty although there are now 23,000 unemployed there&mdash;an increase of approximately 10,000 over last year.  There are many areas where there were redundancies during the past year.  In some cases positive steps could have been taken. The extension of the premium employment programme introduced by the Minister last year, and supported by Fianna Fáil, would have been much cheaper to implement than the continued policy of the Government towards encouraging unemployment.</P>
    <P>The increase this morning is another, though smaller, attack on the people who matter most in our society at present.  They maintain the structures which help to maintain a reasonable standard of living for the underprivileged people.  The people I refer to are the working people who are continuing in employment, and the employers who provide employment opportunities.  They are the target. One wonders if this is not the long-planned ideological socialist labour policy of a party who were telling us about the socialist 1970s some years ago.  When the people told them this was not on, the attitude was: &ldquo;We will make you people suffer as soon as we can combine with somebody else to form a Government.&rdquo;  It may have been a devious plan by people within that party who have little or no concern for the working people but who are far more concerned about their ideologies.</P>
    <P>I accept that the fund has to be financed but we object to it being financed by the people who have contributed so much and who have suffered considerably as a result of the Government's mismanagement. The reasons for the increases are entirely <Col N="562" /> because of the mishandling of the fund, what it is for and what it means.  The alternatives with regard to finding the money at this stage are scarce. We were informed recently that there was a substantial balance in the pay-related fund.  When the last increase was being sought last year I asked the Minister to consider transferring it, at least temporarily.  Rather than impose an additional burden on the people, I asked that the financing be effected by a transfer from the pay-related fund, financed by a similar type of contribution from employer and employee.</P>
    <P>We oppose the Minister's proposal simply because the target is the worker and the employer, the two sections who appear to be non-acceptable and whose names are dirty words so far as the Government are concerned.  These people are our only hope of survival as a nation. I do not want to go into detail regarding the industries that will be affected.  There are very many in my city and county and there are many in Dublin.  However, an even greater tragedy are the rural based traditional industries where there are no alternatives.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach on his return from America promised us an additional 3,000 jobs.  It was a major propaganda publicity exercise.  I should love to see that number of jobs created overnight but we can produce evidence that 850 of these jobs which will be in one particular firm were decided on in October, 1975.  In the light of that we can realise how deceitful was the propaganda and publicity attaching to the Taoiseach's trip to America from beginning to end.  Those 850 jobs form a part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am anxious that Deputies would confine their remarks to the subject matter of this motion which is in respect of the rates of redundancy contributions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair will agree that it affects the subject-matter we are debating because if the 3,000 jobs were available it would spread the load and it would mean that the unemployment figures would be that much less.  The Minister referred to the drop from 19,000 to 13,500 redundancies and I presume he has taken note of the 3,000 jobs referred to.  The Minister's forecast is questionable.  He has said that redundancy notifications are at the rate of 13,500 per annum as compared with 19,000 last year.  I hope the Minister is right but we must express our concern regarding the other industries that are affected by the Government's decisions in other spheres.  We must be concerned about brewery and licensed trade workers.  We know that workers in the meat processing industry have suffered.  It is obvious that redundancy payments are a matter of concern for every employer and employee. What the Minister is proposing is absolutely unfair to the working population and we oppose it vehemently.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my opposition to this motion.  It is most untimely, coming as it does after the savage increases in the social welfare contributions, the legislation for which we passed in this House last week.  It is well known that these increases will affect employment throughout the country. They will have a serious impact on employers, on the take-home pay of employees and they will have an effect on the morale of industry, of business people and of the workers. It will mean an even greater lack of confidence by the people in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases sought are outrageous. They represent an increase of more than 100 per cent for the employer from 13p to 25p and of 200 per cent for the employee.  As it is, the increase in the social welfare contributions are having a serious effect on industry and unemployment. I know of one firm where the increases alone will cost in the region of £75,000 per annum; it will cost <Col N="564" /> the employer approximately £50,000 and the employees £25,000.  I was speaking to some of the management of the firm and to some of the trade union officials who work in this industry and they are most concerned about the situation that exists directly as a result of the increases.  We can visualise the impact of a bill for an additional £50,000 on an industry that is just carrying on in a very competitive world market.  The new rates will have an adverse effect on industrialists who were contemplating setting up factories here and those industrialists who intended expanding will also be seriously affected.  They are also bound to have a serious effect on businesses and the tendency now will be to restrict rather than expand businesses.</P>
    <P>We have had redundancies on a large scale during the past year in the building, textile, footwear and food processing industries and in those industries associated with the spin-off from agricultural produce.  This motion will result in further redundancies in those industries.  The Government, instead of increasing social welfare contributions to such a high level, should be concerned with injecting more capital into the building industry and avoiding the inevitable further redundancies.  Instead of taxing co-operatives the Government should be encouraging them.  Many of those co-operatives are in a serious financial position, one which will not be improved by this motion or the Bill which was passed last week.  It would be laughable, were it not so serious, to have a Government, in addition to taxing co-operatives, putting this further burden on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the relevancy of that matter to this motion.  The Deputy is straying very far from the subject matter of the motion which deals with an increase in redundancy contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxing of co-operatives, and the increase in the contribution for redundancy payments, are due entirely to the mismanagement of the country's financial affairs by the National Coalition and the lack of any plan or policy by the <Col N="565" /> Government.  The deficiencies in the redundancy fund should be taken direct from the Exchequer instead of placing a further burden on the employer and employees.  In asking the Minister to reconsider this I should like to point out to him that the effect of the motion will be that the employees will suffer another cut in their take home pay.  That is a serious matter at a time when delicate negotiations are taking place on workers' pay.  It is serious for any Government to bring in legislation which will reduce the take home pay of any worker by up to 65p per week.</P>
      <P>The ordinary worker is entitled to ask how he will be compensated for this.  Naturally, this will lead to more disquiet and dissatisfaction within industry and employment generally.  In introducing this measure the Government are leading the country further into financial ruin and disaster and for those reasons the Minister should reconsider the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution I intend to show the Minister the serious effect an increase in these contributions will have on workers and employers, particularly the co-operatives. The increase in these contributions, in conjunction with the imposition of a new tax on co-operatives, will mean redundancies there. The Chair has ruled that reference to co-operatives in relation to this motion is not in order but my view is that such a reference is relevant because co-operatives give employment and the effect of this motion will be that employment in co-operatives will be reduced.  I am aware of the financial position of co-operatives and I am also aware that any further burden on them will lead to unemployment. We are concerned with keeping people in employment and it should be the aim of any Government to keep people in employment. I know the redundancy fund is necessary but there should be a contribution from some other source rather than piling it on the employer and employee all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Friends of mine who live in this <Col N="566" /> city are fed up with the increases in deductions from their pay packet that take place weekly.  They have realised that after all the deductions they would be as well off drawing unemployment benefit.  People do not want to be unemployed but it is fair to say that the most dissatisfied man at present is the man who is working. The unemployed man is fed up because he cannot get work but the worker is being scourged daily.  There is no doubt but that the increase in these contributions will step up the cost of living.  The employer must add something to the price of his goods to compensate him for the increase in the contribution.  He cannot be expected to work at a loss.  I am opposed to the increase because I know what the reaction will be.  The Labour Party are foolish to have anything to do with a motion which will impose an additional burden on the workers.  I am closely associated with workers and I know of their discontent.  Every week they find that something more is chipped off their wage packet.  They do not understand why they should have to contribute so much to help those who are unemployed.  They do not know why they should have to carry the baby when they must get up at 7 o'clock every morning to travel to work.  The employers feel dissatisfied also.  I know that we are in a recession and that we are getting it tight to keep going.</P>
    <P>Why should we have to pay?  We are daily becoming more non-competitive in world markets because we are pricing ourselves out of these markets, pricing ourselves out because employers and workers have to pay increased contributions.  I believe money should be borrowed to get people back to work.  I do not want to be misunderstood but there is not enough interest in trying to get people back to work.  An all-out effort should be made to put people into employment.  Every day I am being asked where is this money for all these increased contributions to come from.  This could be the straw that will break the camel's back.  I am not making a political football out of this.  I am merely explaining how people in the country are thinking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely in favour of the payment of redundancy money to workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own.  That they should be paid this money is both necessary and desirable. The Redundancy Payments Bill was brought in by Fianna Fáil and it is only natural, therefore, that we should be wholly in favour of these payments.</P>
      <P>We have heard a good deal about drug pushers.  We have had the price pushers in the present Government. Now we have the contribution pushers.  One day it is social welfare. The next day it is health.  Now it is redundancy.  Where will it stop?  As previous speakers have said, a variety of problems confront the unfortunate worker at the moment.  There appears to be a &ldquo;screw the worker&rdquo; campaign. Every day the numbers in employment are growing fewer.  It is a tragic situation.  The Government should be trying to restore confidence by putting people back into employment. If the people had jobs, there would be no need for redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>We have asked questions about industries that are being run down. We know that redundancies have taken place.  We know that industries which have not already closed down are on the verge of collapse.  The Ministers seem to be absolutely irresponsible in their outlook and in their efforts to cope with the problem.  I believe there is a determined effort on the part of the Government to let industry run down, to create this unemployment situation and try to solve the problem in another way.  I accuse the Government of this deliberate tactic.  There appears to be no logic in approach.  In the boot and shoe industry there have been redundancies. A Labour Minister in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs imported shoes for the Naval Service from Britain while Irish workers were drawing redundancy payments. There is no logic in that.  Those shoes could have been manufactured here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is absolutely no concern whatever for Irish workers.  The same <Col N="568" /> Minister purchased 400 pairs of sports boots for the Army.  They could have been produced here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no need for increased contributions if Government Ministers ensured that Irish workers did not become redundant as a result of their efforts.  There is industrial sabotage by the Government. They are forcing up the redundancy payments.  Deputy Fitzgerald has dealt with that aspect.  I am pointing out that most of the redundancies should not have taken place and would not have taken place were it not for sabotage by the Government and by Labour Ministers in that Government.</P>
      <P>There have been redundancies in the printing industry.  Yet the Labour Minister in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has got labels and stamps printed in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently there is an effort now to justify Irish workers <Col N="569" /> becoming redundant in order to keep the British and what are called the continental Europeans at work.  There can be no justification for making any man redundant here while, at the same time, helping to preserve jobs in other countries.  I am glad Deputy Byrne has come in to spell out Government policy in regard to redundancy. Some time ago the Department of Defence purchased Italian equipment that could have been manufactured in my constituency.  I am glad to hear now that the Government have a policy designed to make people redundant.</P>

I am merely indicating that Government Ministers are directly responsible for the creation of some of the redundancies that have taken place.  There are redundancies threatened in the Dublin docks at the moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If the affairs of the nation were handled properly, there would be no need for the increases as outlined here.  I have not dealt with quarter of the situation, and I feel I am being impeded, that this is an effort to pay people who are put in the position of being redundant through no fault of their own but through the direct fault of the Government who are now asking for an increased contribution.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his brief that there were repayable advances by the Minister for Finance of £4.18 million. The Government have handled the situation in such a way they have created redundancies deliberately&mdash; and I stress &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;&mdash;and the Minister for Finance, in order to cover up or otherwise, has funded this to the extent of £1.8 million. We are told that in 1974 there were 11,000 redundancies and in 1975 19,000 redundancies and these 19,000, as I say, were the result of ministerial action.  One does not know now whether it is a Government decision or ministerial decision, because it is altogether too confusing when one reads the papers.  I would like to know if this is a Government decision or merely a decision of a Minister. Things are so confused in recent times that we have a John Kelly decision, a Conor Cruise-O'Brien decision, a Justin Keating decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs spoke the other day.  I understand it was not a Government decision.  When are we to know when a Minister is making a statement in relation to Government policy?  I always understood that this veil of collective responsibility fell down over Ministers and when a statement was issued by a Minister each and every Minister of that Government <Col N="571" /> stood solidly behind it.  When we ask the Taoiseach about this he will say it is collective responsibility; at a later stage the Ministers concerned are brought in and reprimanded, and we are told something different.  I will have a question down to ask how Ministers can be identified as not speaking on behalf of the Government.  I am not too sure that Deputy O'Leary is speaking on behalf of all the members of the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for Labour consider a 200 per cent or a 180 per cent increase a suitable approach to the problem?  I wonder what would happen if a worker looked for a 180 per cent or a 200 per cent increase.  The Government would be making the sounds with which we are all so familiar in recent times when they admonish the people either inside or outside pubs.</P>
      <P>This Government are now falling asunder.  It is quite obvious that the price pushers have been found out at last.  They are being exposed daily in this House and outside it.  The people have lost confidence.  The Government should let the people decide in the very near future what the situation will be.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I had not the opportunity here this morning of dealing in greater depth with the redundancy problem and the reason why these contributions are necessary.  It is all too sad to think that the few people who are working are having further burdens loaded on to them day by day by one Minister or another.  If it is not Deputy O'Leary today, it is Deputy Cruise-O'Brien tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not those Ministers, it is the Minister for Transport and Power and so on.  These are the pickpockets of the seventies who are examining the purse of the housewife <Col N="572" /> and the pocket of the worker to find out how much more they can extract to cover up for their incompetence and the disaster into which they have led this nation over the last three years.  We hope the country will soon pass into the hands of responsible people who will not adopt the tactics of this Government since they assumed office, that of concealment, until now when they find that the snake has wrapped around them having failed to restore confidence and having put people on the breadline. The Government's job is to put people back to work.  Do not blame the Italians or the Japanese.  Do not blame the Hungarians, the Germans or anybody else.</P>
      <P>Again, I am not sure what Government policy is because we have so many spokesmen on various matters. I am not sure that the Bills that are now coming before this House will ever become law, because I do not think the Government will be there long enough to put them into operation. This House might break up today or maybe next week, judging by the various comments, the run for cover and the individual approaches we now see by Government members who are all endeavouring to save their own skin because they know they are on the way out and that never again will they grace this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the situation has deteriorated to the extent that it is necessary to seek additional contributions on the basis outlined here.  This must be related to something.  As Deputy Fitzgerald asked, is it related to pay increases?  Not alone had we 11,000 redundancies in 1974 and 19,000 in 1975 but the notifiable rate this year so far is another 13,500.  Where will it end?  How many will there be next year if the Minister is still in office? This is the serious situation which is facing this nation.  Will the Minister rob the worker or the housewife to cover up the blunders made in the past?  Let the suggestions made by Deputy Fitzgerald take effect.  We can guarantee that when prosperity returns under a Fianna Fáil Government we will rectify this situation. The redundancy fund will be substantial, <Col N="573" /> because we will have no redundancies. We will take the people off the dole queues and put them back to work.  We will ensure that it will not be necessary to come to this House day after day to dip further into the pockets of the Irish workers.</P>
    <P>When reading the Minister's brief it is sad to realise that not only are so many people unemployed but the terrible tragedy is that redundancies are increasing daily&mdash;we are told this year at the rate of 13,500.  One can never rely on the figures provided by the Government because they change by the hour, the day or the week. How valid is the figure of 13,500? How has this been cloaked?  Is there a veil over this which if lifted would show a much greater number?  Is this figure purely for the consumption of the Dáil and the public today?  There is a terrible tragedy facing this nation&mdash;soon everybody will be out of work or redundant and there will be no money to pay anybody.</P>
    <P>How effective will be the think tanks and the policy plans we are told about?  As Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out, the Taoiseach came back with 3,000 jobs in his briefcase.  I hope they materialise.  Three thousand jobs will be of very little use to 19,000 people who are redundant.  We should be dealing in hundreds of thousands of jobs. That is what we require to put this nation back on its feet.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and desirable that Government Ministers do not sabotage the national effort by importing for Government services items that can be made at home and which are at the moment putting people on redundancies and on the dole lines. Irish workers will never forgive the present Government, especially the Labour Party, for this.  If the Minister and the Government are concerned about Irish workers and redundancies and the possibility of putting people back into employment, I can give them an instant solution, that is, send Cosgrave to the Park today so that the people can decide for themselves and put us back into power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that workers affected by redundancies must be <Col N="574" /> given adequate payment.  In my view, we have reached a doomsday situation in this new measure.  The Government, facing growing unemployment and redundancies, have taken the easy way out by simply imposing more taxation.  I am hoping that we will soon have a radical change here, such as a change of Government. Nothing less will save this nation from continuing on the downward path towards total insolvency.  Is there anything worse than that?  In my view, the Minister is a prisoner of his own peculiar doctrinaire thinking on economics.  He should consult the employers and trade unions and say: &ldquo;Let us discuss this matter and see what can be done, and how we can put people back to work&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If people were working there would be no redundancies and therefore no need for this measure.  The Minister came here this morning with his over simple measure to impose more taxation on a dwindling work force.  The economists remind us of what happens when the law of diminishing returns starts to apply.  We are on that path here today.  The law of diminishing returns will apply because the labour force is shrinking and they will be unable to bear the burden of extra taxation.  Sooner or later the Government will have to start thinking and using whatever brain power is at their disposal to find other ways of helping people who are redundant than by taxing those still fortunate enough to be in employment.</P>
      <P>According to a newspaper this morning the Minister for Industry and Commerce is setting up what he describes as a think tank to provide 20,000 jobs a year.  That reminds me of the call from some of the Minister's colleagues for the new economic task force or the new social order. Last week the European Commissioner, Dr. Hillery, put forward a very sound proposition on how we can absorb our thousands who are unemployed. The people are waiting for a lead from the Government to discuss the matter, to look at the 116,000 unemployed, the men who are losing faith because they are still not employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> I have no doubt that we will pass this motion which will enable redundant workers to receive payments. Because the coffers are now empty, this will be done at the expense of those who are still working.  Not one bit of original thinking has come from the Minister.  It is easy to impose extra taxation but the time has come when somebody must shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;, if we are not to stand by and see the country go into bankruptcy.  I am not such a hidebound thinker that I would not consider going outside the orthodox thinking of the Government. There are ways to get people back to work; one is by offering them gainful employment.  The unemployment benefits now paid help keep a man and his family off the breadline.  The majority of the unemployed are only too willing and anxious to get back to work and make some return to society. They are deprived of this right and will continue signing at the labour exchanges in greater numbers.</P>
    <P>No action is being taken by the Government that would give these people any reason to be hopeful.  We are speaking of people who have had jobs but lost them, not of those who have never had the opportunity of working.  Of the 53,000 young people who left the three levels of education last year, only very few were able to obtain employment.  Recently I spoke with the father of a young boy who, having studied for his leaving certificate, asked his father where he might obtain employment, but the father had to answer that there was no hope of employment.  Britain and ourselves are the sick men of Europe.  While other member countries may have their problems, they are making every effort to provide again full employment for their people. There is no light on the horizon so far as we are concerned.  It would be a different matter if the Government were in a position to tell us that they had plans for restoring employment to 10,000 or 20,000 people.  While the Minister may put forward statistics to disprove what we say, he knows that we are on the slippery slope towards insolvency and that the type of measure proposed here is merely <Col N="576" /> a token social action and not in any way constructive in regard to the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>We believe that the vast majority of unemployed are anxious to get back to work.  There are those who allege that because the social services are so good they have the effect of discouraging people from seeking employment, but we know that the loss of employment is a tragedy for honest decent people. I have had experience of signing at an employment exchange and I know how demoralising this can be.  This Government are not doing enough in the field of creating the conditions in which people could be offered gainful employment.  They are prone to taking a lead from the UK Government in regard to fashions in thinking and in general Government policy, but it would be well to consider the danger signs that are apparent in Britain now.  For instance the hunger marchers from the north of the country are heading south again.  In one area last week it was reported that the police took strong measures against those marchers, but perhaps the police were aggravated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Government heed the warning signs, matters will become much worse.  I wonder if the Minister read the statement made earlier this week by Deputy O'Malley when he warned of what may happen unless matters are rectified.  There was the report, too, of the university dons in England of what may happen if circumstances do not improve.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that this measure is justified because redundant workers must be looked after. They must be looked after, but this House should not be satisfied merely to pass a Financial Resolution for the purpose of increasing taxation.  The Minister would get much more thanks from redundant workers if, instead of providing for increased maintenance allowances, he could offer them the prospect of being able to return to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Our redundancy legislation was introduced because we foresaw a time when during certain periods people would become redundant, but for the past three years we have continued to increase the contributions.  This pattern cannot continue.  Either the Government must put forward concrete plans to improve the employment situation or they must hand over the running of the country's affairs to a party who have the ability to bring about improvements.  I admit that during Fianna Fáil's terms in office there was unemployment, but we did not try to solve the problem by increasing taxation on those who were working. Rather did we strive continuously to increase the productivity of the nation. Influenced by the teaching of a de Valera, a Lemass or a Lynch, the people had reason to believe that eventually we would create a society that would offer them a living.  The parties now in office are adding continuously to the despondency of the people.</P>

      <P>It is the duty of each one of us to be here this morning for this very important discussion but it is sad that we are here for the purpose of improving a Bill that is designed to give handouts to the thousands of unemployed men and women.  The Minister knows that this motion this morning will bring about further redundancies. It will hit the small industry, the very backbone of the industrial arm of the country. I worked in a small industry and I am fully aware of the impact this increase will have on such people. Last week the Minister received a deputation of workers from a Cork shoe factory who walked from Cork to Dublin to display their willingness and desire to keep their industry going.  Surely that must be some indication to the Government of the willingness of the people to build their industries and to ensure employment even with little or no response from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time the Minister for Labour and the Government came into the House with a policy for creating jobs and restoring confidence <Col N="578" /> in the Irish people.  This is of vital importance.  Recently we had increases in the social welfare stamp and this morning we are asking for increases in the redundancy stamp.  Redundancy was never designed for this.  It was only to help workers over a lean period.  Now it seems to have become a permanent part of social welfare benefits.  I know of the dangerous frustration that is building up among the workers.  Many of them just get up in the morning, go along to the Labour Exchange, sign for their payments and return home.  I am sure the Minister agrees with me that it is dangerous to have this type of frustration building up among the people.</P>
    <P>A fortnight ago I asked the Minister for Labour a question regarding the 50,000 young people who completed their leaving certificate examination last year and asked him to give me some statistics on the number who got work and the number who returned back to education.  Unfortunately very few can now return to education because of the very high cost and because of the widespread unemployment in the country at the moment.  One cannot say that this side of the House are not playing their part.  Last week I pleaded with the Minister for Transport and Power to invest money in areas where there are employment potentials.  I pleaded with him to invest £9 million in the Cork Harbour regional development plan where we are guaranteed returns from such an area as far as employment is concerned.  The Government must look at areas like this where there is this kind of potential rather than ask the workers to bear further burdens. This morning we are inflicting a further hardship on the industrialist and the worker to try and help pay for the thousands of fellow workers walking the streets.</P>
    <P>How long can those who are fortunate to be in employment continue to make this contribution?  The Minister must be fully aware of the many protests by the fortunate people who are working against any further burden on their pay packets every week. There is unnecessary delay in finalising the many appeals before the redundancy <Col N="579" /> appeal board.  If we are sanctioning money this morning and if there are unnecessary delays in finalising the large number of appeals before the board, the Minister should give this matter very serious consideration in order to avoid further hardship on those who are made redundant.</P>
    <P>Every Member of the House should urge the Government to seek out areas where there is employment potential rather than invest millions of pounds, money that has been borrowed and which has to be paid back, in things that the workers do not want and that the nation does not want.  This money should be invested in areas where we can give employment to our people so that they can come home every week with something substantial in their pay packets rather than to have to depend on handouts of money that has been borrowed.  We cannot even look to Europe to borrow money to pay our unemployed.</P>
    <P>Surely the Cabinet should sit down and look at their philosophy at the moment, where there are handouts week after week to unemployed people?  The Government should know that there are very definite areas where employment should be given to the people.  Let us restore confidence in our people.  Let the Government have confidence in our people.  Let them be prepared to invest in our people and invest in industry, which is the most important thing in the nation at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say, initially, that I will resist the temptation of allowing my imagination to visualise the position if this morning the situation were reversed and Deputy G. Fitzgerald were sitting on the opposite benches as Minister for Labour and the present holder of that office were sitting here in Opposition.  I am visualising what the attitude of the present Minister would be and basing that on my experience of him in Opposition and the ease with which he could solve every problem whether economic or social.  I recollect his special presumed expertise in the <Col N="580" /> matter of employment, matters connected with redundancy, and anything which had a kinship with what he would have described as his interest in and his knowledge of the workers.</P>
      <P>I recollect, too, the swiftness with which he would dismiss the hand of Fianna Fáil as being incapable of governing and, because of that, he would assert there was no obligation on him to assist them in any predicament which might arise.  He would establish as a political principle that there was no question of the Opposition complementing the Government and that the Government alone had the absolute responsibility to solve any problem which arose.  I suppose I should admit that, up to that point, he had no experience of being in Government. In all charity one could excuse him and say that perhaps his faith in himself was such that he could solve all the problems of this nation and other nations.  I am allowing that charity to him even though I criticise myself for so doing.  Accordingly, as far as possible I will make positive comments on the motion we are discussing.</P>
      <P>This Government and the Minister for Labour have brought the country into an economic quagmire, a situation which, in fairness to them, they all admit.  How can the Minister say he is making any contribution towards solving the appalling unemployment problem by imposing additional taxes on the employers and the workers? That is what this motion represents. The position is bad enough without making it worse.  Does the Minister not know that employers are put to the pin of their collar to survive? Daily we have business after business forced to retire from the scene.  They are crying out for some form of incentive, or inducement, or encouragement, and here we have a measure from the Minister which he must accept worsens the position of the employer. I will not develop that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look now at the case of the employee.  This year the Minister for Finance based his budget on the premise that there would be a pay pause.  The Minister for Labour should advise the Minister for <Col N="581" /> Finance that you cannot aspire to a pay pause when day by day, and hour by hour, you are increasing the cost of living of employees.  The Minister for Labour is asking ladies to pay an increase in the stamp of from 4p to 12p and male workers to pay an increase in the stamp of from 5p to 13p.  In certain times that increase might seem rather small but, having regard to the narrow margins operating at the moment, the Minister should realise it will be an element in the case for increases that will be made by trade unions with which he is so familiar and to which he was attached for so long.</P>
    <P>I have been presented with the difficulty of assessing where this Government are going, or where they think they are going.  This is not a Government in the true fashion. There are no elements of the teamwork which ordinarily would be expected from a Government.  Day after day we get ample proof of each one in his own right persuing elements of dictatorship, each one doing his own thing.  There are verbal admissions of overall responsibility.  They are, unfortunately for the country, articulate and eloquent men, who have the gift of the gab in making any case.  When one looks at the totality there is evidence that in perfect disharmony the Left is not prepared to let the Right know what it is doing, and <i>vice versa.</i> Because of that, we have unparalleled unemployment at the moment, and it is developing.  It is about the only thing that is developing under this Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give a sermon on unemployment, but it is no harm to refer to the proverb and adage about what the devil will do with idle hands, or to what the Lord said about how a person should live during his lifetime &mdash;the quotation with which we are all familiar about&mdash;the sweat of one's brow.  That philosophy reminds us of the need, apart from the desirability, for each person to be gainfully employed during his or her lifetime.</P>
    <P>Each normal person is searching for that natural satisfaction which derives from being gainfully employed. Each person is searcihing for that sense of fulfilment that comes <Col N="582" /> when he realises he has a contribution to make to society.  This Government stand condemned for denying that right to so many people.</P>
    <P>At any level unemployment is unwelcome and is socially undesirable but the greatest tragedy is in respect of the young men and women.  Tens of thousands of young boys and girls are leaving second-and third-level education full of talent and idealism, having spent long arduous years applying themselves to education.  This should normally guarantee them jobs but this does not happen.</P>
    <P>What do this Government offer them?  They offer idleness, disillusionment and shattered dreams.  All of us must fear the reaction that, understandably, will ensue as a result of this frustration and as a result of the ineptitude of the Government to follow up what was prepared for them by their predecessors with regard to developing the economy to the point where it could absorb all of those people.</P>
    <P>All of us know that in 1969 and in the early seventies Fianna Fáil had advanced the economic wellbeing of the country to the point where labourers, technicians and professional people were returning from other countries to fill a need that could not be satisfied at home.  Having planned the economy, Fianna Fáil looked at the educational system. They saw that at primary level the curricula should be updated and that at secondary level there should be proper employment of the resources that existed to break the traditional competition that had occurred between secondary and vocational education.  In pursuit of that aim they established community and comprehensive schools and regional colleges.  All this was necessary to satisfy the economic programme which had been planned and which was being executed.</P>
    <P>During those years the present Minister for Labour criticised the Government for the manner in which they were operating and for what he claimed was the lack of perfection in our economic structure. He told Fianna Fáil that if they could be removed from the scene he <Col N="583" /> and his colleagues would come into office and lead us on to perfection. Let us consider what has happened.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time that a Government like the present one have destroyed the dream of young Ireland. All of us know that the Coalition Governments have a record of double failure and we now have the hat-trick.  In the past fate ensured that they were succeeded by Fianna Fáil who had a double success and, hopefully, we will have a hat-trick of successes.  My fear is that the country will have reached a point where it will be impossible for any Government, whether party or national, to retrieve this situation and the longer this Government remain in office the greater will be the difficulty of retrieving the situation.</P>
    <P>We hear much talk from the Minister for Industry and Commerce about our great wealth.  I accept that a person could share what I regard as the &ldquo;bingo&rdquo; philosophy, of hoping that wealth will emerge from the ocean and from the land.  We understand it is there but it will not be produced without a certain effort and at a price.  I believe in looking at what is there.  I believe in assessing what I can see and in utilising that resource.  If there is any untapped resource in this country about which there is certainty it is labour.  Our labour force is the greatest unemployed resource we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary situation where ostensibly we seem to be concerned about applying ourselves to hidden wealth and hidden resources while at the same time we are neglecting and abusing the resource with the best potential we know of.  In respect of that neglect, I accuse the Minister for Labour.  I accuse him in particular in respect of the measure which he now introduces.  I am sure he is conversant enough with the situation and fully aware of the sensitivity of industry at present to know that the measure he is introducing will not create one new job.  On the contrary, he knows as well as I that it must add further to the accumulation <Col N="584" /> of this untapped resource we have.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of the days when the boot was on the other foot in this House&mdash;shortly there will be no boot on any foot and it will be difficult here, or anywhere else, to recognise any one thing from another.  Certain elements in the Government have set about in their prodigal son philosophy to destroy the real wealth accumulated here over the years. That having been done, they are now endeavouring to pick-pocket the wealth of other nations, and, temporarily, they are getting that accommodation. They talk about the distribution of wealth without accepting the counter-balance, that to distribute anything one must first create it.  They are not concerned about that; they are not concerned about the creation at all; there is too much hardship involved there and it has not the same ephemeral popularity as the other.  They are succeeding very well in reaching a situation where the only true thing in respect of the distribution of wealth is that everyone will have so little that there will be equality.  There will not be anything for anybody.</P>
    <P>In similar circumstances, when the Minister was in Opposition, he was a great man for the emergency call. He wanted to declare an emergency in housing, an emergency in health and an emergency on the economic scene.  He is now in the position of having made his own very substantial contribution to the appalling emergency in which we find ourselves today.</P>

      <P>The measure, as the Chair <Col N="585" /> remarked repeatedly during this wandering debate, concerns the necessity of improving the funds coming into the general redundancy fund to make it solvent because of extra demands made on the funds before they are available.  Members of the Opposition are opposing this measure.  It is unclear why they are opposing it but I do not wish to wander after the members of the Opposition who spoke down the many roads of their imagination. The last speaker made a speech which was typical of the kind of contribution we had this morning. It strikes me that the only fear of the Opposition is that the present recession will improve.  It shows signs of being on the wane and there are signs that the economic position will improve.</P>

      <P>The Opposition appear to be frightened in case the one stick they have to beat the Government&mdash;the present economic difficulties&mdash;is taken from them because then will be exposed the pretentions of this collection of individuals to try to run the Government of this State. Deprived of the difficulties associated with this recession, the people would see the pretentions of the Opposition for what they are.  We have two years to go, at the outside, to a general election and we have not had any policies from a group of individuals who aspire to run the country.  We have heard instalments of the kind of baby talk indulged in by them this morning when they spoke of the difficulties before us and ignored the international connection between our recession and that abroad.  The Opposition, which consists of individuals who make up an uneasy coalition of ambitions and rivalries, when it comes to election time will discover that the kind of contributions this morning on this and other items is no substitute and can get them nowhere near these benches in the foreseeable future.  We need more than that today with the kind of electorate we have.</P>

The Opposition do not appear to know their own mind on any particular measure apart from a general simplistic equation that all difficulties would be eliminated if they were in government. Nobody, but the most brain-washed members of their misguided cumainn would credit them with that kind of gift today because the difficulties are worldsize and a little beyond their capacity.  Certainly, they have nothing to do with any secrets they may have to impart in government.

      <P>The Opposition have all the way to March, 1978, to declare where they stand.  Deputy Dowling argued against the improvement. It is clear that there is an improving position in the employment situation.  There has been a constant decline in the unemployment figures over many weeks and the same thing is clear in the trends in redundancy this year.  We had 19,000 notified redundancies last year and the rate this year is 13,500.  That is a solid reduction. There are many signs on the employment front that even during a term of peak unemployment the position is improving.  This tendency will continue to assert itself throughout the year.  There is that terrible danger dawning for the Opposition that they have only a short time to make the most of the difficulties that confront us and every other country.  I appreciate that it is little consolation to the unemployed person to know that he is one of a number which extends throughout every country in Europe. I readily accept that there is little consolation for the unemployed individual in that situation.</P>

      <P>There was really very little relevance in most of the debate and, because of that, it is difficult to know what the Opposition are for and what they are against.  As far as there being a burden on anybody, the fact is that there is an arrangement for a rebate.  We know that employers in general are in favour of these redundancy provisions and it is also a fact that employers bear only part of the burden.</P>
      <P>The argument was made that the money should be used for job creation. That is a matter of Government policy and Deputies opposite know quite well that, in the capital budget this year, we have provided the largest sum ever to assist industry.</P>
      <P>The numbers of those becoming redundant are decreasing but, because of the large numbers over the past two years, it is necessary to correct the insolvency of the fund and restore it to a position of credit.  That is why these extra contributions are being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Opposition Deputy argued that the pay-related fund administered by <Col N="588" /> the Minister for Social Welfare should be made available for redundancy purposes. That would need amending legislation, apart from the fact that the fund is required to continue that particular scheme.  It was explained last week that the fund is being continued for a further 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers were so diffuse it is difficult to find exactly what points should be replied to.  They seemed to think that, if they were over here, there would be no economic crisis and they believed they would be over here shortly.  There was that sort of sub-conscious stream of talk and I am at a slight disadvantage, therefore, in trying to reply.  Most of the arguments raised would be proper to a general debate on economic policy.  The main emphasis in Government policy from the point of view of economic recovery is on the extension of our industrial bases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>All the arrangements have been made in the capital programme.  While the employment situation continues to be serious, it must be admitted that the pattern is the same as the other EEC countries.  It is anticipated there will be 1,500,000 people unemployed in Britain next winter.  We and others have been going through a very difficult economic period but there are signs of an upturn in our economy as well as in other economies.  By comparison with France and Germany, our figures are showing very encouraging signs in the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>This motion arises out of the necessity to build up the fund.  Heavy payments had to be made out of the fund over the past two years and we now have to correct the position and restore the fund to solvency and, at the same time, reduce its dependancy on the Exchequer.  It is an expensive liability and we want to make the fund dependent on employer and employee so that we will not have to meet from the Exchequer the extraordinarily heavy demands made on its resources over the past two years.</P>

      <P>Deputies are aware that amendment No. 2 on the sheet of amendments which was circulated this morning was substituted for amendment No. 2 which was before the House on the last day the Bill was taken.  Deputies will recall that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 were discussed together.  Perhaps the Deputy has already spoken on amendment No. 2 and if he wishes to speak now on the substitute amendment he may do so.</P>

      <P>There is a substantial change in amendment No. 2 and for that reason I am glad the Chair is treating it in that way.  It does not bear comparison with amendment No. 2 of the last day. Also, there was a lot of confusion at the end of the debate the last day. We were not sure at what time we were finishing.  I am prepared to give way to the Minister as a result of these changes but I would like to reserve the right, with the permission of the Chair, to speak later.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 21 to 24, and to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;agriculture&rsquo; includes horticulture, the production of any consumable produce which is grown for sale or for consumption or other use, dairy farming, poultry farming, the use of land as grazing, meadow or pasture land or orchard or osier land or woodland, or for market gardens, private gardens, nursery grounds or sports grounds, the caring for or the rearing or training of animals and any other incidental activities connected with agriculture;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment clarifies that the joint labour committee will also cover workers employed in racing stables and stud farms and those engaged in horticulture, mushroom growing, poultry farming and pig breeding.  That is the intention of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment shows a substantial improvement in all aspects since we last discussed this Bill.  It proves one thing to me: we had a worthwhile and useful discussion on Committee Stage.  On the last occasion there was a certain amount of repartee between the Minister and myself about whether a bird was an animal or an animal was a bird.  He tried to persuade me that an animal was not a bird.  The reason for this was because we had asked for a ruling on whether poultry farming was industrial, agricultural or in what area did it fall.  As a result of our request this has now been included in the amendment before us.  It will now be a much more suitable definition than was there originally.  The time on this was well spent.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 says that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; includes horticulture, the production of any consumable produce which is grown for sale or for consumption or other use, dairy farming,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> and, above all, &ldquo;poultry farming&rdquo;. Maybe the Minister took my suggestions made the last day seriously.  I welcome that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the use of land as grazing, meadow or pasture land or orchard or osier land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is a bit of a hangover.  I do not know how much activity goes on on osier land anymore but I have no objection to its being left in here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>or woodland, or for market gardens, private gardens, nursery grounds or sports grounds,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>then the additions we had the last day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the caring for or the rearing or training of animals.</P>
    <P>This was again inspired by Fianna Fáil pointing out that there had been an omission regarding stable lads and people working in the horse-breeding and horse-training industries.  I fully appreciate why the Minister was a little embarrassed to have the horse mentioned in the amendment&mdash;because of the involvement of his leader and his colleagues with that industry and sport.  The fact that it is included indicates that our complaints about the inadequacies of the definition as it first appeared were noted.  This definition is now more suitable than that which originally appeared in the Bill which was circulated.</P>
    <P>The Minister told me that the interdepartmental committee had examined this matter thoroughly and everything was in order.  I am glad of that because it is important that he listens to the Opposition who have far more knowledge of the situation throughout the country than the Government. There always seems to be this little lack of knowledge and a lack of appreciation of the problems on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>This section includes probably all the people engaged in agricultural activities.  I note that it includes horticulture. In this area the Minister might, with good results, consider ways and means by which financial assistance could be made available to young people who have no jobs. In certain areas very successful horticultural projects were embarked on, <Col N="594" /> such as growing tulips on a test basis for Holland which is the greatest tulip growing country in the world and there was daffodil growing for export. In a time of high unemployment horticulture is an area which should be encouraged particularly among young school leavers who may have some sense of entrepreneurial adventure. Activity in this area could create ancillary jobs also.  For that reason I am glad that horticulture is included here.  As a country which is dependent so much on agriculture, this entire sphere must be explored fully.  The top six inches of our soil are our greatest natural resources.</P>

      <P>I cannot see how I roamed in any way from the contents of the Bill and the type of people at which it is aimed.  Agriculture is the one area of activity that we can extend at present.  We have discussed at length the expansion of job creation within this industry and industries allied to it.  That is why I say that agriculture as defined here includes the areas that we consider to be very important.  It includes areas that were omitted until we brought them to the notice of the Minister but this indicates again the awareness on this side of the House of what is needed in any such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the Minister for having submitted to me information concerning the circular from the Labour Court on advertisements that appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in the national <Col N="595" /> dailies.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 proposes to alter the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; for the purpose of the Industrial Relations Act.  It provides for access to the Labour Court machinery for people other than the officers of local authorities, vocational education committees and committees of agriculture who formerly were excluded from such access.  The pay and conditions of officers are governed by the operation of their respective conciliation and arbitration schemes so there is no need for their inclusion. However, those other employees who would be comprised within the general legal definition of &ldquo;servant&rdquo; pursue their claims through their trade unions.  Since section 17 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 entitles these persons to access to the court for purposes of trade disputes only, there seemed to be no good reason why they, likewise, should not have access to the court for other purposes such as joint labour committee negotiations as are envisaged in this piece of legislation.  The amendment provides that gardeners and others employed by local authorities are brought within the scope of the Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers.  In other words, we have broadened the definition that was used in regard to the Agricultural Wages Board in order to include these elements.</P>
      <P>I might add that without being included specifically the salaries of such persons would have related to those negotiated with the Joint Labour Committee procedure but since we broadened it in other respects, at least to the extent of specifying extra grades, it was considered in the interest of consistency that we should do so here, too.</P>

      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>Included.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson then proceeded to question him on the employees of Dublin Corporation and whether they would be covered.  The Minister then said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what I mean, but as we <Col N="598" /> go on to section 2 we will see that a person working under a local authority would not be included.</P>
    <P>The door was closed as far as the Minister was concerned.  Later he said:</P>
    <P>They have their own schemes. They will not be covered but that would be relevant to the next section.</P>
    <P>The Minister told me to stop being childish.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald gave the Minister the opportunity of explaining the purpose of amendment No. 4.  I was not present for the Committee Stage debate and I cannot understand the Minister's explanation for this amendment.  Basically, what has happened between Committee <Col N="599" /> Stage and Report Stage and what leads to this amendment, is that the Minister is deliberately leaving out &ldquo;servants&rdquo;.  The new subsection (d) is a replacement for the former subsection (e) which stated: &ldquo;an officer or servant of a vocational education committee&rdquo;.  The new subsection states: &ldquo;an officer of a vocational education committee&rdquo;.  The same applies to subsection (f).  The word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; is left out.  Does that mean that under the existing Act, without the amendment, that the servant is covered?  Is this the purpose of leaving out &ldquo;servant&rdquo; in this amendment?</P>

      <P>We hope that the deliberations on this legislation will be beneficial to the agricultural workers throughout rural Ireland.  Our hope in the present climate is that we will see a greater extension of this group of workers who have contributed so much to the life of the country over the years.  Work force numbers in agriculture have continued to diminish over a considerable number of years.  This has necessitated their re-employment in other sections of industry.  At this time every effort should be made to encourage more intensive farming, more jobs on the land and more jobs in the processing industries based on agricultural products throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I believe the horticultural field is open for development, perhaps on a small scale but even this is important at present.  I hope this Bill will create a better life for the agricultural worker and will not, as was pointed out by some speakers, create any industrial unrest.  There has not been any industrial unrest in that field of agriculture and I see no reason why this Bill should introduce that unrest.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  The letter which was issued by my Department on 27th February, 1976, notified housing authorities that although the overall resources being made available for the local authority <Col N="601" /> housing construction programme in 1976 represent an increase of more than 20 per cent over those provided in 1975, the high level of commitments, especially in respect of work in progress, and the demands of the rapidly expanding Dublin city programme, required to meet the urgent housing needs of more than 5,000 families, have restricted the amounts that can be made available for new work to be started elsewhere before the end of September.  The authorities were informed specifically that it was my intention to review the level of expenditure and output on the programme later in the year and that additional allocations may then be made for new work to be started in the last quarter of the year.</P>
      <P>I am glad to inform the House that the very substantial increase in the resources that have been made available to me in the public capital programme for local authority housing in 1976 will permit of a further expansion in the Dublin Corporation's programme.  The limited delay that will arise in consequence in the start of some new work elsewhere is the relatively small price that must be paid to allow the expansion of the Dublin city's programme to a level of activity commensurate with the urgency and size of the housing needs of the area.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the local authorities have been informed of a capital allocation for local authority housing construction which, in many cases, is sufficient to allow them to start only a small proportion of housing schemes for which tenders have already been accepted and that no money is being allocated for new houses?</P>

      <P>I am not so aware. As I told the Deputy and the House, I have allocated a very substantial amount.  The matter is being reviewed in June and a further allocation will be considered if it is necessary. It is only right to point out that the amount last year was £63.2 million and this year it is £75.5 million. In 1972-73 it was £25.38 million. <Col N="602" /> We are now giving exactly three times as much as three years ago.</P>

      <P>It is only right to point out to Deputy Faulkner that, in addition to the amount of money, the number of houses counts too.  The number of houses completed at 31st March, 1973, on the Opposition's own claim, was 21,500.  We have been building over an average of 25,000 houses, so there must be a relation between the amount of money being given and the number of houses being built.  In addition to that, Deputy Faulkner cannot blame me if there was a back-log of people waiting for houses over 15 or 16 years.  We are trying to catch up with them but we cannot build them all in two or three years.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in the last year of the Fianna Fáil Administration, the number of houses built was an increase of 6,000 over the previous year?  The Minister claims to have increased it by 4,000 in the following year but, since then, there has been practically no increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner is talking a lot of nonsense and he knows it.  The reason the figure was 6,000 over the previous year was that they held over 2,000 from the previous year because there was no money to pay the grants.  In fact, the increase was 4,000.  It does not matter what the increase was.  It was an increase from a very low base.  The fact is that we said we would build 25,000 houses and we have exceeded it every year over the past three years.  There is no getting away from that.  There are now 78,000 people in new houses who were not in new houses when we took over three years ago.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the allocation to be made later this year by his Department will only allow a start to be made and this will mean that people in need of re-housing will not be housed this year? Further, is he aware that work on only 40 new houses approximately will be commenced this year in a number of large housing authorities?  Is he aware that there is a departure in the financing of housing by the Department in that the capital allocation for NBA housing is to be paid for out of the allocation to local authorities, that previous to this there was a separate allocation for NBA housing?</P>

Those houses that will be started in the second half of this year&mdash;other than isolated cottages&mdash; will not be finished in 1976 but they will be finished in 1977.  The Deputy is making a slight mistake with regard to NBA houses.  The houses he is referring to are those that were ordered by the IDA for industrial workers.  Money for NBA houses that were built for local authorities were paid for out of local authority funds.  This was the practice in the past and it will continue.</P>

      <P>I would not deem myself able to understand what interpretation the Deputy would put on my letter.  Therefore, I cannot answer his first question.  As far as a massive, further allocation of money is concerned, does the Deputy not know that whereas last year Dublin Corporation got slightly more than £11 million, this year they are getting £23 million, 46 per cent of the money that is being given for the entire country?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner, Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. J. O'Leary</b> asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the concern expressed by numerous housing authorities about the possibility of large scale unemployment among maintenance staffs arising from the terms of circular letter H4/76 dated 20th February, 1976; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirteen of the 115 housing authorities have made representations to my Department regarding the terms of circular letter H4/76 of 20th February, 1976.  The issue of that letter must be considered in the light of the trend in current receipts and expenditure on local authority housing in recent years.</P>
      <P>Regarding receipts, rents and the net proceeds of sales of local authority houses are never sufficient to meet the costs which the authorities must pay in respect of the houses. The balance of costs&mdash;loan charges, maintenance and management expenses&mdash;has to be met by subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until March, 1973, this subsidy was defrayed in about equal amounts by the Exchequer and the rates.  Since 1973, arising from an undertaking in the National Coalition's 14-point plan designed to ease the very onerous burden on ratepayers, the entire cost of these subsidies is being transferred on a phased basis to the Exchequer.  In 1972-73, the rates subsidy on local authority housing was £6.74 million; this year it will be only £855,000.  On <Col N="607" /> the other hand, the Exchequer subsidy increased from £5.8 million in 1972-73 to £29.35 million during this period.</P>
    <P>Following this transfer of liability to the State, I have been concerned to note that some local authorities who had failed for many years to carry out a reasonable programme of maintenance to their houses while a substantial part of the cost had to be borne by the rates, have been undertaking ambitious schemes of repairs and structural improvements, the effect of which would be to make the general body of taxpayers bear the cost of the past neglect by the same authorities.  For example, expenditure on maintenance and management rose from £7.12 million in 1972-73 to an estimated £13.7 million in 1975.</P>
    <P>In order to control expenditure, while not inhibiting a reasonable programme, I issued circular letters to local authorities on 8th August, 1973, 3rd April, 1974, 13th February, 1975, and 19th September, 1975, warning them of their duty to maintain relativity between the actual expenditure on maintenance and management in 1972-73 and that to be incurred in subsequent years, regard being had to increases in costs.</P>
    <P>In this context, I considered it necessary to issue the circular of 20th February, 1976, which stated that the commitment by the Government to take over responsibility for the nett cost of the social housing programme was never intended to be completely open-ended in the area of maintenance and management.</P>
    <P>These restrictions on expenditure should not generally cause difficulties for any local authority who, up to now, have adopted a normal programme of management and maintenance expenditure and adhered to the guidelines indicated by the Department in recent years.  The limits imposed in the circular of 20th February, 1976, will allow an expenditure of £15.945 million on management and maintenance in 1976, representing an increase of 83 per cent on the expenditure in 1973-74, which is very reasonable in the light of the increase of 47.5 per cent in the consumer price <Col N="608" /> index between May, 1973, and November, 1975, and an increase of 73 per cent in building costs in the same period.  Moreover, £15.945 million represents an increase of 17 per cent on the estimated expenditure on maintenance and management in 1975.</P>
    <P>The restriction on expenditure on maintenance of local authority dwellings does not, of course, generally prevent local authorities from carrying out necessary works of repair in order to comply with the statutory requirement of putting houses into good structural condition before selling them to the tenants.  Pending receipt of statistical information sought in the circular letter, local authorities may proceed on the basis that expenditure in 1976 on such works should not exceed that in 1975.  A further circular letter will also be issued by the Department on the financing of improvement works to local authority houses.</P>
    <P>In the present economic situation, it is necessary to limit expenditure from public funds as far as practicable. While restrictions have been imposed on the growth of expenditure on the maintenance and management of local authority houses, public capital expenditure on housing has increased from £46 million in 1972-73 to over £122 million.  This substantial real increase in capital expenditure is intended primarily for the building of houses for those who need them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is more or less what was in the circular but he has not answered the question he was asked.  In view of the large number of people unemployed, particularly in the building industry, is he concerned about a reduction in the number employed on maintenance work because of a cut in the finances available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am interested in the number of people unemployed but I see no reason why there should be large scale unemployment. I am aware some local authorities did not realise there were houses to be repaired until three years ago and over the last two years some local authorities have doubled, and even trebled, the number of people employed <Col N="609" /> on repairs.  It is too bad that they should have left houses in the condition they were in for so long but I am hoping the repairs will continue because, apparently, some people are not aware that they can still continue to repair houses which are being purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner was one of the Members who walked through the division lobby to vote against budget increases on the grounds that Government expenditure was too high.  The Deputy wants to have it both ways; he wants to be against increased expenditure and he wants to have more money given out under every heading.  The Deputy is aware that this is not possible.  An enormous amount of money is being given for maintenance and housing construction by the State this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not know that the reason why so much money has to be spent now on repairs is because his Government, and the local authorities spent practically nothing over a long number of years under this heading?

      <P>The National Building Agency, who are administering this scheme, received 58 applications from employees of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. for new house loans.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that due to the inordinate and inexcusable delay on the part of the National Building Agency the payment of many of these loans has been held up for more than two years with the result that many of the unfortunate applicants had to pay as much as £1,000 interest on bridging loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that. In fact, I am aware that certain documentation, requisitioned by the agency's solicitor, was not supplied <Col N="612" /> until 25th February, 1976, and, accordingly, the mortgage could not be completed until the title was in order.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the necessity to conserve available funds to make maximum provision for priority services such as housing and sanitary services and to provide for the phasing out of the charge on the ratepayers in respect of the health services and housing subsidies, it is not possible to make any allocations under the amenity grants scheme in 1976.  There is always a possibility of restoring the scheme in the future but I see no immediate prospect of that.</P>

      <P>I do but I believe that if amenity grants are restored they will have to be restored on a far greater scale than before.  I honestly do not believe anybody would start building a hall with an amenity grant of £1,000.  These grants helped in a small way but the amount divided over the whole country was just not sufficient and I see no prospect of making money available this year any way, but who knows?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The total of the Road Fund grants <Col N="618" /> already notified to road authorities including an allocation of £485,500 to Kildare County Council comprises the net income of the Road Fund for the current year.  In the circumstances now obtaining, I have asked councils to give priority to safeguarding the employment of road workers by using their resources as far as practicable on labour intensive works.  It is up to the councils to determine their own priorities in road works within the general guidelines which I have indicated and, accordingly, it is open to them to decide whether it is appropriate to expend further moneys this year on the Fontstown scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister refer to a letter from the county engineer and the county manager of Kildare County Council of 4th February in which the county engineer pointed out that the money being granted did not reach anything remotely approaching the required level and in which the county manager indicated that unless we got a bigger grant employees of Kildare County Council would have to be let go?  Has he referred to that fact?  Is he further aware that a member of his own party, a Deputy and a councillor, has expressed the opinion that this road in Fontstown is in a very dangerous condition and will he indicate in what way normal planning and continuity of work for men and machinery could possibly be carried out with the stop-go policy he is now operating and does he not agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As <Col N="619" /> far as Kildare County Council are concerned, I understand the county engineer expressed a different view at a recent meeting of the council.  I am sure Deputy Power was there.</P>

Secondly, the block grant given now can be used by Kildare County Council on any job on which they wish to use it.  As far as stop-go is concerned, there has been a consistently high amount of money given to Kildare County Council and would Deputy Power please understand I am not responsible for the treatment Kildare roads got over the last 12 years.

      <P>Tenders were submitted to the Department for approval quite some time ago and contract documents were submitted subsequently. The amount of money which was applied for was not available at the time and what I have said to Deputy Blaney is that the contracts were set before the application was made to know whether there was money to proceed with the scheme.  The whole matter is being reviewed and, with a by-election coming along, you would never know what might happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the right side of the line all right.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the administration of group schemes in Donegal has largely been devolved to the county council.  I understand that a proposal for a group water scheme was mooted for the Meenmore area in early 1975. Subsequently, the county council, in considering a proposal to improve the Burtonport public supply, felt it might be desirable to integrate the two proposals. I understand that the position will be examined further when the council receive a report from their consultant in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that, since it has proceeded so far, it is hard luck upon those who are waiting. However, Mayo County Council only have it No. 4 on their list of priorities, and have approximately £3 million worth of work before it. In addition to that, the allocation to Mayo for sanitary service schemes in 1976 is the highest allocation of any county.  Therefore, while I sympathise with those who are waiting for water and sewerage, I would imagine they will have to wait some time further. There is no point in giving them false hope.  It would appear that unless Mayo County Council decide to move it to the top of the priority list, even if the money was given it would not be spent on this scheme.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a definite reply, because the original proposals for the scheme were discarded due to local resistance and a number of technical and administrative difficulties.  As I told the Deputy the last time, it has still to be cleared on a number of points at local level.  If it is cleared, I would be under the impression that it is one that should get very early attention. It will help the Bray water supply as well as everything else.</P>

      <P>I provided £693,200 in capital to meet expenditure in 1976 on water supply and sewerage schemes being provided by Mayo County Council, including £23,200 for small schemes.  £571,500 of this was in respect of schemes in north Mayo.  In addition I provided £31,000 to Ballina Urban District Council.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand a local authority who have a small allocation asking questions about part of their area not getting enough water and sewerage grants, but I cannot understand Mayo in view of the fact that they have got so much: £280,000 for Ballina Regional Stage 1 scheme between 1973 and 1976, and £193,500 for completion of the scheme in November, 1976.  Stage 2 of that scheme, which will service Asahi, will cost £2.3 million, and they got £932,000 for the scheme in 1975 and 1976.  For the Ballina Quay sewerage scheme £31,400 was provided between 1974 and 1976.  There are many others, and I cannot understand Deputy Gallagher putting down questions to know why they should not get more. Does he want all the money for water and sewerage schemes in the whole country to be given to Mayo?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>Before section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution in section 4 (1) of &lsquo;ten&rsquo; for &lsquo;seven&rsquo; and &lsquo;twelve&rsquo; for &lsquo;nine&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This amendment is in keeping with our policy in relation to a second channel but since debate on the Bill has been disrupted on so many occasions, it is difficult to remember exactly what point we finished on. However, when discussing this amendment on the last occasion we said that in the event of the introduction of a second channel and of its being within Irish control, the Authority should be enlarged and a programme council set up.  We consider an extension of the existing Authority to 12 to be appropriate at this time.  I am not in favour of a very large board in any concern <Col N="662" /> and would prefer compact boards which can be more efficient than the larger ones.  This has always been conceded in the private sector and it is a policy that has worked effectively in the public sector&mdash;in many semi-State bodies where there are boards of seven, eight or nine people.  Although the Authority with which we are concerned here may not have the large volume of employees that is a feature of other semi-State bodies, we must realise that the department concerned is very technical and, with the introduction of a second channel, will become more complex.</P>
      <P>It is important that the second channel should have the good will of the people.  In this context we consider that an enlarged Authority will help in the diversification of interests in that they will ensure that the views of those in single channel areas are taken into consideration and reflected in programmes. I can foresee the Authority having to form sub-committees consisting of members who would be conversant with the wishes of the people in the single channel areas.  Preferably, the additional members we propose would be resident in the single channel areas because there is no better way of knowing the views of people than to live in their area.</P>
      <P>The number of the present Authority residing in these areas is very small but acceptance of our amendment would make it possible to increase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not casting any aspersions on the existing Authority.  They are doing a good job in trying to satisfy viewers but a second channel will give them more scope in this regard.  It is for these reasons that we tabled the amendment.  We are anxious, as is the Minister, that the second channel which is expected to come into operation in about October, 1977, will be acceptable to all sections of the community. From a survey carried out we know that a majority favoured a second RTE channel as opposed to what the Minister proposed originally.  However, we must ensure that those who opted for the Minister's proposals will be given what we can consider a better choice than that which was suggested by the Minister in the first case.  It is for us <Col N="663" /> to ensure that the people generally will accept the second channel because in the main they will be paying for the service.  This is why I ask the Minister to consider seriously the new burdens which the Authority will be undertaking. It will be their task to monitor programmes and decide on which are most suitable and acceptable in the various parts of the country that now enjoy only single channel viewing.  The board were appointed originally on the basis of operating a single channel but the view of the proposed new channel the Minister should consider our amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister looks at our amendment he will find substance in it.  I do not want to see the Authority becoming too cumbersome.  I am not for very large authorities or boards because I believe a compact authority can operate just as efficiently in normal circumstances in relation to other semi-State bodies.  Such authorities are commercial enterprises.  There are not the diverse interests in those that we have in relation to this Authority.  This Authority will have to please all sections of the community.  The task we are entrusting to the new Authority will be far more complicated than it ever has been.  We will not be dealing with the huge volume of turnover in personnel that other semi-State bodies are dealing with.  Here we are dealing with culture, news, current affairs and the various aspects of broadcasting which are technical and complex.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to please everybody in relation to broadcasting but I know the Authority will be anxious to do their job as efficiently as possible and to please as many people as possible.  That is the reason I am putting this proposal to the Minister.  I believe there is substance in it.  If the additional number we are proposing in our amendment were resident in the single channel area this would give added confidence to the people in that part of the country that we are genuinely concerned that they will get a balanced programme, that it will reflect their views and that it will be the type of programme they feel they are entitled to.  I have said that <Col N="664" /> at various meetings we have had throughout the country that television viewers in the single channel area are entitled to as good a programme as those who live on the east coast are entitled to.  Now that the decision has been taken as regards the channel it is our duty to ensure that the board are facilitated in every way to bring this type of programme to the people we are speaking about.  I hope the Minister will look sympathetically at my proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The case put by Deputy Fitzpatrick for this amendment is a reasonably good one.  He is proposing that the Minister should have the power in increase the number on the Authority by two or three.  I do not think we can avoid the conclusion that when one has two channels, one of which is available in the whole of the State and the other which will be available in what is known as a single channel area, we have two areas of representation and, therefore, irrespective of from where the present Authority have been drawn, there is a need through some means or other, to ensure that the very important viewpoints of those in the single channel area are represented.</P>
      <P>There may be other ways of doing this.  In fact, this side of the House have put forward proposals in this area. Nevertheless, one of the ways of ensuring it is to add two or three to the Authority to ensure this gives additional balance to the single channel area.  This is a fair argument.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has covered the subject pretty adequately.  I have said that an addition to the Authority could be in the staff area.  At present one member of the Authority represents the executive side.  Unless the Minister has some ideas about how to ensure that the views of those in the single channel area are adequately safeguarded in the Authority from the time the second channel starts, this is one of the ways in which he could safeguard the interests of that element of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who represents the single channel area and who has gone around to inquire what <Col N="665" /> people think of the second channel I would like to put forward the views of those people.  I would go further than the amendment but I am prepared to settle for what the amendment contains. If a special board cannot be set up there should at least be a special committee to deal with programmes on the second channel.  The people on that committee should be drawn from the single channel area taking in the south and the west and those people who cannot get any other programme except RTE 1.</P>
      <P>I would not like to settle for anything less than three people being added to the board.  It is not all I want or all the people I represent want.  They want competition between the two.  This would make for better programmes. They want programmes with a regional bias.  People in the single channel area feel that if the one board are programming both channels the people in their area might not get what they are entitled to.  The second channel may not have programmes with a regional bias, which people in the single channel area expect they should get. The people in the single channel area that I represent have asked me to try to get an independent committee&mdash;I know we cannot get this now&mdash;or at least get somebody added to the board from the regional areas who will put forward the ideas of the people in those areas.  What would people in other areas know about the type of programmes the people in the single channel area want? Competition is the life of the trade. RTE 1 and RTE 2 would be much better if there was competition between them.  We would then have new ideas. Therefore, if three were added to the board we would have better programmes on RTE 1 and RTE 2.  I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered further the question of providing for an increase in the minimum and the maximum size of the RTE Authority as proposed in Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.  From what Opposition Deputies said on this amendment, the main concern seems to be that the Authority would contain sufficient <Col N="666" /> people who would be in touch with the wishes of single channel viewers in regard to the second TV programme and that this was more likely to be achieved if more people were to be appointed to the Authority.</P>
      <P>The argument was also used that the expansion of RTE's responsibilities justified a larger Authority.  I understand these points and I have given careful consideration to them.  I am sorry to say, however, that I do not feel that I can accept them.  On the first point, an increase in the size of the Authority would not necessarily achieve the result Opposition Deputies are seeking.  The maximum of nine members contained in existing legislation gives ample scope for appointing to the Authority people who because of where they live or because of their contacts or interests would have special insight into the wishes of single channel viewers.  The quality of such a person or persons would be more important than the number involved or even the place of residence.</P>
      <P>I certainly accept that a suitable number of such persons should be appointed to the Authority but this is not I feel the type of matter which can appropriately be legislated for. However, the fact that this question has been discussed exhaustively here and that the principle underlying the amendment is accepted by both sides of the House should be a sufficient safeguard to ensure that it would be borne in mind when appointments are being made to the RTE Authority in the future.  Of course, other considerations would also have to be borne in mind.  Deputies opposite are well aware of the different arguments that have to be balanced together in building up an Authority of this kind.</P>
      <P>The second main argument mentioned for increasing the maximum size of the Authority was the increase in their responsibilities arising from the decision to give RTE the task of providing the second TV service.  I recognise, of course, that that is an adequate consideration for introducing here a new amendment because this is a new circumstance which did not arise when the matter was before the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> There has, of course, been no change in the Authority's obligations to provide a national broadcasting service.  Indeed, in one sense the second TV channel should make it easier for them to fulfil this duty by affording greater scope and opportunity to meet viewers' wishes.  I think here, again, it is quality rather than quantity that counts.  I would not accept that the heavier the responsibilities of a body either in terms of their diversity or sensitivity, the larger the board of that body should be.  Indeed, I do not think Deputy Fitzpatrick argued that.  He showed himself to be fully conscious from his own business experience that bodies of this kind could become so large as to defeat the object of diversification which was there when the membership was enlarged.  A board of modest size but with high quality members is far more likely to operate efficiently and to fulfil the duties of the body.  I am advised that the normal maximum size for State-sponsored companies is nine and I do not consider that a larger board than this is either warranted or desirable in the case of RTE.</P>
    <P>I might add that the question of increasing the size of the boards of some State-sponsored bodies may arise in connection with legislation being prepared by the Minister for Labour regarding the election by employees of directors to the boards of State enterprises.  It is not proposed that RTE will be designated as one of the State enterprises in respect of which the provisions of the Bill if enacted would come into effect initially, but it is probable that further State enterprises including RTE may be covered later on.  If the size of the Authority were increased now to 12 and it had to be further increased later on to cater for election of workers' representatives on the Authority, there is a real risk that it would become too unwiedly for efficient operation.</P>
    <P>I have considered this amendment very carefully because it deserves careful consideration but I am afraid <Col N="668" /> I find myself unable to accept it for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am sorry the Minister did not see my point of view.  I am not in favour of a very cumbersome board. The point the Minister made about the quality of the authority is of vital importance.  The quality of the personnel on a board of management is what really counts.  We put down this amendment because of the additional duties of the Authority and the complexity and sensitivity of their new duties.  Because a second television channel is being introduced, they will have a difficult task at the outset. Everyone will be watching the performance of the second channel.  This will be the responsibility of the Authority.  They will have to research the programmes well in advance apart from the producers and the broadcasters and people like that who will play a very important role.  The Authority will be blamed in the end if anything goes wrong.  The Authority will have the responsibility of ensuring that the second channel is a success.  There is no doubt about that. They will spend much of their time from now until the second channel goes on the air in 1977 ensuring that it is a success.</P>
      <P>I do not suggest that the second channel will be designed especially for the single channel areas.  We will all benefit from it.  I expect there will be programmes of interest to many of us on the east coast.  I should not like to think it would be designed in particular for any part of the country. We must ensure that when it goes on the air there will be the choice of programme we enjoy on the east coast.  I firmly believe we will have a better choice of programme on RTE 2 than on BBC 1.  The Authority are conscious of the obligation placed upon them to ensure that the second channel is a success.  It is of vital importance that it should be a success from the point of view of revenue, tam ratings and advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadcasting is expensive today.  It is expensive to put on any performance but broadcasting in particular is <Col N="669" /> very costly.  The second channel must be streamlined to ensure that it will attract the viewers and justify the increased cost of the licence.  In this part of the country we have a variety of channels at the moment.  The Authority will have to concentrate on setting up subcommittees to ensure that the demand for variety is met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's reply.  Surely if we are to have two channels we need some new blood in the Authority.  There are some good programmes on RTE 1 but it is terrible to have to pay a licence to see others.  These people will now have to look after two channels. I am surprised the Minister does not agree there is a need for new blood and add three new people to the Authority.  Part of his argument was that later on there may be labour representatives on it.  That might be very good but it does not weigh against the argument that new blood is needed.  It was expected in the single channel areas that there would be new thinking when RTE 2 was established. I think the Minister is making a great mistake and I would ask him to reconsider between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In the past I have been extremely critical of RTE and certain people within it.  I should like to go on record now as saying that a remarkable improvement has taken place in RTE and in the variety of programmes which go out.  I am fortunate enough to live in a multi channel area and I am satisfied that the programmes put out by RTE can compete with any of the programmes from other stations.  I look forward to RTE 2 keeping up this high standard. According to the Reithian theory, the objective of television is to entertain, inform and educate, in that order. RTE are providing greater entertainment now and I am glad to be able to say that.  In the past I have been critical when I felt it was justified but now I am very pleased to be able to say that the programmes from RTE are excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> I can understand the anxiety to have an increased number on the Authority in order to take account of various aspects that must be considered with the advent of RTE 2.  I do not know if RTE 2 will be operating by the end of 1977; the present limitation of funds may not warrant it.  From the point of view of the entertainment being provided, people are getting their money's worth in comparison with what is offered by other stations. We should be very proud of our television service, particularly with regard to the entertainment it is providing.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Many other semi-State bodies such as Aer Lingus and CIE produce their own journals practically every month.  RTE have been in operation for a considerable number of years and this is the first time their publication has been brought under ministerial control.  My purpose for putting down the amendment is to ensure that the <i>RTE Guide</i> would be exempt from that stringent control.</P>
      <P>Many of us have read the <i>RTE Guide</i> for many years.  I do not think it has entered into any topic of a controversial nature that would embarrass the Authority.  Bringing the publication under this rigid control may inhibit it in some way.  We all realise there is a considerable difference between the written word and something that is broadcast.  Broadcasting is the most powerful medium and all of us know how effective it can be.  I should not like to think that the <i>RTE Guide</i> would be inhibited because of too rigid regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's <Col N="671" /> views on this matter.  I doubt that the <i>RTE Guide</i> has ever stepped out of line but I should be interested to know if the Minister has reasons for including the publication.  Semi-State bodies may issue their publications each month without any such rigid ministerial regulations.  When I put down this amendment I had the <i>RTE Guide</i> particularly in mind.  I do not think the publication has embarked too much on current affairs articles or anything similar but perhaps the Minister has some information available to him on this matter which I do not have.  The section as it is may inhibit the <i>RTE Guide</i> to the extent that it may consider it has to look over its shoulder on every occasion to see if it is complying with the section.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has made a good case.  While he was talking I was trying to visualise how the <i>RTE Guide</i> in publishing something could infringe the new section 3 and I found it quite difficult.  For example, section 3 (1) (a) refers to &ldquo;all news broadcast by it is reported and presented in an objective and impartial manner...&rdquo;.  The next subsection deals with current affairs and debate.  None of this relates to the kind of article published in the <i>RTE Guide</i>.  Its job is to publicise what will be seen on the programmes.  I have been involved with the Authority and I must say that the people responsible for the <i>RTE Guide</i> must be complimented not only on its publication but on the way they manage to distribute it themselves.  The <i>RTE Guide</i> is merely an advertising publication to encourage viewing of RTE television and listening to the radio programmes.  It does not transmit as such and it is to the transmission of views on news which might not be impartial that the Minister is directing his efforts.  He is also directing his efforts at the unequal treatment of debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> I am inclined to think that the Minister should be more liberal in his approach by leaving out the <i>RTE Guide</i> for the time being.  I do not think that since the television service was established the <i>RTE Guide</i> has ever transgressed in the area this new section is intended to operate.  I suggest that on Report Stage the Minister might consider leaving out the <i>RTE Guide</i>.  I appreciate that leaving out the word &ldquo;written&rdquo; might refer to other areas but I would like to see the question of the <i>RTE Guide</i> fully debated before one applies the principles of the old section 18 represented as they are in section 3 in an area which never came under that restriction before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is in order for me to mention that a similar amendment was introduced by Senator Yeats in the Seanad and my reply to that is to be found at columns 476, 483 and 484 of Volume 81 of the Seanad Official Report for 4th June, 1975.  I should like to mention that the Broadcasting Authority were consulted in relation to the framing of this legislation. While I was not able to accept all their suggestions I accepted some of them.  The Authority did not indicate that they objected to the same requirements which apply to broadcasts applying to written material which they publish.  They seemed to accept that it was reasonable that the same requirements should cover both. Written publications by RTE are on a different footing from, for example, newspapers.  RTE publications are produced by a corporation created by statute and bound by statutory restrictions. The corporation are financed out of public licence fees.  In their ancillary activities of publishing I consider it desirable that RTE should be subject to the same restraints as regards objectivity and impartiality, and so on, as those which apply to their main operation, that of broadcasting.  This seems fair and reasonable and RTE have raised no objection to the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to add that no reflection is intended on the <i>RTE Guide</i> which has been well produced, nor is it intended that it be shackled.  I do <Col N="673" /> not think these requirements entail undue trammelling on the liberty of actual broadcasting and I think the publishers of RTE written publications will not find them any more irksome, or irksome at all.  They are precautionary rather than anything else.  I would not like to give the impression that this was just aimed at the <i>RTE Guide</i> because RTE are involved in other written publications, for example in connection with education programmes.  These may be far more extensive in the future and, indeed, I hope the development of broadcasting services would permit that kind of extension.  It would hardly seem appropriate to exclude written publications from the restraints in the Bill and it was to make that clear for the future that I took occasion, in the context of this legislation, to introduce this provision.  I regret, therefore, that I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke previously I praised the entertainment side of RTE.  I praised the station for the good programmes they were putting out but when the Minister spoke he mentioned reasonableness.  Clause (b) deals with broadcasts in relation to current affairs, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debates, and that the Authority ensure they are fair to all interests concerned and they are presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the Authority's own views.  Does the Minister consider it reasonable that Sunday after Sunday we should hear two members of the Government being interviewed on radio programmes without any representative of the Opposition being asked to contribute?  If the Minister was in Opposition would he consider it unfair if Fianna Fáil members, on return to Government, were continually interviewed?  When we were in Government any Minister interviewed was flanked by a member of the Fine Gael Party and a member of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people outside this House have commented on this very notable change since this Government took <Col N="674" /> office.  Last Sunday we heard three speakers from the Government side but no spokesman from Fianna Fáil. On the current affairs side of things there is a certain bias which was indicated to me by people outside the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I take note, with pleasure, of the Deputy's praise for improved standards in certain aspects of broadcasting and I believe this will carry weight and will be an encouragement to the Authority, particularly when it comes from a Deputy who has, as is his right, been critical in the past.  With regard to the question of bias, it is natural enough for political people on both sides of the House to feel sensitive about this.  Some of my colleagues have come to me from time to time and told me that they thought RTE was being unduly severe on the Government.  I am aware that Deputies opposite would not be likely to take the same view of the same programmes.  It has not been my practice to intervene in programming except in so far as I have kept a watchful eye, as my predecessors always did, on the area of possible subversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessors on occasion objected to the appearance of certain Opposition TDs, including myself on more than one occasion.  Having taken note of this, shortly after I assumed office I informed the RTE Authority in writing that the Government had no objection to the appearance of Opposition Deputies in any capacity or at any frequency in broadcasting so they know now they are not subject to any interference from me in that direction.  I believe the Authority will take note of what Deputy Briscoe has said.  I would draw the attention of the Opposition to the recourse they now have.  Where a Deputy or a member of the public feels the role of impartiality is being violated he has the right to complain to the present complaints review committee and, when this legislation is passed, to the complaints review commission.  It is a fact, perhaps more notable when one is in Opposition rather than when one is in <Col N="675" /> Government, that the public particularly wish to hear what Ministers have to say, irrespective of whether they hear it with approbation or the reverse, and I imagine that is reflected here.  It would be as well if more use were made of the recourse for complaint to which I referred.  I think it is undesirable that the Minister of the day should interfere in the matter of balance between the political parties. That is the view I have taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Minister misunderstood me, when we were in office it was only on very rare occasions that a Minister appeared without being flanked by both sides of the House.  Since this Government took office no Minister is flanked by even one member of the Opposition. Perhaps Ministers have refused.  I am very interested in the Minister's invitation to refer such matters to the Complaints Committee.  I do not like the word &ldquo;complaints&rdquo; because it connotes moaning.  It might be just a case of pointing out that something was a little bit unfair.  I am looking for complete impartiality.  Let the Minister be under no misapprehension: there is a general feeling&mdash;it does not do the Government any good&mdash;that there is a tendency to keep Fianna Fáil off the air, particularly on controversial issues, and I am thinking here of the programme that usually goes out on Sunday.</P>

      <P>First of all, I agree that partiality and impartiality depend to a certain extent on what particular side one happens to be.  When I was first appointed spokesman I endeavoured to deal with the situation, to which the Minister has referred, of the failure of Ministers to appear on programmes with members of the Opposition.  Now I exclude the Minister.  I believe the public are being deprived of debate and information that could be engendered by good programmes in which both <Col N="676" /> Government and Opposition take part.  The fault has not been with RTE; it has been with members of the Government, with a couple of exceptions, the Minister being a notable one.  They have avoided appearing on programmes with the Opposition. That was not the case with the previous Administration.  Ministers in that Administration appeared with Opposition Deputies.  That is not the pattern at the moment.  There is a reluctance or a shyness on the part of many members of the Government to appear on programmes with members of the Opposition.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I would hope we would not inhibit the creativity or productivity of writers in any way.  Bord Fáilte and other semi-State bodies publish some excellent periodicals.  I do not think the Minister made any case for RTE in any way transgressing in this respect.  I believe they have maintained very high principles and I see no reason for the restrictions the Minister seeks to place upon them here.  Bord Fáilte, for example, project Ireland as a tourist area and they do that very efficiently.  I would not approve of too much liberalisation but I have never found that the RTE Guide has in any way breached the trust placed in RTE as regards publishing this pictorial which is useful and concentrates on a certain line of information.  It gives the following week's programmes and writes about actors and people like that.  I doubt very much if it was necessary&mdash; evidently the Minister deems it was&mdash; to include it in the section.  We do not want to be too restrictive.  We know what we are aiming at in the section. This section, dealing with impartiality, is of vital importance.  It is only right and proper that the Authority and the people working there should know what is expected of them, and that should be outlined in as simple a form as possible.  The Authority may put the case that they do not know what is in the Minister's mind.  They should not be left in that unhappy situation.  However, as regards the RTE Guide it has worked effectively down through the years.  Those producing <Col N="677" /> it have not embarrassed the Authority in any way or neglected their obligations and therefore I think it was unnecessary to include them in this section.</P>

      <P>I want to come in very briefly simply for informative reasons because Deputy Fitzpatrick said he was unavoidably distracted from a part of my substantive reply here.  The point of this is that, although it does apply to the RTE Guide, it really is intended to provide for more than that.  The RTE Authority are already involved in other written publications, for example, in connection with educational programmes.  These may be far more extensive in the future, and I hope they will be; I think that would be a natural development of our broadcasting services.  I took the view that this development ought to be regulated by the same principles as RTE's activity in the field of broadcasting itself, and the RTE Authority do not themselves dissent from that proposition.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In putting forward this amendment it is not that I want to liberalise what the Minister is aiming at but to ensure that it does not cause complications in the minds of the Authority as to what exactly the Minister wants.  Section 3 (1A) reads:</P>
      <P>The Authority is hereby prohibited from including in any of its broadcasts or in any matter referred to in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of this section anything which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime as tending to undermine the authority of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> We all agree that this section is necessary but we want to ensure that the Authority know where they stand and that they can operate the section effectively.  If the word &ldquo;tending&rdquo; was omitted, the section would read: &ldquo;... be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or to undermine the authority of the State.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;tending&rdquo; is very broad and it would be very difficult for the Authority to decide what would tend to undermine the authority of the State.  If the Authority were to cover protests or strikes, would the Authority be in breach of the section?  Would they be prohibited from showing pictures of protests outside Dáil Éireann? The Minister is probably aiming at a particular section of our community but it is not spelled out in this section. We must not be ambiguous in this.  We have had too much of that on other occasions.  Many things could tend to indermine the authority of the State.  For instance, if RTE covered squatters protesting and blocking the streets of the city or housewives protesting against rising prices or other types of urban protest, would that tend to undermine the authority of the State?  To me the section seems to be strong enough without the word &ldquo;tending&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can prove to us conclusively that it is necessary to include that word and at the same time if the Authority are happy that they can interpret and implement the section satisfactorily, well and good.  However, I believe it will cause a problem, and remember it is the Authority we are speaking about here.  It is no good the Minister saying to the Authority: &ldquo;You are in violation of (1A) of section 3 by virtue of the fact that the programme you put out on television would tend to undermine the authority of the State.&rdquo;  The Authority want to be sure that if they show the types of film I have already mentioned they will not be in violation of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument here is, in a sense, in the mind.  It is similar to what we were describing earlier: two people looking at the same programme but seeing it differently simply <Col N="679" /> because they are not on the same side. I can see where the Minister and his advisers would say: &ldquo;If you put on such a programme, it is likely to do something.&rdquo;  To use the words &ldquo;tending to&rdquo; is stronger.  I notice the two phrases &ldquo;likely to&rdquo; and &ldquo;tending to&rdquo; are used in sections 3 (5) (a) and 17.</P>
      <P>Section 17 reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  where the Minister is of the opinion that the broadcasting of a particular matter or a matter of a particular class would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or would tend to undermine the authority of the State, he may by order direct the Authority...</P>
      <P>In my view, &ldquo;likely to&rdquo; is strong enough; &ldquo;tending to&rdquo; may, in itself, incline the people dealing with the programme to become a little fearful that they are likely to overstep.  They could think along the lines: &ldquo;If this is an industrial or some other protest, we better not do this in case we might be accused of having put on a programme which would tend to undermine the authority of the State.&rdquo;  To a considerable extent it is a matter of judgment on words and, more important, it is a matter of more mature judgment on the nature of the occasion which can be serious in one area but trivial in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we must rely to a considerable extent on the judgment of the Garda. The Minister has to rely on the judgment of the broadcasters but, in my opinion, he is strengthening his hand a little too much.  If he were to say to the chairman of the Authority: &ldquo;I think if you put on such and such a programme it is likely to encourage...&rdquo;, that is fair enough.  When using the phrases &ldquo;likely to&rdquo; and &ldquo;tend to&rdquo;, one is giving a direct negative &ldquo;do not&rdquo; because &ldquo;likely to&rdquo; is not as strong.  When one says &ldquo;tend to&rdquo; one is really saying &ldquo;do not&rdquo;, in other words, one is taking from the judgment of the broadcasters.  I would prefer if the Minister took from the judgment of the broadcasters by simply saying: &ldquo;Do not put on that programme&rdquo; rather than leaving them in this extraordinary situation where they will have <Col N="680" /> to consider the difference between &ldquo;a tendency towards&rdquo; something and &ldquo;a likelihood of&rdquo; something.  I am putting one side of this argument because I am no longer on the Authority.</P>
    <P>As with the previous amendment, there is a danger here of the Minister creating a feeling in people's minds that they will have to keep on looking over their shoulders.  That is not the kind of thing one likes to encourage in a broadcasting authority.  One should try to give broadcasters as much freedom to use their judgment as possible. For that reason I recommend that the Minister consider deleting &ldquo;tending to&rdquo; in the two sections.</P>

      <P>The wording of this subsection, as it now stands, was introduced by way of an amendment in the Seanad designed to meet objections to an earlier wording. Following a prolonged debate, it was accepted by that House.  The effect of this present amendment would be to narrow the scope of the prohibition which has already been somewhat narrowed in the Seanad from the original concept, in my view, rightly. There is a considerable difference between prohibiting the broadcasting of anything which may reasonably be regarded and &ldquo;being likely to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo; and &ldquo;prohibiting the broadcasting of anything which may reasonably be regarded as tending to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the intent of Deputies opposite in raising this.  It is a very moot point and they have recognised it&mdash;the point of what precise balance you have in wording between a more restrictive and more liberal interpretation. We are all agreed on the need for some restriction.  It is a question of what degree and what kind.  A few points have to be made here.  The wording of the statute has to be fairly wide and, therefore, necessarily, like the wording of statutes, contains some ambiguity.  It has to be interpreted and the Authority are there to do that. They have the phrases &ldquo;tending to undermine&rdquo; and &ldquo;which may reasonably be regarded as tending to undermine&rdquo;. In relation to many of the activities Deputy Fitzpatrick referred <Col N="681" /> to, the Authority could reasonably take the view that they could not reasonably be regarded as tending to undermine, that is, if the news team covered certain untoward events in the city, riots and so on, that could not reasonably be regarded as &ldquo;tending to undermine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that the Authority set up guidelines which give their own more detailed interpretation of what the statute intends.  The Minister can indicate whether he regards those guidelines as adequate or inadequate. If a Minister considers that the Authority have wandered in one way or another from the intent of the statute, he has powers falling far short of the discipling of the Authority, of clarification of the intent as covering particular things.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make this point. I fully admit that the amendment proposed here is more liberal and my own wording is more restrictive.  It is a question of which is the right balance.  The basic reason why I leaned to the more restrictive, that which gives the Authority power to curb broadcasters in certain conditions, is that I do not wish to malign broadcasters as a class.  It would not be proper or right for me to do so. Most broadcasters are trying, according to their responsibility, to cover the news adequately, to give proper and informed coverage of current affairs or to probe into what is going on in our society.  But it can occur from time to time that a broadcaster, from sincere convictions of his own, perhaps, may have a desire essentially to make propaganda.  If a broadcaster is bitten by that bug he is likely to be very ingenious about it and it will not necessarily be all that obvious since he is a professional in that area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Authority in discharging their responsibility need to have a provision which is worded reasonably widely and the wording we have here about tending to undermine the authority of the State is better than the alternative wording suggested.  At least, that is the conclusion I have come to but I respect the motives of the Deputies who were considering otherwise and who have <Col N="682" /> urged this point.  On mature reflection, though, I regard the subsection as drafted as an essential restraint in this sensitive area of the general security of the State.</P>
    <P>I should make it absolutely clear here that I accept fully that Deputies opposite are as concerned as I am with the security of the State and that they regard their wording as compatible fully with that concern but I consider that on the whole my wording is more suited to the purpose and, accordingly, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I appreciate the Minister's point of view.  It is not a question of his wording being more restrictive or of our amendment being more liberal. We are anxious to ensure that the Authority will know exactly where they stand.  The Minister has mentioned that the Authority can draw up their own guidelines within the meaning of the section.  I expect that it will be necessary for them to do that in order to arrive at, perhaps, a broader definition of what the section contains.  However, the point is that not only will they draw up guidelines to deal with broadcasters and producers but that they will have to deal also with the Minister who has his views on the section.  I do not know whether any guidelines drawn up by the Authority would be vetted afterwards by the Minister but it is important that the Authority have regard to the wishes of the Minister and, in particular, to what is contained in the Bill.  The words &ldquo;tending to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo; would pose a problem in regard to definition and this is why we were prompted to propose the amendment.  There is no question of our wishing in any way to weaken or liberalise the section but we are anxious to ensure that the Authority will know exactly where they stand.  I am concerned that they might be hesitant, because of the wording of this section, in regard to the broadcasting of news, especially of such items as protests, strikes and so on and that they might have a problem in regard to the word &ldquo;tending&rdquo;<Col N="683" /> in the section.  For instance, they might have difficulty in deciding whether the showing of a protest through the streets of Dublin was in breach of this subsection.  This is the danger I see in the section and it is the reason for our suggesting the deletion of the word &ldquo;tending&rdquo; and its substitution by the word &ldquo;likely&rdquo;. We do not wish to put broadcasters or the Authority into a straitjacket. A certain amount of creativity is part of the lives of broadcasters and they must not be inhibited in regard to news features.  It would not be possible here to spell out the types of programmes the Minister has in mind but we must not restrict the Authority too much.  Comparing this section with, say, section 18 of the 1960 Act, I should like to hear from the Minister whether he considers we are creating more problems in this instance by the introduction of so much detail.</P>
      <P>The section should be as simple as possible and should reflect what exactly are the views of the House. The Minister seems satisfied that the wording he proposes is necessary but we maintain that the same objective could be achieved by the less restrictive wording we propose.  By virtue of their being selected for a commission of this nature, we may take it that the Authority are a responsible group of people.  Therefore, we must give them some flexibility in regard to programmes. We agree that a section of this nature is vital to the Bill but I do not think our amendment would detract from the section but would result in the Authority being able to interpret it better.  I believe they would be able to reflect the views of the Minister more clearly if the deletion was made.</P>

      <P>Section 18 (1), which is the original section referred to now in section 3, tended to be a bit too simple, a laying out of the Authority's responsibilities that when they broadcast any information, news or feature which relates to anything of public controversy or is the subject of <Col N="684" /> current public debate the information, news or feature will be presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's views.  Section 3 spells out in more detail what was intended to be taken for granted in section 18 (1) of the 1960 Act.  I acknowledge that in subsection (1A) the Minister introduces for the first time the question of activities of broadcast which would be likely to promote, or incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State.  I welcome that because in the past I said that one of the responsibilities of the Minister is to withhold democratic institutions against any subversive efforts to undermine them.  The Minister is quite right in introducing this.</P>
      <P>The Minister is spelling out a little more clearly to the Authority what was intended to be understood in the section in the 1960 Broadcasting Act.  I wonder if in the words written in in the previous subsection (IC), the Minister is going a little bit too far?  I was interested in what he had to say in the Seanad on this.  I would have thought that to keep things simple anything which &ldquo;may reasonably be regarded as being likely to&rdquo; is sufficient.  One could go on talking about the difference between one word and another but there is no point in protracting the discussion too long.  I feel this subsection would be better and a little simpler if the Minister were to concede the point.</P>

      <P>If the Chair will allow the amendment and the section to be taken together I would like to speak briefly on both of them.  First of all, in relation to what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said just now about the amendment, I absolutely agree with him when he says how desirable it is that the Authority should know exactly what the Minister has in mind.  This is very important.  We accept that this being a statute the wording has to be general and that it is dealing with a very impalpable subject-matter, an unusually elusive subject-matter.  A different Minister or a different Authority might interpret the section differently. Indeed, either or both might interpret it differently in different circumstances according, for example, as <Col N="685" /> the threat to the security of the State became more remote, or more close, or seemed so.  It is very desirable that each Authority at each time should know how the Minister interprets the statute or his views on it.  One way of achieving this is that when the Authority issue guidelines they can issue their own guidelines.  They do not have to be approved by the Minister of the day but it can help if they are.  If those guidelines are approved then the Authority and the broadcasters know with a considerable degree of precision when they are deemed to be operating within the rules of the statute.</P>
      <P>Shortly after I took office I asked to see the guidelines then operative and I approved them.  The Minister can do that.  As long as the Authority operate within those guidelines they know that their interpretation is upheld by the Minister.  If the Minister considers that a change is desirable because of broadcasting events, or events in the rest of the real world, he has powers under this statute and its predecessor to issue directions which will then supersede these parts of the guidelines and further develop the interpretation of the section.  It is very important, and will always be important in the future, that the Authority should not be in the dark as to how the Minister reads the statute. It is also important that their own guidelines should be as strongly founded as possible.  I would think it generally desirable that they be approved by the Minister so that the Authority and broadcasters would know where they were.</P>
      <P>I would like to say something about the section itself.  Section 3 replaces section 18 (1) of the 1960 Act which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) (a) and (b) of the new section broadly restate the provisions of section 18 (1) of the 1960 Act.  In <Col N="686" /> addition, clause (b) requires the RTE Authority to ensure that broadcast treatment of current affairs is fair to all interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (c) requires the Authority to apply the same standards as regards objectivity and impartiality to any magazines, books, printed matter or recorded aural or visual material they publish or distribute under section 16 of the 1960 Act.  We have, of course, already discussed that in terms of an amendment.  Lines 38 to 44 of the section provide a slight relaxation in the requirement as regards the prohibition on the Authority expressing their own views.  In matters concerning broadcasting policy which are of public controversy or of public debate and which are being considered by the Government or the Minister, the RTE Authority may express their own views subject to the overriding requirement of objectivity and impartiality in the broadcast treatment of such matters.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph of subsection (1) gives statutory backing to the existing practice in RTE in regard to interpretation of the provisions regarding objectivity and impartiality.  It is not always possible to cover all significant views in a single programme and RTE regard these provisions as being complied with if all such views are covered in two or more related programmes broadcast over a reasonable period. This seems to be a sensible interpretation and it has been incorporated in the Bill for the sake of clarity.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1A) which prohibits the Authority from broadcasting, publishing, distributing, selling or exchanging anything which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote or incite to crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State, overrides the provisions as regards objectivity and impartiality.  Subsection (1B) is designed to promote the reasonable privacy of the individual.  Subsection (1C), which relieves the RTE Authority of editorial responsibility in these areas in relation to programmes rebroadcast by the Authority by direction of the Minister, is being deleted by amendment No. 5, of course, consequential on the deletion of section 6. It is true, and I regret it, that the section <Col N="687" /> is longer and rather more cumbrous than the section it replaces. That is not a criticism of the section it replaces which well served its purpose. It is natural after this lapse of years that events in the meantime should suggest the incorporation of further provisions, and that is what has happened.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that under section 18 (1) which the Minister has just read, impartiality is only obligatory in controversial current affairs programmes and is not obligatory in non-controversial current affairs programmes, whereas under the new section it would be obligatory whether it was a controversial or a non-controversial current affairs programme.

      <P>I would be interested to hear any opinions to the contrary and I would be prepared to consider them between now and Report Stage.  It seemed to be desirable that all broadcast treatment of current affairs should be presented in an objective and impartial manner.  It might be construed as a defect in the original wording that they did not have to be objective and impartial unless it was a matter of public controversy. It seems desirable that, in general, broadcasting should be objective and impartial, and that this should not be limited solely to the areas of controversy.  At least so it seemed to me.  If Deputies opposite have a contrary argument I will consider it.</P>

      <P>I do not necessarily disagree with the Minister.  I have some experience of this.  If it is non-controversial, I do not think the need for what I would describe as immediate impartiality or immediate balance is all that great.  Provided there is no incitement, providing it is not becoming dangerously controversial, flexibility is desirable.  By flexibility I mean a more liberal approach.  The programmer may be afraid to put somebody on because of what he might say.  That is not desirable.  If it is an area in which it will not cause a controversy I do not think it is important. That is the difference I see. If it is a political area, or an area which is likely to cause incitement or to be controversial, that is different. There I would expect the director of programmes to use his judgment.  In the other area I would not be inclined to tie him down that much.</P>

      <P>My feeling is that the wording of the new section which makes objectivity and impartiality general requirements in the coverage of current affairs seems to be unobjectionable in itself, and to cover the possibilities which the present legislation does not altogether cover.  It is a little difficult to conceive of a programme on current affairs which does not at some point evoke an aura of controversy or debate. <Col N="689" /> It would be a rather dull programme if it did not.</P>

      <P>I would regard a current affairs programme and a funny programme or a satirical programme as being different fish.  I certainly would not wish to catch the humorous one in a cumbrous web of this sort of thing.  One can imagine a programme on current affairs which was not related to a public controversy at the time it was broadcast, and not the subject of current public debate and, therefore, not caught by this but which, perhaps by reason of its very failure in objectivity and impartiality, stimulated a subsequent controversy.  The people who ran it could say: &ldquo;It was not a controversy at the time.  It is now.  We were not in breach of the Act.&rdquo;  On the whole, I think the new wording should be unobjectionable and it is better to make it a matter of principle that the treatment of all current affairs should be presented in an objective and impartial manner.  The point raised is an interesting one.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> When we look at section 18 of the 1960 Act, this is more restrictive in paragraph (b).  I believe the Minister will bring humorous programmes into the net.  I am thinking of programmes which have been shown on the BBC.  I have seen British Prime Ministers shown in a humorous way dealing with current <Col N="690" /> affairs.  Paragraph (b) will include humorous programmes.  Some of the programmes shown on RTE are humorous programmes on current affairs.  They could be about the budget.  I believe such programmes will be caught in the net.  I do not know if that was the Minister's intention in paragraph (b).  It refers to the broadcast treatment of current affairs, including matters of public controversy.  If the Minister could tell me humorous programmes will not be caught I would be quite happy.  The RTE Authority, reading this section and looking at the words &ldquo;including matters&rdquo;, are bound to say: &ldquo;We cannot put on this programme because it would be in breach of paragraph (b).&rdquo;  Even though it was a humorous type of programme it could deal with matters of public controversy.  I should not like to see this section abused, where people would put on a humorous programme just for the purpose of saying what they thought. On the other hand, I do not want the Authority to be put into a straitjacket. Frequently humorous programmes are very entertaining and I do not want to see them brought under the provisions of this section. We must be careful to ensure that the provisions of the section will not mean a lowering of the standards of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>I am not sure why the Minister elaborated so much on the 1960 Act with regard to impartiality.  I am not altogether sure that it will be to the advantage of the Authority.  I share the point of view expressed by Deputy Brugha that the 1960 Act was not explanatory enough but in this case the Minister may have gone too far.  In trying to spell out the matter in detail, probably he has complicated the matter.  With regard to section 3 (1) (b) which states:</P>
      <P>The broadcast treatment of current affairs, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate,</P>
      <P>will the Minister state if this will include all kinds of humorous programmes at present on RTE if they relate to current affairs?</P>

      <P>The only area where current affairs and humour are considered to overlap is in a satirical programme.  Admittedly the new wording could catch those programmes but I do not see that it is more likely to catch them than was the old wording which stated, &ldquo;when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The kind of satirical programme we are thinking about deals almost exclusively in matters of public controversy or are the subject of current public debate.  If people are sufficiently sensitive or lacking in humour they could regard such a matter as falling under the old Act just as much as under the new legislation.

I am quite prepared to look at the wording and to think over the matter between now and Report Stage because it is an interesting matter.  If we want to give a certain scope or licence to the humorist and do not want him to be caught, the old wording was as likely to catch him because, almost by definition, he is interested in matters of public controversy or matters that are the subject of current public debate. I do not want to refer to any particular programme by name here but if one thinks of the best known programme in this area, it deals all the time with matters of public controversy or of current public debate. That is part of the fun of the programme. The existing Act could have been used to curb it but the convention has grown up in broadcasting here and elsewhere that the humorist <Col N="692" /> has a kind of licence that enables society to let off steam.</P>

      <P>I can understand the difficulty here in so far as current affairs programmes by their nature must be controversial.  When the late President Childers was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he said that when controversy did not surround a television or radio station it was dead.  To some extent, current affairs programmes thrive on controversy.  I am not against controversial subjects being debated as long it is done in a balanced and objective manner.</P>
      <P>It would be a very foolish person who would object to satire being directed at him if it is done in a proper manner.  There are some people who consider themselves satirists but the standard of some of their work could not be described as satire; some of it could be described as sheer vindictiveness. Therefore, one has to strike a delicate balance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment seeks to delete the words &ldquo;or as tending&rdquo; to undermine the authority of the State.  It could be very difficult to decide on that matter.  Either it is incitement or it is not incitement.  Before a Minister would act he would have to be quite certain that certain statements made or certain people brought on to a programme were inciting others to a certain type of action.</P>

    <P>I frequently use the phrase, &ldquo;dealing with uninformed emotion is always difficult&rdquo;.  Frequently there are issues before the House or before local authorities where information is available to a very limited number of people but sometimes a broadcaster who does not know all the story and who becomes involved in a particular issue&mdash;it may <Col N="693" /> be motorways or any other matter&mdash; may put a scare into people that half the city of Dublin will be knocked down to make way for a motorway. This might be done when the maximum number of displaced people may be in about 30 houses in an entire scheme.</P>
    <P>We have to ensure at all times that a balance is kept, that people are not emotionally drawn into something they do not understand.  From time to time all of us receive hysterical letters from people because they have read or heard about something that has been only half stated in the Press, on the radio or on television.</P>
    <P>Controversy is the lifeblood of any current affairs programme.  The Minister has been asked a question which he has said he will think about between now and Report Stage.  The question being asked is about the exclusion of humour because we may find ourselves running into definitions of what is humour and what is sheer bitter criticism in the guise of humour. It is one which may be very difficult to draft into a Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to hear the Minister's view on this matter.  I do not wish to put forward the view that I am too liberal with regard to the Bill.  A certain amount of liberalism is needed but we must keep our restrictions also.  If the Minister thinks it would inhibit the humorous programmes we have become accustomed to, he should say so on Report Stage. I disagree with the Minister when he says that section 18 of the old Bill could be interpreted in the same way. I will have a look at the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to paragraph (a) of section 3 which states:</P>
      <P>all news broadcast by it is reported and presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the Authority's own views,</P>
      <P>That is fair enough but now I should like to refer the Minister to the matter at the end of paragraph (c) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of this subsection, <Col N="694" /> in so far as it requires the Authority not to express its own views, shall not apply to any broadcast in so far as the broadcast relates to any proposal being a proposal concerning policy as regards broadcasting, which is of public controversy or the subject of current public debate and which is being considered by the Government or the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if when a matter relating to broadcasting is before the Government, or this House, the Authority will be permitted to express their views on television.  Will this section apply in such a case?  Will this subsection give them liberty to defend themselves on RTE if the removal of the Authority is being debated by both Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>

      <P>The point raised is an interesting one but I do not think that the wording can be so construed. It is not intended to be so construed. I do not think one could reasonably construe a decision to remove a member or members of the Authority as being a proposal concerning policy as regards broadcasting.  I shall have that looked at again and if it is felt that there is ambiguity there I shall see to it that it is removed between now and Report Stage because it would be highly undesirable to have a debate of that kind.  I think it is unlikely that any authority would engage in such a debate but I will have a look to see whether the ambiguity exists and if so I shall remove it.</P>

      <P>In the final analysis the Minister has the power to say what may or may not be broadcast.  While the Minister is explaining to this House his reasons for removing an authority he has the power to forbid any discussion on the removal taking place on RTE.  That is my interpretation of the situation.  If the Minister has not got that authority he should make sure that he has.  We have had the situation, quite rightly, where RTE were allowed to put up their own defence as to why we should have RTE 2.  I was glad the Minister did not try to prevent the Authority expressing their views on that matter.  RTE did an excellent job on this matter which was of national importance. <Col N="695" /> I am not saying that the removal of the Authority would not be of national importance.  We would be satisfied if the Minister could say to the Authority that they were not taking over the station to defend their actions.</P>
      <P>Earlier the Minister told the House that section 10 gives him emergency powers but by the time the Minister invokes that section that station may have been taken over.  Can the Minister give us an assurance that there is no conflict there?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I take the view that the Authority could look at paragraph (b) and maintain that they were generally speaking about broadcasting in defending any broadcast made which might result in the Minister removing the Authority.  The subject matter under discussion would be the programme broadcast and I am not sure that the Authority would not make that case and say that under paragraph (b) they had the right to defend themselves. This subsection deals only with broadcasting and nothing else.  Of course, we all accept that the Authority cannot be allowed to express their views on all matters but it is in order for them to express their views on general broadcasting. The fact that they expressed their views during the debate on RTE 2 was welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section also provides that the Authority shall not unreasonably encroach on the privacy of an individual. Will the Minister define what is &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo;? In the making of programmes the privacy of the individual must be protected.  It is of vital importance that people are not harassed or their homes invaded by anybody making programmes but if it was a programme concerned with exposing vice what would be reasonable in one case might be unreasonable in another. RTE might want to embark on a programme exposing some racket or vice but they would have to ensure that in such exposure they did not invade the privacy of the individual.  RTE might want to highlight an injustice perpetrated <Col N="696" /> by a small group and in doing that they might have to go a little further than they would in an ordinary programme.  I would like to have the Minister's view on this.  My definition of unreasonable in that context would be different from my definition where they invaded the privacy of a home for the sake of a normal programme of an uncontroversial nature.  There must be a balance.  RTE operate in a very sensitive area and they must never be allowed to go too far but they must have some latitude.  Is it the Minister who will lay down guidelines or will they lay down their own guidelines? Citizens must not be harassed.</P>

      <P>I think that is what the Chair said.  I should like to make my position clear on the amendment and the section.  For the reasons I have given I cannot accept the amendment.  Deputies opposite have made a number of interesting points on the wording of parts of the section. Between this and Report Stage I will endeavour to clear up ambiguities. With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's last point, the present wording was decided on after a long discussion in the Seanad.  The provision with regard to privacy was put in at the suggestion of the RTE Authority.  The word &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; is designed to protect broadcasters in their exploration in the public interest of areas of possible abuse.  Where there is not a valid defence the privacy of ordinary individuals should not be violated.  There would be a widespread consensus on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that because in other countries a situation was reached where there was almost trial by television.  We had an episode <Col N="697" /> here some years ago and a man's appearance on a particular programme probably added years to his life.  He is now dead.  This is something we must guard against.  There is an obligation to expose social evils but there is also an obligation to research the subject thoroughly.  To bring a man cold into a studio and there interrogate him as if he were a criminal is something we could not support.  This is a worth-while section.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> What will the provisions be with regard to restrictions?  We will have no control over rebroadcasts.  If they contain matter prohibited under (1) (a) what will the reaction of the Authority or the Minister be?  Will the Authority be in a position to say what these programmes may contain and what will happen if they contain something contrary to what is laid down by this section?  I can see the Authority finding themselves in a rather difficult position with regard to the transmission of programmes from outside the State.  Will these programmes be subject to the same restrictions as programmes emanating from RTE?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This section will apply to all broadcasts by RTE. The problem is likely to arise only in the case of simultaneous rebroadcasting. The Authority will have to be cognisant of their responsibility in the choice of programmes rebroadcast simultaneously.  The possibility of making a mistake exists.  Without intending it they might find themselves in violation of the statute.  But the obligation applies generally.  I do not think any Minister or any Government would be likely to be unreasonably harsh in his or their judgment if a genuine mistake should be made which might happen in rebroadcasting something which normally would not have a bearing on the security of our State at all or look as if it was about to incite to crime, and which could, therefore, be seen to be an accident.  However, I think RTE in the selection of subject matter of a programme they were rebroadcasting would take care to avoid that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> In general, of course, both the BBC and IBA are subject to much the same restraints as RTE as regards objectivity, impartiality and incitement to crime.  Sometimes in the past they have not construed this in the same way that we would, as they have not felt, for example, as threatened by certain kinds of armed conspiracy as we have been here.  However, I think events have changed that, so that the danger of the kind of unintentional violation, if I may so call it, which the Deputy has quite rightly drawn attention to here is not so great now as it would have been in the past. The main point in relation to what he says is that the statutory obligations apply to everything broadcast by RTE over either channel, including rebroadcast material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> As regards employees under their control RTE can issue their guidelines and say: &ldquo;This is the type of programme we do not want&rdquo;, but they cannot issue directives to an outside broadcasting company that has no obligation to them at all.  Therefore, in relation to rebroadcasting by RTE there can be genuine mistakes made.  The Minister of the day will probably have to take a different attitude on certain programmes if mistakes are made.  If such mistakes were made deliberately and continued to be made, that would be a different matter.  Therefore, this will present a problem to RTE in regard to foreign channels whose programmes will constitute a considerable part of our second programme.  It is for that reason I raise this matter.  Again, there is the phrase &ldquo;undermining the authority of the State&rdquo;.  Is the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; of the State the right word there?  Would the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; or &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; of the State be better?  That is only my own view.  The authority of the State, that would be the Government?</P>

      <P>Could I deal with that point?  We considered this, whether to say &ldquo;security&rdquo; or &ldquo;authority&rdquo;.  We are using &ldquo;authority&rdquo; as a broader word.  Anything that undermines the security of the State, of course, also undermines its authority, and you also have the reference to incitement to crime.  But hypothetically you could have certain programmes which would cast doubt on the legtimitacy or effectiveness of the democratic State which could not be construed as a direct threat to the security of the State but which would undermine its authority, programmes reflecting, for example, not on this one or that one in Parliament, not on the Government of the day as such, but on Parliament as a whole, on the Judiciary, on the Army, on the <Col N="700" /> Garda.  All these programmes would not necessarily threaten security but they would undermine the authority of the State.  The authority of the State is the phrase used in the Constitution, Article 46.1 and we followed that wording considering it the most appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the 1960 Act, including the direction issued under section 31, apply to any BBC or IBA programme broadcast by RTE at present. Therefore, the factual situation is that with the second channel there is likely to be more of these but the legal situation is unchanged.</P>

      <P>Subsection 1B of this section reads:</P>
      <P>The Authority shall not, in its programmes and in the means employed to make such programmes, unreasonably encroach on the privacy of an individual.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the family or an organisation or society. Are they protected by this section or does it apply only to an individual?</P>
      <P>On the whole question of impartiality, can we be assured that the use of concealed microphones, such as were used in the money lending programme that was made by RTE, will be discontinued for all time?  Although this programme was highlighting a social evil, it intruded on the privacy of the individual, who was unaware of this bugging at the time.  Can we be assured that there will be no permission to indulge in such tactics in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, together with Deputy O'Connell, was on one occasion subjected to star chamber tactics by Radio Telefís Éireann.  On that occasion a particular locality was highlighted and downgraded by objectionable references <Col N="701" /> made by RTE at the time.  Because we questioned this, we were invited to the studio and subjected to star chamber tactics by the producers who brought in a number of individuals they had researched over the weeks together with a cleric from this area. They brought them into the chamber knowing well that their views were hostile, politically and otherwise, to Deputy O'Connell and myself.  These people got the major portion of the programme, together with the interviewers and the producers.  I hope that in future public representatives who defend their constituencies and who take note of objectionable references to downgrade areas will not be subjected to these tactics.  Can we be assured that Deputies can refer to programmes in this House and in the Press without being attacked by programmes similar to that which I have already mentioned?</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention the area or the programme because I am sure the Minister knows what I am talking about.  At that time cider drinkers were paid to perform in front of the cameras.  I did not know until after the programme that those cider drinkers had received a payment from RTE.  That programme gave a vicious look to the area and downgraded it to a very large extent.  I hope there will be no further programmes of that type and that there will be adequate protection not alone for individuals, for families and for society, but also for areas and that discretion will be used to a greater extent in the future.</P>
    <P>This did not happen during the present Minister's term of office but it happened some time ago.  Nevertheless some Deputies are aware of this subject and have seen the way Deputies were pilloried on that programme.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that my colleague, Deputy O'Connell was pilloried in a grossly unfair way for his very valid comments.  References were made to statements which he had made under different circumstances some 12 or 18 months earlier.  They were trotted out by a man who has risen to the heights of his profession <Col N="702" /> in recent times.  He was one of the men who was instrumental&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling brought up a few points which merited mention.  There has been a tremendous growth in the maturity of the interviewers in RTE.  I do not think we will witness that kind of thing happening again.  During the Cork by-election in 1966 an RTE employee came to our headquarters and was using his tape recorder, unknown to the people there, to pick up any gossip he could.  Those tactics were used in those days but no longer.</P>
      <P>Instead of journalists aspiring to be Alaistair Cookes they think they can get to the top much quicker through the sensational story.  It is not for me to tell them their jobs.  The journalist will always have the last word and this will always give him a sense of forbearance.  I heard an expression which said that the mighty should be merciful, although sometimes it is difficult for them to be merciful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that any public representative who goes on television should be able to look after himself when he is before a tough interviewer.  If he is asked too many questions too rapidly he can always put his hand up and say: &ldquo;You asked me a question and I intend to answer it.  When I have answered it I will then go on to your <Col N="703" /> next question&rdquo;.  It is up to the public representative to defend himself.  I often watch politicians on television and I can see who are good and who are not so good, who loses his &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and who does not.  A greater understanding has grown up between the journalist and the politician.  When television was relatively new, interviewers tended to look to other countries to see what was being done there but our interviewers have developed their own style and they do fairly well.</P>
    <P>I remember the first time I was ever interviewed&mdash;in 1965 when I was first elected.  I wrote to the interviewer and complimented him.  I did not think there was anything very pointed in his questions, although many people said he asked me very unfair questions.  I did not think they were unfair and I answered him straight.  I said then that a good interviewer should never be more important than the least important person he is interviewing. This makes a big impression on the public.</P>
    <P>I was recently in the United States and watched some news programmes. On one particular news programme in Baltimore, three newsreaders must have thought they were kings because they gave the impression that they were very important and nothing else mattered.  If they had only realised the way they looked in the eyes of the public, they would have been more humble in their approach.</P>
    <P>The aim of an interviewer should be to get information and nobody should be obliged to answer questions.  Deputy Dowling's criticisms were legitimate and the day of what I would call amateur interviewing is gone.  I realise that people like action and that where there is no controversy, a station may as well be dead.  You can get good controversial debate without having people tearing at one another's throats. The sport of the day used to be to have politicians tearing at one another and giving a bad image.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what the Minister said when he referred to the authority of the State.  I once said that if you bring politicians into disrepute you bring the institutions of the State <Col N="704" /> into disrepute, and eventually people will have no respect for that authority. One of the interesting things about satire is that it can be far more damaging than the serious attempt to argue the point.  There is a very narrow line between satire and sarcasm.  I am not talking of television now but of radio. One particular programme&mdash;I will not mention it by name&mdash;comes to mind which has a very cynical attitude.  The attitude adopted on this programme towards politicians is rather cynical. People who present these programmes do not see us as we work in our constituencies. I was concerned originally when I saw the reference to the authority of the State as against the institutions of the State but I realise that the question of the authority of the State is very important.  Democracy has gone too easily from too many countries.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This section is probably the most controversial one in the Bill. Certainly, it is very important.  It is not possible for RTE to please everyone and the question of impartiality must arise from time to time.  Individuals or groups may complain of being misrepresented.  I have an open mind on these matters but recently a matter was brought to my attention regarding impartiality on a programme relating to the Dublin Bay oil refinery proposals.  I do not know whether this is a matter on which the Minister would like to comment but because of the representations made <Col N="705" /> to me I tabled a question to him in regard to the matter.  I was informed, however, that it was the concern of the RTE Authority.  One group of people complained that the programme was not presented in a balanced way.  On a programme of this nature it is imperative that a balance be maintained.  It is not the type of programme on which a broadcaster can express his views.  The question of an oil refinery is very important and controversial in so far as Dublin is concerned.  Indeed, the programme was of much interest to people throughout the country as well as in the city.  In researching a programme of this nature every effort should be made to ascertain the points of view of all concerned and to do this objectively. Researchers and presenters have a duty to ensure in so far as possible that the people interviewed know what they are talking about. After much representations and public criticism RTE decided to broadcast another programme in relation to the refinery but there are those who consider that justice was not done to the subject in this second programme any more than in the first.</P>
      <P>I am putting the case to the Minister as it has been presented to me because I consider it relevant to what we are discussing on this section.  I shall not express my views in relation to the refinery question&mdash;our party have done so already&mdash;but I am putting forward the views of RTE listeners throughout the country and of residents of this city in particular. This type of case highlights the importance of this section.  I am aware fully of the difficult and important job of a broadcaster or a producer in endeavouring to arrive at a perfect balance.  It is a task requireing professionalism and skill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Producers and broadcasters have a task different from that of the journalist who can express his view in a newspaper column, giving it a bias one way or the other.  He is not bound in relation to impartiality. Therefore, the role of those in radio and television is more difficult in that respect.  As human beings we all have <Col N="706" /> views of one kind or another, be they political or otherwise, but a broadcaster and, ultimately, the Authority under which he operates, must not reflect his views or those of anyone within the Authority.</P>
    <P>Some of the criticism levelled at the Authority from time to time may be justified, some not, but we must realise the difficult role they play in trying to maintain a balance in relation, especially, to public and current affairs programmes. Politicians generally are sensitive to television and to the Press. They may consider their point of view not to be put forward adequately or accurately.  Perhaps they have reason on occasion to be aggrieved but we must not overlook the difficult role of the Authority.  The reporting of the proceedings of Parliament and of other current affairs programmes add substance to our institutions.  Debates of this nature should be given a fair airing.</P>
    <P>The question of the broadcasting of the proceedings of Parliament is one that we shall come to in another section.  It is something I have views on because I believe that people should see that democracy works in the House.  I would not like to bore the viewers with a number of hours of this type of broadcasting but I believe a reasonable amount of this type of current affairs programme is no harm. I do not know what the TAM rating for this is but I believe it is a good thing to let Ministers go on a television programme, irrespective of what their views are, and have their Opposition spokesman on the same debate.  This makes for a good type of programme and I believe the public at large would enjoy it.  I hope we have programmes like this in the future.  If a Minister is putting forward a controversial issue, the best way he can get this message across is through the television channel.  Although we might speak in the Dáil for hours and hours we know very well that the coverage of a debate like this is very limited.  A short synopsis of a Bill on a current affairs programme and the Minister being questioned on it by the Opposition spokesman would do no harm.  No Minister in this House should hesitate to go on that type of programme.</P>

      <P>We had a good discussion on this important section.  I would like to be brief but I would like to refer to a few questions about what I should do.  As regards section (1B) Deputy Dowling asked if this would protect the privacy of a family as well as an individual.  It must by the very fact that it protects the privacy of individuals protect the privacy of families also through the individuals which make them up.  He also raised the point about the use of concealed devices, which has a direct bearing on section (1B), encroachment on privacy. A directive to the staff about the use of concealed devices was issued by the Director General of RTE in December, 1969.  The directive reserved absolutely to the Director General authority for permission to use hidden devices in any case.  This directive has, in fact, amounted to a virtual ban on the use of such devices.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling also went over some of the programmes in the past, to the conduct of which he objected.  I do not think I should enter into that here nor would he wish me to do so.  Deputy Briscoe made some very wise comments, if I may say so, in that whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised a specific question about a recent programme on Dublin Bay under the heading of impartiality.  I would like to refer here to the existence of the complaints commission before which matters such as those raised by Deputy Dowling can in the future be raised.  In relation to the Dublin Bay programme this has, in fact, been raised.  The programme in question is the subject of a complaint by a member of the corporation.  It concerns the two programmes on 14th <Col N="708" /> and 29th December.  The complaint is that they were biased.  That complaint is now before the complaints commission so, although this is not technically a court, in spirit we should regard it as <i>sub judice</i> for the moment.  That is all I wish to say.</P>

We do not have the opportunity of letting them know not only what the feeling of the Members of the House is but also what the ordinary man in the street feels about the conduct of the programmes.  I have one wish in my heart, that on the Sunday programmes, particularly, they would cut out some of the jargon when they say so and so is &ldquo;on air&rdquo;, &ldquo;in studio&rdquo;, &ldquo;on phone&rdquo;.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Claremorris-Limerick Railway Passenger Service: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Barrett on 30th March, 1976:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, believing that for social and economic reasons, the Claremorris-Limerick railway passenger service should not be discontinued, calls on the Government to ensure that the passenger and freight service on this line be improved <Col N="709" /> immediately so as to attract more business.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;recognises that under Section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958 the Board of CIE is empowered to terminate any train service provided the Board is satisfied that the service is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period; and takes note that the Board proposes to provide alternative road passenger services in lieu of the rail passenger services on the Limerick-Claremorris railway line.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Transport and Power.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke for a short time on this debate last night on the motion introduced by the Members opposite that for social and economic reasons this line should be retained.  I proposed my amendment which says that this House should recognise the value of the 1958 Act which put the onus on the people who know, that is the board of CIE, what line should be retained and what they should give permission to shut down.  When Deputy Barrett opened the debate he said that this was the biggest closure in the history of CIE.  This is not correct and he knows it is not because this is not a closure.  No line is being closed here.  There is a withdrawal of an underused, uneconomic passenger service.  That is all that is involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Closures are what happened when Deputy Barrett's party were in power in the 1960s when the services were withdrawn, both passenger and freight, when the men were laid off, when the key was turned in the station door, when the line was taken up and when the land was sold.  That is a closure. This is not a closure but a withdrawal of a service which was costing the taxpayer £250,000 a year to maintain.  It <Col N="710" /> is not true to say as was inferred here and in comments in the newspapers and by deputations, that CIE are withdrawing from the west of Ireland.  The opposite is true.  CIE put their money where their mouth is in this regard. They have spent £600,000 in the last two years in upgrading stations but the railway system in this country could not live if the same approach to it had continued.  There must be a new dynamic approach to CIE if we are to maintain the railways because to keep on uneconomic lines, to keep on handling goods as they were handled in the last 20 years, would be a certainty to bring about the complete closure of all rail services not just to the west of Ireland but to the south and east coasts as well.  This is not the attitude of the Government and it is not what CIE want to do. They are upgrading the stations in the west.  They are laying new permanent way.  They are investing in new rolling stock.  They are doing all this with the idea of providing efficient services from Galway, from Westport, from Ballina, from Sligo into Dublin and out of it.  This will be a help to the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no bonus for the west if the people there insist on maintaining services which they themselves will not support.  If the people through their normal loyalty will not support these lines, how can they expect industrialists who come here to support them?  If the local people who have a local interest in maintaining the lines will not support them, why should any industrialists support them? There are two ways to see that these lines are maintained.  First, CIE must make the services efficient.  They must give a fast modern service for freight and passengers.  Secondly, the local people must support them and must generate trade for them.  If that is done, the railways in the west are secure.</P>
    <P>If I thought the Opposition would win the next general election, I should accept this motion and bring in a Bill amending section 19 of the Transport Act and let whoever is Minister for Transport and Power suffer the consequences and pick up the bits and <Col N="711" /> pieces for the next ten years.  I know that will not happen.  Therefore, I will resist this motion.  I have introduced my amendment which I am quite happy will be carried by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister that we are quite certain we will win the next general election.  If he has any notion of changing the Transport Act, 1958, this is a good time to do it.  I support the motion in the names of Deputy Barrett and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies from the west requesting that this branch line be kept in operation.  I am disappointed that the Government Deputies from the west did not put their names to the motion.  I am sure their hearts were dictating that they should do so but, for political reasons apparently, they were not allowed to.</P>
      <P>This motion is intended to highlight the serious threat to the social and economic life of the western community by the withdrawal by CIE of the passenger service on the Claremorris/Limerick line as and from April 5th.  I should like to thank the Galway County Manager, Mr. Keating, and the County Development Officer, Mr. Lynch, for the valuable help they gave to the action committee which was set up to fight against this closure.  They were very helpful and gave all the assistance they possibly could.</P>
      <P>This action committee was set up in the west and was representative of all the commercial and trading interests in the west as well as the elected Members of all political parties.  It failed so far to get a reprieve for this service. A deputation led by the Galway County Manager was received by the Minister for Transport and Power and by the chairman and board of management of CIE.  The case for the retention of this line was put very forcefully by members of the deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deputation put forward some very concrete proposals which, if accepted and implemented, would definitely attract more business for the branch line in question.  Those proposals included an alternative timetable which would fit in with the other services provided and would be far more effective in achieving connections <Col N="712" /> with other trains.  I have no doubt that if the alternative timetable were given a chance and the service improved, it would attract more people to use the service.</P>
    <P>In spite of the deputation's efforts, the letters which subsequently arrived from the Minister and from the chairman of CIE bore out our worst fears.  There was to be no reprieve, no salvation for this line.  It was condemned by the board of CIE as being uneconomic.  That was it as far as they were concerned.  We were disappointed by that reply.  We were far more disappointed by the Minister's reply dated March 10th, which told us in effect that he had no function in this matter, that any decision relating to a particular line rested with the board of CIE.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, may have given CIE power to terminate any rail passenger or rail freight service provided the board are satisfied that the service is uneconomic. The last part of section 19 (2) is very important as far as this closure is concerned.  The wording is &ldquo;and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period&rdquo;.  CIE have made no effort to make the service economic.  It is a bad service. Those who attended protest meetings in the west know the type of service provided, the type of connections, the delays in delivering goods, and so on. With a little foresight and energy, an acceptable timetable could be drawn up which would make this service more attractive to people in the west to use it.</P>
    <P>There is a prospect of making this service economical within a reasonable period, if CIE would do the job which they were appointed to do, that is, to provide an efficient rail and freight service and go out and sell that service.  They have not made any attempt to sell their service so far. The Minister and the Government may try to shelter behind the Transport Act, 1958, and wash their hands of this issue.  I was very disappointed yesterday evening at the Minister's whole approach to the railway system. I dread to think what would happen <Col N="713" /> if CIE decided to terminate the services west of the Shannon and come no further than Athlone.  Would the Minister's approach be the same as he outlined here last night?  I do not think it should be.  Regardless of what the 1958 Act says, there is a question of accountability and CIE are accountable to this House.  We have to vote them money each year.  We have to give them a huge subvention, which has been increasing yearly.  This year it is in the region of £28 million and next year I believe it will be £40 million.  This money is voted to CIE to provide a rail and passenger service.  It comes from the taxpayers, and we in the west of Ireland pay our share of tax.  Surely in a matter such as this, which is of such vital importance to the development of the west, the Minister is entitled to intervene and to tell CIE he is not prepared to sacrifice the future prospects of the west for a lousy figure of £250,000. That is the figure mentioned by CIE. It is the projected loss given for the passenger service on this line.  As was pointed out by Deputy Barrett yesterday, it is very questionable.</P>
    <P>During the course of our discussions with CIE we failed to get a satisfactory answer as to how they arrived at the figure of £250,000.  As Deputy Barrett pointed out, in a recent statement the chairman of CIE said that labour costs represent 63 per cent of their total cost. On this line there are 30 men involved in the operation of the passenger service and after this closure 21 of them will become redundant.  They have an average wage of £2,000, which makes a total of approximately £60,000.  It can be worked out fairly conclusively that a more accurate figure of the loss on this line would be £100,000.  This is a very small figure&mdash;it is only one-quarter of 1 per cent of the total loss for the year for CIE.  It is a very small figure when one considers the amount they will be looking for next year.</P>
    <P>This closure is coming at a very bad time.  We all know the importance of a rail link for industrial development in any part of the country.  In the west we are trying to develop industries and all the State agencies are at their wits' end to attract industry to the western <Col N="714" /> region.  It is very disappointing to see at this time that one State agency, CIE, are pulling out of the west and, in effect, they are telling the world they have no confidence in the area, that it is not a viable proposition for them to operate there.</P>
    <P>The IDA, the county development teams, Gaeltarra Éireann, the Office of Public Works, the local authorities, the RDOs, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Bord Fáilte, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and many others are still trying to establish industry and create employment in the western region.  What effect will the pending closure have on their efforts?</P>
    <P>CIE may say that it is only the passenger service that is involved and the Minister spelled this out this evening. However, it is generally accepted in the west that the removal of the passenger service is only the first step towards the withdrawal of goods services and the subsequent closure of the line.</P>

      <P>I am worried about the Minister's remarks yesterday evening and today.  I must say to the Minister that I was disappointed at his attitude towards the deputation.  He received the people very courteously but I was disappointed at his approach last night when he said they would be better employed trying to get business for CIE.  That is not the function of the deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA have said that the removal of a freight line to the west would be a matter of serious concern to them.  We can well understand why it would worry them because they have to try to sell the various locations to industrialists.  Major industry is very thin on the ground in the west.  The IDA must offer every inducement to foreign industrialists to establish industries here.  We know that if they can be offered a rail link with connections to the south and to Dublin that would be an inducement to establish here.  When speaking on <Col N="715" /> the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power some time ago I recommended that foreign industrialists who were operating in the western region and who had heavy transport costs should be given some concessions on the trains to Dublin. Some of those trains are travelling with empty wagons and if my proposal were adopted it would be an added attraction to industrialists to establish themselves in the western region.  At the moment they cannot compete with undertakings on the eastern coast that do not have to face the additional heavy transport costs. In fact, CIE are implementing their policy of withdrawing their services from the western region with the decision they took some time ago to withdraw freight delivery from the Connemara area.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned the line we are discussing is more important than any other line that was closed. I realise that the Minister or some of the Deputies behind him may say that Fianna Fáil also closed down some lines.  That is quite true and I am not denying it but I would point out that this line is unique in many ways.  It is connecting Munster with Connacht.  It is an independent line &mdash;it cannot be described as a branch line&mdash;and, for that reason, it cannot be compared with the other lines that were closed in the past.  In addition, it is serving an area that is underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>In 1974 CIE published their rail plan for the eighties and one excerpt from that is sufficient to justify retention of this line.  They stated that &ldquo;where passenger services are uneconomic they will continue to be provided so long as the Government consider they are socially justified&rdquo;. That is very important because if the rail service is to be considered a social necessity surely this line must be first on the list.  In no place in the rest of the country is it more socially justified than in the west of Ireland.  Perhaps the Government think that retention of this line is not socially justified?  According to the Minister's statement last night, I am afraid that is their opinion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> It must be evident to everybody that the continuation of service on this line is socially justified.  Why then have CIE decided to discontinue the passenger service and substitute it with a bus service which is inadequate? The bus service is inadequate, firstly, because it will not serve many parts of the area concerned, and, secondly, because passengers on a bus have not the same comforts they would have if travelling on a train. They do not have sanitary or dining facilities which are available on a train, and it must be remembered that young children and old people need those facilities.</P>
    <P>This line is unique because of the number of trains going to Knock each season.  During the summer months about seven trains travel to Knock on that line every Sunday and a big number of invalids are carried on them.  How are those pilgrims to travel if this line is closed?  How can CIE facilitate those invalids on buses, many of whom must bring with them their wheelchairs and their crutches? It is very unfair to these people that the line is being closed down.  When the line is closed the Tuam Archdiocese will be the only diocese without a railway line.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht has been telling the people that it is his intention to establish a Western Development Board.  It is my view that until such time as this board is established&mdash;the Government have already publicly committed themselves to do this&mdash;the rail service should not be withdrawn.  If the rail service is withdrawn, it will make the work of the proposed board more difficult because the rail service was considered one of the assets which could be used in the development of the west.  For that reason it is futile for the board of CIE to talk of closing down the line at the same time as the Government are considering establishing a development board for the west.</P>
    <P>The roads to the west of Ireland are not capable of taking the express buses we are supposed to be getting. To make the roads fit for this type of transport we would need to spend a considerable amount of money on <Col N="717" /> them but the allocation to Galway County Council has been reduced by £101,000.  In 1975 the allocation was £772,450 while in 1976 the council will be getting £671,000.  Our requirement for 1976 was £985,710.  From this it can be seen that there is no possibility of bringing our roads up to a standard capable of catering for the kind of service proposed.</P>
    <P>With regard to selling the service, I can give an example which will illustrate why CIE are not getting the support they feel they are entitled to on this line.  At a meeting in Gort it was stated that it takes eight days for a small parcel to be conveyed from Dublin to Gort by rail.  That complaint was made by a businessman. How could CIE expect to get support for this line if that is the situation?  Similar delays are experienced in other towns along the line.</P>
    <P>Some time ago Castrol opened a depot in Athenry because they considered it would be cheaper and that they could give a better service to the garages in the west.  However, the deliveries for the garages in the west were brought from Athenry to Dublin and back down again.  Garages were getting a worse service from CIE than if Castrol continued to operate from Dublin.  That is another indication of why CIE were not supported.</P>
    <P>Tuam, one of the important towns in my constituency, will be affected if this line is closed.  One of the major industries in that town is the Tuam Sugar Factory and 70 per cent of the beet for this factory is conveyed by rail.  If this line is closed, and I have no doubt, irrespective of what the Minister may say in trying to justify CIE's action, that it will eventually close, the future of the factory is in jeopardy.  That factory is the major employer in that area.  The beet acreage this year has been increased but a disruption of the rail service would be disastrous for the factory.  A lot of beet was brought last year from the Mallow and Thurles factories to Tuam by rail but if the rail line is closed down, how will this be conveyed in future?</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that two years ago a private <Col N="718" /> haulier was engaged to draw sugar from the Thurles and Carlow factories to Tuam.  Where were the salesmen of CIE when this was happening? Why did CIE not attempt to get that contract?  At a meeting in Tuam when this matter was discussed I heard how CIE were treating the factories in Claremorris and Castlebar. In relation to this we should also consider that at present there are people operating off the west coast hoping to find oil and natural gas.  Some business people in Galway city are preparing for the day when natural gas and oil will be brought ashore.  In that event it is important that there should be a rail link to cope with this but, instead, the rail service is being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>CIE should not be allowed to continue their present method of planning in isolation and full emphasis should be placed on the future development of services to cater for the demands and the needs of the people in the west.  I should like to mention some anomalies in the service as it operates at present.  The afternoon Shannon-Galway bus service runs in direct competition with the 14.05 train from Limerick to Ballina.  Surely that is bad planning.  How can CIE expect the people to support both services? Station improvements which could easily be carried out during the week are done on Sundays and the workers are paid double time.  Why does this happen?  It is adding further to the bill submitted to us annually by CIE. The Ballina-Limerick service consists of one full journey in each direction daily and the locomotive involved is never shut down.  It idles for 12 hours and 21 minutes daily and in the process uses approximately five gallons of diesel per hour.  Is it any wonder CIE are running at a loss?  What happens in the case of the other 130 odd engines they have?  These are just a few illustrations of the type of service provided.  As far as telling us tonight, or at any other time, that the alternative service will be better than what we have we can only look at what happened in other parts of the country. A case in point was the closure of the Attymon-Loughrea line and the <Col N="719" /> service provided there to bring workers into Loughrea in the morning, workers who had to thumb their way home at night or hire a car.  That is the type of alternative service and there is no point in saying a bus service will be better.  It will not.  I am appealing to the Minister even at this late stage to use his influence with CIE because I am sure, having appointed the board, as Deputy Donnellan has pointed out, then if they do not do what he asks them he can sack them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a rather awkward position when talking about the rail passenger service between Limerick and Claremorris. People have been protesting and they have asked me to approach the Government about the closure of this passenger service.  I might say hard things about the Minister and the board but, since the 1958 Act came into operation, a great many lines have been closed here, there and everywhere. Those closures never split the Fianna Fáil Party and the closure of this line between Limerick and Claremorris will not keep me from supporting this Government on this occasion.  The fact is the Minister has not the first or last say in this matter.  I did a little research and I have here a couple of quotations from prominent Members of this House.  I have two in particular. Both these Members are now deceased.  I refer to the late Deputy Seán Lemass and the late Deputy Childers.  The late Deputy Lemass, speaking as Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Transport Bill, 1958, had this to say at column 1595 of Volume 167 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>This Bill empowers the board to close down any line or any station for which there is clearly no future. It empowers them to close down a line or station on their own decision without having to seek the prior approval of the Transport Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are, however, given a statutory direction not to terminate any rail service, except where they first satisfy themselves that there are no prospects of its continued operation <Col N="720" /> being economic within a reasonable period.  The board are, of course, also placed under a general obligation so to conduct the undertaking as to eliminate losses on its working by 31st March, 1964. That means, in effect, that the fate of any branch line or any station, depends on whether sufficient business is generated to justify its retention and the future of these lines and stations will be determined primarily, therefore, by the amount of local support given to them.</P>
    <P>The effect of that arrangement is to put local communities in the position that they will have to make up their minds whether they can keep a railway service going.  A railway service can be justified only if there is local need for it and local support sufficient to keep it going.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies opposite are critical of the Minister and the board of CIE but that is what the late Deputy Seán Lemass had to say on the Transport Bill of 1958.  One could find many quotations.  I have just picked two. The second is the late Deputy Childers speaking on the same Bill.  He had this to say at column 541 of Volume 186 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>One last word.  The terms of the 1958 Act made it clear to every Deputy that CIE would drastically alter the character of services.  In giving CIE exceutive power to close uneconomic lines every Deputy knew this could only be done in the public interest by rejecting the short-lived universal protests prevalent here and elsewhere against railway closings at the time that such intentions are made public. They are responsible and they alone for making this decision; they ordained and wrote the new policy into the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>In the course of the protest about the closure of this line the chairman and the Board of CIE have got a great deal of stick.  I know the chairman of the board and some of the members of the board quite well and I believe we have as good a chairman and as good a board as ever we had despite people saying that it would be as well to sack these gentlemen.  From the <Col N="721" /> start of this protest the emphasis was generally concentrated on the Galway section of the line from Gort, Loughrea, Athenry and Tuam.  If yesterday one had taken away from the protesters outside the gate here the people from Tuam and Athenry the protesters would have been very small in number indeed, less than five.  The alleged protesters from Limerick, Clare and Mayo were conspicuous by their absence.</P>
    <P>The people from Athenry were the first to kick off.  They held a meeting four or five weeks ago to which all the public representatives in Galway were invited.  Some did not attend and they probably had good reason for not doing so.  I was asked as a result of that meeting to arrange a meeting with the Board of CIE and the chairman. First of all, the people wanted a meeting with the Minister.  Eventually they decided they would meet the chairman and the board and we had a very long meeting at which a powerful case was made for the retention of this line.  One would think, listening to Deputy Hussey, that the whole line was going. It is the passenger service that is being withdrawn.  The line is being left and a bus service is being substituted for the present passenger service.  On a second deputation to the Minister there were representatives of every station from Limerick to Claremorris.  Business interests and other interests connected with the railway were represented and some of them were outside the gate yesterday.</P>
    <P>When in 1974 they were informed, although not officially, that CIE proposed to withdraw the passenger service from the Limerick-Claremorris line they said they did not mind as long as the freight service remained.  Seemingly when some lobbying got going some of these people, for one reason or another, decided to jump on the band wagon and get a little publicity. I do not think their intentions were as honourable as they expressed them to be.  Personally, I would like to see the passenger service retained, but it is very had to make a case for its retention.  Indeed, I would much prefer to see it being withdrawn under some other Government than under this Government. I mean that sincerely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly some of them were, but some of the Deputy's supporters talked loudly about it, too. CIE propose to substitute a number of buses for the passenger service. There are now eight buses for Tuam alone and there will be a further two. Surely ten buses must be better than one train, and it is quite possible that at some time in the future people will be able to say: &ldquo;We were wrong about the removal of the passenger service because the bus service with which CIE have replaced it has proved more efficient and can get you from one place to another much faster&rdquo;.  CIE themselves say these buses provide faster travel in comparable comfort, and they also say it may mean an improvement in the service rather than a disimprovement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hussey said that 70 per cent of the beet brought into the Tuam Sugar Factory last year went by train.  Surely this change will not stop it from doing the same this year. If there is twice or three times as much beet brought to the Tuam factory this year, the freight service is still there.  It is wrong for people to suggest that the rail line is going entirely.  A great deal of rail line was removed over the past number of years.  In fact, I have a list of them here from 1958 onwards.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they removed a total of 732 miles of railway line, both passenger and freight. Not alone that but the tracks were taken up and sold along with the ground they were on and whatever other property was in the area. Therefore, if one is to talk about this in a political sense, there is no justification for blaming the Minister or the Government for removing a passenger service and replacing it with a bus service when, as I say, Fianna Fáil removed 732 miles of railway since 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that there should be a postponement of the closure for a few months, that people might start to support the line and it might become viable, and also that <Col N="723" /> the loss was only £250,000.  Deputy Hussey made what I thought was a very sensible comment when he referred to the fact that the Western Development Board was being set up some time this year.  When we are talking about western development we are talking about it in its entirety and in doing so it is necessary to have a rail service there.  However, I have no doubt that, in the light of this development board being set up, the Minister for Transport and Power and the board of CIE, if they think a passenger train service between Limerick and Claremorris is necessary it will be provided.  Once the lines are there it is always possible to get the train back on them.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years there was emigration from the west.  That exists no longer, and there is no longer a fall in population in the west.  Efforts are being made quite successfully to industrialise the west.  The industrial development officer who acted as chairman of the protest committee expressed the opinion, and I suppose quite justifiably, that, if the west was to be denuded of rail services it would make it more difficult for him in his capacity as industrial officer in Galway to get industrialists to come to towns such as Loughrea, Athenry, Tuam, Claremorris, and so on.  In saying that he was, I think, presupposing that the removal of the freight services would automatically follow the removal of the passenger service.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister that we in the west of Ireland do not want CIE, at any stage in the future, to put a notice in the paper giving the minimum statutory notice of two months that they intend to close the freight service.  As a representative of the area, I want to say clearly that I would not support the Government on that.  If the freight service is not there it will be all the more difficult to set up the industries that mean so much to Galway.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned GAA specials.  I am informed by the Minister and CIE that there will be no interference with any special trains. They will run on the same lines as in <Col N="724" /> the past.  There will be no such thing as rerouting from one station to another.  On that ground there can be no complaint.  Reference was also made to the Knock special and as far as I know that will not be interfered with either.  The Minister and CIE have said clearly that there will be no change in this and trains will run in a similar pattern to that in the past.</P>
    <P>When the western development board is set up, the people who are protesting now about the closure of this passenger service should be given ample opportunity to meet the board. If there is sufficient growth of population and industrial development in the west, and if there is a need to return this passenger service between Limerick and Claremorris, it can be returned.  That, of course, will happen if the bus service to be laid on by CIE proves unsatisfactory.  It is possible that this bus service will be better than the passenger rail service provided in the past.</P>
    <P>CIE said that they intend to develop a number of stations between Limerick and Claremorris.  They said that major rail heads catering for all rail freight services would be set up in Limerick, Ennis and Claremorris and that a palletised fertiliser rail depot&mdash;sundries are under review&mdash;in the Gort, Athenry and Tuam stations. It is not traditional for people to travel from north to south.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much more traditional for people to travel from east to west.  If one were to go on the passenger train in Tuam on any day, over the past number of years, one would note that the number of people travelling is very small.  In a fortnight last summer less than £5 was taken in at the Gort station.  Regardless of the public protest being made for the retention of this line, I feel there is a lack of public support for it.  It does not operate at such a loss, because £250,000 in relation to the entire subvention for CIE is small.  Any saving is worthwhile and the buses which are being put on now will pay for themselves, but if £250,000 is saved, I hope CIE will put it into other services for the west.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to support the motion in the names of Deputy Barrett and his colleagues.  I am very disappointed that there has not been any protest from the Government benches about the closure of the passenger service of the Limerick-Claremorris line.  The Minister reminded us last night of a Dáil Deputy, now deceased, who, as Shakespeare said, protested too much at a particular CIE closure and later went on to lose his seat.  This message must have got home to Government Deputies.</P>
      <P>I do not see why this closure should become a political football.  It has not been in any of the meetings we had so far.  The deputation from the west represented all shades of political opinion.  It was led by the Galway County Manager who pointed out that we in the west feared that this was the thin end of the wedge so far as railways were concerned.  The commitment of the people in the west to the continuance of a rail passenger service on this line must have been obvious to the Minister at that meeting. We fear that this line will be eventually closed and other lines serving the west will suffer the same fate.</P>
      <P>The deputation which met the Minister on 3rd March could not travel by rail that morning to keep their appointment with the Minister.  That in itself is an example of the service which is available in the west at the moment.  The county manager and the county development officer are to be congratulated on the excellent work they did in preparing their case.  I believe the Minister was grossly unfair to the Western Action Group in his reply last night when he said they would be better off to organise trade for CIE and freight for the line rather than organising protests and pickets. Surely it is the function of CIE to make their service more attractive.  If they do this, they will get the support of the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the picket was that the Taoiseach refused to meet them.  Perhaps the Minister expected the deputation to arrive in sackcloth and ashes.  He met them on Ash Wednesday.  He must have been impressed by the fine case they put <Col N="726" /> up.  As was pointed out, this is the biggest ever CIE closure.  The bare two months' notice, which the company are statutorily compelled to give, were all that were given in this case. We believe the Government should have shown more resistance and we are asking that a reprieve be given for a further period and the quality of the service improved.  This would encourage more people to use the service.  The line serves a vast area. It is the only line connecting Munster directly with Connacht, stretching from Limerick to Mayo and running through four counties.  It serves the important towns of Ennis, Tuam, Gort and Athenry.  Its closure was not included in CIE's Rail Plan, 80.  There is the question, too, of redundancies. The people of Athenry were the first to show their concern in this regard when they organised a meeting to discuss the situation.  In all there will be a loss of 21 jobs with resulting hardship for the workers and their families.  The decision is particularly reprehensible at a time of high unemployment because it will affect both the farming community and the business people of the areas.  Both existing and potential industries will be affected because industrialists will fear a total closure.</P>
    <P>Among the reasons given for the closure is that the service is losing money but it should be pointed out that nowhere in the EEC are railways a paying proposition.  Therefore, we must ask why the west of Ireland is being chosen on this occasion.  We are told that the annual loss on the service is £250,000.  That is a nice even figure but CIE do not give us a breakdown of the receipts and expenses. It might be more convincing for them to give us figures either of £249,000 or £251,000.  If the total loss is £250,000 on the passenger trains alone, this means a loss of £1,400 per day, a figure which seems impossible. Therefore, the figure given would seem to be totally exaggerated.</P>
    <P>Another reason given for the closure is the cost of maintaining the line but it will still have to be maintained at goods standard.  In addition, CIE's wage bill will be <Col N="727" /> reduced considerably by reason of the 21 redundancies.  In other words, it would appear that the total loss must be less than £100,000 or less than a quarter of 1 per cent of the company's projected total loss for 1976. This amount is very small when one considers that the subvention for CIE last year was in the region of £28 million.  For the small amount involved by way of loss, a real service is being removed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred last evening to the Transport Act, 1958.  Section 19, subsection (2), of that Act states that the board shall not terminate a service unless they are satisfied that its operation is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.  We are not told by CIE why they consider this line to be uneconomic.  They are not giving us any figures but if my figures are correct, the line is not uneconomic when compared with other lines both in Ireland and in other countries.  Another aspect of the matter is that CIE have a social as well as a commercial role.  They tell us that there is a limit to their social function but if the annual loss on this line is less than £100,000 they must fulfil their social role in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The other reason given for the closure is poor passenger support. On the face of it, this may be correct but we must ask what the quality of the service is like and what attempts have the company made to sell the line.  Should they not have been able to take advantage of their position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the private motorist during the past few years when there have been massive increases in petrol prices, 12 increases in all which have brought the cost of a gallon of petrol from 36p in March, 1973, to almost 90p today or an increase of 52p?  There have been increases, too, in motor taxation and insurance has increased by more than 70 per cent in that time.  Despite this situation, CIE do not appear to have made any attempt to go after that market and there must be such a market in the <Col N="728" /> west of Ireland.  The service is needed, for instance, to bring students to colleges in addition to bringing workers to their places of employment. In the west we want a service that is as good as any in the southern, the eastern or the northern parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I would refer briefly to the proposed substitute bus service.  Past experience has shown only too forcibly that CIE do not honour their promises.  One example in this regard is the proposed luxury service which they said would replace the Kiltymon-Loughrea passenger train. The service they have inaugurated to replace the train service is such that while it brings workers to Loughrea in the mornings it will not serve the purpose of returning them to their homes in the evening.  This creates much difficulty for the people of the area, many of whom I have witnessed hitching lifts home.</P>
    <P>In addition, the roads in the west are not suited to the purpose of these proposed luxury buses.  They are taxed almost to their maximum in catering for existing traffic.  Apart from this, they do not serve the towns of Craughwell, Athenry and Ballyglunin. Instead, they continue on the main road to Galway city.  Travellers from Limerick to Tuam and Claremorris do not wish to go via Galway where they may be held up for long periods in traffic jams.  Similarly, travellers from Ennis and Gort to Dublin who now travel via Athenry will in the future have to go to Galway by bus in order to connect with the Dublin train.</P>
    <P>Another factor in this is that the allocation for roads to Galway County Council has been reduced by more than £100,000 this year compared with last year.  The Limerick-Claremorris train for all its faults, some of which we have mentioned, has walk-around space, dining facilities and sanitary and washing facilities. CIE's regulations compel them to provide sanitary facilities on all train journeys exceeding one-and-a-half hours.  Elderly people and children need frequent access to these facilities. There are no sanitary or washing <Col N="729" /> facilities on the proposed luxury buses where any journeys exceed the one-and-a-half hours prescribed by CIE's health regulations.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the train journey from Ballina to Limerick takes 3 hours 55 minutes whereas the bus journey over the same route takes 4 hours 45 minutes.  In other words, the bus journey takes three-quarters of an hour longer.  I should like to refer to the reply the Minister gave to Deputy Loughnane on 11th March, Official Report, Volume 288, No. 12, column 1859, when he said:</P>
    <P>I am very keen to see that every traveller on CIE is carried as comfortably and as quickly as possible to his chosen point of destination.</P>
    <P>The Minister said those words to night also.  I should like to ask him how he can reconcile that statement with the fact that those buses will take three-quarters of an hour longer to do the same journey the train does.  We should be concerned, as the Minister says, that CIE carry people as comfortably and as quickly as possible to their chosen point of destination.</P>
    <P>There is excursion traffic on this line, as has already been pointed out, apart from the weekday passenger trains.  Mention has been made of the GAA specials and of the seaside trains which cover this route.  Indeed, of great importance, are the Knock pilgrimage trains.  All such trains from Munster use this route every Sunday from May to October.  Each train carries roughly 400 to 500 passengers. The Minister told us that those trains will function this year.  What guarantee have we that those trains will continue to function every year?  Buses could not cope with such huge numbers of pilgrims nor could one rail route into Claremorris via Athlone handle this traffic.  A huge increase in this traffic is expected as we approach the centenary year.  The archbishop of Tuam has expressed concern about those trains as well.</P>
    <P>The board of CIE informed the deputation that they were pursuing their policy of developing their services in the west.  This may be so but one gets the feeling that they are developing the road services at the expense <Col N="730" /> of the rail services.  There is duplication of passenger train and bus services on the Claremorris-Limerick line with the bus departing 20 minutes ahead of the train.  In other words, the bus service runs in direct competition with the Claremorris-Limerick line.  It is most unfair competition.</P>
    <P>A further example I can give is that a weekend return Ballina to Claremorris rail ticket costs £1.40. The upward journey is made by rail and the downward one is made by bus as there is no Sunday service to Ballina yet.  Out of that £1.40 a sum of £1.35 goes to the bus service and 5p is credited to the rail service.  It is about time the bus service began to pay for itself.</P>
    <P>CIE services in the west can be measured by the fact that it takes eight days for a small parcel to travel from Dublin to Gort.  This has already been pointed out.  A further example I can give is that a parcel sent from Claremorris to Tuam travels first to Dublin, then down to Galway and eventually arrives at Tuam.  Similar delays are experienced at all stations along the line.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot nowadays about developing the west.  Prior to the west Mayo by-election the Minister for the Gaeltacht announced the setting up of the Western Development Board. I would like to refer to a reply I received to a parliamentary question I put to the Minister for the Public Service.  He said:</P>
    <P>The organisation and structure of the Western Development Board is being examined at present by the Departments concerned before beginning consultation with interested bodies.  It is not possible to say at this stage what the implications for various agencies, authorities and local bodies will be when the board is set up.  This will depend on the powers and functions ultimately assigned to the board.</P>
    <P>It seems ironic to me at times when various Departments are examining the organisation and structure of the proposed western board that the Government are allowing the Limerick-Claremorris line to be discontinued. Indeed, from what we have heard <Col N="731" /> the Government are approving the decision of CIE.  We must ask if the Government are genuinely interested in developing the west.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, the man who is accountable for the decisions of CIE, should not allow this to happen particularly as the proposed Western Development Board is to be set up.  I understand it will co-ordinate the services which already exist in the west of Ireland. Certainly, no decision should be taken concerning the removal of the passenger service on this line until the Western Development Board is set up.  Surveys have been carried out by various bodies in the west.  For example, in the towns of Tuam, Athenry and Loughrea, the various bodies there have met and have put forward proposals and alternative timetables to CIE.  Every year when the Estimates are discussed Members of the Oireachtas put forward proposals but, unfortunately, these seem to fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned that a reprieve should be given to this line for a further period so that negotiations can take place among the interested parties.  We are also asking that the quality of the service be improved. We feel in that way that the Claremorris-Limerick line may be made more attractive and that the local people will use it.  The last thing I want to refer to is the development that is taking place at the moment in north-west Connacht.  A railway line would be of immense benefit to the industrialists who might come into the area and to the people in the area.  It is very important, with all this development and the proposed board that is to be set up, that this line be given a reprieve and that the quality of the service is improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is my duty as a Deputy from the west and a Government Deputy to express the opinions of the workers and the people in that area on the passenger service from Ballina to Limerick being taken from us.  I come from a county which has suffered drastically <Col N="732" /> as a result of the closure of lines.  The Achill line to Westport was closed. The line from Killala to Ballina was closed.  This would be of tremendous help if we had it at the moment.  The line from Ballinrobe to Claremorris was closed and the old line from Collooney to Claremorris was also closed.  This had provided a passenger and freight service in the area. Recently we had the demotion of the Ballyhaunis railway station which handled freight.</P>
      <P>It is my duty to put before the Minister the concern of some of the people in the west, particularly the workers who do not know where they are and who are frightened as a result of the passenger service from Ballina to Limerick being taken from them. They feel this is the thin end of the wedge.  I have an assurance from the Minister that this is not the case.  No country in the world has a railway system which pays.  The line from Ballina provides a link with Limerick and the south.  This is one of the biggest closures we have had.  I do not know whether it is wise.  The board of CIE feel it is.  Under the 1958 Act the Minister has not got great power over the board.  Other State-sponsored bodies were set up by Fianna Fáil Governments.  They gave too much power to those boards.</P>
      <P>Deputy McLaughlin put down a question to the Minister for Transport and Power about CIE.  The Ceann Comhairle told him he regretted having to disallow the question addressed to the Minister concerning the delivery by CIE of goods.  He said it was a matter for CIE and the Minister had no official responsibility in regard to it.  It is a sad situation that any Deputy elected by the people should not be entitled to get an answer from the Minister in charge of a particular Department.  This is why I say all State-sponsored bodies have too much power.  There are good technical men in the State-sponsored bodies who see things in their own light and not as they are seen by the workers and the general public.  I am voicing their opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case we will have the displacement of workers who will have <Col N="733" /> to get gratuities and pensions.  Would it not be better to keep them in employment? They may have to receive unemployment benefit at a later stage. I wonder is this good economics.  A Private Members' motion has been put down by the Opposition.  Every western Deputy is in favour of a transport system for the west.  I would hate to see the Opposition challenging a division on this motion. Things are improving in the west and we hate to see any displacement in the services there.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the bus service will give a better service to the people who will avail of it but I have my doubts about that.  A bus cannot provide the same service as a train where you can have a cup of tea and where there are toilets, and so on.  If this closure is the policy of the board of CIE there is very little the Minister can do about it.</P>
    <P>In 1958-59 there were five closures.  In 1959-60 there were seven closures.  In 1960-61 there were three closures.  That all happened under Fianna Fáil.  In 1962-63 there were 13 branch line closures.  The board at that time said they were uneconomic and they were closed.  As a Government Deputy I have to support my Minister and the Government on this issue.  That is exactly what members of Fianna Fáil did when the other closures took place. I have no intention of voting against the Government.  I will support them but I want to pinpoint my views and the views of the workers and the general public who have come to me protesting about it.  I attended several meetings held with a view to bringing pressure on the Minister to keep the line open.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my notice that the trains from Ballina to Limerick are not run at the proper time.  Surely the train should leave Ballina at 9 o'clock or some time like that in the morning to bring people to Limerick at a reasonable time and bring them back that night.  I am led to believe that a train leaves Ballina at around 3 o'clock.  Therefore people have to stay overnight in Limerick.  This is <Col N="734" /> why the service has failed.  I am sorry the date of 5th April has been fixed.  It is a pity that a train could not leave at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning from Ballina for Limerick. If that were given a chance for six months, I guarantee it would get support from the general public. The management of CIE have not looked into this case properly.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with the Minister on this matter I was told that the freight services will be continued on the line and that will be a good thing.  The Minister has given an assurance that this proposed closure is not the thin end of the wedge as was stated by some Deputies on the other side.  We hope that when the Western Development Board are set up they will look into this matter in a rather different way and perhaps the passenger service from Ballina to Limerick will be brought back. I would be very happy if this were done and I know many people would be satisfied also.</P>

      <P>As one of those who signed the motion I should like to speak a few words in favour of it. It was not put down for political reasons but because a very representative meeting asked for the matter to be raised in the Dáil and the Government Deputies who attended that meeting were asked to sign the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deputation who met the Minister reflected all shades of political opinion.  It included three county development officers, at least one county manager, the chairmen of Ennis UDC and of Tuam Town Commissioners as well as a number of business people. Not only did the deputation protest about the proposed closure but they gave positive recommendations to the Minister on how the service could be improved.  They also pointed out that the people in the areas considered this was the thin end of the wedge because this is what happened in areas where passenger services have been discontinued. We had proof of that in the Balla-Swinford-Kiltimagh-Ballyhaunis areas a short time ago when the freight services were discontinued.  If the <Col N="735" /> Minister tells us he has no power over CIE to stop this closure, then the assurances he has given to Deputy Finn are of very little use if CIE decide to close the line.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed with the Minister's speech yesterday because he appeared to have accepted that there was no means by which CIE could be made viable.  The impression seemed to be that if this small passenger service was closed it might repair one of the small leaks in CIE. What is needed is a complete reappraisal and a general rethink of all CIE policies.</P>
    <P>One thing that appears to have come out of the debate is that the &ldquo;specials&rdquo; will be continued from Limerick to Claremorris and on to Knock.  It was stated at the deputation that the line would not be abandoned but that it would not be maintained to the standard required for passenger services.  It was also stated that only a small maintenance team will be kept on this line.  I am asking the Minister if he is satisfied that the line will be safe for the &ldquo;specials&rdquo; to travel on, in view of the information given to us and which was given to the trade union representative who spoke at the deputation.  I sympathise with Deputy Donnellan and with Deputy Finn.</P>

      <P>It was rather a case of Hobson's choice for them.  I can remember the fine, fiery speech Deputy Donnellan made at the deputation meeting.  That speech might even be called an ultimatum to the Minister.  I can remember the Deputy standing up, shaking his fist and saying to the Minister, &ldquo;You put them there and you have the power to sack them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy likes I will go a little further.  He said we had come from west Mayo and that we appeared to have a certain success <Col N="736" /> in the appeal we made.  He shook his fist and said to the Minister, &ldquo;You put them there; you have the power to sack them unless they do what you tell them.&rdquo;  It was a very different speech from the one the Deputy made in the House this evening.  However, as I have told the Deputy, I have a certain sympathy for him.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that there will be a vast improvement in the line from Dublin to Ballina and that this improvement is already there.  I am sorry to disagree with the Minister but I must tell him that this line is nothing short of deplorable.</P>

      <P>An improvement is badly needed.  Anything that is done will be better than what is there now. CIE do not appear to consider any suggestions that come from the people who are using their services. We had the example of the train that left Westport at 8.05 a.m.; the service was used extensively but it was discontinued. People who travel to Ballina for the weekend must get a bus from Ballina station to Claremorris for the return journey.  The journey by bus takes one hour, 30 minutes or one hour, 45 minutes instead of the 40 minutes by train.  The closure of this line will mean that students from this area who attend at UCG will now have to travel by bus, a journey which will take much longer.  From my own experience I know that the journey will not be a comfortable one.</P>

      <P>We were told about previous closures by Deputies Donnellan and Finn and I am prepared to say that many of them were mistakes but I am not prepared to admit that they were as important as a through link; they were all ends.  The mistakes made then are now being compounded and it appears that we have learned little from them. Section 19, subsection (2), of the Transport Act, 1958, states:</P>
      <P>The Board shall not terminate a service unless it is satisfied that its operation is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>One of the suggestions made by the deputation was that CIE adopt a different timetable; that they would consider the use of freight cars and would, in general, try to cater for the needs of the community.  They asked that their suggestions be given a chance but their appeals fell on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>We are now approaching a period when the line will show a profit.  Almost every Sunday from now until the end of the summer season more than 400 people use the trains on this line travelling to Knock.  The Minister should have told CIE to keep the line open on a trial basis, look into the suggestions made by the deputation and the alternative timetable prepared by a member of that deputation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed at the Minister's condemnation of the picket because they are fighting to save a passenger service.  The Minister felt they would have been better employed if they had tried to organise freight.  That is ominous and indicates that not only have CIE axed the passenger service but that they have decided to take the freight service from this area in the near future.</P>

      <P>We did not put down this motion solely for political reasons. It was put down at the request of the action committee and the deputation who met the Minister and CIE representatives. We gave the opportunity to Government Deputies to sign this motion because it was being put down at the request of people from their own parties.  Prior to putting down the motion we endeavoured to submit questions but they were refused.  It was held that this was a matter for the board of CIE.  Many meetings were held and a deputation met the Minister and CIE representatives but all this action was to no avail.  It was then that the motion was put down to which the Government have put down an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our motion contains the true feelings of the people who are concerned about the closure of this line. The Minister referred to my use of the word &ldquo;closure&rdquo;.  Closing a passenger service from Limerick to Claremorris in my view is a closure. We did not seek to keep the line open indefinitely because we are aware of the tremendous losses within CIE. That has always been the concern of Members on this side of the House <Col N="739" /> but, nevertheless, we realise that CIE have a function apart from the economic function.  They have a social function.  Surely the keeping of this line in operation up through the west of Ireland could only be described as a social function.  Government Deputies have referred to previous closures but I should like to remind them that these were not closures of this magnitude.  This is a main line from Limerick to Claremorris and the previous closures were branch lines.  The statements made by the late Seán Lemass and the late Erskine Childers in 1958 were made in the context of that period.  We could find quotations made by the then Opposition which would help our case but we did not resort to that.</P>
    <P>During the course of his contribution Deputy Donnellan said that £5 was the total takings at Gort station for two weeks.  He may be correct but it should be remembered that CIE bear the responsibility for this.  Over a number of years they allowed this line to run down and it seems to have been their policy to allow this happen.  Why, for example, is the timetable not suited for connection with mainline trains in Claremorris and Limerick?  If CIE were concerned about maintaining the line as a viable proposition why did they introduce the expressway bus services in conjunction with this line?  They went into open competition through the expressway buses and now they come along to us weeping and crying because the service is losing a quarter of a million pounds.  It is mainly because of their own actions the service is losing this £250,000.</P>
    <P>We have asked questions, to which we expected replies, as to how this figure of £250,000 was arrived at and we got neither a reply nor a breakdown of the figure.  As I said tonight and as other speakers said last night, this figure is suspect.  It will remain suspect because the chairman has stated that of the total costings in CIE 63 per cent represents labour costs.  If we accept that statement as correct, the total cost of labour on this particular line&mdash;30 people on <Col N="740" /> £2,000 a year&mdash;is £60,000.  We will be generous and say the total cost cannot be more than £100,000.  If we are wrong, why are we not told we are wrong?  We can only believe we are right in our suspicions about this figure of £250,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan found fault with the deputation.  He said it was not representative of the area or it was representative of only a very small area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>All we are looking for is a reprieve of six months for this main line.  We are not talking now about a branch line.  The Minister said the deputation and we had a negative approach. <Col N="741" /> That is not correct.  We have not a negative approach.</P>

      <P>I give fair warning to the House that if instead of organising meetings, parades and pickets... they had been organising trade for CIE and behaving in a positive way to help maintain that line for freight they would be far better occupied. It is a negative way of opposing something which I know a lot of them in their hearts know is inevitable.</P>
      <P>That is from the unrevised report and there the Minister talks about a negative approach.</P>

      <P>The Minister was speaking about the deputation.  That deputation, whether representative or otherwise, put forward alternative proposals to the Minister and CIE.  They asked for a six months' reprieve to test the alternative proposals but that will not be granted.</P>
      <P>Last night we showed a positive approach.  We asked the Minister during these six months to approach the social commissioner of the EEC in order to ascertain if moneys would be forthcoming from the social fund for this particular line because of its social amenity function.</P>

      <P>The man in question is a west of Ireland man and, for the Deputy's information, on a recent visit to Brussels I inquired if there was any point in making an application and I was told by those operating this fund that that should be done. It is worth trying and it should be done.  Coming back to this figure of £100,000, if we can get a grant from the social fund it will not cost a great deal to save this line.  Talking about £100,000 or even £250,000, whichever is the correct figure, it is a very tiny sum in relation to £20 million.  The Minister said last night that £40 million would have to be found for the rail section of CIE this year.  If CIE have to start pruning the rail system by closing a main line, as is proposed here, why do they not consider alternative economies available to them in other sections of their operations? Why are there 12 CIE staff cars operating out of Limerick station? Remember, that is only one station in the whole rail complex.  Why do they not take a look at operations like that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It arises out of two questions I had down today to the Minister for Local Government. One expressed concern about the unfinished state of a major road improvement at Fontstown on the Kilcullen/Athy <Col N="745" /> Road, County Kildare, and the other was a request for enough money to bring the Kildare national primary roads up to standard. The latter question is down in my name and in the names of many other Deputies from the west and the south who are forced to travel along the Kildare Road on their way to Dublin.</P>
      <P>During Question Time today the Minister suggested that when I had not a reasoned case to make I resorted to abuse.  I am sorry he should construe my criticism as abuse, but I suppose when one is thin skinned and feels guilty, as the Minister must do, he is more susceptible to deserved criticism and feels resentful on that account.</P>
      <P>The case I wish to make here tonight has already been made to the Minister by the county manager and the county engineer in a letter of the 4th February last to his Department. This case was made by two reasonable people.  It was not advanced for any party political reasons or anything like that.  It was advanced purely from a desire to improve the roads of Kildare or, failing that, even to maintain them at their present level.  The Minister tried to indicate that he had knowledge of the last county council meeting in Kildare and that the county engineer had changed his mind since he wrote that letter.  I attended that meeting and paid great attention to anything the county engineer said, or that anyone said on his behalf, and at no time was I made aware that the county engineer had changed his opinion about the allocation of money and the need for more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also tell the Minister that a Deputy from his own Party and county councillors from the two wings of the National Coalition looked for a deputation to visit him some time ago.  I presume this request was conveyed to him but so far we have had no indication from the Minister that he is prepared to meet us.  At Question Time today I advanced a theory that more money came out of Kildare by way of taxation of motor vehicles than was given back <Col N="746" /> to us by way of road grant.  The Minister appeared to disagree with me at that point.  I hope to be in a position in the time allotted to me to show that £750,000 was gathered in Kildare last year from taxation of motor vehicles and we got back 72 per cent in grants.  If the Road Fund keeps at the same level this year, it is hoped that £1 million will be collected in Kildare this year from motor taxation and if the Minister is as generous with us as he was last year, the least we should get would be £792,000. As I will show now, this is not the case.</P>
    <P>The grant we got for the upkeep of national primary roads in 1976 was £94,000 and for the upkeep of national secondary roads we got £21,500&mdash;an allowance of £115,500 for the upkeep of both primary and secondary roads.  For the improvement of our national primary roads we have been given the princely sum of £180,000.  That has also to cover whatever improvements we might envisage for our national secondary roads.  That is a total allocation for the upkeep and improvement of our national primary and national secondary roads of £295,000.  We have already indicated to the Minister how it is proposed to spend the money on improving our national primary roads at various centres.  We will spend £23,000 at Monasterevin and we will provide public lighting in Naas and Newbridge.  I need hardly stress how important this is because with the great volume of traffic, our roads are very vulnerable to accidents.  Our accident history in Kildare is deplorable.</P>
    <P>A matter of vital importance was raised by Fine Gael councillors.  They have very strong feelings about this. They are very vexed that the Minister has seen fit to provide only £10,000 to by-pass Naas.  That £10,000 will be spent to build a bungalow for a lady whose house is in the line of the new road.  The Minister has had second thoughts about the type of roads we should have. Also, we will spend £40,000 in the completion of works at Moyvalley, Maynooth, Leixlip and Kilcock while £100,000 will be spent at Moyvalley <Col N="747" /> Bridge.  In this way the £180,000 will be used.  We received also a block grant of £170,000 for the improvement of our county roads and for traffic management works.  I will endeavour to show that this amount will not go very far in the work we hope to undertake.</P>
    <P>When he wrote to the Minister in February last the county manager expressed deep concern regarding the position in our county.  He referred to a report he had had from the county engineer which indicated that the nature of the works required to cater for the volume of traffic in County Kildare was great.  He pointed out that the county engineer's report had very serious implications regarding the continuation of employment of workers in the council service.  He referred particularly to the position of lorry drivers and plant operators who were associated with the council's machinery yard.  He pointed out that if sufficient money was not available by way of grant, it would not be possible to provide these people with an alternative form of employment because their services would not be used in the roadworks as a result of the decreased grants in that area.  The county manager summed up the situation by saying that a substantial increase was needed in the grant allocation to Kildare County Council in the coming year and that if this was not forthcoming, he would be forced to lay off men who would normally find employment in the council services when money is made available to enable the council to undertake essential work on road improvements.</P>
    <P>This is not an entirely selfish outlook because, as has been pointed out on numerous occasions, the improvement of the roads in Kildare would help the tourist industry particularly in the context of the west.  I am confident that if any foreign industrialist thinking of setting up here were persuaded to travel out the western road, in order that he might examine potential locations in the west, by the time he would have negotiated the roads to Leixlip and Kilcock he would turn back because of the deplorable condition <Col N="748" /> of this part of the journey. Resolutions have been passed by many other counties seeking to have the roads in Kildare improved. Recently, we adopted a resolution passed by Leitrim County Council in this regard.  The appearance of the names of other Deputies on the Order Paper in this regard is an indication of their interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>In his letter to the Department the county manager also said that instead of providing additional moneys for the coming year, central government had not taken into account the rate of inflation or the question of increased costs with the result that in real terms less money is being provided now than in former years.  In the final paragraph of his letter he stressed that the implications for employment within the county were serious if more money were not forthcoming.  He included with his letter a report from the county engineer.  This man is highly qualified and is a wonderful engineer. He is not prone to using words lightly. No doubt he is held in high esteem by the various other members of his profession.  In his report he indicated that for the past two years he has been very concerned regarding the works carried out in the county and that the present year was one of particular concern in this regard because the amount of grants in real money terms had been reduced with the effect that there was increasing over-expenditure on improvement works on both national primary and national secondary roads and that there was a marked decline in the standard of the upkeep of our roads.</P>
    <P>He indicated, too, that in regard to our national primary roads we would need £587,000.  The amount we received was £180,000.  He made the point also that for the continuity of work it was necessary to be able to buy land in advance.  At least two years should be the norm.  It is hardly necessary for me to emphasise to the Minister the necessity of having a sufficient float and, if necessary, to obtain compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>When all these matters were taken into account, the county engineer assessed a figure of £620,000 as being <Col N="749" /> our requirement in this field, whereas we received £180,000. He indicated how we proposed to spend the money. All that information is on the Minister's file, no doubt.  There is reference to a continuation of the Naas-Newbridge dual carriageway which is needed badly and to the different improvement works required throughout the county.  The county engineer's estimate was the least amount necessary. He pointed out that it does not indicate the total amount of work that is ready to be commenced but indicates the very least amount which we can hope to carry out.  He indicated, too, that there had been a serious disruption in work in the county last year as a result of financial cutbacks.  He pointed out that down through the years the county council had adopted a policy of providing their own machinery thereby enabling them to carry out the work and maximising the use of the machinery and the work force at their disposal.  The county manager said it was unlikely that the national primary roads improvement grants for 1976 would reach a figure remotely approaching the required level.</P>
    <P>He said he considered it necessary to outline the present financial commitments which the council faced in regard to work on national primary roads in the coming year, that we had already spent £128,000 and were committed to works of that nature.  He pointed out also that the work force of 29 men would cost £60,000 to maintain in the coming year while the provision of the necessary machinery for roadworks in the same period would cost £55,000 and materials needed to carry out the work would cost £60,000. These figures are nothing more than survival figures, the lowest figures that could possibly be arrived at to warrant keeping men in employment and to warrant also the utilisation of existing machinery.</P>
    <P>The county engineer emphasised the declining standards of our national roads and indicated that the amount of money we got in 1975 was not adequate to provide a proper level of maintenance of primary roads while important works such as surface dressing or bitumen carpeting had to be <Col N="750" /> curtailed seriously and that a minimum of £100,000 would be necessary this year to provide even this low standard of upkeep.  He warned the Minister that the continuation of the present policy would mean that in five years' time serious damage would have been wrought on the roads in our county which would necessitate the spending of very large sums of money in remedial work.  He pointed out the effects which the dry weather conditions of the summer of 1975 had on roads which were based on bog ramparts.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the Minister has not taken to heart the serious words of the county engineer who indicated, too, that of the block grant of £136,000 we received last year, £130,000 was spent on the main roads and that what we had left for improvement works on other main roads was not worth spending&mdash;a mere £5,585. He also indicated to the Minister that Kildare had faced up to their responsibilities every other year, had spent quite a lot of money on the main roads in the county and that any shortfall had always taken place in the allocation of grants from the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I also refer the Minister to his statement today regarding the amount of road fund grants received in Kildare and the amount of taxation gathered on the 1,800 registered vehicles in Kildare last year.  In 1975 our grant was £545,810.  We were 11th, behind Dublin and Cork, which we can well understand, and also Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Limerick, Clare, Waterford, Kerry and Meath.  It is hard to understand how we could be placed in that position with counties that have not the same mileage as we have and do not carry the same volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>Kildare returned £750,000 last year in motor taxation and got 72 per cent of that in grants.  In the coming year, with the new cost of registering cars, it should be £1.1 million and even on the same percentage we should be due £792,000.  It was indicated to the Minister, if we had any hope of carrying out a programme with any continuity and not one of peaks and <Col N="751" /> valleys, what would be the minimum amount that we would need to do this work.  The Minister has not taken account of that.</P>
    <P>It was also shown to the Minister that labour costs have increased from 1970 to date by 122 per cent.  We base these figures on road workers' wages and also on the cost of materials which has increased very considerably. In relation to last year's costs it is anticipated that the increase will be something in the nature of 15 per cent to 20 per cent on the different materials that will be used.</P>
    <P>We have put forward a very special case for Kildare which has not been put forward for party reasons but by two very competent people, the county manager and the county engineer.  We have made a request to the Minister, even for survival, to allow us to keep up appearances.  The statistics I gave are not invented by me.  They are genuine.</P>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to Question No. 7 in relation to Fontstown. This is an example of the unfinished business, owing to the shortage of money, in Kildare.  At the March county council meeting grave concern was expressed by members of the Minister's party.  We look on Kildare as an unfinished symphony.  It is a very sad swan song on which to bow out.  It is a reminder to anyone on the road to sweet Athy that the third Coalition are a perfect example of an old lesson we used to learn in school, olc, níos measa, is measa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really sorry for somebody like Deputy Power who, I suppose, wants to help his constituents and would like to give the impression he is doing a lot for them by coming in here.  I object to the idea that the only way he can do it is by having the matter raised on the Adjournment so that he gets 20 minutes to himself to say a lot of things.  I suggest that he checks his facts a little bit tighter with Kildare County Council officials before he comes in here again to make a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> I am really touched by the warning of this county engineer as to how I should behave.  Deputy Power may take instructions from the county engineer but I do not.  The letter we heard so much about at Question Time today, and which has been referred to this evening by Deputy Power, is one written by the county engineer before the allocations were made.  It is not unusual for officials in local authorities to try to get as much money as they can.  There is no harm in that.  If they want to overstate their case and look for a lot more than they are likely to get, O.K., I cannot complain about it, that is the way they do their business. It does not impress because when the matter comes before the Department of Local Government they have to assess what the requirements are and it is on that they make the recommendation to me for an allocation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power is an intelligent man and he is as well aware as I am that a letter written a month or six weeks before the allocations was made saying that this is the amount required does not cut any ice at all because at the time he did not know what money he was getting.  He was aiming at the moon and that was that.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of things I should deal with, one of which is the question of Fontstown.  In case Deputy Power was too gentle to refer to the Deputy and the councillor of the Labour Party in Kildare, let me name Deputy Bermingham, who was the person he was referring to.  What Deputy Bermingham was complaining about, as far as I know, was that the job seemed to be going on a long time; a lot seemed to have been spent on it and it did not appear to be any nearer to being ended.  On that basis an unfinished symphony might appropriately be applied to it.  Perhaps the county engineer might have a look at the job and see if there is any truth in the suggestion made by Deputy Bermingham and one or two other people that it seemed as if there was not a lot of intelligent planning in the way in which the job was being done.  It appeared as if a lot of money <Col N="753" /> was being put into it and it did not appear to be improving.  Deputy Power seems to accept it is still in a dangerous condition and does not appear to be improving after a very sizeable amount of money has been spent on it over a period of two years. The years 1974 and 1975 have passed by and a total of £33,500 has been spent on it.  A further £8,000 is required to finish it, which is a sizeable sum.</P>
    <P>Possibly the county engineer might spend some of his time out there and see if he can find some way of finishing the job.  I would be a little bit perturbed about continuing to give grants for a job which appears to be going on and on.  It is a normal job which appears to be one which could be finished in a relatively short time. I believe Deputy Power has views on this and perhaps he might discuss the matter with the county engineer and see if the job is not dragging on for a long time.</P>
    <P>As far as the £8,000, which is required to finish it is concerned, I have given a very sizeable block grant to Kildare and they can take the £8,000 out of that because they are entitled to allocate the money out of the block grant to whatever work they think most needs money.  One would get the impression from Deputy Power that down the years his party, when they were in power, were pouring millions of pounds into the Kildare roads. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  The only really decent allocation of money which was made was in the last year they were in office.  For the national primary roads that year they gave £160,000 for improvement&mdash;grant improvement works are what are done this year and the next year they are not&mdash;and they gave £48,000 for the upkeep of national primary roads in 1972-73.  In 1976 we gave £180,000 for improvement and £94,000 for upkeep, which is nearly double that.  If the Kildare county engineer feels that from a figure of £48,000 in 1972-73 up to £94,000 in 1976 is not sufficient to keep the road in a proper condition then perhaps he would have a look at the way in which he is doing it.  In fact, he got <Col N="754" /> £78,000 last year and £49,000 the year before so Kildare have been doing pretty well on the upkeep.  I consider upkeep is important.</P>
    <P>Similarly in regard to the national secondary roads.  Nothing was given in 1972-73 in the national secondary by the previous Government and there was nothing given for the improvement and nothing given by us this year.  There was nothing given for upkeep either in the national secondary because the upkeep 100 per cent grant was introduced by us and not by Fianna Fáil.  They only gave 50 per cent.  This year we have given £25,500 as against £17,700 last year and £11,330 the year before for the upkeep of national and secondary roads.</P>
    <P>A general grant was given of £170,000 in 1976 for the county roads. This money can be spent by Kildare County Council wherever they think it should be spent.  There were two main reasons for doing this.  One was so that roads could be improved which were neglected for years because the money was not available. We were improving the national roads but where many people who were paying heavy rates were living nothing was done to the roads over the years.  I decided it was about time we should give them a little help and so the block grant was introduced.</P>
    <P>The second reason was that on this type of road there is far more scope for labour.  There is no reason why expensive machinery should be employed to do a job in three months which it might take six months to do with a smaller type of machine and where labour is employed.  This is what the local authorities, including Kildare County Council, are setting out to do.  Despite the fact that Deputy Power was at the last meeting of the county council, apparently he is not aware that the county engineer said he was revising his arrangement to ensure there would not be any unemployment among road workers. I am sure Deputy Power is as happy about this as I am.  Neither of us wants to see road workers laid off.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Naas by-pass, let us be clear about this once and for <Col N="755" /> all.  For three years in succession a grant of £10,000 was given to Kildare County Council for the Naas by-pass. On each occasion, and particularly last year and this year, they were asked to submit a draft scheme for this by-pass.  They have the money to prepare that scheme if they want to. They have not done so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not submitted the plan to me for a Naas by-pass. Kildare County Council are saying to us: &ldquo;Allocate the money first and then we will give you the scheme.&rdquo;  That will not work.  On the basis of taking a figure out of the air I will not agree to allocate money to by-pass Naas or anywhere else unless the county council produce the plan of what they propose to do.  The matter will be considered next year if the plan is submitted.  If it is not submitted, I would have very grave doubts about giving even the £10,000 which they have been getting for planning over the past three years.  It is a bit ridiculous to suggest they should play along with this.  While apparently pretending they are very interested in having this work done, at the same time they have not produced a plan.  Deputy Power is aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Power is aware that I refused to allow a motorway which would not be financed in this century to be put into operation.  I said I would agree to a dual carriageway and I asked them to submit plans.  They failed to do so.  If they <Col N="756" /> are interested in by-passing Nass, I suggest that what the county engineer should do is to prepare those plans. Kildare is a very important county but it is not so important that it can dictate to the Department of Local Government.  If they want a by-pass they can have it, but they can only have it if they submit the plans.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amount of money given for other roads, it is not correct to say there are far more miles of road in Kildare than in most of the other counties which got higher grants.  A simple check on the mileage will prove to Deputy Power whether that is correct.  I am quite happy that I have given a fair allocation of money.  Over the years the Kildare roads as well as all the other roads were neglected because enough money was not made available.  Since I took office I have made available very substantial sums of money. Because I have done that, some local authority representatives like Deputy Power seem to think there is a bottomless pit of money which should be allocated to their local authority only and we should forget about the remainder.</P>

      <P>In allocating grants from the Road Fund this year, I increased the block grant to each county council by approximately 25 per cent.  I also brought all road authorities within the block grant system.  The allocation to each authority for the upkeep of national roads was increased by approximately 20 per cent.  The purpose in allocating these increases was to help road authorities, who are responsible for drawing up their own <Col N="640" /> programmes of expenditure, to protect the employment of road workers through the selection of labour intensive schemes.  The remaining balance of funds was allocated to the completion of important improvement works in progress by individual authorities and to a small number of new improvement works urgently required in the traffic and safety interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to annex II to the sixth report on &ldquo;Developments <Col N="641" /> in the European Communities&rdquo; laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in December last, which contains a summary of subsidies, grants and loans approved by, and contributions to, the European Communities in respect of 1975.  In this context a distinction cannot be made between subsidies and grants.</P>
      <P>The figure shown in Table I of the annex for the total of subsidies and grants approved in respect of 1975 is £118.557 million.  However, information since received indicates that the total amount of subsidies and grants approved in respect of 1975 is now £119.394 million.  The increase is due to further amounts of £0.8 million approved under the heading &ldquo;European Social Fund&rdquo; and £0.040 million under the heading &ldquo;Moneys for miscellaneous studies and surveys carried out by Irish agencies for the Commission&rdquo;.  The revised total also takes account of a marginal adjustment of the amount for research and investment projects viz. from £0.109 million to £0.106 million.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that, due to Community procedures, it is not unusual for decisions on applications submitted in a particular year, or the final adjustments to amounts approved, to be delayed until later years.  As a result, the figures quoted above will not necessarily represent the final amount of Community grants and subsidies for 1975.</P>
      <P>The figure shown in Table II for loans approved from Community sources remains unchanged at £23.21 million in respect of 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to (b) of the Deputy's question, Table III in annex II contains an estimate of the total contributions made by this country to the European Communities in respect of 1975, viz. £10.493 million.  With the exception of our contribution to the budget of the Communities, the amounts actually paid were as set out in the table.  Due to the procedures for implementing the budget, however, our actual net contribution to the budget in 1975, at £9.76 million, was less than the estimated figure of £10.070 million shown in the table: this is due to the fact that certain expenditure <Col N="642" /> appropriate to the 1975 budget will not fall to be met until this year.  The final figure in respect of our contributions to the 1975 budget will not, therefore, be known until the closure of accounts later this year.</P>

      <P>The total amount spent on the programme from the Vote of my <Col N="647" /> Department was in the region of £10,000.  As the accounts for some of the projects have not yet been finalised, it is not possible to give a final figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A breakdown of the £10,000 figure is as follows: grants towards cost of seminars, conferences, exhibitions, a schools essay competition, a careers film and research, £7,500; cost of sending delegates to the Women's International Conference in Mexico organised by the United Nations; cost of sending delegates to the Women's International Conference in Brussels organised by the Belgian Government; <Col N="648" /> cost of official reception to inaugurate the international programme of activities for International Women's Year and miscellaneous expenses, £2,500.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the emphasis in the programme was on activities which would advance the status of women in a practical way.  Accordingly, a number of activities undertaken by Government Departments and other organisations in the course of their activities during the year but which were specially promoted to honour International Women's Year are not reflected in the expenditure figure quoted.</P>

        <i>Cavan):</i> The information requested is not readily available and its extraction at this stage would be a formidable task involving the examination of a large number of individual files and documents in several branches of the Land Commission.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in the circumstances, to compile the detailed information sought would call for a disproportionate expenditure of time and labour.  It may suffice for his purpose to know that in the past 10 years 6,550 acres, approximately, comprised in 93 properties were acquired or purchased by the Land Commission in County Limerick and a further 2,800 acres, approximately, made up of numerous small holdings were taken over by way of exchange.  In the same period about 8,500 acres were allotted to some 590 allottees.  Income from revenue lettings in County Limerick in 1975 was of the order of £35,000 while outgoings&mdash; interest on land bonds, rates, caretakers and so on&mdash;were in or about the same figure.</P>

      <P>Additional equipment has recently been brought into service and work is still under way in extending underground plant throughout the area.  It is expected that about 400 of the waiting applications will be met during the next three to four months, a further 450 by the end of this year, and the balance during 1977 and 1978.  These figures are in addition to priority applications which are normally attended to within a few months of application.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by CIE that following the completion in 1975 on a nationwide basis of an origin/destination survey for all traffic carried on the board's scheduled road freight services, the board felt compelled for economic reasons to effect a major pruning of its road freight services while continuing, of course, to provide service with all locations where traffic potential warranted it.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated, there is no provision for subsidisation of CIE's road freight services under the subvention arrangements for CIE under EEC regulations.</P>
      <P>Prior to November, 1975, there was a once weekly CIE road freight service with a number of points on the road between Ballina and Sligo but the survey already mentioned revealed that the traffic potential at 13 of the locations served could not justify the retention of the service to these locations and scheduled service was discontinued with effect from 3rd November, 1975.</P>
      <P>CIE continue to provide a once weekly service from Ballina to Enniscrone&mdash;at which point there is a road freight depot where goods may be deposited or collected&mdash;and twice weekly from Sligo to Ballysodare.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> Under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1944, I am precluded from considering the grant of merchandise licences except where there is an inadequacy of transport in a particular area.  I am not satisfied that there is such an inadequacy in the areas in question which would warrant the grant of merchandise licences.</P>
    <P>The Road Transport Bill, 1976, which has just been circulated, contains proposals which, if enacted, should remedy any difficulties which may arise in the future regarding the supply of road freight transport in the Mayo and Sligo areas and elsewhere in the country.  The proposed exemption from control of haulage in vehicles having a maximum total laden weight of six metric tons is likely to be of particular benefit to the areas in question.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates in particular to his supplementary question on 13th November, 1975: &ldquo;Is there any record, first, of the amount of minerals owned by the State and by individuals and, secondly, of minerals that do not seem to be owned by anybody?&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> The position is that all reserves of gold, silver and petroleum are State-owned. An estimated 65 per cent of all other mineral rights are owned by the State; the remaining 35 per cent are in private ownership.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are the main source of information on the ownership of minerals, other than gold, silver and petroleum.  The practice is to ask the Land Commission to investigate mineral ownership in areas which are regarded as having some mineral potential and this information is placed on open file at the Geological Survey Office of my Department.  The Geological Survey Office estimate that not more than 10 per cent of the entire country has commercial mineral potential and mineral ownership has been determined and information filed in respect of 50 per cent of that area. This information is continually being added to as interest is expressed in particular areas.</P>
    <P>As to the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question, all minerals would have to fall within either of the two categories, State-owned or privately owned.  Identification of individual present day owners of private minerals can, of course, in some cases, pose problems.</P>
