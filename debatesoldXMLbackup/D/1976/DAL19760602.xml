      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £114,361,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain services administered by that Office and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The sum of more than £114 million I am seeking is almost £24 million greater than the final provision for 1975 but includes over £25 million for consumer subsidies on butter and milk. The provision for these subsidies in the 1975 allocation was about £10 million.</P>
      <P>After deduction of the consumer subsidies the net amount is £89 million, compared with over £80 million in 1975.  The net provision for farm modernisation, including the schemes which the EEC scheme is superseding, is nearly £13.3 million.  Over £6 million is included for lime and fertiliser subsidy as compared with an expenditure of £4.4 million last year.</P>
      <P>The gross provision for headage payments is around £17.5 million compared with a provision of £16.5 million in 1975.</P>
      <P>The net provision for bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication is £17.8 million, about £7 million more than the 1975 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over £6 million is being provided for education and over £3.5 million <Col N="565" /> for county committees of agriculture. The provision for research is over £6 million, the bulk of which is by way of grant to An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>The net provision for market support is about £2.7 million, virtually all of which relates to market intervention operations in respect of beef and dairy products.</P>
    <P>Total pay and travelling expenses is estimated at £14.4 million in 1976 as against £13.1 million in 1975.  Pay and travelling expenses associated with the former land project work are now shown with the main provisions in subheads A.1 and A.3.</P>
    <P>Detailed notes on the main activities of my Department have been circulated to Deputies and will be of help to them in the debate on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>At the outset, it is appropriate that I should outline recent developments in regard to the common agricultural policy of the EEC which is so important for farmers.</P>
    <P>During the past year the common agricultural policy was comprehensively reviewed by the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee. This review was carried out on the basis of a stocktaking done by the Commission at the request of the Council.  It is desirable to recall the main conclusions of that review not only because of the adverse criticisms which one frequently hears about the common policy but also because these conclusions are an important background to subsequent decisions taken by the Council of Agricultural Ministers. The outcome of the review can be summed up briefly as follows:</P>
    <P>Firstly the review endorsed the importance of the common agricultural policy and its vital role in the process of European integration.</P>
    <P>Secondly the review noted that the policy had contributed positively in the achievement of increased agricultural incomes, relative stability of prices, security of supplies and increased trade within the Community in agricultural products.</P>
    <P>Thirdly the persistence of imbalances <Col N="566" /> in certain sectors of European agriculture was noted, particularly income disparities, regional imbalances and market imbalances for certain products especially dairy products, cereals, wine, beef and veal.</P>
    <P>Finally the review noted the need for improving and simplifying the various mechanisms of the common agricultural policy as well as the difficulties posed for the policy by the lack of progress in other areas of European integration especially in the areas of economic, monetary and social policies.</P>
    <P>It was against the foregoing background that deliberations of the Council of Ministers on the fixing of prices for 1976-77 took place in March last. In addition, the general economic background to the Council's deliberations was one of continued inflation in many member states, sharply rising costs of agricultural inputs and wages generally as well as serious monetary fluctuations especially for the pound and the lira on foreign exchange markets.  The Council agreed to an average increase of about 8 per cent in Community support prices.  In our case this was augmented by the alignment step towards the level of the Community common prices.</P>
    <P>The Council's decisions on prices were linked to certain adjustments in the monetary compensatory amounts and representative rates for certain currencies.  Thus I secured agreement for a 2 per cent devaluation of the representative rate of the Irish £&mdash;the green £&mdash;which resulted in a corresponding increase in the level of our support prices.  These increases will contribute to a substantial improvement in Irish farmers' incomes this year.</P>
    <P>In the beef and veal sector the basic intervention price was increased by about 14 per cent and in the case of milk, the increases in the intervention prices for butter and skim powder are equivalent to about 2.5p per gallon in March and a further 0.9p per gallon in mid-September.  In view of the existence of surpluses&mdash;particularly skimmed milk powder&mdash;in the dairy products sector, the Council is to decide <Col N="567" /> by 1st September on the introduction of a system of financial contributions by milk producers with a view to applying the system as from the beginning of the 1977-78 marketing year.  In the cereals sector the target price of barley has been increased by 8.5 per cent and intervention price by 4.5 per cent.  The Council also agreed on new pricing arrangements for wheat.  A special intervention price for wheat of bread-making quality has been fixed and the the intervention price by 4.5 per cent. The Council also agreed on new pricing into line with prices of other feed grains.  The basic price for pigmeat was increased by 8 per cent and the intervention price for sugar and the minimum price for beet were also increased by 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Currency fluctuations during the past year continued to affect adversely the operation of the common agricultural policy.  As Deputies know, I have never been happy with the way in which the system of monetary compensatory amounts operates.  It creates distortions of competition and obstructs trade, especially when the rate of MCA is high and persists over a long period. In order to reduce the level of Irish MCAs I obtained the agreement of the Council of Ministers to three devaluations of the green £ last year and, as I have mentioned already, to a further devaluation in March of this year. These changes had the cumulative effect of keeping Irish MCAs over 17 percentage points lower than they would otherwise be and of increasing the value of EEC support prices in Ireland by about 15 per cent.  Unfortunately, however, the weakness of the £ on foreign exchange markets continues to create problems.</P>
    <P>I now move on to the EEC programme for the reform of agricultural structures.  The total provision for capital grants to farmers in 1976 comes to more than £13 million.  This includes the residual payments still being made under the former farm buildings and land project schemes amounting together to £3.3 million and current payments under the farm modernisation scheme for which £10 million is provided.  As Deputies are <Col N="568" /> aware, it is the intention to wind up the former schemes on 30th September next.  This will mean that from next year onwards all capital grants available to farmers will be payable under the modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position to look back on the working of the farm modernisation scheme over the last year-and-a-half.  In taking stock at this time it is well to reflect both on the positive merits of the scheme as well as on whatever shortcomings it may have.  At 30th April last, 52,000 farmers had applied to participate in the scheme.  That in itself is an impressive number.  Nearly all of these would already have had a visit from their agricultural adviser.  This direct contact now established between farmer and adviser, particularly in the case of those farmers who had not made such contact before, must be of positive value.  The great majority of the applicants&mdash;some 42,000 of them &mdash;had in addition, been given advice on the future planning of their farms, either through the preparation of detailed farm development plans in the case of development farmers or by way of more general advice on their investments in the case of other farmers.</P>
    <P>In the present day when capital investment on farms tends to run to substantial sums, the value of careful planning of all developments is of particular importance.  There is always a serious risk that substantial investments, for example, in costly buildings and installations will be seen as the immediate solution for increasing productivity on farms.  In very many cases this can be a mistaken approach particularly if a reasonable degree of efficiency in the basic operation of the farm enterprise has not already been attained in such aspects as following a proper fertilising programme or in the provision of adequate feed supplies.  Without attaining basic efficiency in these matters then substantial capital investment is liable to prove more an added burden than an easy answer to the problem of increasing profitability.</P>
    <P>When capital investment becomes more costly than the return on that <Col N="569" /> investment it becomes of paramount importance.  If farm planning means anything, it means making sure beyond doubt that the pay-off from investments justifies the extra expenditure by the farmer.  To-day when agriculture is a highly competitive business we cannot afford wasteful investment in the industry.  One of the essential merits of the farm modernisation scheme is the special emphasis it puts on proper planned development; and I would expect to see both farmers and advisers looking more and more to this positive aspect of the scheme in future.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a fact that at present something less than 20 per cent of the applicants under the scheme have been classed as development farmers.  I am quite satisfied that this figure does not at all represent the proportions of viable and potentially viable farmers in this country.  I would therefore, like to see a much wider stratum of farmers qualifying for development status and, as I told the House some time ago, we have made proposals to the EEC Commission which in our view would help to bring this about.  These proposals will be examined together with those from various other sources in the context of a review of the EEC directives which the Commission has recently initiated.</P>
    <P>Even though we have not the number of development farmers we would like, I should emphasise again that the level of grants available to all farms is generous.  Moreover, they are now calculated as flat percentages of costs and this system enables periodic adjustments to be made to take account of cost changes.  I am concerned, however, to think that farmers, or indeed advisers, are totally grant-orientated or that grants should be seen as the prime motivation for expansion or development on the farm.  The constant preoccupation with grants to the exclusion of any thought of more positive features of the scheme seems to suggest a tendency in this direction.</P>
    <P>Now for the first time ever, the agricultural industry is, since our joining the EEC entirely market-orientated <Col N="570" /> and in this situation the farmer's decision as to whether he will drain that extra area of land, increase his stock, change his milking system or otherwise intensify must, if it is to be soundly based, depend on the return he sees himself getting in the market place at the end of the day.  When this becomes the prime motivation for the farmer's decision, rather than the amount of grant he might get from the State, then I am confident that the premium which it is necessary to place on efficiency of production and the need for an adequate return on the capital invested by the farmer will fall into their proper place.</P>
    <P>It is now a fact that a significant number of farmers are keeping farm accounts under the aegis of the farm modernisation scheme.  This is a very encouraging development from any point of view.  However, the keeping of accounts is one thing&mdash;the use which the farmer makes of the accounts may well be another.  All these accounts will be of little value unless they are seen and utilised by both farmer and adviser together as a useful tool to point up the deficiencies in the operation of the farm business where these arise and to provide the basis for improved efficiency wherever possible. Again, I sincerely hope that we have reached the day when a farmer thinking of keeping accounts will ask rather what use will the accounts be to him instead of what grant is he likely to get for keeping them.</P>
    <P>The scheme of cattle and sheep headage payments operated in 1975 under the EEC disadvantaged areas directive will be continued this year. As Deputies are aware, the scheme aims at maintaining viability and preserving the environment in mountain and less favoured areas and is complementary to the policies operated by the Community for improving agricultural structures.  Under the 1975 scheme the amount paid out to farmers in our severely handicapped areas was about £12 million of which 25 per cent will be recouped by the EEC.  This year, fortunately, we were able to persuade the Community to increase the rate of recoupment in the case of Ireland and Italy to 35 per <Col N="571" /> cent.  The Government have decided that the benefit of this higher recoupment should be passed on in full to the farmer.  Our intention is to increase the number of livestock units qualifying for the higher grant i.e. £16, to eight and to pay £10 on the balance up to 30 livestock units&mdash;maximum £348.  Last year we paid £16 on the first five livestock units; £10 on the next ten and £8 on the next 15 giving a maximum of £300.  As part of the disadvantaged areas scheme we will continue to pay grants on beef cows in the less disadvantaged areas.  These grants will be aligned to the cattle headage grants in the severely handicapped areas and will be at the rate of £16 on the first eight cows and £10 on the next 22 giving a maximum of £348.  Outside the disadvantaged area the grants&mdash;if we are to conform to EEC thinking&mdash;must be significantly lower than within the scheduled areas and we propose to pay £12 per cow on all eligible cows after the second and up to a maximum of £300.</P>
    <P>Sheep grants in disadvantaged areas will also be increased with £1 extra on mountain hogget ewes, 50p extra on other types of hogget ewe and 50p extra on mountain lambs.</P>
    <P>I must stress that these are our proposals which we will shortly be putting to the EEC Commission, but we must await their approval before taking them as definitive.  We have, of course, kept in close touch with the Commission and have taken their views into account in working out the revised grant structure.</P>
    <P>The directive also authorises the provision of certain additional investment aids in disadvantaged areas and of special assistance towards fodder production and the development of hill pastures farmed jointly.  We will be introducing a scheme of this kind as soon as proposals which we have submitted to the Commission have been cleared.</P>
    <P>Before I leave structural policy, there is another measure to which I should like to refer.  This is the scheme of grants which are provided out of the guidance section of FEOGA for certain types of projects approved by the Commission and aimed at improving <Col N="572" /> structural efficiency in agriculture and fisheries.  Since 1973, grants amounting to £12.3 million have been allocated to Ireland under this scheme covering a broad spectrum of the agricultural sector including dairying, meat, fish, cereals and poultry.  This assistance has made a most important contribution to the industry's development and progress and has been particularly beneficial to the food processing sector in helping it to modernise its existing plant and provide new facilities.  For the current year's scheme, Irish applications lodged in Brussels involve grant-aid amounting to £11.5 million.  These applications are being examined by the Commissions at present.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to some of the more important commodity developments beginning with cattle and beef.</P>
    <P>Our cattle industry has recovered well from the very serious marketing difficulties of 1974.  Market prices have never been better and confidence has clearly returned to the industry. However, it is going to take time for this renewed confidence to be translated into renewed expansion in finished cattle numbers and we must accept that our exports of cattle in live or dead from over the next couple of years will be below the record disposals which we witnessed last year.</P>
    <P>Prospects for our beef industry in the foreseeable future are good and I expect that our producers will not be slow to respond to this situation and to the very real advantages which full membership of the Community will bring to our beef trade a little more than a year from now.  They have the continuing support of the beef intervention arrangements and&mdash;on the UK market&mdash;the variable premium, and there is every reason to look to the future with confidence and to be expansionist in outlook.</P>
    <P>In 1975 a total of over 130,000 tons of beef was purchased by my Department as intervention agency.  The handling of this quantity of beef, representing about half a million cattle, involved a huge amount of work and imposed considerable strain on the resources of my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> Despite the improved market conditions, substantial quantities of beef are still going into intervention&mdash; about 1,500 tons a week at present. Intervention is, of course, a vital safeguard for our producers and is particularly valuable in times of surplus. It should not, however, be regarded as a normal and regular outlet.  In the long run we must sell our products on commercial markets and our whole approach must be directed to this.</P>
    <P>I might also say that intervention operations have considerable financial implications for the Exchequer.  The Estimate provided a net £2.6 million to meet incidental expenses.  In addition, pending the sale of the products and the recoupment of losses by the Community we ourselves have to provide the necessary capital to finance intervention purchases.  This can absorb very considerable resources. At times last year almost £120 million was tied up in intervention purchases of beef and skim milk powder.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that I should stop exports in live cattle and calves, and that all of our cattle should be processed in our meat plants.  From the point of view of added value and employment, I quite agree that as a general proposition it is desirable that as much as possible of our cattle should be processed before export.  However, experience has shown that competition from the live export trade helps to maintain price levels for producers and it encourages the increased production which is so important to the factories.  In any event, under Community rules I have no authority to restrict the export of live cattle and calves.  We just cannot turn exports on and off as we wish. Indeed, we ourselves would be the first to complain if other member states were to do this on the imports side.  I might also say that given the good outlook for beef, I see no good reason why our fatteners should not be able to compete effectively with foreign buyers for calves and young cattle.</P>
    <P>I have made several appeals recently to farmers to make maximum use of AI.  I was very glad to note that inseminations so far this year <Col N="574" /> showed a rise of 17.5 per cent over the figures for the corresponding period last year with Friesian inseminations still accounting for around 50 per cent of the total.  I hope that this welcome upsurge in AI usage will continue for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>Turning to milk, the production of creamery milk continues to be an extremely rewarding activity for farmers, with prices in 1976 expected to average approximately 35p per gallon.  This price compares with an average of 30.5p last year, 23.8p in 1974 and 20p in 1973 and the effects of the improving price are clearly seen in the level of production of creamery milk which in 1975 reached an all-time high of 629 million gallons and seems likely to set a much higher record in the current year.</P>
    <P>The heavy stocks of dairy products, particularly of skim milk powder, in intervention in the Community at present are somewhat disturbing but I must emphasise that since our entry into the Community we have not sold any butter at all to intervention.  An Bord Bainne have successfully marketed our entire exportable quantity.  It is likely that, later this year, we shall have to face up to proposals of a financial nature from the EEC Commission designed to help reduce these public stocks to a more tolerable level.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation and diversification on the processing side of the dairying industry continue.  In July last the Dairy Disposal Company's creamery properties in west Cork were transferred to co-operative ownership so the company are no longer involved in milk processing.  There is still considerable scope for product diversification and for a reduction in our dependence on a small number of products.  Some of our processing firms have been showing commendable initiative and enterprise in this respect and my Department have been supporting suitable projects for grant assistance from the IDA and, where appropriate, from EEC grant-aid through FEOGA.</P>
    <P>The consumer subsidy for butter which was specially increased in July last to reduce living costs now stands <Col N="575" /> at £307.29 per ton or almost 14p per lb.  The consumer liquid milk subsidy of about 2p per pint which was introduced in August last also continues in operation.  These subsidies will cost £9.4 million and £15.8 million respectively in 1976.</P>
    <P>Sheep prices have been reasonably satisfactory in recent months and prices for early lamb were well up on those of a year ago.  This relatively buoyant market situation has resulted from the development of fairly regular live shipments to the Continent and increasing exports of carcase lamb to North Africa rather than from the more usual export trade in carcase lamb to France.  Indeed, the increased restrictions applied by France last year and about which I protested strongly at the time were the prime reason for the weaker market here last summer and autumn.  In March this year the French import charges were increased yet again.</P>
    <P>The remedy for this very unsatisfactory situation is, of course, a common policy for sheepmeat.  I do not have to tell the House how strongly I have been pressing this issue in Brussels for some considerable time past.  The most recent development has been that the Council of Ministers passed last month a resolution undertaking to adopt, before 1st August, interim measures to improve the conditions of intra-Community trade in the sheepmeat sector and asking the Commission to submit a report to serve as a basis for a Council debate on the broad outlines of definitive regulations for sheepmeat.  I can only express the hope that after all the frustrations, particularly in the past year or so, some positive progress will now be made towards providing equitable treatment for sheep producers under a common Community policy.</P>
    <P>Conditions in the pig industry improved throughout 1975 notwithstanding the general recession and the difficulties experienced by all sectors of the industry in 1974.  Pig prices advanced substantially and the prices obtained for bacon and pork on export markets rose to new record levels.  By December, 1975, the <Col N="576" /> female breeding hard had recovered to 100,900 from 88,700 a year earlier and the numbers of pigs delivered to bacon factories so far this year are up by 10.8 per cent over the corresponding period in 1975.  This increase in production is most welcome and the indications are that the upward trend will continue.  A higher level of output is necessary for the more efficient utilisation of factory capacity and in order to restore the industry's contribution to farm income and to our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>A substantial increase in production should be attainable reasonably quickly, taking into account existing pig-housing capacity, the grant aid available for pig production under the farm modernisation scheme and the more active part being taken by factories in promoting increased production of pigs for their plants. Prices of feeding stuffs for pigs have been increasing and may reduce producers' margins for a while but the lesson of the past two years is clear&mdash; that is, those who maintain efficient production units of economic size and who are prepared to accept temporary fluctuations in profitability can, in the long run, expect reasonable overall returns on their investment and are in the best position to benefit from the high margins when these occur.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the estimated output of our poultry and eggs industry was valued at about £35 million.  Eggs accounted for over £16.0 million, broilers and hens £12.3 million, turkeys £5 million and ducks and geese £1 million.  In 1975 the poultry industry in Ireland and other member states did not show any recovery from the recession which began in 1974 due to increases in feed costs, reduced demand for poultry meat because of competition from other meat products and, in some instances, because of over-production and surplus stocks.</P>
    <P>Broiler production, which is operated on a contract basis between growers and processing plants, declined slightly in 1975 but there was some increase in turkey production and duck production.  In the case of ducks I should say that about 70 per cent of production was exported <Col N="577" /> oven-ready.  Egg production has remained fairly static in recent years. About 65 per cent is now produced in intensive commercial units and the output is entirely for the home market.</P>
    <P>I now come to the subject of livestock disease.  State funds to the extent of £17.8 million net are being provided in the current Estimate under the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes.  This is almost double the amount spent in any previous year.  The funds provided would permit a full round of TB testing in all counties including for 1976 herds in the seven north-western counties which, for some years past, have been tested only biennially.  Provision has been made for an increase in the fees payable to veterinary surgeons for work done under the schemes.  I am also considering extending compulsory brucellosis eradication measures to County Dublin as the next step in the nation-wide drive against that disease.</P>
    <P>In the absence of normal rounds of testing for over a year, my Department's efforts have been concentrated on testing reactor and problem herds, especially in areas with an unsatisfactory disease history.  As a result, the total number of reactors taken up in 1975 was almost as high as the 1974 figure.  In the southern half of the country, the pre-intensive brucellosis scheme continues to operate.  Because of the active support of the major co-operative creamery societies, there has been an upsurge of interest in the scheme.  I am confident that significant progress in reducing the incidence of brucellosis can be made in these counties in advance of the introduction of compulsory eradication measures.</P>
    <P>There is now an urgent need to resume full-scale rounds of TB and brucellosis testing and it is a great source of disappointment to me that the latest settlement proposals which I made in a final effort to resolve the current dispute with the Irish Veterinary Union have not been accepted. I am not at all satisfied with the progress made to date in our efforts to combat TB and brucellosis and I can only stress once again that it is vital, <Col N="578" /> if we are to maintain and expand our exports of livestock, meat and dairy products, that there must be a real commitment on the part of all concerned to intensify our efforts against these diseases.  The funds being provided in the Estimate are a clear indication of the Government's concern and commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>Compliance with the Warble Fly Order, 1971, had the effect of reducing the incidence of warble infestation from 22 per cent in 1971 to 0.2 per cent in 1975.  Although revocation of the order in 1975 made general autumn dressing no longer compulsory, the farming organisations with the help of the AI stations organised a voluntary dressing campaign last autumn for the twofold purpose of further reducing the number of animals likely to show warbles in the spring and dealing with lice.  My Department gave every assistance to this voluntary campaign.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to all herdowners to co-operate in the measures now being taken to eradicate the remaining pockets of warble infestation and to rid the national herd, once and for all, of this pest.</P>
    <P>Under the Sheep Dipping Order, 1965, flock owners were required to dip their sheep twice each year&mdash;in the summer and in the autumn.  It has now been decided that a single annual dipping, if carried out during the period between 1st October and 31st January when the mite which causes sheep scab is most active, should give more satisfactory results in eradicating the disease and the sheep dipping order has been amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>In view of the alarming spread of rabies across the Continent of Europe and the consequent increased risk of the disease entering this country through the smuggling of dogs, cats or other mammals, my Department are giving intensified publicity to the serious threat from this dreaded disease. All our air and shipping companies particularly the car ferry service between Rosslare and Le Havre as well as harbour authorities, travel agents, home and continental yachting clubs and so forth have been <Col N="579" /> alerted to the danger of illegal importations.  These precautionary measures are being taken in collaboration with our Customs, Garda Síochána and portal authorities.  New statutory measures which I have introduced replace our existing regulations and substitute a more comprehensive procedure for dealing with possible outbreaks of rabies here.</P>
    <P>Turning to tillage, the 1975 cereals harvest was generally good and returns to producers were satisfactory.  The area under cereals, at 850,000 acres approximately, was however far short of meeting our home requirements.  I have been using every suitable occasion to advocate increased cereals production by our farmers and am encouraged by the indications that there will be an expansion this year.  I hope that this increase will be maintained over the next few years to provide at least the 400,000 tonnes or so of grain which we import annually.  The returns to cereals producers are good relative to other farming operations especially with the higher yielding varieties now available and so there is every incentive for farmers to produce more grain.</P>
    <P>On sugar beef, I am glad to note that the upturn which commenced last year in the acreage under beet is being continued this year with an acreage of about 84,000 acres.  This amply demonstrates the confidence of Irish beef growers in the profitability of the crop.  During the year the EEC Council of Ministers agreed that we might import about 32,000 tons of raw cane sugar annually on the same terms as sugar imported by refiners in the UK.  The refining of this sugar will provide welcome employment during the offpeak period at the Carlow factory.</P>
    <P>Ex-farm prices for potatoes have been generally satisfactory in recent years and indeed prices for the 1975 crop rose to unprecedented levels in a situation of scarce supplies and high prices throughout Western Europe generally.  Preliminary inquiries show there will be an increase in the potato acreage this season and assuming reasonable yields prices can accordingly <Col N="580" /> be expected to be at more normal levels.</P>
    <P>The specific provision for horticulture in the Estimate amounts to £195,000.  The major part of this is to meet commitments under the old glass-house and mushroom grant schemes which have now been superseded by the farm modernisation scheme.  There is also an allocation of £25,000 for aid to producers' organisations in the fresh fruit and vegetable sector.  The horticulture industry had a reasonably satisfactory year in 1975.  While there was a slight drop in acreage and the yield of certain crops was affected by drought, overall quality was good and favourable market conditions gave the growers a satisfactory return.  Exports of fresh fruit and vegetables continued to increase, the main items being tomatoes at £2.1 million and mushrooms at£1.7 million.</P>
    <P>As regards the lime transport and fertiliser subsidies, I am providing and additional £1.8 million for the phosphate subsidy.  After the steep world wide increase in fertiliser prices over the past two years, present indications are that world fertiliser prices are levelling out or even falling.  I would again appeal to our farmers not to exercise false economy by reducing unduly their purchase of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Because of the cut back over the past two years increased usage of fertilisers has now become an urgent necessity.  Generally speaking our tillage crops receive adequate fertilisers but, if we are to make full use of the potential of our grassland, we must keep up and improve its fertility.  This can only be done by adequate application of the proper fertiliser nutrients, including lime.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid provided for An Foras Talúntais to meet general expenses in the current year is £5.6 million. A further £50,000 is provided by way of grant to An Foras for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>The amount of the State grant to An Foras has increased very substantially in recent years.  The non-capital provision for the current year compares with a grant of £1.28 million paid ten years ago or £2.4 million paid five years <Col N="581" /> ago.  The State's financial contribution to the development of the institute's research network since its foundation will, in fact, have exceeded £35 million by the end of the present year.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that in the period since 1958, when it was set up, the Agricultural Institute have established a research organisation which compares very favourably with similar organisations in other countries.  In that time the work of the institute has made a significant contribution to the development of the farming industry. I am pleased to say that farmers themselves recognise the value of the institute's work and that they have backed up that recognition with a willingness to contribute financially to particular aspects of the institute's activities.  This is a development which I particularly welcome and, indeed, I would very much like to see all sectors of the farming industry following the example of the dairying industry and of those other sectors which are already contributing financially to the work of An Foras.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute will, of course, be incorporated into the proposed National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority. This must result in still closer liaison between the research workers and the advisory services and in a more rapid and more effective translation of the results of research activities to farmers through the advisory services.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides £3.5 million for county committees of agriculture and other substantial sums for agricultural education and training.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement on the importance of ensuring that farmers have a good basic knowledge of the principles of agricultural science and how to apply them in their farming practice so as to obtain the best results for their expenditure of time, effort and money.  Success depends on careful planning of the farm programme and on good farm management with ability and readiness to make use of improved techniques. Education and training are necessary to achieve these aims.</P>
    <P>Committees of agriculture continue to provide in conjunction with my <Col N="582" /> Department an agricultural advisory and education service to farmers and rural dwellers.  The Government published last April a White Paper setting out their proposals on the establishment of a new National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority.  Work is going ahead on the preparation of legislation to give effect to these proposals.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the existing services has been improved in several ways.  To date a total of 59 agricultural education centres are planned and already 25 of these are in operation throughout the country and a further seven are under construction; grant aid of up to £20,000 is paid by my Department for each approved centre.</P>
    <P>Last November following consultation with the Agricultural Advisers' Organisation, I approved the creation of 70 posts of senior instructor.  This is a new grade in the advisory service and the new posts will be filled from the existing advisory staff.  The senior instructor's main job will be to supervise and co-ordinate the work of all the advisers in an advisory district and to help them plan their education and advisory programmes.</P>
    <P>During 1975 a scheme of vocational training for people aged 18 years and over and engaged in farming was introduced by county committees to meet the requirements of EEC Directive 161.  Under this scheme farmers and farm workers receive special training designed to improve their farming skills and to help them to adapt to modern agriculture.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to refer to the overall performance of agriculture in 1975 and also the prospects for the current year.  For farmers, 1975 was a good year with substantial increases in output and farm income.  The value of gross output increased by 34 per cent from £634 million to £850 million.  There were substantial increases in the value of most products including cattle, milk, sheep, wheat, barley, sugar beet and potatoes.  The most significant feature was the remarkable level of sales of cattle, which provided a very large supply of raw <Col N="583" /> material to our meat industry.  The rise in the milk intake by creameries, to which I have already referred, was also very encouraging.  At the same time, the fall in the national cattle herd was disquieting and the decline in the area under cereals must be reversed. With a substantial decline in the use of feed and fertilisers purchased by farmers in 1975 the volume of net output rose by 10 per cent.  The growth in net output in 1975 has meant the total increase in net output over the past five years has been over 25 per cent&mdash;not a bad achievement for an industry which is sometimes accused of not being dynamic.  The overall result for farmers' income was an increase estimated at about 50 per cent over 1974 and this has brought back confidence to the industry about its future growth.</P>
    <P>As for 1976, present indications are that it, too, will be a good year for farmers.  Although cattle disposals should revert to a more normal level, cattle prices will be appreciably higher than last year.  Given favourable weather conditions, milk yields are forecast to increase and intake of creamery milk is already running at 16 per cent over last year, and in this way we expect a substantial increase. I know that the value of the agricultural industry in the economy as a whole is generally appreciated and that Members of this House will adopt the Vote I have just recommended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever I listen to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries I am reminded of the song about Brian O'Lynn.  You may recall a verse which goes:</P>
      <P>The bridge fell down and we all fell in, &ldquo;But there's ground at the bottom&rdquo; says Brian O'Lynn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's peroration is a classic example of the native detachment of the Minister and the Government generally from reality and the clever cooking of figures talking of the sharp rise in farm incomes.  They did rise in 1975 but in order to get the picture right we must go back another year when farmers' incomes dropped by <Col N="584" /> from 40 to 50 per cent.  What they did last year was to recover a bit.</P>
    <P>The adroit handling of statistics&mdash; and the Minister is good at handling statistics&mdash;is an art in itself.  If you are good enough, and the Minister is, you can even convince people who have suffered a loss of income that they did not suffer such a loss.  The reality is quite different.  The general effect of the Minister's speech would be to think that Irish farming is forging ahead, that everything is fine, that farmers are prospering as never before and that the outlook is very good.</P>
    <P>Referring to realities, if we look at the cattle scene at present we discover that in the past 12 months alone the farmers and the country suffered a loss of about 560,000 cattle. There are that many cattle fewer in the fields of Ireland now than there were a year ago and if the Minister lightly claims that the advances made in the price arrangements in Brussels were his own achievement he must accept responsibility for the badness in the picture as well.  In the case of sheep the picture is also bad.  In cattle and sheep the current market prices are good because of a combination of circumstances, one of which is the declining numbers and the scarcity of cattle and sheep and pigs.  The number of sheep has dropped from more than 4¼ million since we left office to about 3¼ million now and the number is still dropping.  In County Kilkenny last year there was a 40 per cent drop in the size of flock.  There has been a very sharp drop in the size of the pig herd in this country since Fianna Fáil left office.  There was a record number of 7¼ million cattle in the country when we left office or shortly afterwards, but there has been a steady decline since then.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department are charging the management of Irish agriculture generally but last year 28 per cent of the cows in Ireland were slaughtered in the factories.  A hundred and fifty thousand or more calves were sold out of the country because the situation that obtained at that time evidently made it unprofitable <Col N="585" /> for any cattle producers to buy them here, but they were bought by the Italians and the Greeks and others to whom it seems profitable not only to buy them but to cart them across to Italy.  There was nothing in the Minister's speech except rejection of responsibility in this regard.  The Minister said that it would be against community rules to restrict the export of calves.  It would be a severity on the sellers of calves to restrict their market in the absence of the Minister doing anything constructive about improving the domestic market for calves.  When we were leaving office there were about ¾ million cows in a beef herd in this country suckling calves and it is fairly true to say that that herd has been largely destroyed altogether.</P>
    <P>It was of great importance and it is not possible for this country to run its cattle economy properly without the existence of this secondary beef herd which would be complementary to the main dairy herd in the country. One of its main functions would be to take up the calves produced by the dairy industry and convert them into beef fairly quickly.  The beef incentive scheme which was established in Fianna Fáil's time was very successful in this.  One of the defects was that it give rise to the very uneconomic system of single suckling.  A revised beef incentive scheme should not subsidise single suckling.  There should be multiple suckling because it would direct the assistance to the more efficient use of the milk supply of the cow in the beef herd.  It would also give assistance to the type of farmer who most acutely requires assistance.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that in the past two years there has been from the Government and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries a total absence of action.  When the crash came in 1974 the Department and the Minister seemed to be hypnotised into complete immobility by the magnitude of the crisis and they did nothing and continue to do nothing.  The mass slaughter of the breeding herd particularly last year and the mass sale of the cattle that would have been the material for agricultural production in this <Col N="586" /> country to our foreign competitors, which is still continuing to some extent, puts us in a scarcity position which naturally creates better prices, and to some at any rate, including the Minister, gives the illusion of well-being and prosperity.  But there is no denying the figures or the magnitude of the loss sustained by the agricultural industry generally in terms of livestock on the land.  The losses last year were staggering.  Six hundred thousand cows, practically a third of the cows in the country, were slaughtered last year and exported.  This gave the Government an opportunity to say that our cattle exports were never better.  Naturally, they were enormous because we were selling our breeding stock.</P>
    <P>The whole situation in the cattle sector of the agricultural economy is changing very rapidly and it would appear from our performance as a country that it is taking place unknown to us and without any action from us. In the area of the conversion of calves into meat, in the next decade the traditional methods of grazing and possibly a two or a two and a half year cycle from birth to slaughter will have been superseded completely by intensive calf breeding.  This is becoming more and more common in the developed countries and in some of the less developed countries that have a great need for meat production, calves are put into intensive feeding and they are finished within a year or 14 months.  We should contemplate a change in our pattern for the production of cattle that would shorten the production cycle to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>We would need also to consider our cattle breeding.  In that regard the Minister referred to an upsurge in the use of artificial insemination.  In reality, the use of artificial insemination had dropped to half what it was in our last year of office and there may be a slight upturn now.  The Minister said that there was a 17 per cent increase. Having reached the bottom and having declined to a really disastrous level, it crept up a little and this is what is called an upsurge.  This is also self deception.  It is no good saying that because we recovered a little from the disastrous level to which we had fallen <Col N="587" /> last year that everything is fine in the garden and that we have an upsurge.</P>
    <P>We have not nearly got back to our position in 1973 in the matter of cattle breeding.  Cattle breeding is more important now than ever.  It requires more careful study now than ever before.  A number of things are happening on our traditional British market.  It is becoming more and more self-sufficient and the amount of meat we can sell there is diminishing every year.  In a year or so, they will have arrived at the point where they will be self-sufficient.  That points to the continental market.  It is good to see that our sales in the German market especially have been expanding in spite of the monetary difficulties the Minister referred to, and they are very real.</P>
    <P>We have always prided ourselves on the quality of our product.  Irish meat is of very high quality but it is not the quality to which the European customer is accustomed.  When we talk of high quality Irish meat we are probably talking about Hereford cross meat or meat produced from Friesian based cattle.  This type of meat is not very popular in Europe.  We need to examine the European breeds of cattle such as Charolais and Simmental which produce the high lean content meat which is popular with the customer in Europe.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware the Government have given no inkling of their awareness of this need for a change in our breeding patterns.  We should be making a great deal more use of the Simmental breed because, while the Charolais produces really first class export meat, the Simmental has the merit of being dual purpose and producing high quality milk as well. As a crossing beast for the Irish herd a great deal of intensive examination should be made into the potential of the Austrian or Swiss Simmental.</P>
    <P>The reality as distinct from the euphoria in the Minister's speech is that the Irish cattle herd has been taking a hammering in the past three years.  The quantity of the herd has diminished very seriously and the quality has diminished very seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> The use of unlicensed inferior breeding animals has spread enormously.  It must have, because the number of inseminations in the artificial breeding stations has dropped to half what it was in 1973.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a cheerful reference to the situation in the sheep market.  Prices of sheep and lamb are very good at present.  The general situation is relieved by the new markets we have in North Africa and elsewhere, and by the drop in the size of our own flock.  The Aunt Sally in this picture for the IFA as well as for the Minister is the attitude of the French Government.  They are being made to carry the responsibility for the protection they afford to their own producers.  The Minister is beating the wrong Aunt Sally, and so are the IFA.</P>
    <P>The real nigger in this particular woodpile is the British Government and protocol 18 or 19 of their Treaty of Accession.  I have forgotten the number, but it is the protocol which entitles them to bring in about a quarter of a million tons, or so, of New Zealand Commonwealth mutton and lamb every year.  The facilities afforded by this protocol were extended at the summit meeting held in Dublin last year.</P>
    <P>At any rate, our problem in the European and Commonwealth context is very small.  What we want is a market for a maximum of about 7,000 tons of lamb.  The British are bringing in about a quarter of a million tons of lamb and we blame the French.  That does not seem to make sense to me.  I remember Mr. T.J. Maher and a group of IFA people picketing the French Embassy about a year ago.  I could not help feeling they were picketing the wrong embassy and that they should have been picketing the British Embassy, if they wanted to picket.  I doubt that it would serve any real purpose.</P>
    <P>I also think the European Commissioner, Mr. Lardinois, is a bit remiss in this regard.  He is reluctant to offend the British.  The commissioner has always, in my eyes, at any rate, evinced a pro-Britishness which is common enough amongst Dutch <Col N="589" /> people.  Our experience has shown that he has no inclination to regularise the sheep market in the EEC as all the other markets have been organised. I sympathise with the Minister's difficulty because I know he is up against a reluctant commissioner and an unheeding Council.  There are only a couple of countries in the Community of Nine who are interested in sheep.  It is difficult for the Minister at Council meetings to convince his colleagues of the vital importance of sheep husbandry to about 30,000 of our farmers.</P>
    <P>Speaking of sheep, more attention should be given to the question of mortality in flocks, especially winter mortality and especially in mountain flocks.  I often wondered whether it might not be worth while for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to take time on television to alert farmers to the dangers that arise to their flocks especially in the winter time from diseases like pregnancy atoxemia, and so on.  A little timely husbandry could save a lot of money. It would be a worth while investment on the part of the Department to examine the desirability of having a small television programme possibly once a week on a topic such as that.</P>
    <P>The same shrinking and drawing back to which I have referred in the cattle herd and the sheep flock exists in the pig herd as well.  There is the same absence of organisation.  I can see immediately that the pig and bacon industry generally is very difficult to organise.  A rationalisation scheme for bacon factories was in existence and I wonder what has become of it.  For a herd with a kill of possibly two million pigs a year&mdash;I guess that is in or around what it would be&mdash;the factory capacity of the Irish industry is much too large.  It contains 35 or 36 units some of which are very modern and very efficient but in the last analysis the onus for the inefficient, old-fashioned, backward-looking pig producers must rest with the herd owners.  It is important to bear in mind that pig production, as well as milk production, must remain the pillar of the small farm economy. There are exceptions.  There are <Col N="590" /> specialist producers in the field of horticulture and so on but these are a minority.  If we are serious about maintaining the smaller farmers on the land we must do everything possible to make pig and dairy production an economic reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the creditable performance of the dairy industry during the past year in regard to gallonage but, as has been the case in respect of the cattle herd generally, there is a diminution in the dairy herd, a diminution which shows a serious drop in numbers.  This situation need not necessarily lead to a drop in milk production but it probably will have this result in the absence of any measure to increase the production of individual cows. Maintenance at the 1973-74 level of milk intake is not an economic proposition. There must be a rapid increase in the amount of milk taken in at reception points throughout the country.  A couple of years ago we were thinking in terms of a milk intake of 1,000 million gallons per annum but I doubt if we will reach that figure by 1980.  The common mistake that many farmers make is in thinking that the way to increase milk production is to increase cow numbers. That is one way of achieving this aim but it is not the only way. Another way is to improve the quality of cows and the standards of cow management and nutrition as well as to extend the milking season.  This factor is of vital importance to the dairy industry, an industry which has invested so many millions of pounds in processing plant which may remain idle for a long time.  It will be very economic for them to pay premiums on both late and early season milk. It would be well, too, that the Department would indicate their interest in this and their readiness to participate in this area.</P>
    <P>Co-operatives have been under attack recently by the Government and may have to defend themselves on certain fronts but in the context in which I am speaking they have not done anything dramatic.  One of the many serious deficiencies which the dairy co-operative movement has <Col N="591" /> shown is a lack of interest in this matter of the extension of the milking season.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech had an allusion or two to the question of animal health.  When we speak of animal health at present we are talking of the dispute between the Minister and the veterinary profession regarding the brucellosis scheme and the Minister's refusal to allow the TB eradication scheme to go ahead.  Everybody is aware now that the veterinary union are a very intractable group of people. The Minister was right when he said that lay persons should be engaged in the disease eradication programme.  I do not believe the contention of the veterinary union that the taking of blood samples is a matter for professional people only.  They say it is and in the context of what they say and of their reference to underemployment in the profession and also in the presence of their adamant refusal to accept anything else, both they and the Minister should consider the introduction of lay staff whose work would be confined to duties of a non-professional kind.  I acknowledge that what I propose is a compromise.  I acknowledge also that the veterinary union have been very intractable in this regard but they say it is the Minister's responsibility and has been his responsibility for the past 18 months to ensure that the disease eradication programme goes ahead uninterrupted.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the dispute between the Minister and the profession, it has been my opinion for the some time that an all-out attack on animal disease is necessary.  The Minister knows well the reasons for this.  He knows of the hygiene conditions imposed by the EEC in respect of which there is a deadline of 1978, a deadline which we have not a hope of reaching.  However, we should endeavour to do our best. Any Government would need to make special financial provision for this scheme.  Instead we have had a very serious regression.  I have personal evidence of this in the appearance of lesions in cattle at meat factories in a herd which had been cleared for a long time but which was admittedly, in a danger county&mdash;Kilkenny.  There <Col N="592" /> is a body of evidence that would point to the increase in the disease status of cattle.  There is the re-invasion of clear herds by both tuberculosis and brucellosis.</P>
    <P>I suspect that all the manifestations of brucellosis in both male and female animals is imperfectly understood and that a good deal more research is required in this area.  One aspect of brucellosis that escapes the attention of most people is its ready transmittability to humans.  Human brucellosis is becoming a serious medical problem.  I suggest to the Minister that the veterinary union is prepared for a settlement.  Many people have been repelled by their obduracy just as they were not impressed by the Minister's evident lack of zeal in looking for a settlement.  As a possible compromise. I suggest that lay staff should be used for reading ear tags, rounding up herds and other unprofessional work. Herd testing could be a lot more efficient than it is.  Any person who has personal experience of it, as I have, will know that the procedure is very ragged.  The vet may arrive in the yard on a Tuesday morning before you have finished your second cup of tea.  While the cattle are being rounded up the vet is standing around the yard for two hours.  Veterinary time is far too expensive to be wasted in that way.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the general state of farming as reflected by the enormous drop in the use of fertilisers and lime.  Since we left office the use of phosphates has dropped from 155,400 tons to 91,775 tons, which is a drop of over 50 per cent.  Last year there was a 40 per cent drop on the previous year.  The use of potash has dropped from 93,000 tons to 50,000 tons.  Strangely enough, the drop in the use of nitrogen has not been as dramatic. There is a very serious danger in this.  Any farmer will tell you that you can get a quick result from the stimulus of nitrate fertiliser.  With the rapid spread of silage making in recent years that is what has happened.  Instead of buying the basic nutritional fertilisers farmers are being driven to use the stimulant nitrogenous <Col N="593" /> fertilisers, either ammonium nitrate or urea.  This gives plants the capacity to rob the starving phosphate and potash resources that remain in the land and it damages the soil structure.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that our use of fertilisers was only half the right amount in 1973, a drop to about half that quantity is intolerable.  The effect it has on crop production, especially grass production, is that after three years of this treatment grass production will be halved.  We cannot sustain that because our main objective in agriculture is the expansion of our herd.  The earth is being spurred and stimulated but it is not being nourished.  Any farmer will tell you that you cannot get away with it.  The land will wait.  If it is deliberately damaged it will have to be deliberately repaired.  The repair process takes longer than the damage process.  The use of lime is down by half a million tons.  In the case of soil approaching the 6.3 ph level, unless sufficient lime is spread you will not get any result from the use of phosphate fertilisers.  Phosphate fertilisers are fixed in the form of iron and aluminium salts and the phosphate you have paid for and spread on the land becomes unavailable unless you spread lime.</P>
    <P>It is hard to see the good cheer that the Minister's speech exudes from every page.  Admittedly, it is the Minister's own well-mannered approach. It is low-key good cheer, but there is no basis for it.  There is a need to look at the question of the subsidy. The subsidy has dropped since we left office although the cost of phosphates has tripled.  The subsidy on potash has gone altogether.  If you compare the proportion of the available subsidy to the total cost of phosphates you will find it has dropped to vanishing point.  The current phosphate subsidy is not realistic.  The Minister is right when he says it is false economy to rob the land without using lime, phosphates or potash where necessary, but it is trite to say that and nothing else.  The Minister should say that, having done that, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will ensure that you have <Col N="594" /> adequate markets for your expanding herds and accept that it is his job to ensure that you get it in co-operation with the farming organisations.  Of course, the evidence is that you will not get it because of the shrinkage of animal stocks.</P>
    <P>As a farmer I sometimes think that we have become over-reliant on the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and on Brussels.  This is foolish.</P>
    <P>Reliance on others has affected the farmers' co-operatives as well.  The food processing industry has had to fight for its life in recent months against the Government's proposal to tax them into the ground and inhabit their growth.  Co-operatives can play a vital part in the development of agriculture.  It is clear from the Government's action that they are not aware of the enormous potential the co-operative organisation have.  They have achieved many things since the early sixties such as the concentration of the dairy industry, its modernisation and the development of the capacity to handle vast quantities of cattle in 1975.  Was it one million tons in that year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 1,300,000 tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pretty formidable achievement.  In the case of the dairy industry the whole business is co-operative and the meat processing is largely co-operative.  In my opinion their organisation is defective in many ways.  The whole thing needs to be studied by them and also by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries because in the end the co-operative movement will require Government assistance and also sympathy which they do not appear to have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I firmly believe our economic recovery will be based on the food industry. We are fools if we do not cotton on to that fact and also ensure that the co-operative movement is doing its job properly.  I do not believe it is doing its job properly at the moment.  The movement should be told that.  The co-operatives are possibly, in many ways, prisoners of their own origin.  They are framed in <Col N="595" /> the straitjacket of the framework from which they grew.  Their organisation, marketing, management structure and the service to their shareholders are bad.  I know there are some shining exceptions.</P>
    <P>We have been talking at length about cattle, sheep, pigs and improvement in nutrition and feeding.  I am not aware that the co-operative movement in any spectacular way have shown any interest in the type of cattle produced by their shareholders, how they feed them or what type of animal health status exists in the herds which supply them.  It is their business to do this.  I hope, in the future, that I can talk more directly to the co-operative movement about this.  We will need this enormous industry with all its faults, which is still growing and in many ways very modern, for national recovery.</P>
    <P>Farmers, instead of relying on the donations of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or the farm modernisation scheme, should rely in the final analysis on themselves and their own organisations, especially the co-operative organisation and take whatever assistance and sympathy they get from whatever Government are in office at any particular time.  They should rely in the first place on their own resources, strength and people.  Farmers should try to get away from the hand-out because it is destroying initiative. That message may be beginning to sink into people's heads at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister saying that he is seeking an overhaul of the farm modernisation scheme. There is unanimity throughout the farming scene about the short-comings of the farm modernisation scheme as it applies to Ireland.  It is unreasonable for the Commission to suggest that the same standards should be applied to the highly developed Dutch or Danish agriculture as should be applied to ours, which is not half developed because of the limitations that have been imposed on agriculture in this country for so long.</P>
    <P>The element of flexibility is missing <Col N="596" /> from farm development.  I do not like the exclusion of large numbers of people to the limbo of transitionalhood because the underlying suggestion to the people who are so segregated is that they have no future in farming. In many of the more prosperous agricultural constituencies there is probably a future for the part-time farmer whose holding is too small to afford him a living and he has to have a job.</P>
    <P>The denial of any assistance to such a man under the farm modernisation scheme is unfair from the social point of view.  It is unwise socially because the consequences of this denial eventually will be that the man will sell his land and go to live in a town or city. Our towns and cities, especially the major ones like Dublin, Cork and Limerick, are big enough.  The depletion of the countryside has to stop. There will be a further diminution, no matter what happens, because of the marital status of a great many households and because of the lack of successors in farms and the high average age of farmers.  There should be a national resolve, which should not be confined to one party, one group or one section, that the decay, as distinct from the diminution, of the rural population, must be stemmed.  In some cases, such as land acquisition, radical measures will have to be adopted to stop that decay.  The farm modernisation scheme can be a weapon in the hands of the people to combat this.  I applaud the Minister's efforts to have it revised and I wish him well.</P>
    <P>Talking of rural decay, a process of which we are all aware, as we are all aware too that the process is most acute in the western part of the country where the disadvantaged areas scheme applies, I think the Government should raise its contribution. This is one of those schemes which is discriminatory and the Minister was right when he looked for payment by the Brussels Community rather than by substantial national Government contributions.  The difficulties Governments such as the Italian Government and our own Government have in paying their share are far greater than the difficulties of the French Government, <Col N="597" /> the German Government and the Dutch Government, and so their disadvantaged areas scheme is far better than ours.  That, of course, is not the Minister's fault because when we are talking about providing money we are talking about providing taxpayer's money.  If we are serious about giving assistance to those in the poorer disadvantaged areas but fail to provide that assistance, then we shall have a deserted countryside.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a fundamental examination of this whole matter. First of all, there needs to be a fundamental decision made whether or not we are really serious about keeping people in the poorer parts of the country.  If we are then we must decide and decide honestly.  The Government must tell the people what they are going to do.  These problems have not yet been thought out sufficiently and there is dire need for them to be thought out.  One of the references we have in our locker is the disadvantaged areas and I hope the Minister will take note of what I say.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave himself a little pat on the back about his achievement in the 2 per cent devaluation in the green £.  By the time the Minister was home from Brussels the value of the 2 per cent devaluation had been dissipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right because you never lose the value of what you gained there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense.  It is not as bad as it might have been.  It can be measured by the size of the MCA. The Minister spoke about MCAs and the effect the devaluation of the green £ had, modestly enough really, but in the way politicians talk.  The effect on our exports was wiped out in a week. That was not the Minister's fault.  It was due to the slippage of the £ on the money markets of the world.  The relationship between the value of the green £ and the value of the ordinary £ has changed to the detriment of the agricultural community because of the slippage of the £.  I think the Minister should look now for another devaluation in order to keep the coefficient.  If he does look for it, however, we will <Col N="598" /> be in trouble with the Minister for Industry and Commerce because it would have a bearing on the cost of foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a valiant attempt to paint a picture of temporary well-being, of forging ahead, all systems go, onward and upward into the new upland of the future.  Great stuff, but it is not true.  That is not the way we are going.  If one looks at the stark realities and the weapons in our hands, the animals we own, the crop production, the condition of our fields, they are all wrong.  They are all headed in the wrong direction.  I regret that, while the Minister's efforts have been in many ways creditable in his arduous journeys back and forth to and from Brussels, we have no progress to report.  We have been losing ground for the last three years and we cannot afford to lose much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his very comprehensive brief.  It is a most interesting document. The principal Opposition spokesman's contribution, apart from a few necessary political gibes, was fair enough.  Since the Minister took office he has made a reputation for himself in Europe.  In the sphere of bending the very rigid EEC rules the Minister has been quite successful in regard to the farm modernisation scheme and the farm retirement scheme.  But we need much more.  The Minister is obviously not getting much support from the other member states when it comes to bending rules in favour of this little nation.  From the point of view of success I would instance the Minister's achievement in regard to the inclusion of certain types of grants in the deprived areas scheme.  That was a significant achievement that practically went unnoticed and I would like to put on record my appreciation even though my part of the country is not involved to any great extent.  That achievement and his achievement with regard to the green £ are noteworthy.  Some people might be inclined to say he was nearly overdoing it with regard to the green £ but he has worked like a trojan to level up and solve the monetary <Col N="599" /> problem as a result of the daily devaluations of the £.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the importance of a well-informed farming community.  I am not at all sure that our investment in agricultural education is at all adequate.  I would mention specifically our investment in post-primary education.  One would think from our post-primary schools generally that the agricultural scene was not as important as it is.  Our vocational schools are geared towards sending young people into industry, and many of our post-primary schools are too academically-minded, whereas, with the way agriculture is progressing, there will be, in spite of what the pundits say, more people employed one way or another in Irish agriculture in the future.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gibbons pointed out, we are not as well developed as our EEC counterparts.  We have a long way to go, but that in itself, the fact that we have a potential, that our potential is not exhausted is an advantage; in other words, we have places to go.  Unlike our European counterparts, who have practically exhausted their agricultural potential, we can, especially in the areas of the country that are not so well developed, start development.  A lucrative market is available and what may have been considered in the past an expensive operation not worthy of investment is now viable.  I refer to the massive drainage programmes that are currently being undertaken.  This will put into the hands of young people additional land for dairy production, beef and so on and more important than anything else, will give employment on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the farm modernisation scheme, one aspect I would complain about is in relation to the scope for part-time farmers.  Part-time farming has become a very significant factor in many parts of my constituency, where people find employment for part of the year in the food processing industry as well as having a small portion of land.  This is a development which should be encouraged.  These people should not be pushed gently out of agriculture to make way for bigger farmers.  On the contrary, the Land <Col N="600" /> Commission should look at the situation. I would like to see young people, who work in industry in the towns being able to obtain small portions of land, 20 or 30 acres, to enable them to carry on a part-time operation, which is a sound proposition both for the people themselves and for the economy, and also fulfils a great social need.  It prevents the depopulation of rural Ireland and encourages the people out of the cities and towns, thus solving a number of problems.</P>
    <P>Again on education, while the agricultural advisers have been doing wonderful work in regard to winter classes, it is hardly adequate, especially in the present context of people having to work late and early and finding it difficult to attend these classes.  We must start with the youth and treat agriculture the same as any other subject for leaving certificate and so on, with more emphasis on agricultural education. The better-informed people are, especially in the context of the EEC, the better job they will do in farming.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in referring to dairying at length, said that something like 629 million gallons of milk are being produced and that the price of milk has gone from 16p to over 30p a gallon.  I do not think we can hope for this type of spiral to continue in dairying; in fact, I am quite sure it will not.  Prices will stabilise and costs will probably continue to rise.  Obviously, there is great scope here both in regard to work on the farm and at factory level.  In relation to production on the farm, I am not thinking in terms of greater numbers of cows; in the past few years there has been too great an emphasis on this.  I would be inclined to think of better cows.  I paid a short visit to some Six County farms in the recent past and I was amazed at the large number of high-yielding animals.  We, too, have our high-yielding herds but, unfortunately, they are not the rule.  We must think more of better animals and ruthless culling of the low yielders.  This we are slow to do.  A good healthy cow is allowed to continue consuming valuable grass although not paying her way.  The time to cull is when these animals are making good prices in the market place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> On the processing side of the dairying, here again the Department should be complimented for their performance in helping out new projects.  I myself was involved in a few of these projects, and this is the sort of thing we must continue to do.  We now have the very useful marketing umbrella of Kerrygold.  This market brand is to be found all over Europe and in many other parts of the world as well.  It has a reputation for high and consistent quality.  There may be talk of a European recession but the EEC is still a golden market for us.  The British market is not as good as it was, but we have this fantastic market in Europe for as much produce as we have to sell.  Every day of the week they are looking for new products, blue cheese, yogurt and so on.  We should be diversifying into all these new products and this is where we will score.</P>
    <P>As regards yields, we have for far too long been ignoring the real lactation period, and we must think of bringing forward the calving dates. With modern techniques, artificial insemination and so on, this is feasible. With the advance of science it is now possible to have practically the whole dairy herd calving in a matter of 48 hours.  This is a great step forward, and the people who have explored this should be complimented.  Deputy Gibbons mentioned the use of scrub bulls.  Very often the use of lesser quality bulls is due to the failure of artificial insemination and sometimes the difficulty of observing animals in heat.  With the strides that have been made, it is possible to have all the animals inseminated at the one time. I am particularly interested in this development and I would like to see it being universally used.</P>
    <P>During the debate it was said that our beef cattle breeds are not all we would like them to be.  I do not altogether agree with that view.  Our cattle are generally up to European requirements and that is what we must think about.  It may be that initially when we were moving carcases into intervention not enough emphasis was placed on quality and on the preparation but this has been <Col N="602" /> taken care of.  I should like to see the boning of the animals, and indeed the use of the entire animal, being done at the processing plants.  I should also like to see an Irish product being exported with a brand name so that it is possible to identify it back to source.  Our exports in this area should not be unbranded or anonymous, as at present. In order to obtain top quality it is necessary to identify the product and this benefits the marketing end of the business.  For instance, if we were selling meat under the Kerrygold brand, it would be identified in the market place as a high-grade product of consistent quality.  In the recent past we have not had this kind of consistency.  People engaged in the marketing end of the business have had complaints from the market place but now such matters will be taken care of and I am glad to note that.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the exporting of animals and the Minister informed us that he has not the right to interfere in this area.  If a certain number of live animals must leave the country, so be it.  We should not compel people to take a certain course but we should encourage them by making processing more attractive. That should not be very difficult.  If the Italians can produce beef in 12 months there is no reason why we should not be able to do that here.  In one of his speeches the Minister referred to the &ldquo;jobbing&rdquo; mentality and I think it is true that we have inherited that kind of mentality with regard to cattle.  Frequently the same animals change hands four or five times.</P>
    <P>With regard to winter feed, in the past we may have put too much emphasis on expensive rations and not enough emphasis on proper silage-making.  We will have to give consideration to the intensive fattening of animals.  In my opinion that is the road to efficiency.  I was interested in what the Opposition spokesman had to say about the Simmental breed.  Perhaps we should carry out more investigations into their effectiveness as a dairy breed.  I had not associated them with dairying but if they have this potential obviously <Col N="603" /> they are a breed that should be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to tillage and I was glad to note that recently he has spoken quite a lot about this matter. At the moment there are about 1.2 million acres of tillage, which represents only about 10 per cent of the total area under crops and pasture. In other EEC countries, farmers with suitable land plough as much as possible.  We have a long way to go to catch up with them.</P>
    <P>Cereals are the most dominant crop in a tillage programme; they comprise between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of any such programme.  If we are thinking of increasing tillage, we must think in terms of wheat, oats and barley.  In the last few years prices for these crops have improved significantly.  For instance, bread-making wheat has increased from £48.67 per ton in 1973 to £76.80 in 1976; soft wheats have increased from £48.67 to £67.82; feed grain has increased from £38.97 to £65.80.  These are significant increases in a short time but the acreage under cereals has remained static at around 850,000 acres.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the opening exists for substantial increases with regard to the area under tillage.  We could double our milling wheat and the same applies to feed barley and oats.  We have a considerable amount of land available and there is good tillage land in the south and east.  We could produce cereals comparable with the best in Europe.  The Agricultural Institute and An Foras Talúntais have helped to pinpoint the potential of these areas.  We could produce not only our own requirements but also a surplus for export.  In the past we had national guaranteed prices so that producers at the time of sowing could be certain of the harvest prices.  These prices can now be influenced by world markets.  There is the gap between intervention and threshold levels and the price range can be substantial. At the moment our shortfall is in the region of 400,000 tons while in the case of the north of Ireland it is 1,000,000 tons.  We could push our <Col N="604" /> grain acreage by nearly 500,000 acres.  These figures do not take into account the additional demand for pig meat and poultry.</P>
    <P>From conversations with people engaged in the machinery business at the recent Spring Show I am convinced that the swing to tillage is coming.  It was very noticeable this year in the demand for sugar beet acreage.  I should like to compliment the Minister on his approach to sugar beet.  I am delighted he has now taken the sugar beet industry under his wing. For the first time ever the sugar factories are now under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, where they belong.  I do not know what stupid reason there was for keeping them under the Department of Finance in the past because the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was the proper one for this important and vital industry.  In a short time the Minister has succeeded in upping our &ldquo;A&rdquo; quotas of sugar significantly.  This year we can grow 84,000 acres of sugar beet and he guaranteed a price for all our sugar. However, I am not satisfied that we should leave it at that.  The main inhibiting factor at present is the capacity of our factories.  Even though times are difficult and money is hard to get, a lot of money must be spent on this industry.  The capacity of some of our factories must be doubled.  We got the wonderful concession this year of being able to import cane sugar from abroad so as to keep our factories going during the off-season but I see no reason why we could not get involved in the partial refinement of sugar.  During the busy season part of the refinement could be carried out and in the off-season the refinement could be completed.</P>
    <P>The importance of sugar beet cannot be emphasised enough from an employment point of view and from the point of view of feed to supplement the feed grain.  The Irish Sugar Company for a number of years have been toying with the idea of putting in proper ration and feed plants.  This is long overdue.  It would need State aid to get it off the ground.  This by-product of sugar has proved to be <Col N="605" /> very valuable, healthy and a useful ration.  I was hoping that this year all applicants for sugar beet would be satisfied.  This was far from the case. There was a tendency among farmers to move back into sugar beet but the tragedy was that we were not able to satisfy their needs.  I hope that no time is wasted on improving our sugar quota still further because these are the sort of concessions we should and must get from the EEC.  It would be different if we were looking for handouts but all we are asking for in this regard is an opportunity to produce. We cannot be denied this.  I am sure the Minister will not be denied it and will succeed in pushing the quota to more than 250,000 tons of white sugar. That should be our target.</P>
    <P>If we succeed in that we will have more people employed in the sugar factories and on the farms.  The natural follow-up from sugar beet is grain and this would make grain growing more attractive.  If that happened a better balance would be struck.  There is the danger of our agriculture becoming lopsided in favour of dairying.  All the EEC Directives have been an encouragement into dairying and very little emphasis or assistance towards tillage farming.  I could never see the logic of this because we have always had a good tradition of a balanced type of farming.  I am in favour of restoring that balance of tillage and dairying. I see nothing meritorious in this one type of production particularly with the type of soil we have.  Obviously, parts of the country will have to continue with a limited type of farming, dairying or sheep production, but in the areas where we have soils of universal application, where virtually any crop can be produced, a balanced type of operation should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I have not seen anything in an EEC Directive which gives help to tillage farming.  This is an area where a lot of help is needed.  With the expensive equipment involved we could also go to the EEC seeking assistance in the expansion of the horticultural side of this industry.  Horticulture was given scant enough mention in the Minister's brief but in my view it is an important <Col N="606" /> part of the agricultural industry.  It is one that could grow given the necessary help.  It has been the Cinderella of the industry for many years and of late the demand for the product has been growing.  We have been having consistently good years of late.  It may be due to the fact that other European countries were having a bad year but we have now found our place on the European market with a series of good products.  We should be making a greater effort to get more markets for these products.</P>
    <P>In my view this all goes back to the idea of centralised marketing.  I know that is not a very palatable proposition for those with good products to sell but looking at our exports from a national point of view there is a lot of logic in the type of marketing adopted by some nations, of offering all their products under the one brand name.  Some nations offer all their products under the one marketing theme.  That is very important.  We have limited marketing expertise without having it as diversified as it is at present.  We need to pool our resources in marketing and it would be better if we could get all our products under the one brand name.  In this way we could offer to our customers a full range of products and the scarce product could be used to sell the product that is more plentiful and less in demand.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the comments with regard to fertilisers usage.  I am satisfied that while fertilisers took a bad turn in 1974&mdash;this was probably due to the late buying in 1973&mdash;the use of fertilisers has improved.  In my part of the country it is back to normal.  I agree with Deputy Gibbons that the overuse of nitrogenous fertiliser could be damaging in the long run, but by and large it served a useful purpose in the short-term.  It helped people to get used to the shock of the high price of phosphates and potash.  All Irish soil that is farmed properly has massive reserves of phosphates and potash.</P>
    <P>With the high cost of handling, bags and so on, I should like to see the Department and the Agricultural Institute examining the question of bulk handling.  They have made a success of <Col N="607" /> this in other countries but it has been pointed out that because of our moist climate we would probably have difficulties with bulk handling.  Yet, whatever the snags, it is well worth exploring and I see no reason why large amounts of fertiliser for sugar beet and such crops could not arrive and be spread on the farm.  It would mean a significant saving to farmers and lead to efficiency.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Agricultural Credit Corporation for their performance, especially recently.  It augurs well for general confidence in agriculture when the commercial banks and the ACC are quite willing to fund any worth-while agricultural enterprise.  As a young farmer I often tried to convince my bank manager that I had a worth-while project but often I did not succeed.  It is a new situation now when you have lending agencies volunteering assistance to farm enterprises, The ACC are particularly worthy of commendation because of their long term lending, the most significant form of lending for agriculture, as money can be availed of over a long period.  There is not much hope of the &ldquo;fast buck&rdquo; in agriculture which provides steady income over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Opposition spokesman mentioned land acquisition.  This is a matter for another Minister.  I believe it could help significantly, if we had land moving, even on some sort of long-term leasing, directly into farmers' hands.  The Land Commission are not doing a good job with the 11-month system but are continuing a bad system. I should like to see the wishes of the Macra na Feirme President carried out in this respect, so that as soon as possible we would have long-term leasing.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister's work for this all-important industry is showing results and I have no doubt that he will continue to guide agriculture in future years.  I trust he will meet with the same success.  We have had ups and downs in agriculture since the Treaty of Accession but of all industries agriculture is meeting the challenge <Col N="608" /> best.  Farming contributed largely to our economy in 1975 and will continue to do so in 1976.  Prospects generally are good.  We are in what I regard as the upswing in Europe and at any stage they could well afford to pay for our products. They always insist on the best quality.  It took a certain time to get to know what they wanted.  For instance, in horticultural produce we did not have what they wanted initially whereas Israel and some other countries did.  We are now getting around to these things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons said that our beef breeds are not correct; perhaps not. We know there was a time in intervention when what butchers would call the hanging period for meat was not adequate if we were to produce the right product.  If this was so, we should not take that short cut in the operation.</P>
    <P>The potential for expansion in agriculture is vast.  We are not nearly up to the standard of production in European countries.  Perhaps in the past the type of expenditure required was not justifiable&mdash;I shall not criticise that&mdash;but when you have land making about £1,000 per acre and conacre making £100 per statute acre we must look seriously at the amount of waste land we have and see what can be done about getting it into production. As has been said, production here is only a drop in the ocean in the EEC markets.  If there is a mountain of anything in the EEC we are only contributing a barrow-load and it is irrelevant to suggest that we are producing too much milk or anything else.  Our production is not significant in that context.</P>
    <P>We can employ many more people, however, in agriculture and associated industries.  When the crunch came these were our best industries, food processing and so on.  In the rough days of 1974 we had full employment in dairy industries and meat processing. This will be the pattern&mdash;more processing.  As the Minister said he cannot and will not prevent live exports, but if the processing side is made more attractive there would be no need for live exports.  If we copy the Italian methods there will be no <Col N="609" /> need to send cattle to Italy or anywhere else; we can give the Italians meat in a cellophane bag and gain full advantage for the processing of that meat at home; in other words, we can give the employment at home.  All that is going to take a considerable amount of money and a certain amount of time, but now that the money is available the encouragements under the Farm Modernisation Scheme are there.  I agree that the scheme is certainly still a bit tight. Another criticism I have is that there is far too much paper-work involved in this scheme.  It is too difficult to operate.  The scheme should be centralised quite a lot and should embrace practically everybody working in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I do not favour the idea of gently nudging people out because of transition or something else.  My advice to anybody who has a few acres of land is: &ldquo;Hold onto it by the skin of your teeth and try to get a few more if you can.&rdquo;  It is grand to have people who are brought up to being able to go out and grow the necessaries of life. The proof was in the year that is gone when potatoes were scarce.  I noticed this year that a lot of land that had been growing wild grasses and so on is now being brought back into cultivation.  Even around Dublin people have suddenly discovered that potatoes can be grown in gardens and places like that.  All that is for the better.  During the emergency there were schemes, especially in the suburbs, where people got plots of ground to cultivate.  For one reason or another, perhaps because food was cheap, all these plots were neglected and fell by the wayside.  The same thing happened in the UK.  I noticed recently over there that they, too, had given up that idea.  However, there might be something in it for the future.  If people especially in suburban areas had little plots they could fight the flab or do something with a shovel in the evenings and thus provide a certain amount of their family requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister's actions with regard to the veterinary dispute indicate that <Col N="610" /> he is doing his best in this very delicate and difficult area.  At this stage I am not going to comment on it but I wish him well and I compliment the president of the IFA for his efforts to resolve the dispute.  I agree with Deputy Gibbons about the seriousness of the dispute and how it could affect our cattle exports in the future.  We all hope that the Minister will be successful and that in the near future this awkward situation will be resolved because the sufferer eventually will be the farmer.  The business of lay technicians is a difficult area.  However, the system is being used in the north of Ireland and as an experiment here it probably would not have upset the industry at all.  I am hoping that, thanks to the intervention of Mr. Paddy Lane, we will have an end to this dispute.  With regard to the taking over of the Irish Sugar Company by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, I would like this matter to be expedited and that the Minister would put his boundless energies into seeing that this industry is expanded. Up to now all he had to do was to try to get more sugar for us.  He has now a direct involvement.  I hope he will come down and visit our factories and compare them with some of the EEC factories and that the necessary improvements will be carried out.  I see no justification for the importation of cane sugar for any reason, especially when, with the partial refinement of sugar, we could make the necessary work for the off-season. I hope the Minister will convince the people in Government that this is certainly an area of great investment.</P>
    <P>We have, thank God, gas and oil off our shores and mineral resources coming along our way, all very helpful and necessary but the basic wealth of this country has been and always will be the first six or seven inches of Irish soil.  We have a long way to go before this will be fully exploited.  The next ten years will see a significant development in this area because, as has been pointed out, we are in fair and square competition now with our European counterparts.  There was a time when we had very often to give away our products and the products <Col N="611" /> had to be subsidised.  There is no longer much need for that.</P>
    <P>We are, of course, still helping with regard to subsidies, I was glad that somebody gave us credit recently for an extra sale of 4,000 tons of butter. This was certainly a pat on the back. We have regained what I consider the very necessary supremacy over other commodities and I refer to margarine. It is great that butter has really come back on the market in such a big way.  Again, it was due to a little incentive given by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the future we will be facing the open marketplace with good markets, assured markets.  With regard to grain we have £5 or £6 a ton advantage there over any imports because of our insular nature.  Therefore, I see no reason why we should not be self-sufficient.  Why should we be importing 400,000 tons of feed grain? Why should we not be putting nearly one million tons of feed grain into the north of Ireland when it is needed there?</P>
    <P>All these are matters that we will have to encourage and foster but if the indications from the machinery people are a good guideline the tendency is back to a certain amount of tillage which is a very good thing. I am constantly in touch with agricultural people and their confidence is there at the moment in expanding, in farm machinery, in farm building and in dairy herds and in the general appearance of farm premises.  It is significant that we are developing our farms into show pieces as they should be developed.  This will become more noticeable as time goes on and travelling around Ireland would be like travelling around any other EEC country.  Our farms will be of just as high a standard as the farms in any European nation.  These fantastic improvements are particularly noticeable in the west of Ireland, even in the small-holdings, and why not?  The more we do to help these people in their farms the better.  There is more to life than economics.  For social reasons and everything else small farmers here, whether part-time or otherwise, should be encouraged. There should be more emphasis on <Col N="612" /> retaining people in rural Ireland.  In the end the nation would be the better for it because we would have better social structures, less congestion in our cities and a better balance generally.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his ministry.  He has been the subject of a lot of unnecessary criticism from time to time.  That may be part and parcel of his portfolio but he has gone abroad as a man of great determination who is extremely popular with the farming community.  It is important that he should not be swayed unduly.  The ball stops in his court at all times.  He has to accept responsibility for his Department, make decisions and, very often, he can be a very lonely man when he has to make a difficult one.  If it turns out to be a good one he receives all the praise but, if not, he is the subject of much criticism.  However, the important thing is that he makes decisions and that is where he shines.  Perhaps not all of his decisions were the correct ones but the important thing is that he made them.  I compliment him again and am proud to be associated with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has come into the House with his Estimate for Agriculture. Since I came in here I think this is the first time this Estimate has been debated.  For the past couple of years the Estimate was passed in approximately three or four minutes before the House adjourned for the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I listened very attentively to Deputy Hegarty.  In the course of his contribution he said the Minister very often is a lonely man.  I believe the Minister's heart is in the right place but that his back-up from the Government is extremely bad.  Any criticism I make of him is well intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that there is no agricultural policy spelled out in the Minister's brief.  It merely states our present position and what has taken place in the past year.  But, as far as I can see, there is no policy on agriculture.  Farmers are not too badly off at present and not much heed <Col N="613" /> would be taken of anybody who would complain that he was.  But there is a lack of confidence persisting because they have had a bad three years, particularly 1974, which will never be forgotten, in which the farmers suffered a severe setback in their incomes.  After all the ups and downs since our entry into the EEC&mdash; and I have discussed this with the Minister before&mdash;I would have thought that there would have been some study undertaken in Europe with regard to the future of agriculture.</P>
    <P>We do not even have an indication of the trend of consumption in Europe at present.  We are merely told that cattle are likely to be good.  We know that because they are scarce at present.  We were told the same about milk and other commodities before.  I want to know if there will be any direction forthcoming from the EEC or will they continue to function as inefficiently?  I stated this openly before, and I do not mind repeating it, that our Department could teach them a lesson.  It is my experience that the inefficiency and lack of study of consumption trends in Europe have led to meat piles, milk piles, by-products of milk and so on.  There does not seem to be anybody who can indicate where we are going.  There are many people within our own group in the EEC who should be able to give some indication of forthcoming trends in the next four or five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister said things were looking good for certain commodities at present.  I agree with him there, but I do not think the Minister would stand up and say they will be good in four or five years' time.  He could not do so because there is no planning in agriculture.  As Deputy Hegarty said, no matter what oil is found here, agriculture will remain our principal industry. I have been reading a comment by a communist who said that people would need to get back to the land.  He said that in capitalist and communist countries now the trend was to go back to the land, to the family farm.  That is all the more reason why we should study agriculture. Indeed our financial position and <Col N="614" /> so on over the past 12 months would have been very much worse were it not for agricultural exports.  I do not believe any attempt is being made within the EEC with regard to forward planning.  It may be contended that I am always speaking about this, but I shall continue to do so.  I contend that there should be some type of balancing fund set up within the EEC in case of the rainy day in respect of any commodity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty spoke, very properly, about why we should get back to tillage.  When I was doing some tilling I was laughed at.  About five years ago I had to throw potatoes on the roadside.  We saw what happened to them last year because no planning had taken place.  Had I received something out of the Kitty at that time I could have continued in potatoes.  Had the small cattle man got something out of a fund in 1974 he would not have been as badly off.  I know the State cannot afford it, but surely there could be set up a balancing fund in Europe that could withstand the cost. Such a fund would cushion people against a drop&mdash;nobody's fault, except bad planning within the EEC.  Now that things are going fairly well I cannot see why such a fund could not be created and I would ask the Minister to give it very serious consideration. I would ask him also to give serious consideration to the question of planning.  People might ask &ldquo;What good is a plan?&rdquo;  But a target or plan is vital for any farmer.  Otherwise he will not know where he is going. Therefore, it is essential that he have such a target even though he may not attain it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty said that our production was only a drop in the ocean. I have listened to that for a long time. When the slash came in 1974 our drop in the ocean was hit just as were other countries.  If a commodity goes down, the small producer is hit just as is the larger one.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the ideal situation would be to have our cattle processed, an opinion with which I thoroughly agree, but that would not be possible within the context of the EEC.  Unfortunately, we <Col N="615" /> are in a unique position until we educate people in my part of the country to produce cattle and finish them. We are doing everything possible.  But, traditionally, they were produced in the west and finished in the east.  In 1974 we had to depend on the factory and on the east and neither gave too hoots if we gave them away.  If cattle are to be sent direct to the factory I should like to see some kind of agency set up to buy them, and not make rings, as they did in 1974, to ensure that they got them cheaply.  Everybody is aware of that fact.  Even though I agree wholeheartedly with what the Minister said, in the general interests of the country, employment and so on, processing and sending out our cattle would be the best way of doing it.  We are in a unique position that the majority of our young cattle are finished in the east while being produced in the west.  Under no circumstances would we agree that there be any stocking of cattle going out on the hoof.  We will be reaping the full benefit of having been in Europe in 12 months' time.  I cannot see why any feeder or factory here could not compete with their counterpart in Europe.</P>

      <P>Since 1st February, 1976, there have been over 2,000 separate visits to prisoners in Portlaoise Prison each involving two or three persons on average.  For security reasons, however, some persons have been refused entry as visitors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, any person who proposes to visit a prisoner for the first time would be well advised to give advance notice to the Governor of his or her intention and that person would be cleared.  That can be done.  The prison authorities would prefer a system of visits by prior arrangement.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if there is any special significance in recent peremptory and apparently harsh transfers of members of the Garda, particularly in County Donegal; and why disciplinary hearings requested in some cases were not granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Transfers are a matter of internal Garda administration under the ultimate authority of the Commissioner.  Liability to transfer in accordance with the exigencies of the service is a normal and accepted part of the service of members of the <Col N="617" /> Garda Síochána.  The length of the notice given to a member who is about to be transferred depends on the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I assume that the reference to disciplinary hearings relates to a recent case where a member of the force who had refused to obey a direction to transfer was subsequently dismissed. In that case, the Commissioner acted under a provision of the Garda (Discipline) Regulations, 1971, which allows the Commissioner, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, to dismiss a member without the holding of an inquiry where the relevant breach of discipline is so grave that he decides that the holding of an inquiry could not affect his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that regulations are made to facilitate the orderly working of whatever organisation may attach to them.  Is the Minister satisfied that merely leaning on regulations in the case mentioned specifically by the Minister, but not named, is just not good enough?  Leaning on regulations and merely quoting that there is a regulation that covers this, that or the other where injustice obviously exists, where harsh treatment has been handed out is not good enough.  Before a man is dismissed surely to God he is entitled to be heard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, first of all, that no injustice and no harsh treatment has been done in this case.  I am quite satisfied from the facts of this case, which are well known to the member concerned, that the Commissioner did the only thing open to him to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not that particular case of dismissal that I was most concerned about.  I am asking about the cases pending at the moment of sergeants in Raphoe and Convoy. What has the Minister to say regarding the peremptory manner in which they have been bumped for transfer? Why has it happened in the other case that the man was dismissed?  Is it a fact that the hearings will not be granted in some of these cases because again the informers rather than the informants cannot be produced <Col N="618" /> since they are SIB people from the other side of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion that there are unknown informers in any of these cases, or indeed in any case, is quite untrue and inaccurate.  The reasons for the transfers in these cases are well known to the members concerned. The reason for the short notice is, as I have said, that sometimes the exigencies of the situation demand that the notice given has to be short. Further, transfers are an internal matter of Garda administration for the ultimate authority of the Commissioner and I am not consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that shifting people peremptorily and at short notice to Border stations is one thing that can be properly understood but shifting people from Border counties to the remotest post that can be found for them is not something that demands urgency in their transfer particularly in the case of married men with families and all the rest of it?  This is what is happening.  Hearings are not being granted.  The Minister should inquire into this.  In the case of the dismissal he mentioned, the garda was not given before his dismissal any reason why he was being moved and he was ultimately dismissed.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made from the North-Eastern Health Board and I am informed that the information requested by the Deputy is not compiled for any of the counties of the area.  I should add that, since valuation alone is not an accurate indication of a farmer's income and is not the sole criterion used in assessing a farmer's entitlement to a medical card, and compilation of information in the form requested would be of <Col N="622" /> limited value and the cost of compiling it would not be justified.</P>

      <P>No.  My information is to the effect that the only figures that could be known would be the total of those in receipt of medical cards.  In order to obtain the information requested by Deputy Crinion every single record in respect of a medical card holder would have to be scrutinised.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for a health centre in the Finglas West/Finglas South area of Dublin. The Eastern Health Board are in negotiation with the Dublin Corporation for the acquisition of a suitable site at Cardiffsbridge for the proposed health centre.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment of old age pensions at an earlier age was one of the aims listed in the statement of intent published in February, 1973. Since then the qualifying age for contributory and non-contributory old age pensions has been progressively reduced from 70 to 67 years.  These reductions were implemented as part of the general budget provisions so that the necessary financial arrangements could be made to meet the cost involved.  The question of further reductions will similarly be considered in the budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The means of the person concerned, as assessed by a deciding officer for unemployment <Col N="626" /> assistance purposes, represent the estimated weekly value to him of the benefit or privilege of board and lodging in his father's household and take account of the number of persons in the household, the fact that his father is in permanent employment and the amount of the latter's earnings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the grave hardship that has occurred in many cases such as this for the reason that, while the householder may apparently have means, the choice is either to keep the person unemployed and have this sort of charge set against their eligibility for assistance or dump them out?  It is as simple and as regrettable as that in many cases and I would ask the Minister to have a further look at that. This thing of board and lodgings is not something they have by right, it is only on sufferance and in many cases the householder cannot afford it.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the suggestion made by the Deputy but I am afraid I cannot promise a change in the immediate future.  There is a lot of sense in what the Deputy says in relation to this problem.  Unfortunately it has been so for many years. I can understand the plight of somebody who has no money whatever and that the fact that he is kept by his household means he is not eligible for unemployment assistance.  I am not happy about that situation but I cannot make any promise.  I am certainly prepared to have it investigated to see if any other method can be employed.</P>

The allowance is paid as an increase of pension or benefit payments and a separate figure of its yearly cost is not available.

      <P>Due to his failure to disclose his full means in connection with his original application for unemployment assistance the person concerned received unemployment assistance amounting to £291.70 in excess of that to which he was entitled and this amount was being recovered by withholding payments due to him. Because of an error in calculation at the local office, which is regretted, an excess sum of £103.75 was recovered in this manner and arrangements have been made to have this amount refunded to him by post together with payment of unemployment assistance due for the week ended 18th May, 1976.  Further payments will continue as they fall due.</P>

      <P>That is under consideration. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, if somebody is not entitled to a new house grant according to the regulations, it would be rather foolish to make him entitled to a water and sewerage grant for the same type of house.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider extending it for the new house and for the water and sewerage?  A figure of £1,950, plus £100 for each dependant up to a maximum of three, is a miserably low income limit for new house grants.  It bars large numbers of people from getting their new house grants.  Would the Minister consider increasing that limit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will take steps to ensure that the small farmers' housing scheme is utilised to the full by all local authorities; and if he will especially draw their attention to the spirit of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Under devolved procedures, it is for local authorities themselves to decide, within available resources, what houses they will build and for whom they will build them. There is, therefore, no up to date information in my Department as to the extent to which housing authorities are using the approved scheme for the rehousing of small farmers with land holdings of £5 valuation or less.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that I have particular interest in, and sympathy for, families in rural areas in real need of rehousing.  He can rest assured that I will continue to encourage authorities to provide houses in rural areas for those who need them, including small farmers coming within the scheme.  To enable local authorities to press on with their housing programme, £65 million has been provided in the public capital programme in 1976.  I might add that the corresponding provision in 1972-73 was £25.38 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That still does not answer the question.  Will the Minister inquire into the spirit in which this scheme is being operated?  It was intended to cater for farmers with valuations of under £5 who, in some cases, are regarded by the managers as non-farmers. If they take casual work they are debarred from getting a house on their small holding.  If they are useless and do nothing else, they can probably get it.  This is working to the disadvantage of those small holdings for whom the scheme was intended, <Col N="633" /> and who are up and doing and taking casual work as and when they get it. They are calculated to have earned more from their casual outside employment than they did from agriculture on their small holdings, as you would expect on a holding with a valuation of £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the difficulty has arisen.  Any local authorities who want to carry out the scheme can do so.  I have encouraged them.  I do not think the Deputy would suggest I should go down to Donegal and tell the county council what they should do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is down there a good deal at present.  If he feels some of his people are not being properly dealt with, he might remind the county council.  I have encouraged the building of houses in rural areas. As the Deputy is well aware, I have allowed planning permissions in places where they were not previously allowed.  Despite what is stated in the question, from my recent visits to Donegal I feel more small farmers' houses have been built over the past couple of years than have been built for some time.  I was very pleased with what I saw down there.</P>

Under section 51 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, there is enough authority to have offenders prosecuted although I am not aware of any prosecution so far for this offence.</P>
      <P>However, there is the question of our acceding to the UN Convention on Road Traffic which was opened for signature at Vienna on 8th November, 1968, and which is still open.  If we were to accede to this convention our domestic legislation would have to conform in substance with the convention's provisions which are that in order to facilitate overtaking outside built-up areas, drivers of vehicles or combinations of vehicles of more than 7,500 lbs, which is the permissible maximum weight, and of more than ten metres or 33 cubic feet overall, shall, except when they are overtaking or preparing to overtake, keep at such distance from the power driven vehicle ahead as to allow that other vehicles overtaking them can do so without danger.  There is no immediate intention of taking any decision in regard to the signing of this convention, so in the meantime all we can do is to ask the Garda to be more vigilant in regard to section 51 of the Road Traffic Act.</P>

      <P>Since May, 1974, legal tender notes <Col N="639" /> are printed at the Central Bank's new currency centre in County Dublin, with the exception of small quantities of higher denomination notes in the existing designs which are still printed abroad.  I am advised that it would not be possible to change the printing arrangements for those larger notes at this stage as the bank's printing works is in the process of producing the new-design note series which it is planned to introduce shortly.</P>
      <P>I understand that the minting of coin has now commenced at the currency centre and that our requirements will shortly be met from this source, apart from the supply of 50p coins.  In view of the relatively small number of coins of that denomination required and its special design features it would not be economical at present to manufacture it here, but the possibility of doing so in the future will be kept under consideration.</P>

      <P>(i)  neamhní i leith ábhair Ghaeilge faoi bhun 1 cholúin,</P>
      <P>(ii)  £3 an colún Gaeilge i leith ábhair suas go dtí 3 cholún (agus an tríú colún a áireamh),</P>

    <P>4.  Is go dtí an Rúnaí, Roinn na Gaeltachta, Baile Átha Cliath, 2, ba chóir iarratas ag lorg cabhrach faoin scéim a chur.  Má bhíonn an t-ábhar céanna á fhoilsiú ar níos mó ná nuachtáin amháin (mar shampla, ar dhá nuachtán de chuid aon ghnólachta áirithe) ní cóir cabhair ina leith a lorg ach do nuachtán amháin díobh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I have already made my attitude in regard to the desirability of general payment in cash perfectly clear and I have stated in the Dáil and elsewhere that it is the intention to phase out the use of land bonds as a medium of payment.</P>
      <P>Significant steps have already been taken in that direction.  For example, while in the three years to 1972-73 only three quarters of a million pounds were available for the purchase of lands in cash, in a similar period following my appointment as Minister for Lands almost £6 million were allocated for that purpose.  By any standards this is a significant allocation and it is especially so in the prevailing economic climate.</P>
      <P>It is just not possible at the present time to finance land purchase entirely in cash and in order that the work of land structural reform can be maintained, recourse must be had for the time being to the use of land bonds as a medium of payment. I am concerned to ensure that the bonds will be acceptable.  Last year the bonds bore an attractive interest rate of 16 per cent&mdash;a recent market quotation for them was 106½.  The current series carries 15 per cent interest which is also a good rate just now.  It is too early yet for a market quotation for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will give urgent consideration to ensure that the Land Commission give equal priority to con-acre farmers in the allotting of land which those farmers have been renting for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The primary objective of land settlement policy at present is the structural reform of uneconomic holdings throughout the State.  Nevertheless, the Land Commission have, for long, been aware of the claims of men, especially in East Donegal, who can be described as farmers without land.</P>
      <P>However, where land division is concerned, the demand invariably exceeds the supply and in that situation the Land Commission have to weigh the merits of one individual or category against the other.  In particular, they may not disregard their principal obligation, as stated already, to enlarge as many as possible of the great number of existing non-viable holdings whose owners will not be able to survive in farming unless they can secure extra land.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the Land Commission have always taken into account the position of the conacre farmer in East Donegal and, of the 23 new farms allotted there in the period since 1964, 14 were given to conacre farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While this position is peculiar to East Donegal, are these conacre farmers regarded as third priority re-settlement cases and do migrant holdings come under the third category?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> They are not regarded as a top priority. The bringing up of the uneconomic <Col N="649" /> holder to an economic standard is first priority.  Long distance migration is practically a thing of the past.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> While recognising the substantial&mdash;if unacclaimed&mdash;work done by the Land Commission over the years, I have recently expressed the view that the time is ripe for taking a new look at our land settlement programme and procedures. Membership of the EEC has brought dramatic changes in our farming needs and prospects and the way ahead is indicated by the Community's structural directives.  More and more farms are becoming highly developed and intensified and the establishment of rural industry highlights the position of the part-time farmer and his role in the emerging rural community. It is appropriate, therefore, to review our present land policy in the light of requirements of these changing circumstances and the Deputy may rest assured that I am giving the matter close thought just now.</P>

The person referred to in the question did not receive an allotment but, nevertheless, in the course of dividing lands in his vicinity the Land Commission did consider whether, as an act of grace, they could improve the access to two houses, of which his was one.</P>
      <P>However, it was not possible to reach agreement with one of the tenants over whose holding the new road would pass.  In any event, the situation has now changed to the extent that only one of the two houses concerned is occupied and the cost of providing the road would be out of all proportion to the benefit which would accrue.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I referred briefly to the Minister's speech and pointed out that it dealt with the day to day working of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. If agriculture is properly developed, it will provide jobs.  A plan for agriculture is vitally important. We should balance our economy by creating a fund.  If we had such a fund what happened in 1974 just could not happen.  I refer to the complete collapse of the store cattle trade.  We are in an unique position in that we produce the store cattle at one end of the country and finish them off at the other end of the country.  That is something we would like to change and we are trying to change it but, while it is there, I <Col N="653" /> thoroughly agree with the Minister about not trying anything to stop the export of live cattle even though in the long-term processing the carcase here would provide employment. Indeed that would be the ideal situation.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister as to the cause of the shortage of cattle.  The cause is due to the disastrous year 1974.  It is best forgotten but there are people in the west who cannot forget because of the overdrafts they have as a result of what happened in 1974.  The reason for the scarcity at the moment is because people along the western seaboard could not sell a calf.  They could hardly give it away.  Sometimes they could not even gamble it.  They sold the pregnant cow and that is what is causing the present scarcity.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that in the foreseeable future things will be good in the cattle trade.  I agree but I would not like to forecast how long they will be good.  No effort is being made to protect people against market fluctuations.  We must have a fund to balance things out.  The cattle trade is reasonably good at the moment but there is nothing extraordinary about the price of young cattle.  I cannot see why the finishers in the east or the factories cannot compete with the other EEC countries in a free market by buying them in the west and fattening them in the east.  I do not see why they want special treatment and a tariff on cattle going out on the hoof.  We joined the Common Market as a free market and I see no reason why the producers of small cattle should suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sometimes amused at the programmes in relation to the economy. In 1974 everybody was emphasising that milk was the only hope for us in the west.  When will we ever make an effort to achieve a balanced economy? I know what happens when some commodity is over-produced.  The bottom falls out of the market.  The future looks reasonably good for cattle but I would like to emphasise the importance of quality cattle.  The Department are very strong on this at the <Col N="654" /> moment.  I believe that if a man is getting something through the heifer scheme or the beef scheme the calf should be out of a good bull.  I am against scrub bulls.  Unfortunately the Department never told the bull owner to do something that is being demanded at the moment.  If the inspector is suspicious he demands the tag number of the cows served by the bull.  Now the bull owner was never told to do this.  I have nothing against it but it is unfair to ask a man now to produce this information.  It should be the rule and in future the bull owner should be required to do this.  I am 100 per cent behind the idea but proper notification should be given. The quicker proper notification is given to bull owners the better it will be, but it should not be insisted upon at the moment because bull owners had no notification to do this.</P>
    <P>I would not argue with the Minister about dairying because I think I would probably get off on the wrong foot but, where sheep are concerned, I am on firm ground.  I know the Minister is doing his best to get a common sheep policy.  He fought the French as strongly as he possibly could.  It is ridiculous to talk about rules when one remembers the way the French have not adhered to the Treaty of Rome where our exports are concerned.  Sheep are not too bad this year.  I am a sheep farmer myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not bad.  I do not stand up here to complain but for many years we were told to get out of sheep.  I refused.  We should get fair play in the Common Market.  I have my lambs sold and I am quite satisfied, but sheep have got bad treatment from the EEC and I would appeal to the Minister to keep pressing for a common sheep policy.  Wool is fairly good.  There was some criticism about people not knowing the price of wool.  I am a member of the Wool Council and that body does everything possible to keep people informed as to price and trends.  The council have no control over prices. They are trying to implement regulations designed to clean up wool and <Col N="655" /> they have done a reasonably good job. I congratulate the producers of wool because they were the first to make an effort to clean up wool.  I believe there is a future for wool.  It is a very important commodity.  I signed the minority report because I believe that until wool is marketed through one channel the situation will not be right. No matter how rigid regulations are they will be broken if wool is dear. I would like the Minister to re-examine the whole question of setting up another board on similar lines to the British Wool Marketing Board.  I am expressing a personal view, not the views of the Wool Council, because I signed a minority report on this a few years ago.</P>
      <P>The new sheep dipping regulations are a joke.  I do not want the Minister to misunderstand me.  I am with him on one point.  Everybody dips in summer time for maggots, but the important dipping is the autumn one for scab.  However, an autumn dipping after October is just not on.  If anybody wants to have early lambs and the ewes are pregnant, is it not a joke to put down January as a dipping period for sheep?  It should not be after November anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am 100 per cent behind the Minister in respect of the month of October, but it is ridiculous to ask farmers to put sheep into a dipping tub after November.  When the order was made, I am one of those who agreed with the autumn dipping for scab because there are lice and other things in the wool that prevent the sheep from thriving.  Farmers will do the summer dipping; the autumn one is the one they do not all do, but I say it should be finished by November or even October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the headage payments for sheep in the designated areas, there should be a limit.  There are few what I might almost call companies with thousands of sheep on some of the mountains.  If a man gets a subsidy for 200 sheep he is not doing badly. There is a limit on the headage payment <Col N="656" /> of £300; it may be a bit low, but I agree with having a limit.  However, it is not right, if a man owns the whole side of a valley that he should collect a subsidy from the State on a few thousand sheep.  I would rather see a larger subsidy for a limited number. Although I mentioned the figure of 200 I would not object to it being higher, but certainly not going into thousands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it is not being got legally by some people already, but surely the Minister will agree with me that it is wrong to be subsidising two or three thousand sheep which might belong to an individual or a firm.  The sheep situation is not too bad at the moment, but I would ask the Minister to keep pressing for a better deal for sheep and for a common sheep policy.  I would not advise people to get out of sheep or any other line of production in which they are doing a good job.  On reasonably-sized and even small farms people have done well on sheep and I would hate to think that they would be advised, as they have been advised&mdash;but not by the Minister&mdash;to get out of sheep production.</P>
      <P>Again people were told there was no future for pigs.  The Minister did not say himself that people should abandon pig production, but he did say that the EEC were anxious to get us out of pig production and the less pigs we produced the better they would like it.  At that time I was trying to get money for pig fattening co-operatives to keep people in pigs.  The Minister referred briefly to poultry, but what has happened there is that poultry has gone completely from the small man.  It is a few big syndicates that have the control of the poultry industry, and the same thing would have happened with pigs were it not for the fact that pig fattening stations went into debt to pay a price for bonhams, at a time when pigs were at a very low ebb, to encourage people to stay in pigs.</P>
      <P>This all goes back to the balancing fund which it was sought to create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Pregnant sows were sent into the factory and when the factory asked some of its employees to take the sow litter and rear the bonhams, they said no, they would not take them for nothing. That would not have happened if there was a balancing fund to give the farmer a subsidy on his sow so that he could stay in pigs.  Pigs are very important to a small farmer, because it is one source of production you can stay in without broad acres.  That is why I am delighted the pig has come back into production.  Unfortunately many small producers have gone out of pigs because there was no support for them at that time.</P>
    <P>I would like to endorse any encouragement for tillage, because it is a terrible thing for the small farmer who is in dairying to have to go out and buy potatoes, that they have not sown enough for themselves.  I am one who always tilled 20 acres out of a 50-acre farm until I came in here. For years people were laughing at us tilling, out on a wet day pulling beet and looking after potatoes.  It is only five years since I had potatoes into July, and in the finish I asked somebody to take them away for nothing and they would not take them.  That is what happened last year.  If people were given an acreage payment they might stay in tillage.  I might not stay in tillage because I am getting too old, and anyway when one comes in here one cannot look after the land. However, the ordinary man likes tillage; it is something he can become fond of.  During the war years my brother had 26 acres which I ploughed and sowed, with the help of a pair of horses.  I know what it is to plough with horses and with a tractor, and if the return from tillage was even nearly as good as that from another source of production, people would stay in it.  It is not easy to switch back to tillage once you have left it because of the huge price of machinery which is needed for tillage.</P>
    <P>In my area at that time there was a group of 40 and we were sowing a couple of acres of beet each.  We were mechanised; at that time the sugar company used to let out a harvester. That group is gone by the way-side, <Col N="658" /> but if that group were to set up again today the cost of machinery would be more than double what it was when we set up the group.  It would be to the benefit of the economy, as well as to the person who had a small holding and who wanted to buy feeding stuffs, if a certain amount of tillage was done particularly in the areas that are good for tillage.  There should have been an acreage payment made at that time.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Minister in this respect; I am going back over the whole policy of the Department, because it is the first chance I have had to say what I think on this matter.  I disagreed with the policy down through the years in that there was no attempt to balance the economy.  If there was a proper policy people who were in a certain line of production would not jump out of it.  Down through the years somebody heard some line was good and every instructor went down the country telling farmers to change to a certain line, and after about three years the bottom would fall out of the market.  It is not all that easy to switch from one thing to another.  This is a matter to which careful thought must be given in the future.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the condition of the land of Ireland due to the fact that there is not sufficient phosphate or potash being used.  As Deputy Hegarty correctly pointed out, extra nitrogen had to be used in the short-term to get production but in the long term it is detrimental to the land. After 1974 people had little money but with what little they had they bought nitrogen in order to have silage for the following year.  Farmers who are engaged in tilling put a reasonable amount of manure on the land all the time but farmers not engaged in this kind of farming, particularly those engaged in the production of young cattle, did not use phosphate or potash because they did not have the money. I asked the fertiliser companies and the Department if anything could be done but I was told that EEC regulations prohibited it.  I was also told to keep my mouth closed because what <Col N="659" /> we had might be taken from us. Apparently EEC regulations do not affect the French and I shall refer to this matter later.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with the veterinary surgeons' dispute here because I do not think that will help the matter.  So far as the farmers are concerned, it is a scandal because they are the people who will have to pay in the long run.  There is an order in force that female cattle cannot be exported if they do not come from a clean herd.  This means that if a farmer wants to sell some of his cattle for export he must have the entire herd tested.  Up to now it was necessary only to have tests carried out on cattle that were being sold.  So far as the vets are concerned, they will be paid for testing but the Department will not pay for that.  The farmer will have to pay the costs involved.  I hope it will not be long before tests are resumed for TB and brucellosis but I am very worried about the position. The Minister will also have to take into account the completely unrealistic price for reactors, particularly for high quality cows.</P>
    <P>It was a mistake to stop having the dressings for warble fly made compulsory. Warble fly is an infection that can occur if one farmer in a locality does not have his cattle treated and an entire village can be affected.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on another occasion, it is a disadvantage to be a politician if one is a chairman of an outside organisation.  Every move one makes is thought to be for political gain.  If I think I can help in any area I will do what I can without considering any political advantage that may be obtained.  During the course of the veterinary surgeons' dispute I thought at one stage I could have been of help but I also recognised that I was branded as a politician.  I appreciate that is the game and that there is nothing I can do about it.  I do not know the Minister's reactions to some of the suggestions now being put forward but I would point out that some of them were suggested by me 18 months ago.  At that time I said <Col N="660" /> negotiations should be continued while the testing was being carried out.  I am sure the people involved in the dispute have made every effort to settle it but in the long run I believe it will be achieved by personal contact between the Minister and the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in the interests of the cattle industry to settle the dispute.  I realise he has a difficult job.  Everyone knows that certain people who hold special jobs cannot be done without.  They are privileged in that way and from the beginning one is at a disadvantage. The dispute cannot be settled unless there is a compromise of some kind. I should like to see it end in a facesaving situation, where neither the Minister nor the vets would have to say they were beaten.  The Minister cannot say he was beaten and the others do not want to say so either. Even though I am a politician, I am very willing to help in this matter.  The people are fed up because they know that whatever the final settlement may be the farmer will be the loser.  He will have to pay through the nose.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred to Directive No. 160.  As I pointed out in Galway, this is one directive with which I thoroughly agree.  I am only sorry we have not enough instructors to carry out this directive in the way I should like. Practical education is of vital importance to the farmer.  Many instructors have told me they have learned more practical education in two years while working with the farmers than in all their years at school and college.  I have often heard people at lectures telling farmers that cows should calve at certain times but they forget that while things may work out in theory this does not always happen in practice. It is important that people be educated in the practical implications of what is written down in theory. Theoretical farming from an armchair will not work.  I remember a famous company instructed an employee to sow wheat on 18th March in a certain plot but on the date in question it was flooded with water.  However, according <Col N="661" /> to the man in the armchair the plot should have been sown on that date and the employee was reprimanded the following week because he did not carry out the instruction that was written down in the book. I can assure the Minister, as a man with a lot of practical experience, that it is not as easy to put the theory into operation as some people think. This directive will give the man with practical experience a chance to get some of the theory.  Directive 160 is one of the best directives to come from the EEC.</P>
    <P>County committees of agriculture have always had financial problems because of the amount of money allocated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  For example, this year only £3 million is provided in the Estimate for those committees. The amount allocated to them is too little with the result that they have been unable to carry out all the work they would wish.  These committees do a reasonably good job considering the amount of money they have at their disposal.  I welcome the suggestion in the white paper that education and research be joined but I have reservation about the board suggested in that white paper.  In my view elected public representatives should have the majority on such a board. Elected public representatives should also have the majority on county committees of agriculture, not as suggested in the white paper.  I am in favour of bringing in members of rural organisations, but any State board spending State money should have elected representatives in the majority.</P>
    <P>On the educational front I should like to pay tribute to Macra na Feirme, an organisation I have had a long association with.  In the early years of that organisation it was considered to be a university for the farmer who had not received secondary education.  The lectures arranged by that body proved of great benefit to the farming community. In the coming years we will appreciate more the work done by that organisation, particularly in the west of Ireland.  Another matter of vital importance to the west is land reclamation.  In this regard I should <Col N="662" /> like to inform the Minister that the French Government are spending a lot of money on land reclamation thereby breaking another rule of the Treaty of Rome.  It is my intention to question this when I have all the necessary information at my disposal. My information is that a huge amount of money out of the national kitty is being spent on land reclamation in France but we are not permitted to spend a bob on such work.  There is a national scheme in progress in France and I hope the Minister will question the French on it.  The French have broken the Treaty of Rome in regard to sheep and now they are doing the same with regard to land reclamation.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what efforts have been made to get money for drainage works in the west.  Land reclamation is not possible until major drains have been cleaned and there is little point in talking about using fertilisers until farmers get rid of the water on their land.  When advocating our membership of the EEC I did so in the expectation that we would be given assistance for such work.  I have been more than disappointed with what has happened to date in this regard.  If we are to survive in the west, the land there must be drained and we must be given money for land reclamation work.</P>
    <P>I read a book recently on farming systems operated in communist and capitalist countries.  That book was written by a communist who had made an in-depth study of the two systems.  In the capitalist countries the trend was to get the people off the land and into industry while in the communist countries they had State-owned farms.  The author of that book came to the conclusion that neither system worked and that the tendency now was to return to the family farm.</P>
    <P>It was wrong to introduce a tax on co-operatives.  I had a small number of shares in a co-operative and I received only £5 as a dividend.  The small co-operatives in the west who deal solely with farm produce are providing a great service for the farm-appointe <Col N="663" /> ing community.  I notice that the Minister has not mentioned fishery co-operatives.</P>

      <P>If we did not have the co-operative movement in the west, we would not have survived.  In this regard I should like to mention that an effort was made to take over the sale of cattle&mdash;those involved wanted to be on both sides of the counter, to be buyer and seller&mdash;but the people of the west objected and set up their own marts.  As a staunch dairy man I am sure the Minister agrees that creameries set up co-operatively are barely surviving.  It is wrong to tax them at this stage.  I ask the Minister to use his influence with the Minister for Finance to do away with this tax.</P>
      <P>When I voiced my objection to Directive 159 I was accused of throwing water on a good directive.  I accept it is a good directive but it is completely unsuitable for this country. For example, only 4 per cent of the farming community in my constituency qualify under that directive. The Minister should seek to have it changed and another national scheme substituted such as one to help &ldquo;transitional farmers&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Transitional&rdquo; means &ldquo;Get out; you are only there for a period&rdquo;.  Now they are politely called &ldquo;Other Farmers&rdquo; and they get reasonable grants, but there is no planning. The Minister mentioned the number that applied.  Everybody who gets a grant must apply; you must be classified before you get a grant.  The number of applications does not count; it is the number who qualify.  Even for the few who qualify the back-up service is not there, more through a lack of clerical staff than lack of instructors. Our instructors at present are dealing with paper work when they should be doing field work which they are qualified to do.  We have asked for extra clerical staff and we have been refused.  In the case where a married woman has to get leave of absence while having a baby we do not get permission for a replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty spoke about the <Col N="664" /> banks and how they are giving out money at present.  They will do that for a while but they could change very quickly if there was a downward trend.  Certainly, the ACC are doing a very good job.  When marts first began the banks were giving out money freely for the erection of marts but when these marts did not do so well I have seen the screw being put on.  Although things are going well at present I would not be too sure that the banks would not put on the screw again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things that I cannot discuss because I have not sufficient time but the most important thing for Irish agriculture is to have a policy.  I most regret that the Minister did not state here that he has a policy for Irish agriculture and that he is working towards a target. This is of vital importance and I would ask the Minister to consider it.  At present farmers are not so badly off but they do not know what will happen next year.  They had trouble before when they over-produced. While Deputy Hegarty made a fine speech he said that our production was only a drop in the ocean; I do not accept that.  If the slump comes abroad, it does not matter whether you are a drop in the ocean or not, it is all the same.  The slump goes all across the board; it happened before.  I should like the Minister in replying to deal with some of the points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have been helpful.  I did not speak in order to get a crack at the Minister.  I would make the same <Col N="665" /> type of speech whoever was Minister. I criticised various Ministers through the years because nobody attempted to have a balanced economy here and it has now been proved conclusively that a balanced economy is the correct economy.  We saw what happened regarding potatoes because they could not be sold; it also happened with pigs and in everything else through the years.  No attempt was made to cushion the farmer who happened to be in that line of production.  We hear that factories are now short of cattle but we had very little sympathy from the factories in 1974 for anybody fattening or producing cattle.  Nobody had any sympathy for the cattle producers. The man who is now being asked to rear the calves wants to know if this is just a gamble, if there is any future in it.  This is a matter that can be dealt with abroad, not here.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Estimate was brought before the House this year; otherwise I would be very annoyed because it is our only chance to discuss agriculture. If this Parliament is to mean anything, before decisions are made in Europe they must be discussed here.  If I were Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries I would come to the House and I would ask for a three-hour debate if there was to be a discussion in Europe about the changing of directives and so on so that I could have the views of my own people when going to Europe.  Then I would have some confidence in the European setup but apparently European directives are decided abroad and if we try to raise a question here we are told it is contrary to EEC rules.  I should like to see this changed so that we, as a Parliament, would be more relevant.  As it is, we are directed from Brussels.  I am not against membership of the EEC&mdash;we would be much worse without it&mdash;but I want a democratic EEC to which Ministers could go armed with the views of the people in the various countries.  Apparently, we do not discuss EEC directives until they are actually law.  I do not know if that is the rule but it is not consultation, which means discussing before making the decision.  When the decision is made it is law and it does not matter <Col N="666" /> then whether we agree with it or not. The Minister has probably heard enough from me and I conclude with that.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity of speaking on this Estimate and glad to have heard the Minister make his very comprehensive speech this morning.  I am also glad to have a copy of the document &ldquo;Main activities of the Department&rdquo;, which is very comprehensive also.</P>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Callanan's final point.  The Community is democratic, or supposed to be democratic, but this is related to the amount of time our democratic representatives can afford to spend there having regard to the difficulties of the dual mandate.  Our representatives in the European Parliament have an opportunity of expressing what they think are the views of the people here to the Parliament, the Council of Ministers or the Commission before the regulations are adopted.</P>
      <P>I have nothing prepared on this topic but I should like to develop it a little further.  The great weakness in our system and where our organisations falls down compared with that of our European counterparts is that they have a generous and well-developed system of back-up services giving them in brief form an assessment of the actual agricultural or other situation that is to be discussed. It is not possible in our circumstances for our representatives to get the same comprehensive service.  In fact, Standing Orders have not even noted the fact that this House has ten representatives in Europe and no concessions or provisions have been made to make our work&mdash;not even less onerous&mdash;but more effective, which is the important thing.  I do not propose to test the patience of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle by proceeding with that point.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to an extent providing that service for us and it is improving all along.  In complimenting the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his Department on the progress that they have made in the past year on behalf of the farmers, I would like to say that the facts speak for themselves.  Our farmers have every reason to be confident in their future. In comparing them with their counterparts in the various regions of Europe, whom I have had an opportunity of examining in closer detail than most, they have and they should have confidence in their own ability to produce the lines of agricultural produce that are in demand and for which there is a guaranteed market.  They have and ought to have every confidence in their ability to compete.  They have that and they have shown that, especially over the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one picks up a paper and sees the price of conacre or of land for sale, <Col N="668" /> which indeed has gone rather high, this shows that progressive farmers have confidence in themselves and in the common agricultural policy, and I share that view and confidence with them.  I would say to the rest, perhaps the weaker ones amongst us, that they should look more positively at the common agricultural policy and the directives that have been mentioned here, 159, 160 and 161.  It would be better if people would learn to look at these three development directives together.  In the main they are complementary to one another.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that for too long even our farmers' organisations were over-critical of these directives.  Many people are not terribly well versed in the facts and do not appreciate the difficulties that the EEC Commission and the Council of Ministers and our European Parliament have in framing common directives for a farming or agricultural organisation which is so diverse as is the European Economic Community in husbandry, in the kind of activity operated right across the community.  It is difficult to have directives that can give a benefit to some extent in each of the nine countries.  I would like to compliment our Minister on the progress he has made in having many of the directives, not just the three mentioned, amended to fit in more closely and enhance the agricultural activities in our country.</P>
    <P>If we could describe Directives 159, 160 and 161 as planned development for which the applicant is paid handsome grants to organise his own development and to ensure and enhance his own future and that of his family, then people would perhaps take a closer interest.  Indeed, the amount of aid, not only financial from the EEC, but the amount of advice and assistance given by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the county committees' advisory services is very significant.  The advice and assistance rendered in 99 per cent of the cases, where it has been matched by the ability of the individual farmers to comply and to operate the schemes laid down, has brought great and, I hope, lasting benefits to the farmers concerned.  I am sure it is possible if one looks at the country <Col N="669" /> to find the occasional farm development plan which may have misfired, but we should not look at the gloomy side.  We should look at the many thousands who are going from strength to strength and from success to success, and long may that continue.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing about the development of the agricultural community and the common agricultural policy is that it is not fair to compare our country with any one of the other eight, because in not very many ways are we comparable and we do not have the same basics.  Our people do not have the same mentality as other peoples and we are very individualistic. Therefore, the schemes as we operate them will be slightly different from any other country. However, I hope that it will be possible for the Council of Ministers and for our own Department to embark on a long-term policy in as many areas as it is possible to do so.  In order to achieve this we must get greater co-operation between all the existing State and semi-State organisations that are presently assisting the development of Irish agriculture. Over many months I have been looking at the problem of the very many farmers in my constituency in the midlands who have not the land to bring them up to the development status that we would all like to see them enjoying.  At the same time in my constituency there are almost a quarter of a million acres of marginal lands for which it ought to be possible to get some EEC aid to reclaim them and allocate them to small uneconomic holders to bring them into the development status.  If we were to take the 150,000 acres of cut-away bog in the midland counties, taking in a piece of Kildare, there is a real possibility for the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries taking a lead with his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, in developing a long-term policy for future utilisation of this kind of land.  That would be of tremendous advantage to farmers in my constituency where the average acreage is a little less than <Col N="670" /> the national average.  It is about 25 or 26 acres.  If all the marginal land in my two counties were made available and spread between existing farmers, it would give an average holding of approximately 88 acres.  I do not want those figures taken too seriously because they are my own and I do not claim them to be 100 per cent correct. Nevertheless, they are not that far out.  In that task we should enlist the co-operation not only of Bord na Móna but also of An Foras Talúntais, the advisory services of the land reclamation section of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries as well as the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why existing services seemed to shy away from universities where there must be so many young people keen on research, fired with the enthusiasm of youth, who I am sure would welcome some practical experience on such projects. Some five weeks ago I had an opportunity of visiting Israel and of spending some time there on some kibbutz.  If, through an irrigation system, the Israelis are able to take ten cuts of silage off what was desert some decades ago, surely we should be able to improve the situation for our farmers by the reverse process? Where land reclamation has been held up for want of an outfall&mdash;I think the main excuse advanced is that the arterial drainage programme will not be undertaken for the next ten years when we speak about the Nore, Barrow or some other midland rivers &mdash;it ought to be possible for the the Department to introduce a system of pumping stations to ease the problem if not eradicate it altogether.  It cannot be very expensive because it is quite a common operation in Holland, in some northern parts of Germany and even in Denmark.  I would hope that the Minister, perhaps with the co-operation of An Foras Talúntais, would have some studies undertaken to lay out the boglands, especially in the Central Plain, part of which is in my constituency and formulate a policy for their utilisation. The depth of peat remaining as a result of Bord na Móna activities creates a problem in this respect.  If the average depth is too low, it will <Col N="671" /> not be possible to utilise the land for a number of agricultural pursuits in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I do know that the Commission frown on introducing new land into agricultural production in present circumstances. The only way it can be introduced and subsidised for the individual farmer is as part of a development scheme to upgrade existing small farmers in those areas.  I can foresee a development, not alone in my constituency but in the rest of the country as well, of not only assisting existing small and uneconomic holders to become viable and gain development status but, additionally, of having sufficient land which could be reclaimed, on 1965 estimates, at a cost of less than £400 per acre.  I do not know who should initiate this.  Surely the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, with his interest in An Foras Talúntais and its advisory services, might even set up an interdepartmental committee to examine the possibilities that this vast area of land presents for the future.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister saying that some 52,000 farmers had applied for benefit under the farm modernisation scheme.  In the coming year I hope it will be possible for the Department to increase the amount of moneys being made available to the county committees of agriculture to enable them to employ the maximum number of advisers, ensure the quickest possible processing of applications, have farmers categorised and their plans drawn up with the least possible delay.  That is important in the present climate and should be undertaken with the greatest urgency.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed in 1974 when the Minister announced the disadvantaged areas scheme because a very small area only of the midlands, of my constituency, was included. Indeed, only about 10 square miles of the Slieve Bloom mountains which cover part of north west Laois and south Offaly were included.  That is not good enough because we have in those two counties very many severely disadvantaged areas that are <Col N="672" /> not mountainous but are bogs.  I clearly recall from debates in the European Parliament that the Commission had proposed that it should be a scheme designed to aid farmers farming on terrain in excess of 3,000 or 4,000 feet in altitude.  They were thinking of mountains in Italy, the Alps, the north of Scotland and so on.  We had the title of the scheme amended to take in disadvantaged areas that were depressions rather than mountains.  In the application of the scheme and in the Minister's proposal there has been a complete disregard for the advantages we gained in that European forum.  I would ask the Minister to look at the disadvantaged areas in those two midland counties at the earliest possible opportunity because the latest statistics available show that the average population there enjoy the lowest income <i>per capita</i> in the Republic.  Surely we are entitled to this kind of service because, in the comprehensive areas included in other parts of the Republic, both the terrain and land mass are of greater value than many parts of those two counties?</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the success of his efforts in having the FEOGA contribution applicable here increased from 25 per cent to 35 per cent.  That represents significant progress.  The Minister is to be complimented especially on winning that concession which will mean a considerable amount of additional income for quite a number of farmers who will appreciate those additional funds being made available to them.  I hope the Minister for many a day will have the energy to continue with the very valuable contribution he is making to the farming community.</P>

      <P>We had to climb five flights of stairs to get to the office when it was at the top of a building in Poplar Square.  In my experience of farming the errand boy for the blue card is usually the grandfather or the father who is likely suffering from rheumatism or arthritis and may need a stick to help him to walk.  The Minister brought it from the top of Poplar Square to a site behind the barracks.  This is not the kind of service farmers are entitled to.

      <P>I am not an expert in co-operative management.  There may be a number of reasons why they are not running as smoothly as we would like.  It was unfair of Deputy Gibbons to put a very negative slant on the figures he presented and at the same time ignore the fact that more than ever were exported last year as well as an extra 91,000 tons of beef. Possibly all those things add up to a depletion of the national herd.  It appears to be on the increase again this year.  The AI stations report increased insemination.

      <P>When Deputy Gibbons speaks about the difficulties of the meat factories he must remember that since the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries put his own particular stamp on the various aspects of agriculture the price of milk has almost trebled.  The best Deputy Gibbons could do when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was to pay around 12p a gallon.  This year under new management the farmers should get on average around 35p a gallon.  This means that more and more farmers are expected to go into dairying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased price given for milk will encourage more people to go into dairying.  I have listened to many of the agricultural organisations' spokesmen talking about the difficulties of the dairying sector.  I believe the dairying people are the best organised.  I heard the deputy president of the IFA make a very strong protest about the suggestion that dairy farmers should be levied in order to reduce the mountain of skim milk powder.  The same gentleman was not as loud in his protestations when the pig producers were saddled with the imposition of a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was perfectly right when he told the farmers to go ahead and produce more milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the Minister; I am talking about the spokesmen.  If it is all right for people like the pig producers to carry part of the burden to reduce the skim milk powder mountain, then the dairy farmers should be burdened as well.</P>
      <P>If the present trend continues&mdash; added to by the difficulties of the monetary snake and the devaluation of the £&mdash;then forces in the Community who could be described as anti-CAP will succeed in having the amount of money available for the operation of the common agricultural policy greatly reduced.  I hope our Minister would resist on appropriate occasions the temptation to follow a narrow nationalist line&mdash;I am not suggesting he has ever done that.  Many pressures are brought to bear on the common agricultural policy.  We should ensure that this country, which is so dependent and which is benefiting so much from the common agricultural policy, does not impose the last straw.  We should take a serious look at the problem of the skim milk mountain.  We should not add to the difficulties arising from the common agricultural policy by advocating increases without first seeing that the £ is strengthened and getting an assurance that there will be sufficient money to continue with that policy.</P>
      <P>Last month in the European Parliament I was started to hear the Conservative members of the United Kingdom delegation proposing an all-out attack on CAP.  They were not attacking CAP as such, but they were attacking the concept of subsidising the production of milk.  If this idea is allowed to develop, the areas in the Community from which it will get support may be surprising.  It is in this area that we as a small country could become vulnerable.  Perhaps the Minister will give me the benefit of his advice when this problem comes before the European Parliament next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's record in regard to <Col N="677" /> the sheep meat policy has been very good.  I know it has been a frustrating year for sheep producers because of fluctuating prices.  Nevertheless, the latest Council decision to have a transitional sheep policy from 1st August next, if I read the document correctly, and a sheep policy hopefully from 1st January next is a great breakthrough.  I hope our sheep producers will take encouragement from the fact that this progress has been made.  I was pleased to see in the shops in Brussels lamb described and sold as &ldquo;Irish lamb&rdquo;.  The price the Irish producers get on the Belgian market is not as high as they get on the French market.  Over the past few years Irish meat has become accepted in Belgium and let us hope this trend continues.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister gave encouraging statistics for the development and expansion of the pig trade and the upswing in the numbers of the national pig herd.  When replying perhaps he would give me an indication of what the Department now consider to be the minimum economic size of a pig fattening unit.  I do not know if the Department have done a recent study on this, but it would be an interesting statistic to have.  I also noted that in my constituency the number of people in pigs appears to have waned in the last year.</P>
    <P>I will now mention briefly preventive medicine and the problems facing the Department and the agriculture industry.  I was glad to see Government agencies stepping up their campaign against the introduction of rabies into this country.  Most people do not understand this disease.  The United Kingdom television services are giving a much clearer picture of the danger of rabies and getting across more forcibly the message that there is no cure for anybody who contracts rabies through a bite from an infected dog.  Yet very often one sees traveling on planes into this country little dogs neatly tucked away into handbags and so on.  These dear old ladies are not only ignoring the regulations but exposing our people, especially our children, to a deadly disease for which very little progress <Col N="678" /> in finding a cure has been made.  I hope the Department's officers at various airports and points of entry will continue to keep a sharp and vigilant eye for people who contravene these regulations.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the Minister because of his dispute with the veterinary profession.  At the same time, we should not lose sight of the outstanding service the veterinary profession render to the farming community, and have done over a number of years.  They are one of the few sections of the community still operating a 24-hour service.  If a kitchen or office appliance needs servicing or repairs, a mechanic or repairman is called out.  The standard house or office call costs between £8 and £10. In the early 1940s the fee a vet got for a call was around £1.  Nobody would suggest that the cost of training a professional man and a technician is the same.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating an increase in fees to that extent for the veterinary profession but nevertheless, we should recognise the fact that prices have gone up.  I feel that the Minister should make an effort to settle this dispute which unhappily has drawn on for far too long.  If the vets were encouraged to employ technicians trained by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries it might be possible to economise in that way.  I accept that the Minister is responsible for the moneys spent by his Department and that the Minister should have control over the money being spent by his Department.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I believe in private enterprise.  I am convinced that the private sector can still give the farmers and, indeed, the Government a better service.  The argument put up by the vets about the continuing need and desire for the advisory content of each call that a vet makes to a farmer has something in it.  It is a pity that the veterinary union has adopted such an entrenched position and it is difficult to see an end to it. Can the Minister say how serious he considers the news announced last week or the week before that the United Kingdom were going to insist on new certificates for all live <Col N="679" /> animals entering the United Kingdom and is it his opinion that this will in any way adversely affect our trade with the United Kingdom?  Having regard to the fact that the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme has been in operation for a long number of years and the vast majority of animals tested over the last five or six years have proved to be tuberculosis free, I do not think the areas that have been looked upon, areas that have been up to now enjoying a disease free status have had an upsurge of the disease.  The problem has, perhaps, been overstated to some extent.</P>
    <P>In relation to subhead B in the Estimate I think that the time has come when the Minister and the Government might consider a greater infusion of capital to the IAOS for the reorganisation of the co-operative movement.  We need a more viable co-operative movement in our country. Listening over the last few months to the many societies who say that they are in financial trouble or in difficulties of one kind or another, I feel that the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society should be strengthened and given the necessary equipment to play a greater role in servicing existing co-operatives and to employ for themselves experts and advisers who are well qualified to guide co-operatives who may be in slight difficulties at the moment.  I have for many years taken the view that the IAOS have been unnecessarily and unfairly restricted. The work that they have endeavoured to do has been of tremendous value to the agricultural co-operative movement. In order to ensure that this will continue and that it will be able to meet the new challenges that have presented themselves over the last couple of years, we need some sort of organisation and the best I can think of is the IAOS.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider strengthening the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society in the coming financial year in such a way as to give them the necessary expert personnel to guide our co-operatives both large and small.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> Many speakers mentioned this morning the fact that we imported some 400,000 tons of cereals over the last year and people are advocating that we put more land under tillage. I listened to Commissioner Lardinois who told the agriculture committee of the European Parliament that the Community as a whole had a shortfall of 500 million tons of cereals and he advocated that we should encourage the growing of cereals right across the Community.  We should accept this and I would ask that when the Minister sits in council some time should be devoted to the problem of making the production of cereals sufficiently profitable to encourage people to go in to do this.  I am not saying it is not profitable but, obviously, it is not as profitable as other lines of production or people would go into it.  If we had a reintroduction of, perhaps, storage silos or something like that, it would encourage many farmers to go into cereal production, especially feed grains.  It would certainly be of great benefit to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months most rural Fine Gael Deputies have been invited to meet organised sections of the farmers, the IFA and the co-operative movement, on the question of farm tax and of taxing co-operatives.  I do not known if this is relevant to the Estimate.</P>

      <P>It might be possible for the Minister to deal with the Estimates in a cyclical form, taking in the average three to five years cycle, and having regard to the weather and other pressures which have an adverse affect on farm incomes. It may not be proper to mention this topic on the Estimate, but it plays a significant part in the agricultural industry.  It must have the attention of the Minister since he is responsible for agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> I wish the Minister continued success. Our export figures for the past year make very good reading in a year when most people were complaining of redundancies and economic difficulty. They indicate great confidence in the industry.  In all cases but one, agricultural exports have shown a considerable increase over the past year.  This must be accepted as the yardstick for the success or failure of Government policy.  Out of 24 headings, only one shows a slight decline in profitability.  Under some headings there are increases of 25 per cent and in one or two 70 and 80 per cent.  This is a record of which the Minister and his colleagues in the Government can be proud.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister of my support in the continuation of this policy which has proved popular with the farming community, although many of them do not like admitting it.  The policy is working.  It is showing tremendous returns not only to individual farmers and their families but also to the spin-off agricultural industries, the supply services and the processing services.  I would ask the Minister to continue with the difficult but I am glad to say successful work he has undertaken.  I assure him of my support and my appreciation of the great work he is doing for our farmers.</P>

      <P>At what cost were these exports made last year?  At the cost of running down our stocks.  At the start of this year our cattle numbers were down 560,000 head as compared with the previous year. Any farmer knows, if he runs down his stocks, this is the start of his ruin, or bankruptcy.  We sold a big number of our cows last year.  Our cattle numbers are down.  This means that in two or three years we will not have the same number of head to export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>This means that cattle to the value of £112 million which were in the country last year are not here this year.  That will have an effect on our economy.  If we are to get the country moving again we must plan ahead.  We have the raw materials and the know-how.  We need planning.  We need incentives to get production moving.  A very small increase in production has dramatic effects on our exports.</P>
      <P>The incentive in relation to our beef herd came first from Deputy Smith in the sixties and from Deputy Gibbons at the start of this decade. They gave the incentives to increase our cattle numbers.  They realised the importance of having increased production from the land.  They realised what this would mean to our exports and to employment.  Because of the Government's inactivity in 1974, the beef herd has been completely wiped out.  It has been said that our cow numbers have been increased and that we are supplying milk to the creameries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Some producers of beef have gone over to milk.  Farmers with intensive dairy herds do not keep calves except for replacement.  In 1974 we had 7¼ million cattle.  Our target should be 10 million cattle by about 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we need is forward planning but it is difficult to understand why the Government who have been in office for more than three years have not paid any heed to such a programme either in respect of agriculture or of any other area.  They should realise that the potential of the agricultural industry is colossal. We now have the situation where cattle numbers are decreasing and there has been a decrease, too, in the use of fertilisers, a factor which leads to a reduction in production.  The creameries can forecast the amount of milk they will receive during the months of January, February and March when they know the amount <Col N="683" /> of fertiliser that has been purchased in the creamery areas in the previous year.  On a national basis sales of fertilisers have decreased by 50 per cent.  As in the case with any industry, farmers must continue to expand. There is no point in remaining stationary.  However, at the time of the next general election this party will have a forward plan to put before the people not only in respect of agriculture but in respect of all other aspects of our economy.  We have always based our programme on the concept of forward planning and shall do so again although the task may prove somewhat more difficult in the absence of a census.  I expect that the Government were afraid to have a census carried out lest it should show up yet some more bad news.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest the application of a small levy in respect of every beast going to the meat factories.  I am thinking in terms of a levy of 2p or 3p per beast.  A system of this nature would help to counteract the fall in prices during valley periods.  However, I would be adamant that the coffers be farmer-owned although administrated by the Department.  The scheme would have to be operated differently from the feed voucher scheme which was a complete failure and has produced some bad effect.  There are always slumps in the cattle trade.  We used to talk in terms of a slump at some stage in a five year period but the periods tend to be a little longer now and the slump may come within a five to ten year period.  We had one in 1966 and again in 1974, the latter being much worse than the former. The moneys that would accrue from <Col N="684" /> the type of system I have in mind could be utilised to make up deficiency payments during those lean periods. The Minister mentioned such a system in regard to pig producers but apparently he did not get the response he expected.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years farmers were encouraged not to borrow too much but that attitude has changed with the result that farmers now borrow large sums of money as a result of which they have a better living. However, they must meet repayments as well as other expenses and the levy system would help them in this regard during periods of depression in the cattle trade.</P>
      <P>On the question of prices it is interesting to recall that the average price paid to a farmer for a product represented 58 per cent of the price at which that product was sold to the housewife.  Today the figure is about 42 per cent.  In other words, the processor, the shopkeeper or any other middleman is getting a much larger margin of profit.  The farmer should be encouraged to handle the processing and sales of his product rather than allow others make a large profit at the expense of his hard work, work which involves very long hours in respect of which there is no such thing as overtime payment.  The Department should look into this aspect of the industry and should make every effort possible to encourage farmers to market their own products.  There should be an examination of the profit margins that obtain now.  I wonder whether the NPC have noticed this situation.</P>
      <P>At the time of the introduction of the farm modernisation scheme the Minister should have been fighting harder to have the scheme geared more to Irish conditions.  Instead, we have the situation where only 18 per cent of our farmers are regarded as development farmers with about 3 per cent being regarded as commercial farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme had already been introduced in Europe. When it was being introduced here the Minister should have been fighting for a more suitable scheme for Irish conditions.  In Europe there is more uniformity in farming and a higher percentage of farmers qualify for the scheme.  I suggested a transitional scheme for nearly 80 per cent of our farmers.  There should be a category for potential developers which would get the same grants.  This would help to bring them into the development and commercial categories.  We are depending on the development category to raise farming standards.  There is no point in giving the main grant to 18 per cent of our farmers.  Even at this late stage the farm modernisation scheme has need for streamlining.</P>
      <P>When it was first introduced I asked the Minister a question and suggested that very few people would qualify for the scheme.  The Minister said that the case I referred to was an isolated one; that he could not qualify because he had borrowed a certain amount of money.  The Minister got a warning before the scheme was fully introduced but, of course, nothing was done about it.  We have now reached the stage where a farmer with 50 to 100 acres can automatically enter the development category if he has not borrowed too much.  A farmer who is trying to develop his farm with the aid of an overdraft has no hope of entering the scheme.  Quite a number of farmers in the transitional category get the normal building grants.</P>
      <P>The grants under the farm modernisation scheme are generous and have given people the incentive to do a good job and some forward planning. Agricultural planning is important. The Minister should produce a plan for the future.  It is dangerous to try to foretell the future but it is much better to try with the help of the Department's experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not got a great export <Col N="686" /> market for our sheep.  We depend a lot on French trade which is harming our sheep industry.  The Minister has been doing his best to help our sheep trade but some type of agreement is urgently needed because our sheep numbers are falling.  Every year I visit a certain town to buy store lambs. In the last three years the lamb numbers have dropped from 14,000 to 7,000 in this one area.  That is a serious drop in numbers in one area &mdash;Blessington.  The old saying &ldquo;Another sheep is a sheep's worst enemy&rdquo; is still true today.  Sheep numbers should not be increased too intensively. This is a wide field, particularly on mountains and in the west where a lot of work could be done in the matter of fertilising land and hillsides to get a little more grazing on the lower slopes.  Sheep farmers in such areas should be given incentives to get their sheep down from the mountains in the winter.  Then in the spring the mountains would be able to carry more sheep.  I am not advocating that this should be done in any extensive way as applies to beef, pigs and poultry, but sheep farmers could be given encouragement to increase their numbers and to export more. We have trouble with absence of set markets and we want to give people hope that there will be a reasonable income for them from their investment and hard work.</P>
    <P>The pig board have markets for a lot more than we are producing.  A year and a half ago when pig numbers were falling some levy should have been arranged to tide the industry over until prices became economical and pig numbers increased.  A number of people were forced out of the industry and people who were not engaged in agriculture came in and engaged in what is known as factory farming in pigs and poultry.  In ten years about a million acres have been sold outside agriculture to professional and business people and to others who had come into the country at a time when our farmers needed more land to be able to maintain their standard of living. Co-operatives have taken over some of this business and in that way it has remained in the farmers' hands, from the sales end at least.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> Then there is the development farmer.  I can tell of a man in the development category who in his forward planning was getting to the peak of his production before the third and fourth years.  It would have been difficult, therefore, to give him development status because his production would not increase in the third and fourth years.  His wife happened to be trained in poultry and she asked: &ldquo;Why do I not go into a poultry unit in a small way?  That would give us forward planning status.&rdquo; That was accepted.  A couple of Department people were sitting in on that forward planning and I felt that the initiative should have come from them rather than the farmer's wife.  There should be more encouragement from the Department, more advice given to them which would render them unafraid to commit themselves.  No business was ever built up on sitting tight: calculated risks must be taken and we need to be taking such risks to stand up to our competitors.  This we can do comparatively safely because we have the best land and the most suitable climate in the world.</P>
    <P>In Holland they are all right as far as irrigation is concerned but in Denmark, Germany and France they have 15 inches of rainfall per annum, all from snow and heavy rain in the winter.  In the growing period from May to July there is no rainfall there. Therefore, we have the advantage over those people from the point of view of climate.  We should be able to get better production and to stand up to them in world markets.</P>
    <P>In those countries they have kept factory farming to themselves.  In Denmark the farmer grows his grass for silage and his root crops for winter feed.  He does this even though he has only an inch of rainfall in the growing period.  They have fairly good pig units as well as dairying and they have their co-operatives behind them which a farmer owns.  That is a country of similar size to us.  Denmark is smaller but it has a larger population than we have and production there is much higher than it is here.  Actually we have tremendous advantages as compared with Denmark <Col N="688" /> and other European countries.  We are not giving a lead where planning is concerned.  The sad thing is that our beef herd, established by Deputy Smith and Deputy Gibbons, has been let decrease to an alarming extent as a result of inactivity in 1974.  There is no encouragement to farmers to produce more beef cattle.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDonald referred to AI. Artificial insemination is availed of for dairy cows.  Where beef cattle are concerned the system is to let the bull run with the cows so there is really no criterion to lead us to believe we are increasing the numbers.  I hope we are but I doubt it.  Stores are not coming on the market in the same numbers.  Farmers have not been encouraged or educated as to the type of cattle we need.  Britain expects to be self-sufficient in beef by the end of this year or early next year and there will not then be the same market there for our stores.  It is doubtful if Britain will take very much of our beef from the factories.  We will need animals that are readily saleable all over the world and that will be the leaner type of animal.  As I understand it, according to the AI people we are coming back to the Hereford. I prefer the Hereford myself.  It is a quick developer.  The housewife, however, is looking for lean meat and the Hereford is unfortunately, no so good from that point of view as some other breeds.</P>
    <P>We may have to go into continental breeds and here the question of our climate comes in.  Some have thinner coats or thinner skins and cannot stand up to the cold and wet.  A rough rule of thumb is the vet testing for TB.  He can always take it that the Hereford will be around 10 to 12. The continental breed will be more likely to be around 7 or 8.  We should be telling the people what type of cattle they should go in for in the future.  The question of housing enters into the picture.  If they must be housed during the winter, then incentives will have to be provided.</P>
    <P>The dairy farmer is in the happy position of being able to see results immediately.  Unfortunately, the farmer producing beef very rarely sees <Col N="689" /> his beeves hanging up.  He sees them going into the factory, nice round fat fellows, good and firm, and he gets his cheque, but he never sees the end result.  The stand at the RDS was an excellent idea because the carcase was on display.  We should have more of that type of thing.  There is need for leadership here.</P>
    <P>Farmers should be encouraged to develop co-operatives.  I am surprised at the Minister agreeing with the Minister for Finance in the imposition of a tax on co-operatives.  At the moment co-operatives are being asked by the banks to produce more share capital. The creamery co-operatives are not affected because they stop a certain amount off the milk cheque.  Co-operatives which cannot do that have to find the share capital from their own members.  Most co-operatives are under-capitalised.  Admittedly, they can borrow seven, eight or ten times the amount of share capital which is something that could not be done by the farmer or businessman.  He would need to have more share capital than the amount of borrowing he would have; it is very seldom a person would be allowed borrow more than his share capital.  I believe that in the future farmers will be asked to put up more share capital for their co-operatives. We should be giving incentives in this direction, because this is the way to ensure that the farmer gets the largest part of the price of the commodity, instead of, as I have said, the proportion dropping from 58 per cent to 42 per cent.</P>
    <P>The farmer should have an organisation, whether it is a factory or a creamery, that can sell right up to the supermarket counter.  No individual farmer would be capable of that, and it is the co-operative organisation that can do it.  There are many co-operatives that would need to take particular note of the word &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo;; it is co-operation.  They should be co-operating in every aspect of the business, but unfortunately quite a number of them are in cut-throat competition with one another. The farming organisations should be able to give a strong lead, encouraged by the Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="690" /> Fisheries, so that all co-operatives would be working as a unit for the betterment of the farmer.  One can often see in the saleyard one co-operative, in an effort to build a better and more effective organisation poaching on the area of another, not worrying whether they take the cattle numbers away from it so that it finds it hard to keep going.</P>
    <P>The co-operatives could do a great deal in the marketing of the produce. Business people can do it even though they are in competition with one another.  The farmers should, in the co-operative movement, be able to put their products on the supermarket counters and not have other people making good profits out of the farmers' hard work.</P>
    <P>Cattle numbers increased from 1970 to 1973, to 7,250,000, and they have dropped now to about 6,500,000.  That is a serious situation for any country, and bringing it down to the level of the ordinary farmer, it is on the road to bankruptcy.  The time has come when we should be planning and setting targets.  The land of Ireland can carry ten million cattle and somewhat increased numbers of sheep and pigs, because the export trade is there for them.  There is not much room for expansion in the poultry business.  Experts have told me that, taking every type of cattle from the calf to the fully matured cow, the land of Ireland can carry that number of ten million.  It can also carry home-grown materials that are needed to feed all those animals particularly during the winter period.  Too much maize and other such commodities are being imported.  A certain amount of protein has to be imported because it is not possible to produce at home all that is needed.  Nevertheless, the land can produce a great deal more. Not alone have animal numbers decreased but fertiliser consumption has also dropped.  It is time to arrest the decline and secure increased production for the coming years.  The increased production will lead to increased exports, which will benefit our balance of payments.  I was amazed to hear the Government saying that, for the first time in about ten years, there was a surplus in our balance <Col N="691" /> of payments last October.  They should be hanging their heads in shame, because the reason given for the surplus in October was the dramatic increase in the sale of our livestock, which depleted our stocks.  That is what gave us the surplus, but instead of taking the hint, we are bragging about it.</P>
    <P>Therefore there are 560,000 fewer cattle in the country.  At around £200 a head, that gives £112 million.  That is a fair figure, having regard to the price being paid for reactors.  It means there is £112 million less capital in the farmers' pockets or 560,000 fewer cattle on the farm.  The reason the sales of fertilisers are down is that farmers do not need as much grass for cattle.  It is necessary to take a good, hard look at that situation and increase the stock numbers to the maximum.  If that is done our exports will increase dramatically. The factories will be able to give more employment and they may be able to regulate production throughout the year so that there will not be too many valley and peak periods. In addition, the farmers will get a greater return for their hard work throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the veterinary surgeons and the Minister have not been able to come to an agreement. I do not think there is any point in reminding the Minister of the effect on the country of the non-testing of animals.  The amount of money invested by the Department in tuberculosis and brucellosis testing has been wasted because there has been no checking on the incidence of those diseases.  In the counties where some testing has been carried out there has been no improvement in the reactor herds and the situation is bound to be worse in areas where no testing whatever is being carried out.  The Minister and the other people involved in the dispute should come to some agreement in the interests of the country.  If the dispute continues for much longer it will not be possible to get one round of testing completed this year.  When any dispute drags on for too long people become entrenched in their attitudes and it is more difficult to arrive at <Col N="692" /> a solution.  As there are negotiations proceeding in the present dispute I will say no more about the matter except to hope that a satisfactory solution is found.</P>
    <P>I should like to see much more forward planning by the Government and the Department to increase production for the betterment of the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A farmer in my area will have to work hard to provide the stores which the previous speaker will fatten on the plains of Meath.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who is doing a wonderful job.  He is in a completely different position from that of previous Ministers because he has to face EEC Minister and hammer out a bargain with them.  Anyone who has been to the EEC headquarters will appreciate that the Minister has a difficult assignment; not alone does he have to spend a considerable amount of time travelling but the negotiations he must carry out call for grit, determination and ability.  I pay a tribute to the Minister; he has all these qualities and the farmers appreciate the work he has done on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to pay tribute to officials of his Department.  These men have spent a lifetime in the service of agriculture and they have the expertise to give the Minister all the information and data he requires.  These officials <Col N="693" /> are second to none in the world. The advisory services have been improved considerably during the years. I remember when County Cork had six or seven agricultural advisers; now they number more than 30 and the numbers are increasing each year. Today the farmer has much information that was not available to him years ago.</P>
    <P>The money the Minister is seeking is the largest amount ever sought for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  That is only right because agriculture is still the most important industry in the country.  I should like to pay a tribute to the farmers for the work they are doing because they do not always get the praise they deserve. They are a hard-working section of the community.  They have no half days free; they do not get weekends off; they have to work seven days each week.  Help is not always available in the country.  We hear a lot about unemployment but it is very difficult to get help.  The farmers are setting an example for the rest of the country.  They were the last section of the community to become unionised. Some years ago when doctors considered forming a union eyebrows were raised but now everybody is in a union; even the journalists have a union.</P>
    <P>The last speaker told us that the number of cattle in the country decreased last year but those of us involved in agriculture realise that the cattle population changes because of various circumstances.  I can recall when the cattle population was half of what it is today.  We must all remember that 1974 was a bad year for the cattle industry.  During that year the price of cattle fell considerably because calves were not sold.  Because of the low prices offered for them a lot of calves were slaughtered.  The position has changed this year and a very good price is being paid for calves.  I do not think it will be long before the cattle population has increased considerably.</P>
    <P>Cattle are the mainspring of agriculture and for this reason I hope that the cattle prices will increase considerably this year.  I welcome the <Col N="694" /> efforts by the Department to bring in new cattle breeds.  Anything that will improve the quality of our stock is worthwhile.  I am aware that the Department spent a lot of money and time in their efforts to improve the quality of our stock.  It is encouraging to know that as a result of their efforts we are now able to export the progeny of the cattle we imported.  It is also pleasing to know that very high prices are paid for those animals.</P>
    <P>In my young days the Shorthorn breed represented about 90 per cent of the cattle population but the predominant breed now is Friesian. Statistics for 1974 show that 52.8 per cent of the inseminations were Friesian while only 3.8 per cent of the inseminations were Shorthorn.  It is encouraging to see that Charolais and other continental breeds are being imported.  I am sure the Department are looking into the effect these breeds are having on the cattle population. I should like to point out that the reason the number of inseminations in 1974 was down considerably on the figures for the previous year was because of the poor price for calves.  I hope that this situation will improve in the coming year because the animals at the insemination centres are the best of their breed.</P>
    <P>Progeny testing is very important also.  Any improvement in the dairy breeds will mean an increase in the milk yield per cow.  I was glad to see that in the creamery in my area last year the average milk yield was 700 gallons per cow, compared with the national average of 500 gallons.  I am sure this figure will be exceeded.</P>
    <P>Animal health is causing great concern to farmers at present.  I would be sorry to see the good relations which obtained down the years between the farming community and the veterinary profession deteriorate in any way.  However, unless something is done in the near future the farmers and their veterinary surgeons will not be as co-operative as they were in the past.  This country seems to produce its full quota of unreasonable people but the time comes when everybody must take stock of their position and compromise.  If the health of our <Col N="695" /> cattle is at risk everybody will suffer. Because the health of our cattle is vitally important I appeal to everybody concerned to be reasonable and to bring an end to this dispute as soon as possible.  It is up to all concerned, particularly the veterinary profession, to be reasonable.  I ask the Minister to do all in his power to bring this dispute to an end.  I am aware that he has done his best so far but the situation is so serious that a special effort must be made now to bring about a settlement.</P>
    <P>Farming is a more difficult business today than it was some years ago.  We have the most modern plants in Europe to cater for our dairy industry and the number of people employed in killing of cattle and pigs is increasing. It is pleasing to note the great improvements that have taken place in relation to the handling of beef and bacon in such factories.  The Minister and his advisers should see if any improvement is necessary in the processing industry.  We are in competition with other dairying countries that probably had these facilities before we did and it is up to us to be able to compete with them in world markets because much of the farming community's money will be gained through these exports.</P>
    <P>Many farmers do not understand EEC directives and when agricultural advisers called to them they were not able to give them proper information with the result that they do not now get grants that would be available if they really understood the position. I understand that changes are being made in this regard and it is about time that something was done, especially in my county, where farms are small and farmers are unable to reach development status and they should be helped to get the money available from these grants.  In west Cork most of the land has been reclaimed in the past ten or 15 years since the land project came into operation.  Much of the reclamation was done on mountainy and bog areas and the land needs attention; otherwise, it will return to its previous condition.  Manure and lime <Col N="696" /> should be made available to help these farmers to maintain in top condition the land they worked so hard to reclaim.  I have seen farms which were able to maintain only three, four or five cows ten years ago supporting now as many as 30 dairy cows, which shows the importance of keeping the land in good condition.  If there is a change, as I hope there will be in the near future, I appeal to the Minister to see that these small farmers who really need money for development will get their share of what is given by the EEC.</P>
    <P>Tillage is very important for Irish farmers.  For many years we were able to supply the barley needed for feeding and malting but last year we imported a large amount of grain.  We should keep our tillage going so as to produce enough grain at home rather than import it at a very high price. Every incentive should be given to tillage and dairy farmers to grow on their own land the food needed for their stock during the winter.  Barley breeds are now so productive that it pays any farmer to grow a certain amount of grain.  This would ensure that the farmers' cattle would be more forward in condition in the winter months.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is doing well this year; prices are good and the demand is there for all types of cattle.  The pig herd has also increased this year and this means increased business for bacon factories and increased exports. But agriculture can change quickly; you may have a good year and two bad years.  That is why farmers are never sure of their income.  For instance, 1974 was not a good year for farmers because small farmers especially lost a good deal of income. This year there is a big improvement which I hope will continue.  This is important for our balance of payments as well as for farmers.  It restores confidence to the farming community and gives them heart to spend more.  That money circulates and everybody benefits when the farmer is well off.  When he has no money everybody feels the pinch.  A farmer making money will improve his herd, his farm buildings and put in new machinery and there <Col N="697" /> is a spin-off benefit for our industry and business so that it is really important that everything possible is done to give the farmer his full share of what is going.</P>
    <P>It was said by a previous speaker that milk production has gone down, but there has been a big increase over last year.  This has shown that we are able to produce more milk even with a smaller herd and that is very important because if we can raise the number of gallons per cow this would have a big influence on the total output of cheese, butter and other dairy products.</P>
    <P>More fertilisers were sold in January this year than in the whole of 1974 which shows that farmers are spending money when they know they will get a return.  That is money well spent; it increases the productivity of our land and increases our herd.  It will help to supply silage and grass for most of the year.  We are possibly the most favoured country in Europe because of our long period of growth and this should be used to the full.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister again and hope that the farmers will have as good a year this year as they had last year.  While we may not be thankful for many things, it is a long time since they had so much sun as they had last year, and while we do not claim credit for it, it must be that the good Lord above looked down on us and gave us that year of sunshine. I hope it will be continued this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Deputy across the way in congratulating the Minister on the job he is doing in Europe.  It is what I would expect of him because I served a few years with him.  I know of the tenacity and vigour that he put into the job he was doing at that time.  I also congratulate the Department on this document which is presented to us.  If I have criticisms, and I will have on some of the figures and the direction that agricultural policy is taking, I am not directly criticising them but hoping to convey the opinions and feelings of the people I represent and the job that we should be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very obvious that we are <Col N="698" /> following a fashion which may be termed &ldquo;the easy £&rdquo; or &ldquo;the easy shilling&rdquo;.  It is a norm of the industrial world and of business people if they have good years to try to hive off a small bit so as to explore possibilities in other directions.  This is not happening with our agricultural energy and effort today.  It is all too easy for us to turn our meat into the present system that obtains when we should be availing of the great product we have and developing markets in Europe for the processed and prepared cuts of meat which would be acceptable there.  If I may use a side-turn, we do not put our sand into tins or canvas.  We do not try to compete with or even enter into the same field as the North American exporters because we have a far better product and we should be doing the same where our meat is concerned.  We should be developing a taste for the very valuable asset we have.  Instead of that, it is all too easy to kill an animal, cut it down through the middle, have two sides of beef, and export it to Europe or wherever we can just to compete with South America and other countries.</P>
    <P>Our eyes should be turned to the possibility of development, and there is plenty of opportunity for development in Europe.  Two or three very large concerns in Europe have contacted me about the possibility of buying anything from 5,000 to 10,000 acres in order to handle our beef here and do this job.  I had to explain to them that there is no hope of them getting this type of land in this country because they are not allowed under our law to purchase such.  I have tried to direct them into considering a co-operative effort of producing cattle around the year that those people could purchase and kill, and that they did not need to fatten those animals themselves.  Those are avenues that can be explored to the benefit of our farmers and people and our general agricultural policy. Cattle are at the highest price that they ever were and looking at the conditions prevailing in the outside world today, we being to wonder how long <Col N="699" /> that situation will obtain.  The fact that the Australians are shooting their animals and that prime beef in the United States, the dearest country in production of anything in the world, is only half the value of our cattle here must indicate that those cattle prices cannot remain.  The Germans and the Europeans will go along with us as long as they are selling their machinery and other products.  The very minute there is a setback they will turn very quickly to the cheaper forms of meat.  That is why I say there must be a gourment market in Europe still where our beef, the finest in the world, can find a market in spite of anything that has happened.  This is what we should be doing while prices are good and while we can hive off some of the profits in this direction.  Our co-operative bodies should be following this up.  This is the type of work that is ideally fitted for their outlook and the job they have to do.</P>
    <P>I know it is very difficult for a Department to steer our people in all directions, but I feel very proud of one fact.  Many years ago I served as chairman of the Kerry Committee of Agriculture for seven consecutive years and I was obsessed with one idea at that time: the more advisers we could get out on the field the better results we could get.  I got extra money on the rates to get those advisers out on the job of work that was to be done and we eventually scored because at some stage the Department saw the advantage of this and started to give the £2 for every £1 we put in.  We reaped a very big input of money which helped us to expand further.  I think that in Kerry today we have a production figure which supersedes anything in this country.</P>
    <P>We are a county of small farmers. Eighty four per cent of our people are under 15 per cent land valuation. We are a working and industrious people, but it is said we have a far road still to travel if we are to trap the energy of those people&mdash;I am speaking of my own county&mdash;into the <Col N="700" /> type of feeding of animals that the British are doing with our animals. This is what we should be doing at home and we should be capable of producing a product here that will sell in any market in the world because very few other countries can attain it.</P>
    <P>We sell too many of our cattle to Britain for sterling.  Britain is selling them into the Common Market afterwards for the hard currency that they need.  We should be availing of this advantage ourselves.  We are not because there are organisations in this country and outside who try to keep our products channelled in the direction that suits them.  The figures before me show that £366.2 million of our total £596.2 million agricultural products sold went to the UK.  This is not in the best interest of our country because when it suits Britain she will again turn to the cheap meat she can get anywhere in this country. This is why we went into the Common Market, to get away from this grip or stranglehold, particularly in our agricultural production.  We are sliding along because it is all too easy to take the good prices that are going and ignore what might hit us in the future. In the words of the old cliché, we should make hay while the sun is shining.  Now is the time for us to explore other markets because this is what industrialists and manufacturers do.  When they have a good product selling they are always directing their energies to producing another that is ready when the first is reaching the end of its road.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to direct his energies in this direction, to ensure that we build for the future.  History has proved that when cattle were on top they always slipped backwards and remained there for quite a while. We are producing too much of the one type.  We are not producing sufficient feeding stuffs.  While we have a considerable reduction in our cattle numbers, we have not offset it by any considerable increase in grain production.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes and approves the efforts of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to ensure that the plant for the production of ammonia and urea being established at Cork will be constructed to the highest standards of safety and efficiency so as to safeguard the State's investment in it, the employment in that plant and in the fertiliser industry in Ireland, and the security of supply of such a vital material for the farming community.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his speech defending the action of NET in allowing this contract to go to Kellog without competitive tender, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that Kellog would not receive any extra profit&mdash;if he was here he might confirm that I am not misquoting him &mdash;for doing this work on a direct labour basis because, to use his words &ldquo;there was a fixed fee for services agreed&rdquo;.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary must realise that the fixed fee agreed was not for the erection of the plant but rather for the consultancy services that went into its <Col N="702" /> design.  Kellog have not decided to undertake this very important and valuable contract by direct labour solely for the good of the Irish nation or because they like the Cork air. They are doing it for profit, because they know that if they do this work in that manner there will be more money for them out of the contract that they have been allowed, one might almost say steal.  They are interested only in how much they can make out of the work they will do.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also answered that the Minister was involved only after the original contract was awarded.  He said&mdash;again I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;that the Minister was asked only to reverse a decision already taken.  There seems to be some confusion about this in that the Minister, in answer to Deputy O'Malley in the House, stated categorically&mdash;and Deputy O'Malley gave the reference&mdash;that he had full responsibility.  The Parliamentary Secretary said also that any Government should not interfere in the day to day running of a semi-State or State-sponsored body.  I and every other Member of this House would agree with that.  Surely the construction of what the Parliamentary Secretary himself described as the second biggest plant of its type in the world could not be said to be an everyday affair of this semi-State body?</P>
      <P>A decision such as this, with its major political implications, should have been a matter for the Minister. If the Minister was not consulted, I feel&mdash;and so must everybody else in the House&mdash;he should have been; he should have had the final say as to who would obtain the contract.  That was a decision not only of vital importance to NET but to the country as a whole and to the advancement of technology here. Positive, definite action will have to be taken to ensure that something like this will never be allowed to happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The very basis of competitive tendering was upset in this <Col N="703" /> case.  Even at this late stage&mdash;I know it is late because I am aware that recruiting has commenced&mdash;the Minister should ask NET to reconsider their decision, that Irish sub-contractors be given a chance to prove that their skills, expertise, workers and standards are as good as any in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision&mdash;and a wonderful one it was&mdash;by the Government to build this nitrogen plant in my part of the world was a very welcome one at the time.  I must compliment the Minister on his wisdom in using practically half of our natural gas resources to date in investment in farming because that is what this project is all about&mdash;investment in farming, when, for the first time in history, we have real control over our inputs. In recent years we have seen what an international situation can do to upset the whole farming industry.  That is why I welcome the decision of the Government to invest so much money and indeed half our natural gas in the creation of a very valuable fertiliser industry.</P>
      <P>This effort by the Opposition is really a vote of no confidence in the board of NET because, like a lot of other State bodies, they have to act in a commercial manner, take commercial decisions and ultimately be responsible.  If we are to succeed we must put our trust in their decisions. They took what I regard as the best commercial decision.  The mechanical construction of the plant is the most important part of the project.  So far in Ireland we have never attempted the construction of any such plant.  It is of gigantic size and complexity, capable of turning out something over 2,000 tons of nitrogenous fertilisers per day.  The view was taken by NET that, while it would be possible for a group of companies here to construct this plant, it would be better if Kellog did the job themselves.  NET believed that in sub-contracting to smaller contractors control would be dissipated and the main contracting control weakened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also to have the job completed on time.  Here I would go <Col N="704" /> along with Deputy O'Malley's point of a penalty clause, if necessary, because time is of the essence&mdash;get the job done quickly, get people employed and have the product available.  We have been assured that the same number of Irish men will be employed and that all available Irish equipment will be used.  Indeed, it was a free decision of NET to utilise the direct hire system.</P>
    <P>This construction is the most important part of the project.  As Kellogs have done this work previously by now they must have perfected their technique.  We all know the first time we do anything, whether it is a farming operation or anything else, we make certain mistakes but by degrees we learn to perfect that job.  I believe Kellogs are now the experts at building this type of plant.  They designed it and they have the advantage of experience and direct supervision.  It is vitally important that such an important project costing so much money be built by the people who designed it.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, there will be 584 Irish workers on this job.  As one who realises the unemployment problems in the area the sooner those people are employed the better.  My advice to the Minister and to NET is that they get on with the job.  From the information given last night by the Parliamentary Secretary I am assured that NET are carrying out this work most efficiently and as economically as possible.  It is vitally important that this plant gets into production.  It is also important that it be built by Irish labour.  The cost factor of sub-contractors is also important leading to a more expensive product for the farmers and NET.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that we will have to compete with foreign fertilisers on the home and export markets.  Due to the magnitude of this project and bearing in mind possible development in compound fertilisers this industry must, of necessity, export.  This is the key to the whole thing.  It has to be built efficiently and as cheaply as possible if we are to compete.  We are in an EEC situation where we will have <Col N="705" /> severe competition from competitors on the European mainland and from practically all over the world so we must have a competitive product.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that NET know what they are doing because they will have to run that factory and will have to make it pay.  We must have confidence in them when we have appointed them to do the job.  I am assured by the Minister that the work so far is on target.  Due to the fact that Kellogs are constructing the plant themselves it will be completed in the minimum time.  This will ensure that we will be in production in the shortest possible time giving jobs in the manufacture of fertilisers, haulage and distribution.</P>
    <P>This is a very exciting project for the nation and also for the harbour area.  We will not only have the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers but I am told that this will develop into compounding of fertilisers and into bulk handling, which is something I have been interested in for a long time.  I believe when the board of NET get going they will set up a project whereby fertilisers will be handled in bulk for distribution around the country and for export as well.  I place full trust in the board, the Government and the Minister because I know that he has handled all his industrial projects with care and efficiency.  I have full confidence that with his close liaison with that board we are on the right road and that we will be employing Irish people.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to get the plant built and get it going because this is where the permanent employment comes into it.  Builders and technical people run around from one job to another.  I would like to see the plant in action with a full complement of Irish people working it and a further expansion and diversification into other aspects of the fertiliser business.  I would like to compliment a great decision of a great Government in devoting half of our natural gas to the fertiliser industry and to the benefit of our farmers.  Fertilisers have been described as the life blood of <Col N="706" /> farming.  Therefore, we are pouring life blood into that industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody on any side of the House who doubts that this industry is necessary and advantageous. We wish it well for the future and compliment all those who had anything to do with setting it up. However, I do not think that is the point we are debating in the motion before us.  I, like other Deputies, have received many representations, both verbal and written, regarding this decision in relation to the disquiet it has caused in certain sections of the community.  As the previous speaker has said, the disquiet is not in all sections of the community but it is certainly in many sections.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate what was said last night.  I do not believe anybody on this side of the House would advocate that people who either priced themselves out of it or were unable to do it should get the contract from the board of NET.  We are talking about a matter of principle where people were ignored and Irish firms were not given the chance to tender. That has caused a good deal of disappointment. There has been resentment in some cases and anger in others.  It is understandable if you take the viewpoint of the person engaged in that type of work.  We all feel in our own spheres that we are able to do the job we are engaged in as good as the next.  Certainly we would not like to be passed over completely in relation to something which should be for open competition, especially when it happens to be the biggest project that ever came to the country and that we were so small and so insignificant that we were not consulted in the matter.  That is the difference between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many excuses made why this did not happen.  There does not seem to be much reason behind these excuses to the men involved in this. It is bad enough to lose a chance of creating employment at a time when we never needed it so badly but I feel something worse is happening. We are eroding the confidence of our young people in the future of the <Col N="707" /> country.  In years gone by the bias was towards academic education because we were a rural population, an agricultural population, and we had not much of a choice.  An academic education was the kind of education which appealed to us most.  At that time we exported our brains as well as our brawn.  Perhaps we had no choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>The advent of industrialisation, the coming of the oil refinery to Whitegate and Gulf Oil to Whiddy Island and various other major industrial projects have certainly changed the attitude and especially the educational bias towards technology.  I know there is tremendous activity in the regional technical colleges and I know in Cork we have a very active Department dealing with these matters. Public representatives, local government officials, lecturers in the college and many industrialists went to foreign countries and learned what they could from what is happening there.  When it comes to our turn in the not too distant future, I hope we will be able to face up to the challenge and learn from what happened in Aberdeen and other places.</P>
    <P>We have to do all in our power to prepare our young people for the developments that will accrue from the coming of our offshore gas and oil.  I am stressing this point because a great injury could be done if it were to appear that we were not able to tackle big jobs as well as small jobs in fields which were unknown to us until recently.  It is not much of an excuse to say &ldquo;You have never done it and therefore you are not able to do it&rdquo;.  If that were so, none of us would get very far in any new walk of life.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult to explain to students of technical colleges and their lecturers why we are not giving them the same opportunities as people living abroad.  Due to long experience the person coming from abroad may be better equipped to do a specific job, but that is not a reason for not inviting a home-based industry to tender.  If home-based industries were invited to tender they would feel they were getting some recognition.  If they <Col N="708" /> did not make the grade the first time, by the time a decision had been made they would have learned something that would equip them for the future.  As I said earlier, we are living in a free-for-all European Community in which our industrialists will be able to compete with confidence to gain contracts from other countries. But to do that they must feel they are worthy of consideration in their own country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the one man who should be fostering and encouraging an interest in technology for the future of the industrial welfare of the country.  In my opinion his attitude to this matter has gone a long way toward undermining the confidence he should be trying to build up.  He made the point that he does not interfere in board decisions.  I accept that&mdash;the Minister is a good man to make his point.  But he should have made it his business to be aware of what was happening. He should have ensured that he was consulted and his opinion taken.  He should have had the welfare of the workers at heart and seen the problems that might interfere with the future development of the education of our young people in this technological age.</P>
    <P>In this case the decision reached can be interpreted by all those engaged in the industry as a vote of no confidence. I can think of nothing more detrimental to the future of the country. I cannot understand why a Minister cannot explain beforehand the reason Irish firms are not asked to tender for a certain job.  How could it be unethical to do such a thing?  There must be some kid-glove method to explain why they were not asked to tender for the work.  An explanation given later does not have the same effect.  It is a matter of public relations. If you have to have public relations between employer and employee, you should also have the closest harmonious relationships between Departments, Ministers and the industry.  If we had had that relationship, we would not have had the resentment and frustration which occurred much too often recently.</P>
    <P>Last night we listened to the Parliamentary <Col N="709" /> Secretary, who appeared to be very gratified that Irishmen would be employed in the direct labour operations conducted by Messrs. Kellog.  That is a wrong premise because the slant is that the Irish workers are good enough as hewers of wood and drawers of water, but when it comes to a skilled job they have to look somewhere else.  We should all try to get away from that kind of interpretation. The day is long past when the unskilled, semi-educated Irishman had to go abroad to take his chance with the lowest paid workers of the world.</P>
    <P>In this new era we should ensure that, if an Irishman is properly equipped, he can take his place with the best workers of any nation.  There should be some way of fitting him for such positions at home.  I can imagine no better citation for a firm in Ireland than to say they were in some way associated with the building of this large enterprise.  That is if they were capable of doing it.  I always qualify that because I am not asking that anything should be given to a person or a firm who is unable to do it.  If a person is able to do it, it should be a tremendous boost not alone to him but it will be an example to the whole country as to what can happen if a person is enterprising enough and has enough initiative to go out and learn how to do things as they should be done.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to explain not only why no Irish firms were asked to tender but why they were kept in ignorance of that fact until such time as the decision had been made.  We are living in very uncertain times at present.  Everybody knows that there is a great sense of insecurity.  No one is sure of his job as he could have been years ago.  No young person is sure of what his future holds.  There is an air of uneasiness and therefore opportunities like this, which would mean a great deal of employment and the spending of a great deal of public money, require kid-glove handling.  Public relations must be of a priority where you are concerned that there should not be misunderstanding and that injury should <Col N="710" /> not be done where it is not wanted to be done.  The Minister, the board of NET and everyone involved, should take the people into their confidence and explain why it is felt that certain decisions must be made, especially when these decisions might mean the creation of employment for several hundred people.</P>
    <P>A few years ago we were told that we would have open Government.  In my opinion that means that the Minister would consult with his Department or with the semi-State board and with the employers and workers representatives and maintain perfect liaison at all times.  It seems that the very opposite is the case.  Not only are decisions arrived at without consultation but people are being made to feel that they have no right to protest and no entitlement to an explanation.  The Minister was unwise in making a public statement that Irish firms were capable of building houses but not of constructing complex plant.  That statement is another outstanding example of how this affair was handled.  It has caused considerable irritation among workers that such a statement should be made especially, as was stated last night, as several major projects have been successfully handled in this country and abroad by Irish firms.  Taking it all in all, the atmosphere that we now find building up about decisions of this nature indicates a very bad public relations job.  If the decision was necessary it should have been explained beforehand. The Minister's attitude since then has not helped.  It is very necessary at present to do everything possible to create employment.  It is up to the Minister to use whatever pressure possible to ensure that whoever gets contracts or work, employs as many Irish people as possible and that every job that can be done by an Irishman is so done.</P>
    <P>I received a petition from Cork some months ago because some oil riggers, or some people of that kind, were worried because they were being moved out by the new people coming in.  There was great uneasiness and concern about it.  They took certain strong action and the matter seems to be resolved now.  But that was a <Col N="711" /> very minor thing compared to this huge complex and what it entails.  If things were stated by the Minister, and there was no one in Ireland in his opinion with enough experience to do the job properly I feel they might still have been invited to quote.  When people are recognised as being involved in a certain industry they should be invited to quote, even if the Minister knows or the board who asks them realises that they will probably be beaten by a more reputable and experienced firm.  This is quite understandable.  But it is the fact that they are in their own country and that a board set up with millions of pounds of the people's money should not consider them and let them see that they are considered is wrong.</P>
    <P>The amendment put down by the Minister is another indication of no confidence.  It is badly worded.  If the Minister wants to oppose this motion it could have been done without wording the amendment as it is.  It is worded to seem that the highest standards of safety and efficiency would not be safeguarded by the State if the work had been given to an Irish firm.  I am not saying that was what was meant.  I am saying that is the way it can be read.  This decision, following the decision about the building of ships and the making of furniture abroad, has caused, and is causing grave concern throughout the country. For that if for no other reason I feel that every Minister and every Deputy could support the motion without any reflection on anybody.  The motion only indicates that all Deputies regard the decision with deep concern.  It is an appeal to see that what has happened will not happen again and that at least the Minister, if not directly responsible, will ensure that he will be consulted and that the Minister will do all he can to see that Irish firms are aware of the position they hold and is aware, if they are not tendering, why they are not tendering and in that way avoid confusion.  I appeal to Deputies on all sides to support the motion.  I think it would do nothing but good and the Minister <Col N="712" /> would come out of it stronger eventually if he adopted that course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Healy, if he does not stay to hear everything I say, will at least read the whole of my speech afterwards.  I found him in my years in the Dáil someone who is always concerned with the decencies of public life, with accuracy and with fairness, and I believe that the answers I have to give will convince anyone who is fair that the accusations made against me and also, much more importantly, against NET, are unfair and are, in fact, pandering to chauvinist instincts, which are easy to arouse but which are also harmful to arouse.  I do not for a moment try to pass away responsibility for this decision, not because I am involved continuously in the decisions of the semi-State companies responsible to me&mdash;of course I am not; of course they must have freedom to get on from day-to-day with decisions big and small&mdash;but in the sense that if they make a mistake, I have the power to call them in; of course, if the worst comes to the worst, I have the power to dismiss a board and to reverse a decision.</P>
      <P>This is something that arose not in the first week of May.  This controversy has been going on now for more than a year; it is not new and I am very familiar with it.  In that sense the Minister responsible for any State company working to him, in the end, carries responsibility for those decisions, even if he was not consulted beforehand and even if it is not desirable in the normal day-to-day functioning that he should be, because obviously you cannot have every decision going over a Minister's desk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that the action of NET is costing unemployment, is costing jobs in Ireland, that it is eroding confidence in Ireland and in the terms of Deputy O'Malley's motion he said his way would benefit the Irish economy and so the inference is that this way is damaging the Irish economy.  I must rebut all of those charges and, I hope, when <Col N="713" /> people have heard me finish, that those who are fair-minded will believe convincingly.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with an area of demarcation, because at the two poles there can be no disagreement.  Everyone agrees, I take it, that as much as possible of any construction task or of any other task should be done in Ireland. Then we get into the area of definition: how do you define &ldquo;as much as possible&rdquo;, and I will come to that.  Everyone who lives a practical life from day-to-day in Ireland knows that there are areas at the other end of the spectrum where you cannot have everything Irish, and nobody&mdash;Government, Opposition, man in the street&mdash;claims for a moment that you can.</P>
    <P>We do not insist that Departments of State have what I might call Irish motorcars; there are some assembled in Ireland, some not, but there are no motorcar companies owned in Ireland, only motorcars owned by American firms, British firms, Italian firms, German firms and so on.  Nobody claims that Aer Lingus should fly Irish-made aircraft because there are none.  We are very proud of Aer Lingus, but we are realistic enough not to make that claim.  Nobody claims that RTE which, I take it, again many of us are proud of, should use Irish equipment on the floors of studios, because we recognise it does not exist.  There are many areas where the claim is never raised because it is known to be unreal.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where you get into a grey section of decision, where decisions are not easy.  I do not claim, for example, to know all the reasons and I do not, therefore, offer judgement on the action I am about to mention, but I would give it as an example of a grey area, not judging it but mentioning it just to show that sometimes decisions may be difficult.  I understand that all of the colour work of <i>The Irish Press</i> group of companies is done in England.  There may be very good reasons for that, and I am not offering a value judgement on it.  I am saying that there is a company, associated very intimately both in its foundation and in its present management <Col N="714" /> with the Opposition, where this happens.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there can be decisions of all kinds, and we have the two poles. What we have to do is to try to define accurately where the balance of benefit to Ireland as a whole lies.  If that can be defined, then it is not just something that politicans and Ministers may do, but something they must do, to take a decision that may be unpopular with a section of the people, as this one is, as I am perfectly well aware, for what I am satisfied is the greater good, much the greater good, as I hope I can indicate. As I say, we are in this area of demarcation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy says there is a shortage of information.  I gave what I thought was a lengthy, helpful and non-contentious parliamentary answer to this recently, but it has not stopped the misunderstanding and so I want to put some facts on the record first, and some arguments after that.</P>
    <P>First, on the matter of the scale, the cost of the project to NET in Cork is £74 million.  That to me seems to be an immense affirmation of confidence in Irish industry, in Irish skills and jobs, and in investment in Ireland, and something that I am proud to have driven along with all the strength and all the wheeling-dealing capacity I had to get positive decisions.  I think that is an affirmation of confidence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I said this is one of the biggest single ammonia urea plants in the world.  It is also a case that we are racing against time.  We know the time the gas will be coming ashore and we know the rate of plant construction. You cannot quantify it exactly, but to give people even an approximate figure, every month lost will cost the State, both through NET and in other ways, £1,500,000.  If you look at that £1,500,000 in terms of industrial grants, jobs created and so on, you will see what that can mean to our economy.  It is not a year lost, but a month lost.  That is the order of magnitude.</P>
    <P>Anything going wrong with this in regard to time of completion&mdash;I have quantified that very roughly&mdash;in regard to reliability of the work, in regard to <Col N="715" /> the total cost, which means the efficiency of production, has a bearing on the jobs of the people at Marino Point in Cork; it has a bearing on the people in Arklow, because they will take ammonia from the Cork plant; it has a bearing on the viability of the whole project in conditions of free trade, and people who know a little about the fertiliser market will know what fertiliser free trade can be like.  Therefore you have to guarantee the company the absolute maximum of efficiency and competitiveness, and the best way to build up the confidence which Deputy Healy talks about of Irish industrial enterprise&mdash;and what can be more Irish than NET&mdash;is to let them have success in profits and exports, to let them grow and have no failure, no difficulty and to achieve this huge contract under NET management as quickly as possible.  That is the best thing for confidence.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested over and over again by Deputies&mdash;and I beg them not to move on misbeliefs without investigating the facts&mdash;that no contracts were given to Irish firms.  I must assure the House that that is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Healy asked why Irish firms did not get a chance to tender.  I am putting it on the record that for certain parts of this whole construction such as a jetty which is a fairly large individual construction or such as the site preparation, there was direct contracting by Irish firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside those parts of the total construction which obviously are suitable for Irish firms, we come to the question of the major process plant, much the biggest part.  In that case one must affirm that in respect of the manufacturing of that process plant there is no firm in Ireland that have ever done anything like that, that are fit to do it or would claim that they would manufacture such a plant.  When NET investigated the situation, they found that there were only eight firms in the world considered suitable for the job but this figure was scaled down to three and <Col N="716" /> from those three NET invited tenders.  The NET team decided that by far the most efficient way of approaching the matter was to give to one of those firms the responsibility from beginning to end for design, engineering, procurement, construction and commission of the process plant, having first set aside the other parts for Irish tender.  That was their technical judgment and the CIF did not claim at any stage that any of their members could do other than assemble the plant when it came on to site and participate in the commissioning of it.  There was never any separate £10 million tender that was not offered.  There was a total tender to Kellog for the whole effort because, for what seemed to me very good reasons, that was reckoned to be the most efficient way of getting the job done.</P>
    <P>The good reasons relate not simply to cost but to the date of commissioning, reliability of commissioning, the tying down of the main contractor, so that they could not wriggle out in any way, and the certainty that they would have to complete their contract. Let us look at the possible management structure.  There would have to be NET staff there anyway and a very expert and highly qualified Irish team they are.  There must be the people from Kellog who are building the plant from equipment obtained from suppliers as far away as Japan.  There must be Irish workers and these are not only labourers. They are people who are being given a whole series of very valuable skills which they will use in Ireland in further construction.  If I have time, I shall itemise the skills of those workers, of whom there are about 600 involved.  Therefore, with NET for the parent company, Kellog as the manufacturers and the direct employment of Irish workers there was a simple structure whereby targets could be met but what we are being asked to do is to introduce another layer into the management.  We know that we must have the original manufacturer, that we must have NET and that we must have the Irish workers but we are being asked to introduce a number of other Irish firms as a <Col N="717" /> layer between the workers and NET/ Kellog.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about what are the options in terms of cost since it is suggested that we are damaging the economy.  I am suggesting that the NET way is better for the economy and in this regard there are some figures I wish to put before the House. For the £10 million part in respect of which it is argued that an Irish firm might have been involved, the Kellog fixed fee would be the same anyway as would the hourly-paid labour which is totally Irish.  The same applies to the NET staff salaries, a staff that is totally Irish.  Kellog staff would be comprised of twice as many Irish as British so if I am generous and say that you reduce the British part of that to half what it is, there is a reduction from 4.2 per cent to 2.1 per cent of the total charge.  In other words, if you sub-contract the British part and cut it in half there is a saving of 2.1 per cent of the whole cost.  Temporary buildings, workshops, office furniture&mdash;totally Irish&mdash;amount to 17 per cent while the hire and purchase of cranes, specialised welding, pipe bending, lifting and other equipment represents 12 per cent Irish and 4 per cent British.  There are items here which are referred to as gin poles.  I have no idea what they are but it says they have a 600-ton lifting capacity and since they are not available in Ireland they must be hired in Britain.  A lot of all this shows that 90 per cent of the job is Irish and 10 per cent British and if by sub-contracting there is a saving on the British side of 2 per cent we must ask what we add to this.  Irish contractors charge 15 per cent and if the face value of the contract is £10 million, this 15 per cent would involve another £1,500,000.  Also, Irish contractors would constitute another layer as there would be four or five of them on the site.  They might complete the work as fast as it would be completed with a simple management structure but for every month that might be lost the cost would be approximately £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>Such a structure might not have any troubles along the way in regard <Col N="718" /> to an impeccable totally correct commission but should they have any trouble, other delays would follow.  If the work were to be in the hands of a sub-contractor, the main contractor could raise arguments about date of finishing and about quality finishing. If we were to make the job more complex in these ways, we would be adding to the cost and this added cost would be passed to the Irish taxpayer, to the Irish farmer and on to the future profits of NET, a wholly Irish company.  Regarding the extra number of Irish people that would be employed in such a set up, these would represent only a handful of the senior management of some Irish contracting firms.  There would not be any more Irish workers on the ground.  The number in this respect is 584.  For Deputy Healy's information I shall give a breakdown of this figure.  They comprise 95 welders, 225 fitters, seven carpenters, 75 riggers, 31 equipment operators, 16 transport drivers and 135 labourers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, of these 584 personnel, 135 are unskilled.  In fact, a training school has already been set up for these people and they will be released to the construction industry with the valuable skills learned on this job under the supervision of Kellog and NET.  It is not a choice between more or less employment because the difference would be a handful of Irish engineers and managers. NET will employ a staff of 30 exclusively on this project, nearly all of them engineers. You are saying that, for the sake of a handful of management and supervisory staff in Irish contracting firms, you are going to put an Irish State company in a disadvantageous position which may threaten its profits and cost our farmers and the State large amounts of money.  As I have said, we would not reduce the Kellog staff, we would not increase the number of Irish workers, but we would increase the total cost and run severe risks.  Any increase in the total cost must fall on the people who pay&mdash; the taxpayers, NET profits and farmers buying fertilisers.</P>
    <P>I want to put it in terms of a <Col N="719" /> balance sheet, but before doing that, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I want to make an apology and this is the most formal place in which I can do it.  I reacted in Cork to a document from the Construction Industry Federation. I had read it but I did not have it in front of me at the time.  It refers to the &ldquo;major mechanical contract&rdquo;, that is the phrase used in the second line of this statement of 5th May.  I did not know of a separate contract for £10 million because there never was such a contract, but I did know of the major mechanical contract that went to Kellog.  I believed that that reference by the Construction Industry Federation was to the total contract, including the manufacture of process plant, and I reacted to that with irritation, unfairly and unjustly. There is no firm in or out of the Construction Industry Federation that manufacturers process plant.  I did utter a sneer, not at the capacities of the Construction Industry Federation, but counterposing it, when I said they were good at building houses, to their complete inability to produce process plant, which they would affirm.  Many countries bigger than this one do not produce process plant.  Nevertheless, I expressed myself unjustly and with irritation towards both the Construction Industry Federation and one individual in it.  That sort of irritation is always a bad counsellor.  I do not weaken the basic argument I am making in the least, but one of the newspapers pointed out, correctly, that I had confused the issue by my outburst.  I think they were right.  I very much regret it and apologise.</P>
    <P>What I have said does not alter the basic argument.  I have altered the terms of the technical assistance scheme because under the previous Government it was not possible for technical assistance moneys to be given to the construction industry for the bringing together of groups for greater planning efficiency and the taking on of larger jobs.  They all know from, for example, my travels abroad and my talks with them that I am aware of and admire their capability and am happy to see it extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  That does not alter the basic argument.  The basic argument is as follows: that in the interests of the workers, because the jobs will be for Irish workers anyway but some of the owners and managers in those CIF firms are trying for perfectly clear reasons of their own personal advantage to insinuate themselves as another layer of management in the process plant section of the NET site in Cork.  The decision of the NET board was not to allow them to do that but to give supervision in a direct recruiting mechanism in conjunction with NET to Kellog.  Doing it the NET way is worse for the owners and managers of these firms.  But all decisions are about making balance sheets. I am satisfied that the NET way of doing it is right in terms of total cost to the State, efficiency of completion, and the efficient tying down of NET on their contract so that they cannot plead any other reasons.  I am satisfied from the point of view of NET, which is a State company, the jobs at Marino and Arklow, and the farmers and taxpayers. In that scale path you have to put taxpayers, farmers and Irish industry.  In the other scale path against them you have to put a handful of the owners and managers of a few Irish construction firms.  That handful would benefit at the expense of the sections of the community that I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I have to take a wider view and to uphold the general interests of taxpayers, farmers and State companies, I have no doubt that the balance of correctness lies in upholding the decision of the NET board to which I was not a party at the time, about which I became aware afterwards and for which I accept complete responsibility. There is, of course, that balance sheet.  When you look at it this way you can only believe that in the interests of an efficient industry, and what is better for national confidence than an efficient industry completed on time, that in the interests of employment, and what is better for employment than secure industry <Col N="721" /> making profits, that in the interests of Irish industrial expertise, and what is better for expertise than an Irish firm as a magnificent success using half our natural gas to make fertiliser for us, the interests of the wider section are in conflict with the interests of the ownership and top management of a small number of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>There is that conflict, but when I am faced with that conflict, when I am faced with choice, I have to choose the wider interests&mdash;I have to choose Irish jobs, Irish efficiency, the well being of an Irish State company, not for now but down the decades.  I have to choose that as against the sectional interests of a very small number of people. Those who try to distort this into lack of confidence in Ireland are playing on chauvinist passions which are neither good for the future of Irish industry nor for sanity and calmness in Irish public life, or for the best decisions in Irish public life.  I beg them earnestly, the ones who are open to conviction, on rational grounds to consider what I have said and not to make this, for party political purposes, into a sort of issue where there are no winners and where everybody belabours everybody else, and the atmosphere of calm and reason and best decisions gets blown away in a welter of what I have called chauvinist passions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed listening to the statements of the Minister and his reasons for granting this contract. I was particularly startled to hear him say there are only eight firms in the world capable of doing this job and that three of them are on this side of the world.  I assume those three are on the Western side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well-established practice in an industry of this kind that such firms farm the jobs around among each other&mdash;they take the jobs in turn, they quote against each other.  This decision does not redound to the credit of our own people.  If we had given the job here, the fact that we keep every pound at home begets more and more pounds. This is done by every country in the world.  We had experience several <Col N="722" /> years ago when our exports of Donegal tweed were hitting at somebody else's industry, despite the fact that the price of our produce was much lower than theirs, they kept it out.  The French have done the same to our sheep.  Every country does this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>To stand up here and make the case that because it was cheaper this contract was given to a foreign firm does not redound to the credit of the Minister who made it.  We know that any Irish firm tendering for any job, particularly one involving imported steel, will have to quote much higher prices because any Irish firm that wants to buy British steel today will have to pay a far higher price than a British firm.  It is obligatory on us to keep any work of this kind at home, even if the cost is much higher.  We have expertise which is known throughout the world, and if we do not back up our own people we are denigrating their productive efforts and in effect we are asking them to go out into foreign fields to try to get jobs.  If we do not give them jobs at home how are they to be given the confidence to go out and say in other countries: &ldquo;We got this type of job in our own country against all others from outside&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>That is why I regard this policy as being all wrong, of a Government here handing a job to a foreign firm just because it will cost a few pence less.  I do not care if it costs a few million pounds less, we have an obligation to back our own techniques and our own labour.  It is extraordinary to listen to a Minister tied to Labour making these startling statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an interesting debate on this topic, not the least interesting aspect of which was the speech of the Minister which was in marked contrast in tone and <Col N="723" /> temperament to certain of his earlier contributions on this point.  He was gracious enough to apologise in a fulsome way to the wide spectrum of people whom he gratuitously insulted in Cork on 10th May last.  For that reason I do not want to labour that aspect of the matter, which to my mind was one of the most serious and objectionable of the various serious and objectionable aspects of this whole affair.  Now that he has, after an interval of nearly four weeks, apologised, it is best to leave that side of it alone.  I will just say that it is a pity it needed this motion to provoke his apology, that such a long period was allowed to elapse between the making of those unfortunate intemperate remarks and the equally fulsome apology for them which we have had tonight.  If the motion achieves nothing else, at least it has achieved that.  That in itself is something worth achieving.</P>
      <P>Apart from his apology to the people whom he insulted in Cork, the Minister went to great pains to try to calm the matter and to play it all down, to try to give the appearance that there was a lot of fuss being made about something that was less important than the amount of talk about it would seem to indicate, that there was a very reasonable explanation for everything.  We have had a number of explanations for certain of the things that were done or were not done.  By virtue of the very short time available to me to reply to them, I will have to summarise much of what the Minister said.  If I summarise them unfairly or inaccurately, I am sure he will correct me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help that. One of the main points he made and which ran right through his speech was that it was more complex and more costly to have subcontractors involved in this matter, and he endeavoured to prove, apparently to his own satisfaction but not to mine or anybody else's, that it was cheaper not to put the mechanical end of this whole contract out to tender for sub-contract as was done, as far as I know, <Col N="724" /> in all the other specialised sub-contracts that have arisen in the construction business up to now.  If what the Minister says now in relation to the mechanical subcontract is right, surely it is right equally in relation to all the others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly the same situation arises in relation to Asahi in Mayo and Merck, Sharp and Dohme in County Tipperary, but the huge&mdash;I will not say major&mdash;mechanical contracts in these two very complex firms were both put in by an eminent Irish firm, H. A. O'Neill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there was no problem whatever created.  We had a long argument here before about the structural steel contract which was not awarded to the lowest tender, which happened to be that of an Irish firm, but was awarded to an English firm, although that was not the lowest tender, on the grounds that the English firm were likely to be more competent because they had more experience. Now we have the same argument here all over again and it <Col N="725" /> is really a bit much to have all this constant denigration of Irish ability and Irish enterprise time after time from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has at least by his apology tonight in relation to what he said in Cork partially cleared the air but I would regard his apology at best as a partial apology only when, almost in the same breath, he said it would be much more satisfactory to have Kellogs doing it because they would be more reliable and they are more likely to be on time and more likely to do it properly.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us Kellogs were now beginning to recruit staff.  They are&mdash;from all these other Irish firms which built up trained staff in the hope and expectation of jobs such as this and arising out of jobs like the long list I gave last night of tremendous complexity which they successfully carried out for public and private firms over the past couple of years.  The Minister told us Kellogs were now setting up a training school at Marino Point to train operatives. Who will pay for this?  The Irish taxpayer in the long run will pay for it. If one of the major Irish firms which have successfully carried out work of approximately equal complexity, if one of those, such as the one I mentioned, or even one of several others, were allowed to tender for this and were successful, there would be no need whatever to set up a training school because their work force are already trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out last night one of the disadvantages of a two-day debate like this is that the Minister, who only comes in on the second day, does not take any account at all of what was said on the first day.  One of the advantages that I pointed out of putting this out to tender and, hopefully, an Irish contractor getting it, is that these Irish firms have continuously been training apprentices in technology of this kind and they would be in a position to train more apprentices in this very important technology to the benefit of this country.  Kellogs are not going to train Irish apprentices.  They are not interested in them.  All these Irish firms, like O'Neills and all the <Col N="726" /> rest of them, have been paying annual levies to AnCO.  They have been carrying out the training of apprentices and skilled operatives on a continuous basis.  All the incalculable value that could be got from an existing Irish firm with a trained work force, with its own apprentices which it is prepared to continue to train, is being thrown away because Kellogs are allowed to come in here, without any tender whatever, on a once-off job and carry on as they like without any obligations in regard to the future training of anybody other than those they need for this particular job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would stop interrupting me we might be able to make some progress.  We have the situation that we are talking about a complex contract about which the Minister tonight and the Parliamentary Secretary last night kept making assertions.  The managing director of NET in a letter he wrote to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24th May said, with regard to the issue, that it is necessary to understand the nature of NET's contract with Kellog and then he goes on, as the Minister did tonight and the Parliamentary Secretary last night, to make certain assertions.  I asked NET for a copy of the contract and they refused to give it to me.  There is nobody apparently outside of the Department of Industry and Commerce and NET who knows what is in the contract.  We know nothing about the penalty clause.  We know nothing about the completion date.  We were not told anything about these things and it was <Col N="727" /> suggested by the Minister tonight that, if this sub-contract were put out to tender and some firm other than Kellogs got it, Kellogs would no longer have control over the situation and NET could not enforce the completion date.  No matter how many sub-contracts there are, and there are already a large number in relation to this project awarded to Irish and other firms, the main contractor, who in this case is Kellogs, retains its overall responsibility for the completion date being arrived at and it is the main contractor's duty to ensure that every one of the sub-contractors fulfils his sub-contract to enable the main contractor, in turn, to fulfil his contract.  The Minister's argument in this respect is quite an erroneous one and simply does not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very valuable contribution to this debate last night from someone who knows what he is talking about.  I refer to Deputy Calleary, a qualified engineer with many years contracting experience and practice behind him.  He made it perfectly clear that the most useful thing from the point of view of a client who wants to get a job such as this done quickly, and we would all like to have it done as quickly as possible so that we will be ready when the gas is in, is to ensure the sub-contracts are given to competent firms which already have a trained staff and which do not have to go around, as Kellogs are now doing in Cork and other parts of the country, trying to recruit a man here, a man there and a man <Col N="728" /> somewhere else and bring them together and put them into a training school, as the Minister told us tonight. Deputy Calleary told us last night, and I accept what he said absolutely, that it will take months to recruit staff and months to train the staff when recruited.</P>
    <P>Where then is the Minister's argument in the face of that when an Irish firm, or indeed, a foreign firm, if this were put out to contract could start virtually immediately?  If I had time to deal with all the Minister's arguments I think they could all equally be demolished as those particular arguments by him have been demolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not demolish them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major contract. It is not just an ordinary commercial contract.  I have been endeavouring in the public interest to get a copy of the contract and I think I am entitled to see a copy of the contract. I am refused it.  Apparently other people were refused it too although it is a contract of major importance.  If NET have so little to hide why are they hiding this?  Why not let us see the contract?  Finally, I want to point out that the Minister makes the argument that a number of firms are peeved because they did not get this.  It is no harm to mention that the unions concerned issued a joint statement with the firms concerned saying they felt equally strongly about it.</P>
