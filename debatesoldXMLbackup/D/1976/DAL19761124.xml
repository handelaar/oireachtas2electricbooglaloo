      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking on this motion on the previous occasion I was attempting to summarise some points in relation to this House and its association with semi-State companies or statutory corporations. On the inauguration of a committee such as that now proposed it is not easy to summarise what might be its relationship in regard to the scope and extent of the powers of some of the semi-State companies.</P>
      <P>This is the century of monopolies. We know of the situation in America where early in the century American business was faced with the question of private enterprise.  In private enterprise the tendency is always towards a monopoly of power and wealth and to this extent the American economy then found itself up against what I might call a trade barrier, an <i>élite</i> at the top exploiting the consumer at the bottom.</P>
      <P>Fifty years ago some of our semi-State companies were set up.  For this House it was then a question of whether it would agree to vote money to extend private enterprise or whether it was going to vote money to set up semi-State companies and, at the same time, to put them under the control of civil servants.  It was quite correctly argued that if the State tried to extend and to foster private enterprise inevitably we would have a monopoly and possibly a restriction in trade which could ultimately lead to the exploitation of the consumer.</P>
      <P>The other argument was that if the semi-statutory corporations were placed under the control of civil servants there would be all the attendant red tape, accompanied by trade restrictions in the sense of the strict discipline that would be enforced by the civil servants.  At that time it was said it would conflict with the principles of good trade operations and relations. Those of us who knew something about these arguments had an idea of what was behind them.  One impression was that if the semi-State companies were handed over completely to civil servants they would be run as departments of State with all the inevitable restrictions.  It was not realised that they would be a little more detached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> The other argument was that if we tried to extend private enterprise we would have all the monopolistic tendencies and ailments that went with that kind of trading.  It was fortunate that at that time a combination of methods was used.  In a sense the methods were rather novel because the State was young and one must look with a certain amount of admiration at the work the companies have accomplished during the years.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I confined my remarks to a few of the companies and I took them as examples and perhaps it would be as well if I continued in that way.  Many arguments could be put forward both for and against the extension of the concept of the semi-statutory corporation and I merely wish to pose the questions that should be put by a Member of the Oireachtas. It is essential that we have a rational approach to the matter while keeping in mind the way the semi-staturory corporations did their work in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister who is sponsoring this motion has the advantage of belonging to a younger generation who have seen the workings of those companies.  To that extent he and his advisers have acquired knowledge regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the companies.  He has also the added advantage that he has heard arguments for and against the extension of the companies.  On balance the arguments in favour are much greater than the arguments against semi-statutory corporations. Irrespective of how the arguments are framed or whether the person putting them forward is totally in favour of private enterprise, I think the question would fall in favour of semi-statutory corporations in our circumstances. In earlier days we had not the money or experience to float large companies.  Private enterprise had not the werewithal to do it and it fell to the Oireachtas to generate not merely the ideas but the money, which was the greatest barrier at that time.  It was then left to the leaders of those companies to recruit their respective staff.  The Local Appointments Commission was used and it may be said that most of those companies got the best material possible.  It would be <Col N="571" /> wrong for Members of the Oireachtas not to record appreciation of the work of the personnel of those semi-statutory corporations over the years.</P>
    <P>We could easily be led into thinking that a committee like this could be a committee of management.  I do not believe this is the idea of the House in regard to this matter.  Those semi-statutory corporations are well managed already.  They present annual reports and they have recourse to advice they did not have in the early days.  They can recruit consultants at various times who have dealt with matters like this not merely here but abroad.  There is no shortage of technology available to those companies and neither is there a shortage of advice on administration and management available to them.</P>
    <P>What should be the functions of the committee?  A certain amount of caution must be used in regard to the setting up of such a committee.  If the House is to be of real help and provide a certain amount of leadership in this regard it must be seen as having a sort of partnership with those companies, that is having a benign attitude but at the same time seeing that strict accountancy methods are used.  There need be no conflict between the House and those companies.  As far as I am aware there never was any great argument in the past between the House and those companies.  There was often argument in the House, when it came to voting money, that there was not enough control and that the Members of the Oireachtas did not know about the working of those companies. Some arguments were used in praise of those companies and some against them but there was no great conflict on the principles underlying the general work which those companies were engaged in.</P>
    <P>I said earlier on I intended referring to two companies in particular.  We depend on the ESB for a great deal of our power and energy.  This company employs a large number of people so we are dealing with a company of very great importance to our economy. I believe Bord na Móna are equally important.  We could do great service <Col N="572" /> to everybody by dwelling a little while on the ramifications of Bord na Móna and the ESB.  It was thought to be a joke by some people if one spoke about going back to the bogs.  I am very glad that there were people who had the idea that we could get energy out of the bogs and that they were not enormous sponges in the midlands for holding water.  We must be very grateful that there were people who insisted on the development of the bogs as a source of energy.</P>
    <P>Many people believe that by the end of the century the ESB will have extended considerably and will have gone into nuclear power so that we will have entered another age.  If that happens we hope the House will still be able to provide the money and provide every help to the ESB and also to Bord na Móna.  It is very important to have a combination of politicians and those companies.  We have never been too afraid of exploitation by semi-statutory bodies because we knew there was some control, even though it might be remote, and that public spirit underlay the working of those companies.  We were able to appreciate that there was not the same desire to exploit the consumer by those companies as there would be in the case of private enterprise.  I am not condemning private enterprise but unrestricted private enterprise in monopolies can be very dangerous. This has happened in many countries and could also be dangerous here. Our concept of semi-statutory bodies saved us a good deal of anxiety during the war years and subsequently, I believe this has improved the image of semi-statutory corporations.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of the Council of Europe, before we went into Europe, I remember discussing the matter with some Germans and members of the Swedish delegation.  I recall saying in regard to socialism, that while we had not the name of being outright socialists we had more socialist principles at work here than in any country in Europe at that time. When the Minister mentioned that these State companies employ 57,000 or 58,000 and have a turnover of £500 million I realised that this is an enormous <Col N="573" /> business and it would pay us as politicians in this House to try to frame the best possible legislation in dealing with these companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he proposes asking the House to consider for this committee seven Members of the Dáil and four Members of the Seanad. If one wants an effective committee this would possibly be the correct number. Sometimes a committee of good personnel will give better results than a large committee which could be engaged in useless debate on occasions. A forward-looking committee balanced as between Dáil and Seanad is a fair proposition and in my limited way I fully support that.</P>
    <P>I also tried to deal briefly with the fact that procedure in the House was inclined to be slow because we had too many subjects in the pipeline.  One could say that matters appertaining to public administration and economic matters were coming into conflict in the House to the extent that one was vying with the other for priority of debate.  We would avoid this if we could free the House to deal here with public Departments, with debates on Estimates and Bills and so on and in that way regularise our business here and arrange it in a better way.  Those who have been here for some time know that the volume of business coming to the House is enormous and we know there is a limited time for debate in any week.  Our aim then should be so to arrange our order of priority that we will have time to debate briefly the Estimates of the various Departments leaving time afterwards to deal with Bills and other matters.  I think it is very sensible to try to shift matters from the floor of the House which should not properly be there and which should properly be moved to committee.</P>
    <P>The argument always was that we have a small House.  That is so and when one takes out of it Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries and now Members of the European Parliament, one is left with a rather small number of personnel.  The time of that personnel is important and should be used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>I believe that I also made some <Col N="574" /> point in relation to the large spending Departments.  In the last few years the agenda was so crowded that we did not have time to discuss fully the various Votes.  We should have a way of dealing with this matter.  By consent between Government and Opposition or otherwise we should have some system whereby we could select at a certain stage the Estimates we would like to debate and bring them to the House. This would ensure that in any year no large Estimate would go undebated provided Members wanted to debate it and that they would get some time to make some points in regard to it.  I mention that because I think that what is visualised by the Minister here could help to take some of the business off the floor of the House.  I am not saying that the House was very much taken up with semi-State bodies or their ramifications but it was very disedifying at various times in the past to find questions directed to various Ministers being met with the standard reply: &ldquo;I have no responsibility for the running of semi-State bodies.&rdquo;  Of course that was correct but the questioner was inclined to dispute that and there was an argument across the House as to whether the Minister should have power or not.  Going in the direction now proposed will, I think, indicate how this matter stands in general in relation to the House and at the same time will clear the minds of Members regarding the work of semi-State corporations. It should lead to a more appropriate way of dealing with those companies.</P>
    <P>I have some other notes on matters which I intended to stress in regard to semi-State bodies.  I have aired sufficiently the point in relation to what other countries tried to do with regard to private enterprise.  In other countries they had great trouble early on in dealing with private enterprise and they suffered great privation as a result of the unprincipled approach to trade and commerce which some merchant princes had in the past, even some people manufacturing goods. Because we had the services of a statutory corporation available to us, we escaped a good deal of heart-burning and travail.  We used our time <Col N="575" /> wisely.  In setting up those companies the House had a social aim as well as an economic aim and made social and economic progress at the same time. It is not easy to combine those two principles.</P>
    <P>In the first part of this century the big argument was on the question of social and economic principles. Revolutions were fought on that basis. When one lives with something one does not always notice it.  One comes to accept living with a lake, or a lovely river, or a mountain.  If one is working and earning one's living one does not have time to stand back and discover what were the ideals of the initiators of such movements.  Let us be thankful that, by having the services of the companies I have described, we escaped a good deal of the heart-burning and argument that went on about the exploitation of the consumer.  We are all consumers.</P>
    <P>If we thought there was some transgression of the principles of trading, whether or not a Minister had responsibility for the company, we could always raise it in the House, as it was raised in the past.  Thankfully there were not many occasions on which it was necessary to raise those matters.  This method was always available and at hand.  Public opinion was another element.  All those elements helped to make for smoother relations between the semi-statutory companies and this House.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was considering setting up this committee the question arose as to the type of company which would be included.  We have some large spending semi-statutory corporations. Some of them handle millions of pounds.  Others are more or less administrative.  The question had to be considered as to how many companies should be named in the Schedule and how many of them would subscribe to the view that they came within the scope of the working of this committee.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the history of the semi-statutory corporations and the way they were set up, this is the best method of bringing into existence a committee which may be deemed to be capable of dealing with those semi-statutory <Col N="576" /> corporations and living with them.  That is what the House wants. That is what is in the Minister's mind. Unless we can set up a committee of this sort, neither the committee, the House nor the semi-statutory companies will be satisfied in the long run. The history of some of the semi-State corporations would lead one to say truth is stranger than fiction.  One could tell a story which would vie with a fairy story or a nursery yarn as to the start of the companies and their subsequent working.  Some of them came into existence because we had not got wealthy people who could readily invest money in large-scale long-term enterprises.  We were credit worthy but it was not considered wise to go outside the country and borrow on a large scale to set up companies which would be concerned with the essentials of life, power, energy, and so on.</P>
    <P>The best way to deal with those companies is to take them in easy stages, to include a limited number of them, mainly large spending semi-statutory companies, to select them and see how the committee will work with them and, if necessary, to extend the system later.  The country and the House will be satisfied with a committee of the dimensions at which we are trying to aim.  Aer Lingus started by easy stages, in fact, with one plane. Irish Shipping started in a similar way.  Bord na Móna started from very small beginnings and extended their activities outwards.  The ESB started in a similar way.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider the beginning of Irish Shipping.  During the war we depended on England for our ration of tea and although the British promised us a reasonable supply of tea, they later went back on their word.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce said if possible he would buy the next tramp steamer coming up the Liffey.  Irish Shipping started in those circumstances and have extended their activities on a worldwide basis.</P>
    <P>Therefore when we are dealing with matters of this kind we must have regard to what has been achieved, to the store of knowledge which has <Col N="577" /> been built up, to the technology and the guiding principles which are there already, and the managers who are there already.  If we can appreciate such factors it will be of great benefit in the working of the committee envisaged here.  The basics are there and all that is needed is the general knowledge of the subject one is dealing with to appreciate all the elements involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to cover about 25 semi-State corporations here, but there are a great number of other companies dealing with essential matters in which one could be very interested, although they are not spending the volume of money which is mentioned, nor are they engaged in huge schemes like the generation of power and so on.  However, by virtue of our target these companies could not be brought in here.  I think it is better to have a small number, the proportion involved here, roughly one-fourth, and see how, with the passage of time, these three elements, the House, the committee and the companies involved will work together.  If necessary, the scope of the committee's activities could be extended to a larger range of companies.</P>
    <P>As I said, I agree with the aim of this motion.  It will eliminate confusion on the floor of this House, with a Minister having to say that he has no responsibility for the working of some semi-State corporation which might be within the ambit of his Department.  It will take away that embarrassment from the Minister and also from the members of the Opposition who would be the querists.  We all acknowledge the enormous amount of work in which these semi-State corporations are involved and its usefulness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that this committee be set up to study the operation of semi-State bodies.  There is a large number of bodies included here but I cannot see why Gaeltarra Éireann should not also be included. While private enterprise is of great value I believe that if we are to solve the unemployment problem the State will have to play a bigger role in setting up State companies.  However, the <Col N="578" /> Government must ensure that these State companies are run efficiently. Therefore whatever committee is set up to investigate them must have a back-up service.  Some members of this committee might be authorities on one or other of the companies mentioned here but they might not have the vaguest idea of the operations of the vast majority of them.  Unless there is available a back-up service which will tell the members of the committee where these companies are going wrong and how they can be corrected, such a committee, however busy the members may be receiving reports and just glossing over everything, it is not enough.</P>
      <P>This committee must be in a position to examine the affairs of a company and be satisfied that such a company is not over-spending the nation's money.  There are many State companies which we just could not afford to let flop.  We must support them financially and, therefore, they may not be as careful about how they run their business as a private individual would be.  Nevertheless we will never solve the unemployed problem merely by the expansion of private enterprise and we must see that whatever additional State companies are set up are run efficiently.</P>
      <P>One thing I note about State companies is that when they get into trouble and start losing money, they embark on redundancy, but they always start at the bottom, although many of them are top heavy with officials.  CIE started making people redundant.  It was always the man at the bottom who was made redundant. A lot of State companies are top heavy.  This committee should ensure that the money voted by this House is spent in the best interests of the State and of the company concerned.  We have reason to be proud of some of our State companies.  The ESB, the Sugar Company and Aer Lingus were established when I was a boy.  When the late Seán Lemass established Aer Lingus everybody said that he was too ambitious.  Now we have an airline that is respected all over the world. These companies were established by men with vision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> A seven-member committee will not be able to look after all the companies listed in the Bill.  A smaller committee with specialist knowledge of two or three companies would be more suitable. There is a limit to what a person can do.  I have been on co-operative committees but I found I could not do my business as a Deputy and look after the committees at the same time. The Minister will burden the committee by giving them too many companies to deal with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter mentioned that not enough time was given in this House to debating Estimates and companies and I believe he is right.  We have to listen to long-winded repetition day in and day out.  If you want to make a contribution you have to sit here listening to the same argument being repeated again and again.  When the Chair changes, the same argument is repeated over and over again.  I do not intend any disrespect to the Chair because he does not know what happens when he leaves the House.  The business of this House should be arranged to give time for items of importance to be debated reasonably with short to-the-point speeches.  I shall be four years in this House next March. During this time the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries has been debated only once, but we have spent hours debating less important Estimates.  It would be in the best interest of the public if there was co-operation between Opposition and Government in relation to important matters.</P>
    <P>This Bill relates to companies and the creation of employment.  More State companies should be established to deal with the unemployment situation. It has been said that the private sector could, if they had more confidence, create 10,000 new jobs.  The creation of 10,000 new jobs would not go too far towards helping the present situation.  Therefore the State must be involved in order to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it would have been impossible to forecast Bord na Móna's achievements.  I have been closely associated with the Sugar Company and know they have done an excellent <Col N="580" /> job.  The ESB have also done a good job and I understand that they are planning further development.  We are all worried about CIE but we must admit that there is a social side to that company.  CIE must continue in business, even though it is not run efficiently and is top heavy.  I want this new committee to have a social sense as well as common sense.  The committee should also have a back-up service to advise them on each company. I cannot understand why Gaeltarra Éireann has not been included. There is great respect for Gaeltarra Éireann in the west.  All State companies should be run efficiently and I believe that worker participation will help in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the suggestion that it might be better to have a smaller committee dealing with a few companies than to have a seven-member committee dealing with all the companies listed in the Bill.  It is difficult for any Minister to convince his Department that his views are correct.  When a Minister attends a meeting he is accompanied by a back-up group with specialist knowledge.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it is an important one.  Irish Shipping Limited are another company who have been excluded.  Irish Shipping are a reality now.  Very few Irish companies were started with State backing.  They are giving a good service and great employment. We must ensure that more State companies operate efficiently when this committee is set up.  Even if the committee cannot cope with all companies the fact that the committee exist will make them more careful.  I cannot understand why Gaeltarra Éireann are not included as one of the companies.  I will not hold the House up any longer because everything I want to say has already been said but I will ask the Government and the Opposition to come together and ensure that the things that are of real importance and which would create employment are debated here and that too much time is not taken up in discussing trivial things.  If this committee helps to do that I can assure the House of my full support for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention if it has not already been done to the amendment in his name and to part of the amendment in Deputy Colley's name which refers to Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta.  This was not the intention of Deputy Colley.  When assisting Deputy Colley in drafting his amendment I described it as an Bord Gáis but then recalled that although that was the literal translation, the name in Irish is Bord Gáis Éireann.  The Act which was passed here earlier this year refers to Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta as a limited company which was formed a year or two ago as a transitional company pending the establishment of the permanent board by statute.  On the establishment day of the Act, Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta stand dissolved, therefore these two amendments are defective and should be corrected, because they are referring to a company which no longer exists and which was a private limited company and not a semi-State body established by this House.  The body which was established by this House is Bord Gáis Éireann.  I presume the necessary amendments can be made to the amendments by agreement of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in this debate one can only speak once and cannot have a Committee Stage debate.  For that reason one is in some difficulty about going through all these amendments again.  For all I know the Minister may be accepting all or some of them and it may not be necessary to press them all.  The fifth amendment in Deputy Colley's name proposes the addition of four bodies, Bord na gCon, Gaeltarra Éireann, Bord na gCapall and Bord Gáis Éireann.  I regard this of importance because there are two at least of these four trading semi-State bodies which it is absolutely vital should be included in the list that will come under the scrutiny of this committee. Bord Gáis Éireann are now trading in the Irish natural resource of natural gas.  They are purchasing it from Marathon who discovered it and it is selling it to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, to the ESB and to the Cork Gas Company. I was unable to discover the terms under which they are trading. <Col N="582" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce on the NET Bill and in a number of debates relating to NET refused to disclose these figures and the managing director of NET to whom I wrote in relation to other matters also refused to disclose the figures at which they were purchasing the gas.  The price of gas in Britain when it is being bought and sold by a similar board is disclosed and I fail to see why it should not be disclosed in this country. It is of considerable importance when one is trying to think out the long-term implications of an energy policy that we should know what the cost of gas to the board is and at what it is being resold to Nítrigin Éireann and to the ESB.  One of the effects of this arrangement which has been made by Bord Gáis Éireann to sell gas to the ESB is to lose two-thirds of the calorific value of that gas.  The fact that Bord Gáis Éireann are doing that is a matter which properly should come under the close scrutiny of this proposed committee and therefore that body should be added.</P>
    <P>One hopes that Bord Gáis Éireann, who currently are dealing with only one comparatively small gas find off Kinsale, will in time be dealing with much more substantial finds off the south coast or the west coast if it is possible to land gas from the apparently hydro-carbon bearing areas under the sea bed off Galway's coast.</P>
    <P>An equally strong if not a stronger case can be made in relation to Gaeltarra Éireann.  Gaeltarra Éireann are a trading company who have factories all over the west; not alone that but they are engaged in many joint ventures with private companies.  Their relationship with the Department of the Gaeltacht and with the Minister for the Gaeltacht gives a great many people a lot of concern.  I will confine myself to one aspect of which I have personal knowledge in relation to the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann in conjunction with the Minister for the Gaeltacht and that is in relation to a factory on Achill Island which was a joint venture between Gaeltarra Éireann and a private group.  A factory was opened in a village on Achill Island called Dooega.  The name of <Col N="583" /> the company running it, in which Gaeltarra Éireann had a 50 per cent or slightly greater interest, was Achill Quartz Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The company got into very serious production and financial difficulties within a very short time of opening and in order to cut their losses Gaeltarra Éireann decided to close down the factory.  This was within a matter of a few months of opening.  Instructions were given to the management that, notwithstanding Gaeltarra Éireann's views, it was the wish of the Minister for the Gaeltacht that the factory be kept open.  It was pointed out by Gaeltarra Éireann that it was impossible to keep the factory in production, that some of the key operatives and other key people had left and that there was no money available, thereby making it impossible for the plant to remain in production.  Despite this Gaeltarra Éireann were instructed that the workers were to be paid their wages each week.  That continued to be the position for a period approaching 12 months.  The workers in the factory at that stage numbered 17 or 18.  It was not their fault that they were doing nothing but they continued to go to the factory each morning and to go home in the evening in order to give the impression that these jobs had been provided in this company, that the factory was a viable and on-going industry.</P>
    <P>However, within a week or two of the by-election in West Mayo, that factory closed officially in the sense that the workers were told not to report any longer each day.  Some of the machinery from the plant was moved to an empty factory building a couple of miles away in another village.  This building had been there for some time.  Allegedly another firm had set up there and, allegedly again, the workers from the closed plant would be given some form of alternative employment at this other place. Gaeltarra Éireann are not to blame for that situation.  They had wanted to do what any prudent trading company would do in the same circumstances but they were not allowed do as they wished.  This is a matter which, <Col N="584" /> for example, should be subject to scrutiny by the committee we are talking of here.  A full explanation should be obtained as to why Gaeltarra Éireann were not allowed to act prudently in this case.</P>
    <P>As I understand Standing Orders, if one were to table a question in relation to that factory either to the Minister for the Gaeltacht, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or to any other member of the Government, one would be told that it was a matter for which the Minister concerned had no responsibility to this House.  However, it is a matter in respect of which there must be public accountability.  Assuming that it is not the intention to change Standing Orders so as to allow for public accountability here, I foresee this committee as the only forum for this purpose.  The committee will be representative both of this and of the other House and will be the appropriate mechanism for inquiring into the sort of activity I am talking of.</P>
    <P>I might add in relation to that precise company that at the time the workers were being paid merely for attending in the mornings and leaving in the evenings, a number of local creditors who had supplied goods and services on the establishment of the factory had not been paid although money was being poured down the drain in a totally useless fashion in an effort to maintain the appearance of the factory being in production.  I do not know whether those creditors have been paid since.  One would hope that they would have been paid when Gaeltarra Éireann succeeded finally in closing the factory.  Basically Gaeltarra Éireann's capital and finances are moneys that have been voted by this House.  Therefore we are talking of taxpayers' money and, consequently, no such company should be forced&mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;forced&rdquo;&mdash;by a Minister or by a Department to spend the money against their will and against their better judgment.  Above all others, Gaeltarra Éireann should be included in the Schedule to this motion.  I could visualise a great deal of the time of this committee being devoted <Col N="585" /> to an investigation of that body's activities during the past three years.  I have referred only to one specific case of which I have personal knowledge but I understand there are others which give cause for concern in the context of the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann and that body's relationship with and subservience to the present Minister.  I do not propose to say any more about it but Deputy Tunney who is more familiar with the subject on a broader scale will refer to some other instances and will argue equally to show the vital necessity for the inclusion of this semi-State body in the Schedule to the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's amendment mentions two other semi-State bodies that are engaged in trading on a fairly substantial scale.  These are Bord na gCon and Bord na gCapall both of which are successful semi-State enterprises which have achieved a great deal for the respective industries with which they deal.  I do not think there is any special need for scrutiny in regard to them but because they are engaged in trade to a considerable extent&mdash;this applies particularly to Bord na gCon&mdash;they should be listed.  At least they should be here rather than the National Stud which is listed but which is existing basically on a grant-in-aid each year from this House and which is not really trying to operate as a commercial entity.  It is providing a service to breeders at subsidised rates which would not be economic for any private stud that might want to operate in the same way.  In other words, the National Stud is not really a trading company whereas the position in regard to Bord na gCon is that they own seven or eight of the largest greyhound tracks in the country. Two of these are in Dublin, one each in Cork, Limerick, Tralee, Clonmel, Waterford and, possibly, Galway. These are the largest tracks in the country.  So far as I know the only large track they do not own is Dundalk. They are engaged in trade in a substantial way.  They hold greyhound sales and they buy dogs and export them on a very wide scale.  It would be only logical to include them here. <Col N="586" /> Bord na gCapall who are engaged in the purchase and sale of horses are equally a trading company.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Colley has not included Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the list, an argument might be made for their inclusion since they are engaged in a fairly widespread way in the construction and sale of fishing trawlers in various parts of the country.  They are by far the biggest boat builders we have in the context of trawler fishing boats.  They are selling these vessels, not giving them away.  Of course, they are financing themselves to a large extent.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say regarding the addition of trading bodies to the Schedule to this motion but I wish to say a few words about the problem that is created by the fairly arbitrary distinction between semi-State bodies which are trading and those which are classified as non-trading bodies.  The distinction is a very narrow one at times and there is a considerable overlap in many cases.  We shall have an unusual situation in that if we set up &mdash;as presumably will be done&mdash;this committee and it carries out investigations of this kind, monitors the affairs, activities and policies of trading semi-State bodies, there will be no control by the Oireachtas over the non-trading companies.  This is rather an anomaly since the non-trading companies in many cases are at least as important and in some cases perhaps a great deal more important.</P>
    <P>The fact that the committee can call in and talk to the chief executive of the ESB but cannot talk to the chief executive of the IDA does not seem to make sense.  The importance of a policy which a committee of the House might wish to discuss with the chief executive of the IDA is certainly no less from the national point of view than discussions with the ESB or with rather obscure companies such as Min Fhéir (1959) Teoranta.  I do not know exactly what they do; I think they grow grass in Mayo but they are not of great significance to the national economic wellbeing.</P>
    <P>The IDA are the most fundamental body of all from the point of view of <Col N="587" /> our future as a nation outside the Government itself.  We shall have an anomalous situation if some parallel arrangement or some change in the existing arrangements is not made to allow for some meaningful dialogue with the policy-makers of these very important non-trading semi-State corporations. I should like to hear if the Minister has views in relation to that when he replies.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister, and other Ministers in other statements in recent months, sought to give the impression that non-trading companies of the IDA type and other types that I shall mention later, are gradually being subsumed under the umbrella of their relevant Departments and being identified with their Departments to a far greater extent than was the practice in the past.  The Minister for Finance gave some indication, not in very specific terms, that the question of the relationship between the Departments and semi-State non-trading companies would have to be thought out and that a closer relationship would have to be established.  I ask the Minister to think again before he commits himself or the Government to establishing what he calls a closer relationship because the net effect of that will be to interfere with the independence of semi-State bodies.  I do not think their independence has ever been abused. Some of their senior executives found it necessary in recent times to make remarks that were critical of the Government's economic policy.  They should be respected for that and their right to do that when they feel it necessary&mdash;and they did feel it necessary in the past 12 months&mdash;should be protected and strengthened.  I suspect that the closer relationship which the Minister spoke about at the beginning of this debate means a relationship that will become so close that the exercise of any independent judgment or the expression of independent opinion might well be stifled.</P>
    <P>I do not think the problem is confined to the Minister for Finance personally because we had the situation in the past year or so where the chairmanship <Col N="588" /> of the IDA fell vacant and it was filled by a civil servant from the Department of Industry and Commerce on the nomination of the Minister. The chairmanship of the IDA is a vital position.  It was always occupied, to the best of my recollection, by successful, independent businessmen who in no sense were associated with the Department or the Minister of the day and who guided the activities of the IDA in so far as the chairman can do so, in the way each of them thought appropriate in the national interest.  One thought, perhaps, that was just an instance that was not likely to be repeated and that it was not the beginning of a pattern but the chairmanship of Córas Tráchtála subsequently fell vacant and that has been filled on the nomination of the Government&mdash;presumably on the proposal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;by a senior civil servant of that Department&mdash;an assistant secretary or deputy secretary.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the two men concerned; I believe both to be completely competent men but there is a principle involved here, that the independence of those two vital semi-State bodies, the IDA and CTT, cannot but be impaired by the fact that an officer of the Minister&mdash;or in one case a very recently retired officer&mdash;is chairman of the board concerned.  We had another example within the past few weeks involving a different Minister. When the annual general meeting of An Foras Forbartha was held it was addressed by the Minister for Local Government who informed that body that he envisaged in the future a much closer relationship between An Foras Forbartha and his Department than had obtained previously. One can only conclude from these efforts to strengthen the ties, as it were, and the interdependence of the semi-State bodies and the various Departments that there is at present a conscious effort on the part of the Government to subsume under the influence of various Departments these non-trading semi-State bodies. That is why I mention them as being liable to cause an anomaly, perhaps quite a serious one if we cover all or most of the trading companies here <Col N="589" /> and make no provision for consideration of the very important, non-trading semi-State corporations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through each of the other amendments.  I hope the Minister is going to accept them.  I presume he is going to agree to five of the 11 members of this committee, including the chairman, being nominated by the Opposition.  This committee is analogous and similar in many ways to the Committee of Public Accounts where the division in terms of numbers is equal.  We are asking for less than half and it is not unreasonable to suggest that the chairman should, as is the practice invariably in the Committee of Public Accounts, be a member of the Opposition.  It is only appropriate that he should be and it would be much more satisfactory from the public point of view that he should be.</P>
    <P>I trust also that the Minister is going to agree to the insertion of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; before &ldquo;report and accounts&rdquo;, because if the policy in fairly general terms of these bodies cannot be examined this committee is of little value.  They would simply be a committee to talk to chief executives about the results achieved in financial terms, because their function would be confined to examining reports and accounts and the overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies.  A financial journalist in the newspapers could perform that function perfectly adequately without ever interviewing or cross-examining the executives of these companies.  If this committee were to be confined simply to that function they would not perform any worth-while function at all. They would have to be able to query policy from various points of view.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that the sort of policy pursued by semi-State trading corporations such as Aer Lingus has an enormous bearing on the national economic level here.  If Aer Lingus&mdash; and I use this purely as an example&mdash; were to take the view that their brief was to achieve at all costs the best possible operational results in financial terms at the end of each year, that <Col N="590" /> would be a policy that many people in the country in the national interest would disagree with.  There are many people, not least among An Bord Fáilte, who take the view that that is not and should not be the function of Aer Lingus, and that efforts at all costs to achieve good financial results should not be the policy of a national airline.  Rather the policy of a national airline should be to maximise the number of tourists brought in here each year, even if this may not be as profitable as certain other operations which would cut down on the number of tourists.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that it would be unreal if, for example, major policy considerations such as that could not be discussed with the board and chief executives of Aer Lingus by this committee.  If this word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; does not go in he could say, &ldquo;That is a policy matter, it is not a matter I need go into on this committee and I do not propose to answer any questions in relation to it&rdquo;.  What is the value of the committee then?  If it is simply to look at public accounts, any accountant can do that.  It is done regularly and frequently by the financial correspondents in our daily newspapers, who perform this function as adequately as anyone can without the opportunity of cross-examining in detail the executives who have produced those results.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister can delete bodies is potentially dangerous.  We propose to delete the power to delete bodies from this list.  It would have to be clear that they were no longer engaged in trade or commercial activities. I have given instances of quite a number of semi-State bodies clearly engaged in commercial activities who are not on this list.  If the Minister considers that these are not engaged in commerce he might well consider in some time to come that some of those on the list are not engaged in it either and take them off.  This would be very undesirable.  If any company is taken off the list it should be taken off by the agreement of this House. The list is established by resolution of this House and should be amended only by resolution of this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> Our next amendment relates to the question of whether the committee should refrain from publishing confidential information regarding a body's business activities and plans if so requested by a trading or commercial State-sponsored body.  I agree that the committee should not in any way jeopardise a State-sponsored trading company <i>vis-à-vis</i> that company's competitors, but it is a matter that the committee should adjudicate on.  The committee should not be hidebound by the provision here that, if the request is made by the company, that is the end of it and nothing can be done.  The committee might unanimously consider that it was in the national and public interest to publish certain information, but by virtue of the drafting of clause (3) of this motion they would not be able to do it if the chief executive said that he did not want any of it published.  It should not be in that form.  It should be in the more open form which appears in our amendment, namely that the request can be made to the committee and the committee make the decision.  I have no doubt that the 11 people who will comprise the committee, whoever they may be, will be perfectly reasonable people who are not going to jeopardise any companies and will give the fullest consideration to any request in regard to non-publication and who, I imagine, would almost invariably not publish if the request was made.  But the final decision should be that of the committee and not of the body concerned.</P>
    <P>That deals with all the amendments we have here.  Subject to those, we are all very happy to see this motion passed.  The only other matter I want to mention briefly before I conclude is that this is yet another committee in this House.  I was chairman of a committee that reported here in 1972 which recommended the greater use of the committee system in the House.  I am fully in support of efforts in that direction, but while that committee was meeting I recall warning the members of it that this is a very small House in terms of numbers and that we would be foolish to think that we <Col N="592" /> could run a committee system akin to that which is run, for example, in Westminster where there are 630 members of the House of Commons and something in the region of 2,000 members of the House of Lords from which to draw.  Here one finds a comparatively small number of the Members of this House doing the great bulk of the work of the House.  We have had, for example, in the past six months or so, more than one of these special committees on Bills sitting simultaneously.  An almost chaotic situation arises where some people have to serve on two committees and cannot possibly do it.</P>
    <P>The committee system as it has operated over the past six or nine months has not been satisfactory.  On the Wildlife Bill Committee alone, the Government were defeated on either three or four occasions in the course of the Committee Stage because the Members had no interest in the committee at all.  It was totally boring and it was going on in a room somewhere around the House in total privacy. There was nothing in it to induce them to be there.  They did not take part in the debate and they did not for the most part even attend the proceedings. As a result the Government were defeated four times on that Committee Stage.  A very lengthy Report Stage has been put in by the Minister for Lands in order to rectify what was done in that committee by the nonattendance of his own Deputies.  The Deputy on it who missed the greatest number of those divisions in which the Government were defeated is a paragon of total perfection in this House who frequently lectures all of us on our blatant imperfections, Deputy Barry Desmond.  He in particular was very keen on these committees but when it came to the crunch, like a lot of other people who talk very loudly in public about how much more perfect they are than lesser mortals, he failed to do the work himself.</P>
    <P>I served to the best of my ability, unfortunately in a limited way, on the Special Committee on the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  I simply did not have the time to do it.  I attended only four, <Col N="593" /> five or even six meetings.  That was a more useful committee and one or two members on the Government side actually contributed to the debates. There were many worth-while amendments made on the Committee Stage. A great deal of work was done by Deputy Haughey who was there meeting after meeting.  I am happy to say that the attitude of the Minister for Health was very helpful and that is why that Bill was improved very considerably.</P>
    <P>The Special Committee on the Wildlife Bill was a joke, totally useless and treated as such by Government Deputies who not alone sent in substitutes but sent in substitutes for the substitutes, and then got their own chairman to rule that the substitutes for the substitutes could vote for the original people who were being substituted for two or three rungs up the ladder.  Notwithstanding that, they were beaten four times.  The whole thing was a farce and was treated as such by the Government.  That is an indication of the dangers and difficulties that arise in relation to a proliferation of committees in this House.  We are not big enough.  There are 144 members and 25 of them are not in a position to serve on these committees.  There are some members who are less interested than others and some who are less able than others to serve on these committees. Therefore, we fall back on a fairly small group who have to do the bulk of the servicing of these committees and that is not easily done. The fact that too many committees are going on simultaneously may mean that none of them will work satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>No matter how competent the individual Members from this and the other House may be to deal with the chief executives of some of our semi-State trading corporations, they will need the fullest advice from people with experience and competence in accountancy and business practice. with the greatest respect to the very helpful officials who service less technical committees here, I do not think it is appropriate that this committee should be serviced by officials of this House, competent as they are and as <Col N="594" /> splendidly as they service various other committees.  They do not have the experience and knowledge necessary to get to the bottom of the financial and policy position of major semi-State companies.  I would like the Minister to enter into a commitment that one or two full-time experienced chartered accountants will be made available to this committee because without them I am afraid the committee's effectiveness will be considerably blunted.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind that what this committee are being asked to do now is not unlike what Congressional committees in the United States frequently do.  One has probably seen accounts of how those committees operate.  The members may sit only for a few hours a week or even once a month, but they have a vast staff working five days a week from morning to night preparing for that hearing.  Each of the six, seven or eight members of that Congressional committee are briefed to the last.  They have at their fingertips, the entire background of the matter they are investigating.  They have the benefit of as competent advice as can be obtained in the United States.  The result is that those committees are very important.  Anybody who has been in the United States may have seen them televised live on the national networks.  I am not talking about the more spectacular investigations like Watergate, but topics of national, domestic and economic importance. They get tremendous coverage because of the importance of their work.</P>
    <P>This committee could do equally important work for this country as those Congressional committees do for America, but they will do it only if they have in some small way the same kind of back-up service facilities available to them that the United States Congressional committees have available to them.  I am not suggesting that we should or could possibly have the same battery of experts that they can afford to pay because we cannot.  But to ask for two full-time chartered accountants is a modest request and the Minister should meet <Col N="595" /> it, particularly in order not to blunt the effectiveness of this committee.</P>
    <P>One could go away after the passage of this motion and say that Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann have done their bit to look after these trading semi-State companies.  They have set up a committee which can investigate and ask questions of the chief executives.  We would be codding ourselves into thinking that we had done our bit by setting up this committee if we did not give the committee not just the legal powers to find out what they need to know but the actual physical means of carrying out the investigation through people of skill, knowledge and experience which could not be expected of individual Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Motion which is long overdue.  There has always been a general air of suspicion and anxiety <i>vis-à-vis</i> semi-State bodies and this House.  If one put down a parliamentary question it was always ruled out of order.  The public were aware of this and that is why they tended to be a little suspicious of these bodies which seemed to be a no-man's land.  Strictly speaking they were neither State nor private companies.</P>
      <P>This committee will open up a whole new area of discussion.  An examination of these bodies is not intended as a witch-hunt or a reflection on the executives that they are not doing their job.  Deputies are concerned that companies which are voted money through this House should be accountable to this House. Semi-State bodies have played a major role in this State.  They are large employers and in the main give an excellent service to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company with which I was involved for a number of years, the ESB, have served the nation very well. When we were emerging as an industrial nation there was never any shortage of power.  They always gave a first-class service.  A great job has been done on rural electrification.  The same can be said about our first-class international airline who have done <Col N="596" /> such an excellent job from the point of view of our balance of payments in attracting tourists.  Bord na Móna are a first-class energetic company who are all the time looking for markets for their products.  On the other hand, CIE present a national problem because of the colossal annual subsidy being paid.</P>
    <P>From that point of view alone, a committee of this kind will do tremendous work if they can do something to cut losses.  Our problem is that at the moment it is difficult to see whether a State body make a profit or a loss.  They should not be apologetic about making profits because it is in that way that their activities can be expanded and that future development will be ensured.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that there will not be ambiguity in regard to State companies' trading operations <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector.  They should not be given grants that competitors in the private sector are not getting.  Of course at the moment there are numerous incentives for private companies, but it would be wrong if State companies, operating in the same fields, were given an unfair advantage over their private competitors.  We must ensure that there will be no discrimination.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must ensure there will not be restrictions on State bodies and that they will not be forever leaning on the Exchequer.  I have no doubt these bodies will welcome this type of investigation or cross-check. I would hope that when the reports of the committee come before the Oireachtas they will be put into operation, that this will not be a nice fancy type of report with general recommendations which will be put on some shelf to gather dust.  I have no doubt that the joint committee to be set up will work on the assumption that their reports will be followed up and implemented.  Otherwise this will be just another meaningless piece of window dressing.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the number of companies to be examined one cannot help thinking about the heavy load that will rest on the committee's shoulders.  It will be a small committee <Col N="597" /> and like Deputy O'Malley, I would be looking for a lot of outside help from businesses.  This would give a fresh look because to rely altogether on opinions within the public service would not be very effective, because such people would be thinking along the same lines as the semi-State bodies.  We must get a different approach and if we do the reports of the committee will be more meaningful when presented to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would also look for a good back-up service for such a small committee which will have such severe pressure on them.  Deputy O'Malley was critical of a number of the committees we have had working.  I do not agree, from experience of the Misuse of Drugs Bill Committee and the Family Law Bill Committee.  Both were well attended, there was harmony among the members, there was no petty politics in them.  I would not in any way be critical of the committee system.  It helps to expedite the work of the Oireachtas.  At the moment we have a committee examining the possible establishment of an ombudsman and the work they have been doing argues well for the establishment of a committee of the type proposed here.</P>
    <P>However, I repeat that too much work must not be thrown on Members, that there must be a good back-up service.  This will improve the quality of the committee's work.  It must be remembered this will be a full-time committee&mdash;it will take years, literally, to examine all the operations of the bodies concerned.  It will also be necessary to ensure that when the committee sit they will not be examining just top management people. Every aspect of the State bodies' activities, from top to bottom, will have to be examined: all their problems will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that no damper will be put on the committee, and conversely we must see that the activities of our State bodies will not be hampered by any breach of confidentiality. This is very important because State bodies who are competing in <Col N="598" /> the field of trade should not be put at a disadvantage from the point of view of the competitors.  That would be wrong but the particular company would, of course, have to give very good reasons to the committee why they wanted to withhold certain information. Very high-level negotiations might be going on and it would be imperative to ensure that nothing was leaked which might jeopardise those negotiations.  None of us would want that and we would want to be prudent in our attitude.  Basically the prime function would be to try to help to improve the operations of these companies to make them more viable rather than merely investigating. There would be a specific role to play in helping these companies to operate as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>We live in a high-wage economy and there must be maximum production in return for that high wage. That is an area that could be looked at to ensure the public are getting good value for money.  We are here to serve the public and it should be the task of this committee to look after the interests of the public.  As I said, earlier, the public are a little suspicious of semi-State companies and this committee could help to allay suspicion.  The reports on these bodies under scrutiny or investigation could be valuable in that regard and that could be a bonus.  The whole thing could be a very worth-while exercise and one the public would welcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to expertise, I should like to see businessmen as well as accountants helping the committee. We need the vigour of businessmen who know how to, as it were, make a shilling.  They could generate new ideas.  Again, is there interaction between various semi-State bodies?  I know there is between Bord na Móna and the ESB but are there other areas in which there could be more interaction?  There will be a seminar shortly on district heating.  This is a new area.  Bord na Móna could go into the glasshouse business.  The ESB have an abundance of hot water which is wasted.  That could be used in a glasshouse industry.  Bord na Móna have the space and the necessary resources <Col N="599" /> to undertake this type of activity.  We want maximum employment and this is an area in which employment could be generated.  Are CIE progressive enough?  Have they diversified enough?  I do not think they have.  Someone suggested they could go into office development and other activities designed to inject new capital into their organisation.</P>
    <P>These semi-State companies should be forced into other activities.  If the Acts under which they operate are not wide enough, then these should be amended and brought into line with modern thinking.  I am not too worried where employment comes from or who is in competition with whom so long as there is employment, productivity and more wealth accruing to the nation.  If semi-State companies have the resources they should be forced into activities which will generate more employment and more wealth.  The reports should cover aspects like this.  Too many reports in the past have been left to gather dust.  If we are serious about this then we should be equally serious in implementing, recommendations and following the reports out to the bitter end.</P>
    <P>The quorum will be four.  I should like it to be higher than that.  I believe it should be at least six.  I presume the committee will have access to all the relevant documents.  These would help the committee to arrive at more comprehensive conclusions.  The list of companies is rather formidable. Deputy O'Malley wanted some more included but the present list will take a considerable time to investigate. There are four major companies involved: Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, CIE and the ESB.  Investigating those alone will be a mammoth task.  It is important that we should have people to examine the reports.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone could object to the committee, certainly not the semi-State bodies.  I was speaking to a senior executive of one of the companies and he said he welcomed the committee which would bring the working of the companies out into the open rather than have the cloister type of situation in which they <Col N="600" /> exist at present.  I accept that it is human not to like being questioned or being made accountable but this measure now before the House will ensure that companies are made accountable.  In my view they will tend to exercise greater prudence and try to encourage development within the companies.  It will put them on their toes and that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure.  I have been advocating it since I came into this House three years ago and I am glad I had an opportunity of speaking in the debate.  I hope the legislation will have a speedy passage through this House so that the committee can get on with the job of examining the semi-State bodies, of making recommendations and of ensuring that they are put into operation.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased that Deputy O'Malley referred to the matter of staff.  It is very necessary but unfortunately from the documentation we have received to date and from what the Minister has said, while it may not have been overlooked I think it has been taken for granted very much.  I would ask the Minister in his reply to indicate precisely the position regarding the staffing of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley gave his views and I agree mainly, but not entirely, with what he said.  I am speaking now from my experience on committees, especially on the Committee of Public Accounts.  We should have available to us what would be regarded as professional advice.  However, we should be very careful that we do not remove from the committee that extraordinary facility which Deputies have which comes perhaps from experience, intuition, perhaps from a boldness they may have or from a spirit of adventure but which is not always technically or professionally based.  Nevertheless, it has occasioned many accounting officers moments of discomfiture before a committee.  I do not think there is any formula for that contribution made by Deputies but it is an asset with regard to the overall area of accountability that must be retained at any price. <Col N="601" /> Deputy O'Malley made a vital recommendation with regard to the employment of chartered accountants. However, instead of having such professional men as a permanent fixture we might have a system where the members of the committee might have available a right or a freedom if and when they so desire to engage professional expertise of the kind considered desirable.  Perhaps a system could be devised where the members of the committee, having used that right or freedom, would submit to our accounts branch here the appropriate fee for the advice received. If we are to have a full-time accountant, from my experience to date I should like to see that accountant being a member of the staff of this House.  This is a very important aspect.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts since 1969 and I have been very happy with the officers who are serving and servicing that committee.  I would hate to see that service being removed.  It would be most undesirable if this new committee were to be serviced by civil servants from the Department of the Public Service or from the Department of Finance.  Apart from anything else, they would appear to me as servants of the Government rather than as servants of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a committee of the House of the Oireachtas; it is not a Government committee.  Therefore, we must accept that the staff serving it must be of this House.</P>
    <P>If there is one aspect more than anything else which appeals to Members of this House it is the impartiality of the service provided.  The office of the Ceann Comhairle, which serves the Committee of Public Accounts, is manned by one or two persons.  I marvel at the capacity of those people to do all the work they perform.  I do not know if the members of those offices, the servants of this House, are members of an association or union.  Perhaps it comes from their willingness to do the work, but to me they do work of a complexity, range and challenge that surpasses what might be regarded as a normal day's work.  Notwithstanding <Col N="602" /> all that, the great comfort and advantage Members of the House get comes from the confidence they have in those people.  Even though a Deputy may challenge why a question has been rejected, or may be frustrated by the rules and regulations applied at a given time, one thing he can be sure of is that there is no favouritism, that everybody, whether on the Government side or on the Opposition side, gets precisely the same treatment.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to how Members of the House treat different committees.  The respect which Members occasionally show to committees springs from the respect they have for the dedication of the officers serving those committees and from the trust we have in those officers.  I would be less favourably disposed to attending and serving on the committees which it has been my pleasure to serve on if that were removed.  I hope the Minister will refer to this matter when he replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>We should not have a situation that this committee are served only by professionals so that what lay members are doing is adjudicating on the case of one professional, the accountant in the company, against the accountant from the committee.  The committee would then be in the middle area of a referee rather than acting in a fashion which a committee should and which I believe they are capable of doing, that is, in the whole field of accountability.</P>
    <P>The current Report of the Committee was made available to the Public Accounts Committee yesterday. On page 7, paragraph 7, it states:</P>
    <P>The Committee is pleased to learn that training courses in the principles of Government Accounting were provided in 1975 and attended by thirty-nine officers and that a further forty-six nominations had been received for courses scheduled for 1976.  It notes that a booklet outlining financial procedures is in the course of preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Report on the Appropriation Accounts for 1973-74. <Col N="603" /> There is an aspect of this whole area which is often neglected and forgotten.  Personalities from all walks of life are elected to Dáil Éireann. Long may it be so.  There is no stated requirement for election in relation to one's knowledge or ignorance of Government accounting.  Sometimes it happens overnight that a Member with no knowledge or experience in that field finds that he must discharge duties appropriate to that committee. Dáil Éireann, however paradoxical it may sound, is a very lonely place, especially for a new Member.  Deputies are so busy and so much engaged in their own duties that they have neither the time nor the inclination to take new Deputies aside and counsel them in any particular area, certainly not in relation to Government accountancy. The Deputy finds himself pressurised from constituents and also in relation to other areas so that he has neither the time nor the inclination to do the necessary research.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for a Deputy to do any research in the past.  When I was appointed to the Committee of Public Accounts I immediately contacted the Department of Finance and asked them if they had a book which would indicate to me the <i>modus operandi</i> and I was told that such a booklet was not available.  I was told I could have relevant documentation. In a short while I received some foolscap pages which dealt with certain aspects of the matter.  I am very pleased that will not be the position from now on.  I am sure that everybody who is appointed to this new committee will be interested in finding out something about accounting matters.  Such Deputies will have available to them this booklet which will give a clear picture to them and will help them in the discharge of their duties.  I presume the officers of Departments who availed of the training courses ranged from EO up.  If junior executives, higher executives, junior ads and assistant principals are having the instruction referred to in the report, surely that is proof of the need there is for instruction and help to be available to Members of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> I have stated all I wanted to say in the matter of staffing, but with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I should like to recap briefly what I think is needed.  It is that the committee should be serviced by officers of this House.  As far as I am concerned, those already available to us must be over-taxed and therefore we should now be setting in train the steps necessary to recruit the officers that will be required by this committee. We should bear in mind the matter of professional advice.  One recommendation is that there should be permanent accountants available.  If that is what the Minister and others would regard as being the best possible staffing arrangement I would accept it, but I would be afraid that it would remove from the scene the non-professional T.D. I should prefer a situation where I, for instance, would get my own professional advice.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley said I would deal at greater length with the matter of Gaeltarra Éireann.  Between now and 1.30 I intend to do that to the best of my ability.  In his opening speech the Minister, <i>inter alia,</i> referred to the need for allaying public disquiet in this area.  It could be said there will always be public disquiet about this and other such matters.  The concern about it, its basis and the degree to which it must be allayed, are considerations which can best be adjudicated on at the appropriate time.  But it is true to say there is no doubt that in the past there has been, whether well founded or not, an amount of public disquiet at home and abroad&mdash; in the Gaeltacht and in the cities&mdash;regarding Gaeltarra Éireann.  I am not dismissing the possibility that on occasions disquiet and criticism can derive from a wrong base, that there might be envious and jealous people in regard to the efforts of any public company and that from that wrong premise people will proceed to attack.</P>
    <P>In regard to Gaeltarra Éireann I must say that I have not been influenced to any extent by what rumour has brought to me but by that which I have seen myself.  The physical operation of the company is more important in the matter of accountability, and I <Col N="605" /> take the notes of the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to the Tuarascáil Bliantúil of Gaeltarra Éireann for 1974.  The tuarascáil is in the Gaeilge and I am asking that the House would bear with me while I quote from the observations of the report of Comptroller and Auditor General, headed &ldquo;Tuarascáil an Iniúchóra&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that what I am about to do may remind people of the fact that, like yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was at one stage a school teacher and that perhaps I have not forgotten it and that I may be appearing in that role here. It is necessary to explain the point I want to make.  I will be asking the House to bear with me while I give my own translation.  In paragraph 1 of his report the Comptroller and Auditor General states:</P>
    <P>Fuair mé cuntais iniúchta na gcuideachtaí in a bhfuil infheistíocht ag Gaeltarra Éireann do na blianta trádála atá luaite ar Sceideal 1, colún 9.</P>

      <P>Ar eagla nach mbeadh Gaeilge ag daoine a bheadh ag léamh na tuarascála seo, b'fhearr liom dá bhfágfá liom é.  Freisin, ar eagla nach dtuigfinn go beacht céard atá ann, ba mhaith liom m'aistriúchán féin a chur air, mar is air an aistriúchán sin bhunófaidh mé mo mholtaí, agus mo cháineadh, b'fhéidir, amach anseo. Here is my translation:</P>
      <P>I have received the audited accounts of the companies in which Gaeltarra Éireann have investments for the trading years mentioned in Schedule 1, column 9.</P>
      <P>That refers to 49 companies.  I would point out that it was other auditors who did the inspections.  I continue with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iniúchóirí eile a rinne iniúchadh orthu.  Cuntas do bhliain a chriochnaigh <Col N="606" /> i 1973 a cuireadh ar fáil i gcás Ostlanna Ghaeltearmainn Teo. agus ní bhfuaras cuntas ar bith i gcás Grianchloch Acla Teo.</P>
    <P>I am translating.  This refers to Gaeltarra's report for 1974.  At numeral 1., it was an account for the year that finished in 1973 that was presented in respect of Ostlanna Ghaeltearmainn and the auditor did not get any account at all in respect of Grianchloch Acla.  We will return to that in a few moments.  I hope the House will accept my translation of what the Comptroller and Auditor General said in the Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>At numeral 2., he says: &ldquo;As is indicated on the investments schedule, an Chlár, Ambler Dhún na nGall, Teo., Iarmhuir Teo., Faisin Chonamara Teo. and C.P. Teo. tar éis éirí as trádáil.&rdquo;  Those five companies have retired from trading and the investment has been written off.  The last note by the Comptroller and Auditor General which I want to translate is: &ldquo;As I have stated in note 1 no provision at all was made in respect of a reduction in the price of investments Gaeltarra Éireann have in other companies and which are shown on the investment chart according to reduced costs which have been written off.&rdquo;  The last sentence is: &ldquo;Looking at the trading&rdquo;&mdash;and I emphasise the word `trading'&mdash;&ldquo;results of those companies, I am of the opinion that the value which is recorded in respect of that investment&rdquo;&mdash;and here he gives a figure of £1,916,839&mdash;&ldquo;is excessively overstated.&rdquo;  Sin iad na focail atá ann. Tá sé &ldquo;go mór os cionn a bhfíorluach&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are subsequent notes from the Comptroller and Auditor General. His final comment is one about which this House and the Minister cannot be entirely happy.  I will translate what he said.  &ldquo;With the proviso mentioned by me at paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above, it is my opinion that the accounts, together with the notes on the schedule attached, give the correct picture.&rdquo; I do not think it has ever happened before that the Comptroller and Auditor General has given a report in respect of any company in the fashion in which he has given it there.  That <Col N="607" /> confirms me in the view on the matter of accountability, the matter of accountancy, and the matter which may be regarded as being the correct thing.  Having regard to the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General is the person in whom all our confidence resides, I must express my unhappiness regarding the accounts as presented.  I will not refer to the accounts of other years.</P>
    <P>I want to indicate to the Minister that, unless he has evidence which would dispel my unhappiness, he will not dispel public disquiet about this company, which he said he hoped to do in his opening speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to intrude I may be able to help him.  He will recall that I mentioned that Gaeltarra Éireann have two lives, one promotional and the other trading and commercial.  It is very difficult to define the distinction between them.  Údaras na Gaeltachta when it was established will have responsibility for the trading and commercial activities.  I anticipate the use of the provision in the resolution which enables the addition of bodies to cover the examination by the committee of the trading and commercial activities to which he is making reference.  I am not opposed to these activities being examined.  I share the Deputy's view about them.  I should like him to know that, rather than that he should think I was thoroughly opposed to his exhortations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his intervention.  I have no place for rumour.  I comment only on what I see myself.  I will refer later on to what I actually saw in some of these factories.  What I see in the notes of the Comptroller and Auditor General is of such importance that we cannot any longer postpone this matter.  If I say to him that his colleague, Aire na Gaeltachta, advised me three years ago that Údarás na Gaeltachta was around the corner and we have not seen it yet, the Minister will accept that it is not as imminent as he thinks.  It might please the Minister to know that, in the notes which I have and which should be of help <Col N="608" /> to me when I am making my comments here, I see the word &ldquo;Údarás. Question mark.&rdquo;  I had it in mind that perhaps that might happen.  Well and good if that happens.  But if there is provision for this, surely something else can happen to have them excluded.</P>
      <P>As reported at column 1414, Volume 293 of the Official Report of 10th November, 1976, referring to the accounts of Gaeltarra in respect of the year to which I have referred, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>In the year ended 31st December, 1974, the last year for which accounts were published, Gaeltarra Éireann received £4,500,000 by way of grants-in-aid and repayable advances while their total sales for the same period amounted only to £1,500,000.</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion there of relativity about which I am not too happy.  If we accept that the legislation applies to State-sponsored bodies involved in trading, whether exclusively or in a hybrid fashion, the obligation then would be on this committee to examine those accounts.  The £1.5 million, which the Minister would seem to dismiss on the grounds of relativity, comparing it with the amounts available for loans and advances, is a considerable amount of money.  Surely you cannot say that, because the amount for loans and advances is so much higher you do not bother about that.  The £1.5 million could represent the total trading amount of some other company, but because that other company is not a hybrid company, is not involved in the promotional field, we exclude it. Trading bodies by their very nature require promotion.  I do not think you can exclude trading from promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function I would see this committee serving is one of examining companies that are using public money to the extent Gaeltarra does. I do not like to indulge in repetition, but in case it might be thought that I do not appreciate the contribution which State-sponsored bodies have made, I would like to put it on record. I have in the past praised State-sponsored bodies for their endeavour, <Col N="609" /> for their initiative, their integrity and efficiency, and for the wonderful contribution they have made to the life of this country.  In that I would include Gaeltarra Éireann.  Nevertheless, I do not remove Gaeltarra Éireann from accountability to this House and to the people.  I think what I have said already is ample justification for the acceptance by the Minister of amendment No. 5 as proposed by Deputy Colley, especially in respect of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to what he heard about the company in Aran. I saw something happening in a Gaeltarra Éireann company which was no longer operating but part of which had been handed over to a new company who were engaged in operations of a different kind and who were very busy when I called.  But having stayed, I stayed, I will not say longer than people thought I might, but long enough to discover that behind a partition in the new factory were former workers of the original factory who had been on the payroll for some months and who at that time were engaged in the recreation of playing cards.</P>
    <P>I saw that.  I would not be too critical of it in an emergency, but if Deputy O'Malley also has evidence that it happened in a different place from where I saw it, one would have to think, apart from other considerations, of the damning effect that has on the people who are out working in the half of the enterprise that is operating. I am as keen as anybody else that the people of the Gaeltacht should get assistance and enjoy far greater generosity than any other section of the people, but I would be critical that any Government agency would make little of the people, muintir na háite, to the extent that they would ask them to take part in what was to me national fraud and deception.  If people from another area or from an adjoining parish see that happening, what respect can they have for the company that tolerate it, whether they want to inflate the number of jobs in the Gaeltacht or not?  There is no justification for any State company who are handling State money asking people, no matter where they live, to join with <Col N="610" /> them in fraud.  That is what was happening and what could be happening. This does not take away from the fact that Gaeltarra Éireann are doing excellent work, but we must have the highest possible standards.  No matter how sympathetic an approach is demanded in certain circumstances, we must forever indicate that, as far as we are concerned, especially in the matter of the expenditure of public moneys, nothing less than perfection is good enough for us.  Therefore, there is an obligation on us to protect people, particularly the people who are being asked to indulge in this fraud.  I am not saying that the executives of Gaeltarra Éireann thought up the idea of having people nominally employed and giving them money.  But in so far as it was under their management that it was happening, Gaeltarra Éireann must carry the can.</P>

As far as France is concerned, the price is generally higher but it will be another week before up-to-date information will be available.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifteen Norwegian fishing boats were purchased by Irish fishermen between 1968 and 1972 at a total cost of 12,696,884 Norwegian kroner which was equivalent to £745,730 at the rates of exchange applicable on the dates the vessels were purchased.  The most recent half-yearly repayments due in respect of eight vessels still the subject <Col N="616" /> of Norwegian loans amounted to £46,464, whereas these repayments would have been £28,322 at the rates of exchange which applied when the vessels were purchased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this enormous increase from £28,000 to £46,000, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that fishermen are not able to meet their repayments?  What does the Parliamentary Secretary intend doing to try to alleviate the situation?  Fishermen now find themselves in a worse situation than when they first purchased the boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that two of the 15 Norwegian vessels referred to in the reply were cleared in full within their repayment periods, and six purchasers are meeting their repayments as far as is known to BIM, and two or three purchasers are finding it difficult to meet repayments. When these people decided to purchase their boats from Norway that was a risk they took.  It was open to fishermen to buy boats in Ireland. These people decided to buy in an outside market at a time when the present exchange rates could not be foreseen.  Undoubtedly, it will cost them money but that is one of the hazards of business life and the Exchequer should not be asked to subsidise them.  The vast majority of Irish fishermen had their boats built in Ireland but there were no restrictions on any who wished to purchase abroad.  As a result of their decision to purchase foreign boats, they are now caught up in the currency exchange rates.  I have great sympathy for them but a number of them are able to cope with the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara guarantee the loan repayments for the purchasers.  They do not authorise them to buy abroad. Once a person decides to buy a boat and qualifies to do so with BIM aids it is up to him to decide whether to buy at home or abroad.  We emphasised again and again the desirability of purchasing at home in order to keep our boat yards working.  We do not preclude people from buying abroad but when they did so and when by virtue of the currency exchange rates they now find it more difficult to meet repayments that is a business hazard. There was no question of the board asking anyone to build a boat abroad. The opposite would be the case.  As a result of the currency exchange rates now the demand for foreign boats is almost negligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty eight fishing boats were purchased between 1966 and 1973 with the aid of non-sterling loan finance.  The most recent half-yearly repayments due by fishermen in respect of 17 vessels still subject to such loans amounted to £89,842.  These repayments would have been £62,284 at the rates of exchange which applied when the vessels were purchased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is more or less on the lines of the previous question. Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept that when fishermen concerned bought these boats they were told what their repayments would be and acted on that basis when they decided to go to Norway for the vessels but that in view of the change that has occurred in regard to repayments the Department should endeavour to have the period of repayments extended so that the annual repayments would not be more than those contracted for originally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the fishermen did not anticipate the changes that were to take place in the currency situation but people in this House or elsewhere who might have much more knowledge of economics than have the fishermen could not have anticipated them either. Anybody who, a few years ago, could have anticipated such a major inflationary trend would be a millionaire now.  I agree that these changes in currency rates have resulted in hardship for those fishermen who had bought their boats abroad but as I indicated in my reply to the supplementaries on the previous question, that is a business hazard.  A number of the boats in question have been paid for.  At this stage I cannot say whether there is any indication that Exchequer funds might be used to assist those who are suffering much hardship because of the changed situation.</P>

For example, between the year 1931 and the last date for which figures are available, which is quite recently, the total area planted in the private sector was only 22,587 acres.  It would appear that during the past few years as agricultural land has become progressively more valuable it has become less attractive to plant land.</P>

Unfortunately, some misguided and unfortunate criticism of the scheme is being conducted in certain quarters.  That criticism is not <Col N="624" /> justified and is doing damage.

He was encouraged in his disappointment by a section of the media and by some parliamentarians.  That was unfortunate because the man who got about £20,000, was allowed to retain his house and two acres and got £12 a week, could not reasonably expect to get a non-contributory pension.

Therefore, even with net immigration, we still have a problem of young people going to Britain, some of them not well prepared.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been discussions recently by a working party of the Council of Ministers of the European Communities on the possibility of a joint declaration on respect for human rights which would be made by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.  The declaration would stress the importance of fundamental rights in the Community and underline the importance of the European Convention on Human Rights, and I would fully support such action by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made no proposals for a charter of fundamental rights at Community level such as the Deputy refers to.  One of the difficulties about drawing up a Community charter of human rights is that it could conflict with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental <Col N="629" /> Freedoms to which Ireland and 18 other member states of the Council of Europe, including the nine members of the European Community, are parties.  Furthermore, it could lead to a conflict of jurisdiction between the European Communities and the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>In fact, I do not believe that there is a need for a Community charter of fundamental rights because the recent jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities guarantees very effectively the protection of the fundamental rights of the Community's citizens in the application of Community law.  That court decided in 1974 that it could not uphold measures which are incompatible with the fundamental rights guaranteed by member states' constitutions and, in addition, that international treaties for the protection of human rights can supply guidelines which should be followed in the Community law framework.</P>
    <P>However, as I have already said, I would fully support a joint declaration on respect for human rights by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that this matter has been under consideration by the Parliament for some time and that the Commission, in their report of the 4th September, 1976, and the Parliament, in their latest report of the 4th October, 1976, called for a solemn common declaration on the part of all the institutions in the Community, namely the Parliament, the Commission and Council. In the light of that would the Minister not think it would be appropriate that the Council should seem to be acting more urgently than they apparently have been to adopt this solemn common declaration and that our Government, as being the Government for fundamental rights, should be seen to be very much in the van of such a promotion?</P>

There is no delay in this area, the Deputy can be assured, and we are giving the fullest support to speedy action in respect of the common declaration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there has been no delay.  Would the Minister agree that there seems to have been a lack of urgency in view, for instance, of the view of, for example, the Federal German Constitutional Court, some time back that there is a need for a charter of fundamental rights for a standard throughout the Community? Would the Minister not agree then that there should be a more determined and urgent effort on the part of the Council to meet this common standard which is necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are thinking of two things here.  One is having a Community Charter of Human Rights. The view of the European Commission and of the European Parliament, a view which the Council of Ministers share, is that for a number of reasons it would not be the best way to proceed, reasons which I have outlined in a general way in my reply.  As an alternative to that the common declaration is proposed as the best way of emphasising the commitment of the Community to human rights and the commitment of their court to uphold them.  The common declaration is therefore, if you like, in lieu of a charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of difficulties would arise with a charter of human rights. Some of them I have outlined already in my reply.  Another is that it could tend to become the lowest common denominator of rights in existing member countries rather than the highest common factor.  The existing situation is well protected once the European Court has taken on board this idea of human rights and is willing to ensure their protection.  In the circumstances it was the view of the Commission, and Parliament the Ministers are also in agreement, that rather than seek to devise a charter for <Col N="631" /> the European Community the best approach would be a common declaration.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the European Communities in The Hague on 30th October agreement was reached on a resolution which includes the following provision:</P>
      <P>The Council recognises that the protection and the control of the fishing zone off Ireland must not result, because of the size of this zone, in a charge for that member state, which is disproportionate to the volume of the Community fish resources which can be exploited in that zone by the fishermen of that member state.  It agrees that the implementation of available means of surveillance or those to be foreseen must be accompanied by appropriate measures to ensure that the charges which ensue will be shared equitably.</P>
      <P>At the same time the Commission indicated that the question of an equitable sharing of the charges incurred by the member states would be further studied by the Commission which will, if necessary, present proposals to the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to say what form Community assistance for the protection and control of the extended Irish fishing zone will take. The matter is under close examination <Col N="632" /> by the Departments concerned here as well as by the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, can the Minister for Foreign Affairs tell us if there are any definite proposals from our Government as to the help we might need for the protection of our fishing resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is under examination, but it is not something in a sense solely for our Government because in the outer part of the 12-mile zone the fishing to be protected will really for the foreseeable future be fishing by other countries rather than by us.  The Deputy knows our fishermen are, on the whole, operating coastal zones and therefore the scale of protection required on the outer part of the zone is a matter very much of concern to our partners, in a sense more to them than to us.  This is precisely why, in our view, they should share in any costs involved. Therefore, while of course we have to make our assessment of the protection measures necessary for the zone as a whole and in particular for the area within which our fishermen will be fishing, it is a matter in respect of which we need to consult with our partners and to get a common view as to the total scale of protection activity which, in their view and in ours, is appropriate to the whole zone so that the financing of that protection can be equitably shared.  That process of consultation is now beginning.</P>

      <P>The European Commission authorised the introduction by the Italian Government of an import deposit scheme under Article 108 of the Rome Treaty in May, 1976. Under this article such authorisation may be revoked, or the conditions and <Col N="633" /> details of such protective measures may be changed by the council.  No such revocation or alteration was sought by the council.  On 29th September, 1976, the commission announced their decision that the scheme should be phased out over a seven-month period, ending in April, 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs why Ireland abstained in the recent vote in the United Nations General Assembly on the Security Council to impose a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa and to ban all military co-operation with the South African Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of unsubstantiated allegations against certain friendly countries, contained in the preamble of this year's resolution, we abstained on this vote while reaffirming our support for the general objectives of the resolution.</P>
      <P>The Government have consistently supported and observed the Security Council resolutions calling for a voluntary arms embargo against South Africa.  In 1974, Ireland voted in favour of a United Nations resolution which called upon the Security Council to impose a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa.  Government policy has not changed since then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recognise that our representative in explaining that vote did not make any reference to the unsubstantiated allegations he has referred to now and I have a copy of the record here before me.  Will the Minister tell me if there has not been an increasing trend on our part in the UN recently to abstain on matters of fundamental principle?  For instance, we abstained on the resolution on the economic collaboration with South Africa, on the programme of action against apartheid and now we are abstaining on the resolution calling for a military arms embargo against South Africa when there is evidence to suggest that the terrible murders at Soweto were <Col N="634" /> committed by people using weapons supplied by these people.  Is that the position our Government are taking up?  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, have been known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Order.  This is Question Time.  Brief questions, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has any information in his possession as to the source of arms used in Soweto, I should be grateful for it because no information has come to my attention suggesting that any arms imported from these countries mentioned here have been used internally.  I am not excluding the possibility; I am only saying quite sincerely that if the Deputy has any information to that effect I should be grateful for it.</P>
      <P>For the first time this year's resolution contained references to particular countries as exporting arms to South Africa.  In one instance in particular, the government in question, a friendly government, made representations to us saying that this was false.  That government's statement has been circulated by the anti-apartheid committee of the United Nations in New York without comment.  This would seem to suggest acceptance of the fact that the allegation made in the preamble to the resolution against that country was incorrect.  When such a false allegation is made against a friendly country, while we support the general tenor of the resolution, it would be inappropriate for us to vote for it and we marked our disapprobation of what appeared to be an incorrect allegation by abstaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me add in the general issues the Deputy raised on the pattern of our voting that there has been a growing tendency to introduce into resolutions on matters of principle with which we are deeply concerned, material which is of such a character as to make it difficult, and in some cases impossible, for us to support the resolution.  This includes, for example, the case of the introduction into the resolutions about racism of references to Zionism.  The tendency is to elaborate resolutions year by year in a form which introduces <Col N="635" /> matter which we cannot accept as being factually correct or that could be supported by us.  This means that there are a number of resolutions which we would have been happy to support in the past, and which we will support again if they are in the same form as they used to be, but there may be resolutions in respect of which we may have to abstain or in certain cases even to vote against. There is no change in our policy; there is a change in the form of resolutions.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that in every single instance the question of our voting pattern is carefully scrutinised and this often has to be done, because resolutions are submitted with 24 hours' notice, at very great speed and at very curious hours of the day and the night when one is in very curious places in order to make the best decision possible.  The guiding principle throughout is that we stand by the principles we have always stood by in relation to matter of this kind.  If the resolution changes its form and unacceptable matter is introduced, it can and sometimes does become necessary for us to change our vote in those circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did our representative not make that reference?

Finally, and I want a precise answer on this, does this represent our official policy that instead of supporting resolutions of this kind the best way to remove apartheid would be through a process of peaceful change involving all the people of South Africa?  Is that the position our Government are taking?</P>

      <P>I hold the same views about events in Soweto and about the whole South African situation, but when a resolution is formulated in terms which are changed and which involve statements that are incorrect about friendly countries, we have to take account of that.  We would be untrue to ourselves to vote in favour of a false statement even about an unfriendly country, never mind a friendly one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the present position in relation to securing a 50-mile exclusive fishing limit for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Foreign Ministers of the Community discussed the question of fisheries at their meetings in The Hague on 29th and 30th October, 1976, and in Brussels on 15th and 16th November, 1976.  At those meetings I reiterated our demand for an exclusive coastal zone for Ireland, adequate to ensure the continued development of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
      <P>At the meeting in The Hague on 30th October, 1976, the Ministers agreed that the provisions of the common fisheries policy, as further determined by the Act of Accession and adapted to take account of the extension of waters to 200 miles, would be so applied as to secure the continued and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry on the basis of the Irish Government's fisheries development programme for the development of coastal fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that meeting I made a statement on behalf of the Government of which the council took note and which was recorded in the minutes.  This was to the effect that in the view of the Irish Government the continued and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry can be secured only by the establishment of an exclusive coastal belt of up to 50 miles and that <Col N="638" /> the Government consider agreement on the coastal belt issue to be a precondition to the adoption of new directives by the council for substantive agreements with third countries on the reciprocal fishing rights which would be designed to follow on the conclusion of framework agreements and of such interim arrangements as may be required before substantive agreements on quotas and zones can be put into effect.</P>
    <P>At the council meeting on 16th November, 1976, I stated that I hoped it would prove possible to agree on sufficient elements of the internal fisheries regime in order to secure the application of the agreement reached at The Hague with effect from the date when the 200 mile zone comes into effect, that is, 1st January, 1977.  I added that if this did not prove possible the Irish Government would have to take as a temporary measure and in consultation with the Commission and the interested member states, interim steps to ensure progress towards the achievement of the objective in respect of Irish coastal fisheries agreed at The Hague on 30th October, 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that fishermen and the nation as a whole are gravely concerned that the Government seem to be getting away from the idea of the 50-mile fishing zone and we are talking in terms of a 30-mile zone?  Will the Minister tell us what the position is in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is public concern.  I think the people are satisfied that we have made significant progress without conceding anything.  Secondly, no reference to a 30-mile zone has passed my lips or those of my officials in any discussions or negotiations.  Any such reference in the newspapers is newspaper speculation.  I am not aware of any proposals for a 30-mile limit.  All we have said is precisely what I have stated in my reply, that we consider that the continued and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry can be secured only by the establishment of an exclusive coastal zone in belts of up to 50 miles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a physical difficulty about contradicting every speculative newspaper report on every issue, nor do I think it is necessary. I have, however, sought to clarify fully for the fishermen the position of the Government by writing an article for a fishery magazine which will come out shortly.  I think it is important that fishermen should have the maximum first-hand information on the position and I hope the article will help to clarify the position on these points.  In so far as there is any confusion arising from the reference to 30 miles, I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me the chance to clarify it.  There is nothing whatever in that proposal&mdash;there is no question of a 30-mile limit and there has not been in any discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On 18th October, 1976 the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe was informed by a note from the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the Council of Europe of the resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1st September, 1976 regarding the existence of a state of emergency and of the subsequent enactment of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976.  As this enactment could involve derogation from the obligations imposed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Secretary-General was requested to regard the note as informing him accordingly in compliance with the requirements of Article 15 (3) of the convention.  A copy of the Emergency Powers Act was attached.</P>
      <P>The following day, the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe acknowledged receipt of this notice and stated that it would be communicated to the other contracting parties to the European Convention on Human Rights.  I have been informed that the full text of the Irish note was sent by the Council of Europe to these States on 27th October, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, each of the nine member states of the European Communities has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights. The Community, as such, is not of course a contracting party.  There is <Col N="643" /> no obligation to notify the Council of Ministers of the European Communities of a declaration of a state of emergency or of the enactment of emergency legislation by a member state.  I do not think it would be appropriate to give notification of these measures to the Council of Ministers, particularly when each of the member states of the European Communities has already received formal notification from the Council of Europe.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his Department have any established procedure for entertaining international sports teams from this country in Irish embassies <Col N="644" /> abroad; and, if so, if he will state the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our embassies do not have special funds available to them for that purpose and so my Department can have no established procedure in the matter.  However, an ambassador may, at his discretion, arrange a social occasion from his own funds if his and the visiting team's schedules permit.  This would, of course, depend on such factors as the venue of the sporting event and the engagements programme of the visiting team being notified in advance to the embassy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the cost of such a reception would not have been very great.  A recent Press report suggested that one of our teams were not brought to the embassy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case in question unfortunately no notification was given and no contact made by the team or the association with either the Department or the embassy.  It is the practice normally for teams visiting other countries who wish to have a reception at the embassy and meet people to notify their intention in advance.  The Irish Rugby Football Union do so usually about three months in advance.  In this instance the ambassador was away on other duties.  He was in Nairobi at UNESCO.  He arrived back in the morning.  He had no sleep.  He had a function that day but he went to the match that evening.  I regret that owing to the fact that no contact was made no reception was held and I hope that in future associations will make contact in advance.  Of course the question of arranging receptions is a matter for the ambassador or members of the embassy staff out of their own entertainment allowances.  There is no special allowance but I know they are always anxious to use the provisions made for them in a hospitable way <i>vis-à-vis</i> people visiting from Ireland, especially people who come in a representative capacity.</P>

      <P>Would Deputy Tunney, I wonder, allow me to intervene for a moment?  I have been considering what was said by him and some of his colleagues this morning and I think we may meet the situation with regard to Gaeltarra Éireann in this way.  As I have explained already, Gaeltarra Éireann have two functions, one is promotional and the other is ordinary trading and commercial activities.  We could bring the latter within the ambit of the Oireachtas committee and I am disposed to table an amendment to bring in these activities of Gaeltarra Éireann.  They can be identified because they come under the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The matter will want to be looked at very carefully but I can table an amendment to meet the points raised by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the Minister's intervention and I welcome it.  I will leave it to our spokesman to deal with the position.  I spoke earlier about the need for adequately qualified <Col N="650" /> staff for the committee and I hope the Minister will be mindful in that regard of the proven capacity, dedication, independence and ability of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, a staff which has served so well in the past.</P>
      <P>I would like to remove some confusion in what I said about a company retaining staff while no production was taking place.  Deputy O'Malley spoke of similar circumstances obtaining in a factory in Achill.  I think I said Aran.  The factory to which I referred is located in Carraroe.  With regard to the Minister's proposed amendment, it might be wiser to include in full the business of Gaeltarra Éireann having regard to the note to which I referred given to us by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of our amendments calls for the inclusion of Gaeltarra Éireann and I propose to speak in support of that amendment. There is a very big principle involved as to whether all the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann should be brought before the committee for consideration or merely their trading activities. The points I prepared deal mainly with their trading activities and the companies with which they have investments and in which they hold shares.  In view of the Minister's proposed amendment there is no need for me now to elaborate on that particular aspect.  I should, however, like to thank the Minister for conceding this point to the Fianna Fáil Party. On further reflection he may consider including all the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been accused by the Minister for the Gaeltacht of asking questions in regard to some companies in which Gaeltarra Éireann are involved which are to the disadvantage of the companies and to the disadvantage of Gaeltarra Éireann in promoting industrial activity in the Gaeltacht areas and attracting new investment into those areas.  Up to now we have been in a very awkward position.  I have the utmost regard for the officials who work in the various Gaeltarra Éireann establishments.  They give very loyal <Col N="651" /> and very dedicated service in a very difficult field.  At the same time, recognising that and giving due credit for it, I do not think I should be inhibited from raising pertinent questions in regard to the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I believe the public should not be denied information as to how the moneys voted are spent.  It may not be spent in all cases to the best advantage.  The committee will eliminate most of the difficulties an Opposition Deputy encounters in this regard of not wishing to interfere with the success of the company while, at the same time, making sure that everything is being done satisfactorily and that rumours are quenched by facts.  This could only be done up to now by way of question and answer in this House.</P>
    <P>It is most suitable that the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann be discussed by the committee, where discretion will be exercised by the members.  It is most important that the chairman be a Member of the Opposition.  That principle has been established in the Committee of Public Accounts, for instance, and it must be adhered to in this case also.  The effectiveness of the investigations of the committee can best be assured by the allocation of the Chair to a Member of the Opposition, and I hope the Government will concede that amendment which stands in the name of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I am glad that no longer will I have to bring before this House the affairs of these individual companies and the way they are being assisted by Gaeltarra Éireann.  Up to now it was the only way open to us, but it is right and proper that it should be done in the Committee rather than having to drag it out here in public.  I should like to thank the Minister for the bit of the road he has come in regard to the concession he is making to us.  I would ask him to consider again the terms of the concession and to ensure that all of the operations of Gaeltarra Éireann are included, not just the trading company aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister described the setting up of the committee as a significant step in the reform <Col N="652" /> of the public service.  In addition, he gave us the reasons it was necessary to do so.  Frequently it has been quite obvious that the relationship between the Oireachtas and the semi-State companies was not a satisfactory one.</P>
      <P>I agree with the reasons he gave for making an effort to improve the situation but I do not think the step now proposed is of any significance or will make any worth-while changes in the situation.  This is my candid opinion.  The motion calls for a committee &ldquo;to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities&rdquo;. Instead of the word &ldquo;results&rdquo; I should like to see substituted the word &ldquo;proposals&rdquo;.  Will the committee simply look at reports that in most cases appear one-and-a-half years after the figures have been compiled? What service will it provide to improve the many things Members of the Oireachtas would like to see changed?  Will the committee help to expose the workings of State-sponsored bodies?</P>
      <P>I have gone through the Minister's opening statement again because I did not hear all of it when he was speaking. At column 1407, Volume 293 of the Official Report, dated 10th November, 1976, in relation to the State-sponsored companies he said:</P>
      <P>There is a problem in relation to their responsibility to the Oireachtas but, at this stage, it seems that a solution may well lie in a redefinition of their relationships to Ministers. For the commercial State-sponsored bodies, however, we feel that the existing relationships to Ministers, which provide for considerable operating freedoms, are broadly correct but that there is, in the overall structural pattern, a gap in the area of responsibility to the Oireachtas which will be filled by the proposals now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several significant points in that statement.  The Minister admits there is a void to be filled.  He claims that this motion providing for an all-party committee will fill that void, <Col N="653" /> but I do not think it will.  In that statemen the Minister implies that there will be amending legislation in relation to the Minister's powers with regard to State-sponsored bodies.  I do not know if he has spelled this out in clearer detail since but I formally request now that in his reply he makes clear whether it is his intention to have amending legislation in respect of Ministerial relationships with State-sponsored bodies.  This might allay the fears of those who are not satisfied with what the committee can do within the terms of reference set out.</P>
    <P>All of us have the greatest admiration for the executive officers who were responsible for the success of the important State-sponsored companies that did so much for the economy.  In this connection one cannot fail to think of the faith that Seán Lemass reposed in the Irish people on each occasion when the companies had to fill a void that could not be filled by private enterprise.  No private company was likely to take on the development of the bogs on a national scale as Bord na Móna did many years ago. Things have dramatically changed and our economy has benefited enormously because of the work of the State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Public transport is the subject of legislation before the House.  The necessity to have a common carrier, to have a company committed to public transport, was the reason CIE were established.  The same applies to shipping and many other areas where appropriate State-sponsored bodies were set up.  This was done because it was beyond the capability of private enterprise.  So far so good. The pioneers of those companies were great men who gave their best to something which was really on trial.  Many thought it could not possibly succeed. There was a good deal of the usual opposition at the time, which was to be expected.  The fact that those semi-State bodies succeeded is a great tribute to the executives who undertook the gigantic task of getting them started.  They have been given practically absolute autonomy and are almost independent from many <Col N="654" /> obstacles which the House could place on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that those semi-State bodies have grown to the stage when £1,000 million is estimated to be the value of their assets, their turnover is a net £5 million a year and they employ 57,000 people.  They have become an integral part of the national economy, indispensable to the success and progress of the economy.  They must be very much involved in economic expansion.  We have not got a programme of economic policy at the moment.  This must emerge at some stage and those semi-State bodies must be a part of it. They have grown to the stage where the freedom and independence they had from parliamentary control is no longer justifiable.</P>
    <P>I believe the extent to which this committee will improve this situation is minimal.  In fact, it is only an excuse.  The people who have been crying out for a better link between the Oireachtas and those important bodies will not find any satisfaction in what the Minister is doing now.  It is another glorified Public Accounts Committee which will say whether or not that money was wisely spent.  What power will the committee have to deal with the many things we would like to see corrected?  The committee should be able to enlighten us why those companies are doing certain things.  Will the committee do anything to allay our suspicions about the lack of friendship between Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus? We are not satisfied that there is co-operation there.  They are both operating in the same field, which is of the utmost importance to the economy. What will the committee do to improve that?  What power will they have to deal with matters of that kind?  What power will they have to deal with many other things, such as our suspicion that there is overstaffing, that Parkinson's Law has been allowed to operate unbridled?  What power will the committee have in relation to companies that are not obliged to make a profit and can employ more and more staff with extra facilities that are out of proportion to the need of the actual job they are doing?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> I may be wrong and thousands of people in Ireland may be wrong but there should be some means, if those suspicions prevail, of allaying the feelings of the people.  This committee are worse than nothing because they will create the impression that now everything is all right.  The committee have no power except to look at a report that comes out one-and-a-half years late, say what they think about it and put forward some suggestions to the company.  That is locking the stable door when the horse is gone.  That is not enough.</P>
    <P>The amendments we suggest would dramatically change the situation.  The word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; is an essential one.  If it is taking power away from the Minister, which he would prefer to have, let him amend the law in relation to ministerial power in liaison with those companies so that he can be accountable to the House and that Parliament is given the same relationship to those companies as it has to any Department of State at present.</P>
    <P>Those semi-State companies have grown up and matured now.  They have good men in charge.  They have experienced many vicissitudes as they passed from their embryo stage until they reached maturity.  They are capable of withstanding the pressures and very often the wrong accusations that could be flung at them in the House. They should not be afraid to open up everything in relation to the important work they are doing and the important part they must play in any future plan for the expansion of our economy.  This committee will not be given any teeth to uncover any of the weaknesses we suspect at times in those semi-State bodies.  What will this committee do in relation to the lack of proper co-operation between two bodies which should be co-operating for the general welfare of our economy, that is, Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte?  What will the committee do in relation to something which is causing a good deal of public anxiety where CIE this year sold a subsidiary body dealing with air freight traffic? This is reputed to have been sold to a former manager for a nominal figure.  An asset like this, carrying an <Col N="656" /> international freight transport licence with great goodwill attached, should be worth a considerable amount of money if it were advertised and sold &mdash;something State Departments are obliged to do when they have any assets to dispose of.  How were CIE, as was reported earlier this year, able to sell Aerlód Teoranta to a former manager for a nominal sum?  Was it offered to other interested people?  We are told that CIE are losing money. This subsidy body had an IATA licence.  The people are anxious that those bodies be made accountable to the Oireachtas and that their suspicions be allayed.  It would be to the benefit of the companies concerned if they had the opportunity to submit everything in relation to their operations to the House and have them discussed and, if necessary, rectified.</P>
    <P>This motion providing for the establishment of the statutory committee is an innocent looking one, providing for the appointment of a few Members from each side of the House.  There has been some argument about who should be the chairman. It is not very significant, if the committee have no teeth.  There is then a nice clause which says that no matter can be published in relation to the workings of these companies if the committee are requested by the particular body not to do so.  The obvious reason for that is that where commercial undertakings are involved they would not like competitors to know how they were dealing with market research, sales, quantity control and many other things.  No sensible committee would indulge in this but, nevertheless, that provision can be used by some State-sponsored bodies to prevent anything they wish being published.  Such a body could say that any information was detrimental to them.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to ask the Minister if he would agree to a major examination in relation to commercial dealings to see whether State-sponsored companies should be in competitive business or not.  The Minister interrupted the proceedings to announce that he is going part of the way to bring in some of the activities of <Col N="657" /> Gaeltarra Éireann to be scrutinised by this committee.  I do not think what he has announced is very important but at least he has acknowledged the soundness of the case being made by us.  In fact, he could not refuse to take in the commercial side of Gaeltarra Éireann because in his opening statement he made the case that it was the commercial companies he sought to bring in first.  There is no more commercialised company than Gaeltarra Éireann and no State-sponsored body requiring a magnifying glass to be put on their activities than Gaeltarra Éireann.  The public suspect that Gaeltarra Éireann is simply a public relations body for the Minister for the Gaeltacht because he is directly associated with the promotion of every bog road, track and parish pump they are involved in, from one end of the Gaeltacht to the other.</P>
    <P>Gaeltarra Éireann are never known to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to anything that is proposed but they never say &ldquo;when&rdquo; and leave themselves an unlimited amount of time in which to carry out a proposal. The promotional and commercial activity of Gaeltarra Éireann should be subjected to minute scrutiny by the House.  I am aware that Gaeltarra Éireann and other State-sponsored bodies are not obliged to make a profit.  The forerunner of Gaeltarra Éireann was established by the Department of Lands for the purpose of setting up industries in areas where private enterprise would not go.  It was taken for granted that that body would lose money in the process of doing so. That argument held water until such time as the manufacture of tweed, particularly Donegal tweed which is the only tweed in the world worth buying, reached its peak on the world market. Then we found that Gaeltarra Éireann was a thorn in the side of private producers. Gaeltarra Éireann, because they were not obliged to make a profit, could under-cut on the market and did not mind if they stockpiled or not. When private enterprise was making a handsome dividend on the shares in their investment Gaeltarra Éireann were losing money on the same product. Nobody complained at that time. Later we amended considerably the terms of reference under which they <Col N="658" /> were operating and passed legislation permitting them to take equities with private enterprise in the development of companies.  That activity is being pursued by Gaeltarra Éireann now.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with how easily Gaeltarra Éireann can at times undertake certain enterprises which have not a great potential or are likely to last out for any great length of time. I must say that the IDA, before they give grants, require applicants to do their market research, have proper quantity control and the testing of products.  They ensure that the knowhow and technological production side of the enterprise is available before they pay a grant.  On occasions they are so particular that they annoy applicants.  They make these investigations because they are giving a free handout, a gift, to the person going into the enterprise.  I do not think that Gaeltarra Éireann enter into a commitment with a proper appraisal of the potential of an enterprise or its likely outcome.  They do not have due regard for the possibility of a sudden closure.</P>
    <P>I would hope that Gaeltarra Éireann would do twice as much but on a firmer basis and that they would link other responsible bodies to their enterprises, such as the IDA and CTT.  In that event there would be constant vigilance and supervision.  One of the best ways to have the necessary surveillance would be to give the committee the Minister is proposing to establish the powers we are seeking for it.  The public would then know what was happening and the firms concerned would have an opportunity of explaining to the House, through the Minister, what they were doing. Because that will not happen under this committee, I believe it will be a disappointment.  If the Minister said he may introduce amending legislation to improve the relationship between the Minister and the House concerning State-sponsored bodies it might make up in some way for what the committee lack.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for some years and on occasions I felt it was not a very effective exercise, particularly if <Col N="659" /> Members did not do their homework or engage in any research.  We often asked silly questions that were remotely related to what we should be probing.  However, if one did one's homework one could find out how the money was spent and whether it was spent to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>This is a different operation.  This is a committee which is supposed to look into the workings of the State-sponsored bodies which account for 57,000 employees and possess £1,000 million worth of assets.  They have become a huge cog in the whole economic mechanism of the country. We need more than a few Members of this House examining their reports and accounts and overall operational results.  Those are the terms of reference. These accounts and operational results in the past have been submitted a year and a half or perhaps two years late.  I cannot see that this is a very important step.</P>
    <P>The State-sponsored bodies which have been included and those which have not been included make one suspicious.  The Minister referred to the criteria he used to select those on the list.  He laid emphasis on their commercial activities.  Why then did he include such firms as the Dairy Disposal Company and Ceimicí Teoranta and leave out Gaeltarra Éireann and others?  One would almost suspect that, in the selection of that list, the Minister was activated by no other motive than to find a list of companies which would be least controversial.  He could not omit Aer Lingus, CIE and the ESB.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to make reference to the ESB's operational affairs in this House several times.  I have incurred the ire of ESB officials.  Some of them have written to me to that effect.  The ESB legislation which went through the House recently was rather limited and did not give scope for a detailed debate.  I referred to what I believe to be a fact, that is, that the installation costs are far too high. I repeated something which was pointed out to me by ESB officials, that the estimate was based on the very highest figure they could find <Col N="660" /> through whatever slide rule they used and when the technicians came to do the work they were supposed to do it in the most inexpensive way.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting poor materials or poor workmanship would be used. Nobody could accuse the ESB of that. In fact, their emphasis on quality is sometimes overdone.  I should like the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, or the ESB, to explain something to me.  A few years ago you built your house and you asked to have the electricity connection made.  It was done in about a week's time and there was no charge.  As I pointed out recently, a woman applied to have her cottage connected in a little place called Duchairi and she was asked to pay £3,790.  Some explanation is necessary other than the mad inflation which has been allowed to run unchecked and throw everything out of gear. These people feel the ESB have gone mad.  The only way to allay those feelings is to expose them to the light.  I use the word &ldquo;expose&rdquo; in its true, literal sense.  They should let the people see what exactly is happening instead of continuing to suspect it is due to some other cause.</P>
    <P>Our State-sponsored bodies are so much an integral part of the economy that the Houses of the Oireachtas should be able to manipulate them to the benefit of the economy as a whole, allow them to run deficits in times of stress if necessary, and ask them to do certain work which is essential to the economy, perhaps in relation to a superstructure which will bring about consequential industries and improvements generally.  Having the approval of the Oireachtas they would be free from suspicion and the blame would not rest on the very able executives who are in charge of these operations. This proposal does not in any way move towards that.  It will be an irrelevant, futile committee.  If we are to be charged one of these days with the responsibility of producing an economic plan to deal with the serious situation in which the country is at present, we must be in a position to use the State-sponsored companies to the greatest advantage to pull the country by the shoe strings up out of <Col N="661" /> the depths into which it has been trodden by a lack of attention and complete neglect under the present regime.  That is very hard speaking but it is quite straight, and it is the way the public are talking at present and the way they expect us to talk from these benches too.</P>
    <P>We are taking up the time of the House dealing with a little motion. The Minister will not even accept the use of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; in the amendment proposed by us.  It is just cosmetic to pretend that a promise made prior to the election is being carried out.  It is a pretence and nothing more.  The committee are completely devoid of teeth.  Worse still, it will now be taken that everything is all right: the Oireachtas have got the accountability they wanted and everything in the garden will be rosy.  There is nothing in it to make changes, if changes are necessary.  The economy as a whole will demand a plan and a policy and a programme which will necessitate the complete involvement of many of the State-sponsored bodies.  It will then be more necessary than ever for accountability to be available to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I could say half a loaf is better than no bread, but I do not see even half a loaf here.  If one could say it is a step forward it would be welcome.  To me it is likely to be a <i>fait accompli</i>, and the one and only effort.  There is no provision for what the Minister described as significant development.  I do not see anything significant about it.  The accounts of these companies are audited by competent auditors. They work to the highest dictates of public responsibility but the things that private enterprise must and can do are very often absent where State-sponsored bodies are concerned.  The only weakness in State-sponsored corporations is that all the checks and balances to which private enterprise is subject are not applied to the State-sponsored bodies.  A greater degree of accountability to this House by these bodies, giving them the opportunity to show the public what they do and why they do it, would satisfy the public.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has not shown his readiness to accept the <Col N="662" /> amendment proposed except to the small extent he has come in relation to Gaeltarra Éireann.  I would ask the Minister to let us know whether CIE had the right to sell Aerlód privately and whether the transfer of the international airways licence, which has not yet taken place, will take place without an open explanation being given in regard to the disposal of this important asset, the goodwill and the licence which this company has.</P>

      <P>One would think, listening to Deputy Brennan's statement on this motion, that he was some backbench Deputy who was elected to the House at the last general election.  One would never guess that he has been here since 1951 and during a number of years was a Minister in the Fianna Fáil Government. I am asking him before he leaves the House, what did Fianna Fáil do about probing into the affairs of State-sponsored bodies?  I ask that as one who again and again down through the years suggested that a committee such as this motion proposes should be set up.</P>
      <P>I agree that the committee I had in mind and for which I used to agitate in this House would have more bite than the one proposed in the motion but I am satisfied that this is a good beginning.  It is something for which we have been looking for many years and Fianna Fáil would do nothing about it.  I used to say, and I think with some justification, that their main reason for doing nothing about it was that the boards of the State-sponsored bodies were utilised mainly to give a soft seat to some of their political cronies, ex-Members of this House and Members of the Seanad and Taca men around the country.</P>

      <P>That was one of the major defects of these bodies. We all know the importance of these organisations, some of them listed here: the ESB, CIE, Siúicre Éireann. <Col N="663" /> I do not think I am reflecting unjustifiably on a number of people when I say they were appointed to these boards with little or no other qualification than that of being an active supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, financially or otherwise.  These were the criteria Fianna Fáil applied to appointing people on such boards. It was detrimental to their advancement, and I am giving that as one of the main reasons why we did not get a motion somewhat similar to this before the House in the years gone by.  To my mind it was a shameful period of our industrial history, this appointment to boards of people who could not be said to hold the minimum qualifications for such membership.</P>
      <P>Now in 1976 this Government are taking cognisance of our State-sponsored bodies and the role they play in the life of the country.  The Minister in his opening statement has said that there are almost 100 bodies that may be deemed to be State-sponsored, that their total employment content is some 65,000 and their overall financial resources in the region of £1,000 million.</P>
      <P>It was possibly right on the part of the State to set up these bodies.  The ESB was a most essential corporation to establish here at the time it was established more than 50 years ago. We can look back with pride on its work down through the years.  That body has now reached the stage where our electrification scheme is being brought to a conclusion with 98 to 99 per cent of homes having the advantages of electricity.  However, without reflecting on the ESB or any of these bodies set down in this motion and those which are not set down in the motion, I think they could do their work just as well if the elected representatives of the people had more say in their affairs.  I do not mean by that that we should dictate to them about their day-to-day affairs, but there should be more accountability to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When questions were asked here in the Dáil we were told that this or that body was autonomous and it was not <Col N="664" /> open to the Minister to give information as requested in a Deputy's question.  Because of the repetition of this type of answer, Deputies felt it a futile exercise to put down questions relating to State-sponsored bodies. The position will change with the help of this motion.  If we find that it is inadequate and does not measure up to the requirements of this House and the interests of the public, it can be extended.  This is a wise beginning.</P>
    <P>We accept that the boards of these companies are doing a good job but the executives of State-sponsored companies must lie more lightly on their pillows at night than the executives of private companies.  The owner of a private company is a troubled man today if he cannot meet his liabilities.  We hear a great deal of talk today about the large profits being made by private companies, but I have always been a believer in private enterprise.  Private enterprise is not in conflict with public enterprise. Most private businesses, whether large or small, have served the State well.  They are providing facilities for people at moderate rates.  There is no excessive profitability in most private concerns.  The private businessman must find money to pay his employees, to pay his tax and to meet his other liabilities, but the chief executive of a State-sponsored company has not the same worries.  If, for instance, CIE, a State-sponsored company, are not making money, this House will come to their aid.  Year after year we are voting the allocation of moneys to State-sponsored bodies.  The people who vote for the allocation of money to State-sponsored companies are entitled to more information than is available to them at present.  Many people say that State companies are not efficiently managed, that they are over-staffed and have surpluses of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said that he had occasion to remark on a particular body and that, as a result, some executives of that body were not too nice to him afterwards.  If a Deputy is not entitled to comment on these companies, then he has no business <Col N="665" /> here at all.  My reason for quoting Deputy Brennan's point is that I commented on a State body on another occasion and I was given the same treatment.  I had occasion to visit that company at a later date to make representations on behalf of my constituents and I got very little attention.</P>
    <P>It has been said that all information obtained by this committee should be published.  I do not agree with that. The ESB are a commercial organisation. They buy the equipment they sell from different manufacturers.  It would not be fair to publish that kind of information.  This committee should be able to decide what should be published. Any man in the public service who is doing his work properly has no reason to be afraid of any committee. The members of the Public Accounts Committee are fair-minded.  They are not trying to stab anyone in the back but are trying to get facts and figures in order to improve the services of State companies.  There is no doubt that State-sponsored bodies are unwieldy at present.  The big snag is that they are free from accountability.  I know that many of the chief executives of State-sponsored companies are eminent men and have no doubt that many of them welcome this measure.  It will give them an opportunity to express their recommendations.  Unfair charges are often made against these companies. This measure should give them an opportunity of refuting unjust charges.</P>
    <P>My main reason for intervening in this discussion is to congratulate the Minister on making a stand.  It may not have all the teeth that Fianna Fáil would like, but they had not the courage to bring forward anything like this.  They did not provide even a toothless motion.  We had to continue in Opposition asking questions on State-sponsored bodies and being satisfied with standard answers.  Projections made in relation to State-sponsored bodies have been proved incorrect.  I remember a time when the closure of the West Cork railway and the Waterford-Tramore line was being discussed in this House and it was considered that the closure of these lines would result in the better functioning of CIE. The executives in CIE backed up the <Col N="666" /> then Minister's proposal and these lines were closed.</P>
    <P>I do not know how that prophecy of 14 years ago is working out at present but the capital injection for the railway side of CIE alone is something in the region of £28 million.  It is a pity that this committee was not there at the time to have those executives questioned and their answers on record.  I assume that any statements made to this committee by executives of State-sponsored bodies will be recorded as will the questions and statements made by the committee.  Wild statements were made years ago in relation to CIE and if they were recorded and read now in the light of what has happened they would seem very funny indeed.</P>
    <P>The number of bodies being investigated is sizeable.  I assume that the more important and bigger ones are in the first list and if it is necessary to amend or add to the list that will be done.  I have no hesitation in voting for this motion as it is set down.  It is a move in the right direction.  If I had the setting down of it, I would give it a little more bite but at any rate it is an innovation.  It is something new and as far as I can see the membership will be apportioned between the Government and Opposition.  From my knowledge of committees established by this House they work smoothly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>Not only will this committee be helpful to Members of the House and to the Irish public in getting information on the activities of our State-sponsored bodies but it will also be helpful to State-sponsored bodies. They will have an opportunity of channelling their views to Members of the Oireachtas.  I know many men and women of integrity employed in State-sponsored bodies and they are doing everything they can to keep costs down and to improve the board or body where they work in the best possible way.  It is not easy to do so at times.  This committee will give an opportunity to the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to meet the executives of these boards and of getting information.  When the executives meet with members of the committee <Col N="667" /> they can put forward their views and recommendations and if necessary they should be allowed to find fault with the activities of this House in relation to legislation passed which affects their board.  I see no reason why this should not be allowed if the criticism is sincere and constructive. It would be quite in order for such senior people to make this type of comment.</P>
    <P>This motion is a beginning and it is an indication of Government thinking which has also been reflected in the legislation that has been passed in this House since this Government took office in 1973.  We have dealt with all aspects of public life.  I take little notice of the bluffing statement made by Deputy Brennan in the concluding part of his statement when he was hopeful that he would be back again on this side of the House to rectify all the ills that have beset the country in the past few years.  Taking everything into account, particularly this motion, the Government are looking forward and this motion is trying to ensure that State-sponsored bodies will work more efficiently than they are at present and where there are doubts about their efficiency steps will be taken to rectify any deficiencies within the bodies.  No matter from what aspect one views this measure, it is sound and it is in line with the measures brought before this House by this Government since 1973 and I have no doubt that it will be acclaimed generally by all the people throughout the country, almost all of whom have an interest in the workings of our State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in almost universal agreement with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.  I note the Parliamentary Secretary's real concern to ensure that State-sponsored bodies will be seen to be publicly responsible in so far as we in this House as representatives of the people can be the agents in that responsibility. There was concern that in the past they may not have been as responsible as the public would have wished them to be.  For that reason <Col N="668" /> all of us welcome the move towards accountability to us of semi-State bodies and, more importantly, through us to the public.</P>
      <P>Before one can think in terms of the accountability of any State body one must establish what is their role, their place and their function in relation to the national aim in the economic area.  I would have hoped that in an innovation of this sort the Minister responsible, who also happens to be the Minister responsible for the Public Service, would have given us some indication of the role he sees for these State bodies in the economic development of the country.  One must recognise that it is not possible to scrutinise the role of any of these bodies without first being made aware of how that role fits into the overall economic plan in whatever area it is charged to operate.</P>
      <P>In this area lies the first weakness in the Minister's approach to this generally laudable legislation.  I should have thought that he would have given an outline of the functions and obligations of these bodies in the economic planning for the future.  I have no wish to be unkind, much less to be cynical, in this regard.  Perhaps it is understandable that the Minister did not enlighten us in regard to the role he sees for these organisations since the Government have not given us an outline or a programme of what they intend their own economic direction to be.  There can be no full definition of the role of these State organisations without there being also a clear definition of economic policy. Whether we are talking about State organisations that are promotional or those that are commercial, the most important question should be that of the Government's economic plan and philosophy.  The question of the role of the Government is a very important argument.  Should it be, as the Labour Party have been advocating, the promotion of national development agencies, or is it to be an entirely free enterprise, as Fine Gael ask for?  Until this question is decided there can be no clear decision how these State bodies should operate.  In other words, the basic premise of the argument is missing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> A reply to this question is long overdue, but perhaps the Minister will supply the information when he is replying to the debate.  As both he and the first speaker to the motion from this side of the House have said, these bodies welcome the introduction of the committee we are setting up, subject to some of the reservations I shall refer to later.  They would welcome even more some directions to which they could respond in the same way as the public would welcome targets or challenges to which they could respond but there can be no response either from the public or from semi-State institutions in the absence of such targets.  The person charged with responsibility in this area, the Minister for Finance, has not given us any guidelines.</P>
    <P>There is no point in endeavouring to claim credit for the introduction of the various semi-State bodies.  I expect that for each claim for the credit for a successful body there could be also the responsibility on either side of the House for having set up bodies which, although not without some success, have been costly.  However, I think it can be said of the fifties and sixties that the State bodies under Fianna Fáil played a major role in the economic development programme of those decades. One recalls that many of their executives identified with the type of confident economic thinking personified by the late Seán Lemass.  I shall not refer to names in regard to these executives but these names are well known in the various areas in which these people operated.  There was the &ldquo;get up and do things for yourself&rdquo; attitude of the Government in those days and the semi-State bodies responded to that challenge as did the private sector.  Shannon is a very good example of what I am talking of. These semi-State bodies literally changed the face of the areas with which they were most directly converned. This was to the economic and social advantage of these areas.  To that extent they identified with a co-ordination and a partnership that redounded to the public good.  Unfortunately we have had no plan for economic development during the past <Col N="670" /> three years.  In those circumstances how can we criticise Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus or any of the other bodies mentioned here in regard to the discharging of their functions?  They have not been given any guideline as to what their position is or as to what it is to be during the coming ten years. These bodies are entitled to ask what is expected of them.  But to the extent that there is no plan for economic development this exercise may be very much of less use than it might otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>In so far as the legislation represents a degree of accountability to this House it is welcome.  Equally, it must be recognised that to render the accountability effective there would need to be also a reappraisal of the role of this House, of its Members and of their capacity to deal with such heavy responsibility.  To illustrate what I have in mind, as I was coming here to contribute to this debate I was approached by the secretary of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and asked to go along immediately to a meeting of that committee which was about to begin.  Those of us who in one sense are privileged to serve on committees of that type&mdash;the burden of so serving seems to rest on the same minority of members&mdash;find that such membership involves much time, study, research and analysis.  We must realise that many of us by reason of our professional, business or personal backgrounds have not the capacity to be experts in all the areas with which we are asked to deal, but membership of these committees requires a readiness at least to study and analyse detail.  The amount of data coming before us for examination is increasing daily.  Documentation from the EEC is an example of this.  We have many committees in operation and we can expect to have more in the future.  We are lucky in regard to the committee I have just referred to because we have the back-up service of a dedicated and expert staff but the problem is that we are a relatively small House compared with, say, the House of Commons or the US Congress.  Although their responsibilities are greater, there are more people <Col N="671" /> among whom to share responsibilities in these parliaments or legislatures than we have here, of necessity.  I think this will involve a complete reassessment of the function of the Deputy and that the Deputy himself will have to reassess his functions to some extent. Perhaps the public will have to recognise also that it is time that they should analyse the function of the Deputy in a more detailed way and also his responsibilities and obligations &mdash;and I might include remuneration &mdash;by comparison with those that apply in other sectors.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable that there are many people employed in other sectors of the community, including the semi-State bodies, who could not and would not be in a position to accept the reduction in income that becoming a Member of the House would involve.  I do not say that we who are here now are not being paid enough, that we personally want more.  But perhaps one should have a good look at the role of this House, the status and significance it represents, so that those who are best equipped will be here discharging these very heavy responsibilities and so that nobody can say: &ldquo;It would be too costly for me to transfer from a semi-State body and offer myself for election to Dáil Éireann.  I would lose too much for myself and my family&rdquo;. That has happened and is happening. It is regrettable.  I do not say these people are being paid too much where they are, but perhaps somebody should analyse the consequences of the financial relativities in this Parliament and these bodies and see what the effect is on public service generally.</P>
    <P>We must always recognise that Deputies have constituency responsibilities. We have the primary responsibility to be answerable to the immediate needs of those who elected us. We cannot tell them at the end of a week: &ldquo;I had no time to inquire about your problem.&rdquo;  They will not believe or accept that, and they are right.  If we wish to discharge our responsibilities as Deputies we need&mdash; and this is much more important than <Col N="672" /> financial reward&mdash;secretarial facilities of a type we have not even begun to provide.  I do not blame the present Minister; I think both sides of the House have been responsible but some Deputies find themselves in positions that would not be tolerated in any concern, semi-State or otherwise, outside this House, where three of us are thrown together in one room with nobody to answer a telephone.</P>
    <P>If somebody rings for me in my room while I am speaking here now he will get no reply.  That could not be tolerated in any other sector.  If we are to discharge these new responsibilities, as we are all anxious to do, at least we are entitled to the same secretarial services and research facilities that are available in the semi-State sector, the private sector and every other sector.  If, on occasion, I answer the phone for Deputy Brennan with whom I share the room and say he is not here at present, I may be asked; &ldquo;Could I speak to his secretary?&rdquo; My answer must be: &ldquo;We do not have secretaries here.&rdquo; This is a terrible admission of lack of respect for our function&mdash;not for ourselves.  I hope the present proposal will bring about an analysis of how we can discharge our functions and what services we need.</P>
    <P>While we serve on these committees, who will answer our phones, deal with our correspondence and do the things the public are entitled to ask to have done?  If these facilities are not provided, a Deputy would have to be very unselfish to say: &ldquo;I shall ignore my constituency and serve the national interest on this committee.&rdquo; That is asking a lot when he knows he will be blamed at the end of the week for not making inquiries about this, that or the other as he has been asked to do.  Both tasks must be discharged.  There is a second general responsibility, as the Minister concerned has a dual capacity, I think that on both sides of the House we must take a new look at the way we work in this House, the facilities we have, so that what we can do we shall do well and so that nobody will be neglected because we are otherwise engaged.  This is much more important than the remuneration we receive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> I turn now to the third point, the broad principle involved here, the selection of the bodies concerned. Even if Deputies were only to deal in detail with the bodies listed here along with some others on which I shall comment, it would involve very detailed study.  If we do not do this in this sphere of responsibility the last state will be worse than the first because, if what the Minister proposes turned out to be nothing more than a facade of public accountability, where overworked Deputies with lack of normal secretarial facilities to do their job were presenting themselves on this committee asking questions they had no chance to research, looking at accounts they had no opportunity to study, the position would be worse than it is now.  The public would apparently be asked to believe that there was accountability to this House through us when the reality would be that we had neither the time, capacity nor perhaps energy to do all these things.  We should have the time, capacity and energy to do these things and we can only do them if given every proper facility to attend to all our responsibilities.</P>
    <P>We all know there is a great temptation sometimes to absent oneself from the Chamber&mdash;some people think there is nothing happening except for those of us who are here while others are serving in committee and in various other ways. That is where the immediate return comes, not here in the House discharging one's fundamental responsibility. I do not want that tendency increased.  It is vitally important that the whole structure, programme and procedure for the operation of this new committee should be established on a regular basis and that while Deputies will be serving on it, their other obligations will not suffer.  The Minister should ensure that those who are ready to serve will not be asked to serve at the price of neglecting other responsibilities.  That can only be done by ensuring that the assistance that is available outside in the public and private sectors will be available here also.  We must have people to answer phones, type letters <Col N="674" /> and make inquiries in matters of pressing personal interest.  If we end up with a committee which appears to involve public accountability but in fact, does not, such a facade would do no service to what the Minister wants to achieve, no service in the semi-State sector and&mdash;most important&mdash;no service to the public that all of us are charged to serve.  I hope we shall not have a facade, that all of us, particularly the Minister who has the greatest responsibility, will ensure that it cannot be such and will insist that whatever the cost&mdash;it will not be very great&mdash;we get every facility necessary to guarantee proper and effective functioning and questioning and exchanges of views such as must arise with this committee.  These are three points of fundamental principle that I want to make before we analyse the bodies themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to make a fourth point which relates as much to the bodies not on this list as to those that are on it.  It is one that has been raised by other speakers before and the Minister must have considered it. The Minister says he has confined our consideration of semi-State bodies to trading or commercial State-sponsored bodies and generally he has excluded promotional State-sponsored bodies. In his very brief explanation as to why he excluded the latter and included the former he says that the latter, being the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, are in many ways similar to the executive branches of Government except that they have a larger degree of operating freedom. There is a problem in relation to their responsibility to the Oireachtas, but at this stage it seems the solution may lie in a redefinition of their relationship to the Minister.  As far as I can see, that is the extent of the Minister's justification for the exclusion of these bodies.  I accept that he is genuine and concerned when he says, perhaps, the solution may well lie in a redefinition of their relationship to the Minister. They all have relationship to the Minister including those ones that are here.  He did not go into it in any further deatil.  Perhaps he did not think it appropriate.  Perhaps he <Col N="675" /> thought: &ldquo;I am not going to be critical of that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They all have this responsibility to Minister but the difference between the ones we are now being allowed to examine and the ones we are not being allowed to examine is that those we are being allowed to examine have to produce annual accounts of profit and loss, showing where they made and where they lost.  They are engaged in the business of production and, as with any other company so engaged, anyone looking at their reports can see they made this much from this operation and lost that much on that operation.  Therefore, there is a problem somewhere, in sales, marketing, programming of one form or another, or in the general administration, if the loss is too significant at the end of the year.  That is the test that these bodies we are being allowed to consider in Committee have to fulfil, the test simply of profitability.</P>
    <P>We may suffer the frustration that the Parliamentary Secretary has obviously suffered, that is the frustration, when you ask about the why or wherefore, of being told that it is a matter for the semi-State body and the Minister cannot intervene.  Allowing for that, at least the accounts and the profitability of such bodies as CIE, Aer Lingus and Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann&mdash;and they are all engaged in some form of production&mdash;are there to be seen like those of any other body and to the extent that the public can see and criticise them and make suggestions in one way or another to the public press.  To that extent those bodies are already accountable to public reaction if not to public scrutiny. They must be sensitive to the public reaction to their accountability.  Many of them, perhaps, are unduly sensitive, but where those we are including here have their annual balance sheets the other ones&mdash;and there are quite a lot of them, Bord Fáilte, the IDA, SFADCo, all of the promotional bodies &mdash;have no annual balance sheets to present.  They do not have to say: &ldquo;We made this money, we lost this much, we spent this and there is the balance at the end of the year.&rdquo;  They <Col N="676" /> are promotional bodies and, therefore, we can judge them only by the success or otherwise of their promotions.</P>
    <P>How do we know whether the money that was voted to them in this House was spent to the best advantage? How can we check, if they are now going to be excluded, on whether or not they have grown too big, have mushroomed and become too comfortable or too fat?  Some of them might have been lean, hungry and determined when established ten or 15 years ago and they have now become comfortable and fat.  We do not know at the moment and, unfortunately, in view of their exclusion now, we cannot know in the future.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary expressed, perhaps, even deeper reservations than I would.  I do not want to be taken as criticising any of these bodies.  Some of them, IDA, SFADCo and others, are charged with industrial promotion, a very specific responsibility. Industries or executives in industries who may have been established with the support, encouragement and guarantees or loan assistance of IDA or SFADCo have found themselves in the last few years in very severe financial stringency.  Where in the private sector which may have been promoted by the IDA or SFADCo there may be redundancies, these redundancies, breezes and draughts that have blown like a gale through the private sector have not been reflected in the semi-State sector.  There have not been redundancies in AnCO or SFADCo.  I am not saying there should be.  These are only two examples.  I am saying that the industries which may operate under their aegis have had to suffer redundancies. Perhaps this highlights the need to have a look at the role and function they have and at least to ensure that everything is as tight as possible and the economies are applied to the best advantage within these bodies in the same way and with the same tests as in the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is important that, from the point of view of getting an identity in the private sector with the national programming, the public sector at any level, State or semi-State, should not <Col N="677" /> look on themselves as being immune from the breezes or influences, or even viruses if one likes to call them such, that have been attacking the private sector very vigorously over the last three or four years.  If they do we are getting an imbalance in our society which is improper and will not do anything to arouse the kind of confidence we need on an overall general basis.  For that reason I believe it is vitally important that these promotional bodies particularly should be subject to scrutiny here in this House as to their operation, accounts and expenditure, particularly their expenditure.  I am not criticising any of these bodies because they have not had redundancies.  There have been suggestions from time to time that some of the expenditure of some State bodies in their promotions have been rather freely applied.  It has not begun even under the present Government. It has been a matter of some public comment.  For the health of the bodies themselves it can be important that somebody could check or be seen to check on the expenditure of these promotional bodies to ensure that, either by way of travelling expenses or various entertainment or other allowances, there was a tight discipline being applied.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  I travelled as a Minister on one occasion to a function outside this country.  Also travelling on that occasion were representatives of State bodies.  I was travelling in an official capacity doing a special job, as were they also.  The luxury in which those gentlemen spent the few days outside the country by comparison with the relatively parsimonius comforts that I as a Minister had, although I was quite comfortably provided for, struck me as very strange.  There was an imbalance somewhere.  I cannot see that that degree of expenditure could be so casually undertaken.  It is part of a pattern where we are properly accountable here, as I am sure the Minister wishes it to be, to the public sector and where we should be severely scrutinised wherever we travel and have occasion to travel.  I would expect that there should be the same <Col N="678" /> level of accountability and stringency in the public or semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>May I give another example which will highlight the need to include promotional bodies here?  The Minister may know that I have the unenviable distinction of having the shortest period in office of any Minister since the State was established.  I hope to rectify that soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy crossing the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I will cross the House very shortly.  As the Minister crosses this way I will go over there and a lot sooner than he expects.</P>
      <P>The Minister must know that there are more State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of the Department of Transport and Power than of any other Department.  When I was Minister for Transport and Power it became very clear to me that there are not always identities of interest between the State bodies under that Department. Deputy Brennan referred to one such body and I want to highlight it by practical illustration.  I want to tell the House of a clash of interests between Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus wanted to ensure that they would be the instrument of carrying people to this country and thereby guaranteeing their profitability. Bord Fáilte wanted to get people here from every source and felt Aer Lingus were not capable on their own of discharging that responsibility.  I felt that the only way I could get a real appreciation of the differences between them was not to see the executives and directors separately but to see them together.  I have never had a more heated but at the same time more informative meeting that I had on that occasion.  I learned more from them than I could ever have learned had I interviewed them separately. Both men were quite properly zealous, if not jealous, of their own interests.  Each was concerned for his place in the national plan.  Neither was as concerned for the other's place in the national plan as he should have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Aer Lingus are on this list and <Col N="679" /> if an examination of their functions arises in relation to their promotional activities or the number of passengers they will carry to develop tourism, and if there is a clash of interest&mdash; and I believe there is a healthy difference between these two bodies&mdash; how can they be resolved if the committee do not have Bord Fáilte before them?  Aer Lingus could say that they could not operate more profitably because they had to compete on the Atlantic or European routes which should be exclusive to them. They could also claim that another reason was that they had to compete subject to IATA, when they might have been better off working outside the IATA umbrella.  These arguments might be valid for Aer Lingus, but the consequence of accepting them might be that fewer tourists would come to Ireland.  Bord Fáilte would have something to say about that.</P>
    <P>The committee should have the right to summon the executives of both bodies to scrutinise the effectiveness of the programming of the body under consideration.  I cannot see how the committee could properly examine one body without having the right to examine the other.  They should be able to say to the executive of Bord Fáilte &ldquo;If we take certain decisions about Aer Lingus, how will they effect you?&rdquo; That seems to me to be a matter of fundamental common sense.  From my limited experience I do not see how the committee could take an effective decision on Aer Lingus without consulting other bodies such as Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>When one talks in terms of promotional activities, there is a great need to ensure co-ordination of marketing and promotional activity abroad.  The CTT are doing a very good job for the development of Irish exports.  On the other hand, Bord Fáilte may be doing another job in another area, and Aer Lingus may have somebody else doing yet another job.  We have an obligation to coordinate all these promotional and marketing efforts to the best effect and at the least cost.  We have seen different State bodies promoting products <Col N="680" /> in the same region.  In such a case, joint promotion probably would have yielded a better result at less cost.  This area of sales promotional activities should be examined very closely and analysed very deeply to ensure that necessary economies are made and that money is being spent to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking us to cut back and be less selfish, but he is not getting the response he wants for the reasons I have already stated.  Everybody, including semi-State bodies, should be conscious of their obligations, reanalyse their functions and take another look at their expenditure. If I were given a choice I would opt to have promotional bodies included in this list rather than the trading and commercial State-sponsored bodies.  The latter will be accountable because they must produce a balance sheet at the end of the year.  I should like the Minister to consider that point.  My only worry is how we would deal with them here?</P>
    <P>Some of those companies were established 40 years ago, others 30 years ago, but most within the last 20 years.  Each year there is a need to redefine their roles and functions having regard to the direction of the national plan, which is not apparent at the moment.  These companies cannot fulfil their obligations until the national plan is published when we will all know where we are going in the economic area and can respond to the challenges which the Government are charged to meet.</P>
    <P>Each year the role of these bodies will change.  The role of Fóir Teoranta will change.  The IDA are not mentioned on the list here but we must consider whether we have been giving too much money towards the capital cost of equipment.  Perhaps we should consider the employment potential rather than the cost of new installations.  We should relate our grants to the employment potential of companies rather than to the capital costs of their equipment.  Each year the role of the semi-State bodies will continue to change and for that reason we should have a flexible, well-researched service in this new committee to ensure that we can discharge <Col N="681" /> our responsibilities, having regard to the new priorities.  These bodies are entitled to know what is expected of them and what part they have to play.  The Government must present a plan in order that they can respond.  I want to remind the Minister that during the sixties when there was a plan they did respond.  When there is no plan, they do like the rest&mdash;they simply react.  They might even become selfish and the Minister seems to believe that the public have become selfish recently.  They have no challenge, no national concept to which they can respond.</P>
    <P>I will give another example with regard to the co-ordination of the efforts of these bodies.  AnCO are doing a fine job in the training area, backed by funds from the European Community.  We have been reminded very often by the Minister of the external factors which have caused our economic problems, but we overlook the external factors which are providing so much for us in this country.  We have had £110 million net by way of grants from the European Community in the FEOGA section alone.  A little bit of national honesty would serve us very well in this area.  Equally, AnCO are being consistently backed by funds from the European social programme.  The sum is in the order of £3 million.  This has enabled them to carry on very important training programmes.</P>
    <P>I believe that if we are to launch training programmes we have a responsibility to our own community and to the European Community to provide jobs at the end of the line when the training programmes have been concluded.  AnCO may be using this money to good effect but we must ensure that there are jobs available for the young people who have completed training courses.  That is very obviously not happening.  We can all give examples of boys and girls going back within a few months to repeat courses with AnCO at State or European expense because there are no employment outlets for them.  AnCO are establishing themselves throughout the country and there are dedicated men and women ready to serve and advise people on job opportunities, <Col N="682" /> but these opportunities are simply not there.  We have to ask ourselves what is happening to the people who are being trained.</P>
    <P>We are going round in circles because there is no co-ordination between the various bodies concerned. We must look at the role and function of these bodies and their policies if we are to do anything effective and I certainly endorse our spokesman on this.  I hope the Minister will give us a comprehensive statement on the role of the semi-State body, of the commercial body, the trading body, the promotional body and the co-ordination which should exist between them. He must know this and he should be able to say how AnCO can coordinate with the IDA or with CTT or any other semi-State body.  There must be co-rdination and we must know whether it is going to be done through him or through this committee. We do not discharge our responsibility simply by trusting them. We must question, analyse and then give support and I think it is fair to say that the semi-State bodies welcome this accountability because it will enable them to justify themselves in a way not previously possible.  To that extent I welcome this proposal of the Minister because it will lead to a healthy reaction all round, provided that we have the capacity and the facility to discharge the responsibility which he propses to give us, even in a limited area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the question of publication of proceedings.  I recognise that it could be detrimental to the financial position of some of these bodies to have their trading positions fully disclosed, but nevertheless I feel that an all-party committee of this House could and must be trusted with the responsibility of not undermining the position of these bodies during their deliberations.  If we are not capable, as representatives of the people, of trust and discretion we should not be operating here.  For that reason I feel that the Minister should not just vindicate the role of these bodies but the role of the House and should give what our spokesman on Finance, Deputy Colley, has asked for, namely, the right to <Col N="683" /> examine the policies and the role and function of the semi-State bodies. Above all else, the Minister should trust us to decide, on request from these bodies, what information should be publicly available.  If he does not, we will seem to be less responsible than we should be and the people will have less respect than they should have.  The Minister should recognise that and I hope that this will develop into a much more comprehensive exercise in the years to come, provided he adopts the recommendations which have been made by many people on this side and not least by the Parliamentary Secretary who spoke before me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which this motion has been debated.  I think that there is no substantial area of disagreement. The main criticism seems to be directed at the fact that we have not brought within the ambit of the bodies to be examined by the committee a number of semi-State bodies which are not either trading or commercial bodies but have some other function, like the promotional function referred to by Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat now what I said at the beginning.  I said a start has to be made sometime and our motion covering 25 semi-State companies covers 90 per cent of the employees in the semi-State sector, so it cannot be said that we are making a small beginning.  We are making a very substantial start in allowing Parliament to review the operations of some semi-State bodies.  We have brought the major ones within the jurisdiction of this committee, major in the impact they have on the lives of the people, major in the amount of public moneys they involve and major in the number of employees they have.  They include bodies like CIE, Aer Lingus and Bord na Móna.  Were the committee to do no more than look at the operations of these bodies for a start I am certain they would probably have sufficient work to engage their attention for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The lifetime of this Parliament by law expires in March, 1978, and the bodies in the schedule to this motion are incapable of being fully examined during the lifetime of the present Dáil. I believe, however, that the experience gained in the course of examining the reports and the overall operational results of these companies will enable all of us to take a better and a clearer view in future of what would be the appropriate area of future work and the way in which we should go about that work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley, Deputy de Valera and others asked what is the status of this committee.  In what particular category of Committees of Parliament does it fall?  They drew attention to the fact that this committee will be a joint committee of both Houses unlike some committees which are confined to a particular House.  The closest parallel would be, I think, with the Committee on Secondary Legislation. That exists under an <i>ad hoc</i> resolution of this House, a resolution similar to this resolution.  When the committee on the consolidation of Bills was first set up it was established under a similar resolution and under a similar procedure.  After both Houses had had experience of the working of that committee the procedure was introduced into Standing Orders.  I would visualise that, after some years' experience of the operations of this committee, Standing Orders being amended to provide for this committee on a permanent basis.  At the moment its life stems from the passage of this resolution today and its future existence will depend on future resolutions until such time as Standing Orders are amended.  I anticipate there will be an amendment of Standing Orders in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean existing Standing Orders would not apply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Existing Standing Orders have a number of provisions relevant to the working of this committee.  For instance, Standing Orders contain provision for the establishment of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking in terms of a joint committee of both Houses and whether Standing Orders apply to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they do but I am not speaking <i>ex cathedra</i> on that. I think there are Standing Orders governing procedures of Joint committees, but no procedure will work without co-operation and I anticipate there will be a concensus on this committee as to the best way in which to go about the work.  If Standing Orders are silent as to the working of joint committees, obviously we will need to get the co-operation of Members of the other House in working out acceptable procedures and the probability is this could not be done without years of experience of the operation of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera laid, I think, too much stress upon the financial responsibility of the committee.  I am not for one moment taking away from its financial responsibility but he seemed to cloak this committee with precisely the same garments as are worn by the public accounts committee.  That is a wrong assessment of the situation.  It is certainly not the way I see it.  The Committee of Public Accounts have no responsibility at all in the area of policy; they may not even review policy.  Their function is to satisfy themselves that the moneys voted by this House have been spent in the proper manner.  We are going further in this new committee. We are allowing them to examine reports, and as we know, reports of trading and commercial bodies frequently cover matters other than the trading accounts and the profit and loss accounts of the concerns in question. We are going beyond the reports and accounts and allowing the committee to examine the overall operations and the results.  Examining these will inevitably involve a study of policy, albeit past policy, but one cannot debate the results of past policy without forming a view as to whether or not the continuation of such a policy would be proper in the future. If criticisms arise and are published in the reports of the committee in regard to the operations and results of <Col N="686" /> past policies, they will undoubtedly help the Government, in the first instance, and both Houses of the Oireachtas after that, to formulate better policies for the future.</P>
    <P>In our democratic system in which Government is responsible for the running of the country and Ministers are responsible for the various bodies under their Departments it is proper that future policy should be determined by the Government of the day. But Government in a democracy must take account of views and criticisms uttered outside Parliament or by parliamentarians themselves.  I anticipate that the better understanding of the workings of semi-State bodies and an examination of the results achieved by them in the committee will improve decision-making at all levels of Government and in semi-State bodies themselves in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley, Deputy Halligan, Deputy O'Kennedy and others argued in favour of including bodies like Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the Industrial Development Authority into this.  I was, in fact, specifically asked to include these and asked why they were not being brought in.  They are not brought in for the simple reason that there will be more than enough to do in the schedule available for consideration in the lifetime of this Parliament.  We are dealing with bodies which obtain most or a substantial part of their revenue from the sale of goods and services.  Bodies like CTT, the IDA and SFADCo are not in receipt of the greater part of their funds from the sale of goods and services.  They are helping our economy to be more efficient and achieve greater growth, provide better services and so on, and they obtain most of their funds as a direct subvention from the Exchequer.  I agree with Deputies who have expressed a desire that such bodies should be examined by a committee of the Oireachtas and I would look forward to the day when such examination would take place.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies were quite rightly concerned about the immense weight of work which lies on their <Col N="687" /> shoulders and they feel a certain frustration and dissatisfaction with present procedures and systems which do not enable them efficiently to discharge their functions.  They felt that perhaps we were asking a limited number of Deputies to do too much. I can sympathise with that point of view having served on both sides of this House to the best of my ability. I understand the pressures and I do not willingly add to any of them but I know that conscientious Deputies will happily bear the additional responsibilities entrusted to them by a motion such as this and by any extension of responsibility which the Dáil may vote in future years.</P>
    <P>So far as the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Finance are concerned, we will do all we can to make available to the committee an adequate secretariat so that the members will be able to get a great deal of the analysis done for them to enable them to concentrate on what could be called policy matters.  They will be able to take broad decisions based on the analyses prepared for them.  However, if it is to be a Parliamentary Committee it must be operated mainly by parliamentarians who must do their own thinking and an amount of research themselves so that they may pose the questions which activate them and others and which often find expression in the form of public criticism or protest of one form or another.</P>
    <P>It may be that in the course of time the secretariat may have to be enlarged but it would be wrong to create a new secretarial empire to serve this committee.  That could lead to a situation where the work would be done by one group of bureaucrats looking over the shoulders of others.  Here we want the parliamentary view, the view of Members of this House who have been sent here to serve the interests of their constituents.  That must be the force and influence that has most impact on the working of the committee and on the semi-State bodies themselves. It can best be achieved by providing an adequate secretariat and I do not anticipate any great difficulty in reaching <Col N="688" /> agreement on the numbers, status and skill of the personnel involved in serving the committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked if meetings would be public or private.  This will be a matter for the committee to decide. The Dáil Standing Orders provide that the committee may decide such matters.  If it is to work effectively, if it is to get the greatest possible amount of information and co-operation from the semi-State bodies, it will probably work in private, just as the Committee of Public Accounts operate.  However, this will not prevent the committee from issuing a report disclosing information it considers of material public interest, subject to the obligation to maintain confidentiality in relation to information it would be necessary to keep secret in order to prevent damage being done to the commercial interests of any State body.  That safeguard must be retained for the public good.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made here that the public good would require the fullest possible disclosure of information and it was suggested we should not impose an obligation to maintain confidentiality.  I can understand the thinking behind that view but I would ask Members who advanced that argument to appreciate the need to preserve the public good and to ensure that semi-State bodies operating in the trading and commercial sectors are not subjected to any inhibition that would not apply to the private sector.  It arises out of the need to ensure that they will not be put at any disadvantage compared with competitors in the private sector, either in Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that the obligation to preserve confidentiality will create any real problems.  If members of the committee consider that information given to them with a plea of confidentiality is deserving of publication and that it can be published without harming the body in question, I feel certain they would undoubtedly respect the obligation to preserve confidentiality, in the presentation of their report to both Houses of the Oireachtas they would express their concern that information was given <Col N="689" /> to them with the plea of confidentiality but which the members themselves considered should be published in the public interest.  The knowledge that such a comment could be made in the annual report will lead to a situation where the representatives of semi-State bodies will not lightly plead confidentiality in relation to information. I anticipate there will be little or no difficulty between members of the committee and representatives of semi-State bodies who may furnish information to them.</P>
    <P>The points I have dealt with were raised by several Deputies in the course of the debate and there is no need for me to return in detail to the several well-considered and well-presented problems put forward by many Deputies.  However, I should like to refer briefly to some criticisms offered today about Gaeltarra Éireann. One Deputy rightly said that the problems of Gaeltarra Éireann are not new, that they have been recited in this House for decades past.  It would be very wrong if, as a consequence of anything said today by the Opposition, the view should go out that Gaeltarra Éireann are not a sound and well-run organisation.</P>
    <P>Gaeltarra Éireann have eliminated many of the practices that were a cause of justified criticism in the past. In the past three years they have had a record of very substantial progress. It is always undesirable to relate individual cases as though they gave the overall picture.  The few cases given today bear no relationship to the overall performance of Gaeltarra Éireann.  They gave a very unfair picture and a totally unbalanced view.</P>
    <P>I should like to put some point on the credit side.  Since 1973 Gaeltarra Éireann have turned their knitwear and tweed divisions, which had traditionally been in the loss-making sector, into a profit-making operation. For instance, in 1975 it produced a profit of £30,000; this year the profit on those divisions is £120,000 and next year it is estimated that the profit in this sector will be £250,000.  That is quite a significant improvement. Total employment in Gaeltarra Éireann increased from 1,800 at the beginning of 1973 to 3,300 at present. <Col N="690" /> This reflects the tremendous amount of restructuring and reorganisation that has taken place in Gaeltarra Éireann and in activities promoted by them.  One of the most significant aspects has been that their whole structure has changed from being primarily a trading and commercial body with substantial losses into being a promotional organisation encouraging private interests to establish themselves in the Gaeltacht area.  Today only a small proportion of their annual income comes from activities in the trading and commercial area.  As I said earlier today, I accept the need to respond to public anxiety which has been expressed in the past about Gaeltarra Éireann, some of which was reflected in the contributions by Members here today.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, disposed to amend the motion to provide that the committee may study the trading and commercial activities of Gaeltarra Éireann. I am doing that by putting in a second Schedule which will refer to Gaeltarra Éireann and by amending the substantive motion by providing that it is the trading and commercial activities of Gaeltarra Éireann only which will be examined.  The day may well come when this committee or some other committee of the Oireachtas will examine the non-trading and commercial bodies and the State promotion bodies.  Whenever that occurs one can then put in the non-trading and non-commercial activities of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I hoped to have the appropriate amendments typed but I gather there was some misunderstanding or some breakdown in communications. The result is that I have not got the actual text typed and this may create some difficulty.</P>

      <P>I have.  I have some textural amendments I want to make to the motion to incorporate ideas which I think may be agreed on either side of the House.  The real problem that arises, as I see it, is that the Seanad will be asked to approve a motion in similar form.  If we do not <Col N="691" /> pass this motion today in the form in which I present it to the Seanad the Seanad will ultimately pass a motion in a form different from that passed by the Dáil today.  I would then have to return to the Dáil to rescind the Dáil's previous resolution and, hopefully, adopt the resolution which would be passed in the Seanad.  On the other hand, if the House agree today to making the amendments which I will suggest orally we could then pass a motion today which could then be reflected in identical terms in the Seanad.  I have a copy of the motion, as amended.  I could hand it to the Chair and I could also explain it to Deputy Colley as I go along.  I am sorry this has happened.  The way in which I would approach the problem is this: Paragraph (1) would be amended in the following manner:</P>

      <P>Before the Minister gives details of it could I be permitted to make a very brief point which I believe is relevant to what he is saying? Am I right in thinking that the Minister proposes to amend the motion in order to provide another Schedule which would contain the references to Gaeltarra Éireann and the motion itself would contain references to both trading and commercial activities and non-commercial activities as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Paragraph (1) will be amended by providing that the committee will examine the trading and/or commercial activities and the reports and accounts and the overall operational results of the body referred to in Schedule B thereto.  In Schedule B we would have Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it being done that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Deputy will see that the original motion authorises the examination of the reports and accounts and the overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies which are described as engaged in trading or commercial activities being the bodies being set out in the First Schedule.  It does not say &ldquo;shall examine the trading or commercial activities of those bodies&rdquo;. I want to provide that in relation to Gaeltarra Éireann it is only the trading and commercial activities of that body which fall for examination.  All the activities of the bodies in the First Schedule are trading and commercial and there is no need to put in the limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really the point <Col N="693" /> I wanted to put to the Minister.  It appears that it might simplify the amendment very greatly as well as which I believe the Minister would not be doing any great damage to the concept he has in regard to this, if he were simply to add &ldquo;Gaeltarra Éireann&rdquo; to the existing Schedule.  I agree that thereby he would seem to be opening up all the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann to examination, which is not what he intends to do.  I want to urge him to reconsider that. I do not believe there is any great loss involved particularly, as he said, he visualises in due course other bodies, which are not engaged in commercial activities, being added to the surveillance of this committee.  Would he not consider adding the whole of the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann and thereby, hopefully, in addition to other benefits, simplify his amendment enormously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly simplify the presentation of the amendments today but it would mean that we would have the promotional activities carried on by Gaeltarra Éireann under this committee whereas the promotional activities carried on by the IDA, SFADCo and some other State agencies, such as Bord Fáilte and CTT would not come under the ambit of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We could start with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair, having regard to the fact that Gaeltarra Éireann could be in competition with the IDA and SFADCo&mdash;they are certainly carrying on the same kind of industrial activity&mdash;that one should have its activities in that area under the ambit of this committee and the other would not.  I assure the Deputy that the effect of my amendment is precisely that which Deputies today argued in favour of&mdash;to bring the trading and commercial activities of Gaeltarra Éireann within the ambit of this committee.  In my view it does it in a way which is fair to Gaeltarra Éireann and achieves the objective of Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the <Col N="694" /> Minister if the effect of the amendment he is proposing is that the companies with which Gaeltarra Éireann have investments will have their accounts examined by the committee or is he saying that only the accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann will be considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect will be that the accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann and of companies which are subsidiaries of Gaeltarra Éireann or in which Gaeltarra Éireann is the predominant shareholder, all of which accounts are at present examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, will fall for consideration by the committee. Gaeltarra Éireann have a number of minority holdings in private concerns and they will not fall for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the 1974 published accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann there are 49 companies in which Gaeltarra Éireann have a share holding. The percentage of that shareholding varies from 100 per cent to as little as 15 or 20 per cent.  What does the Minister mean when he says &ldquo;predominant shareholder&rdquo;?  This side of the House would like the amendment to cover all companies with whom Gaeltarra Éireann have a shareholding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the precise figures with me and I would not like to give any information which would not be entirely accurate.  The parallel is that the IDA have shareholdings in some concerns, Fóir Teoranta hold shares in concerns, and the accounts of those concerns and their activities do not fall for examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General; they are not public companies. Nobody would deem them to be public companies but a company wholly owned by a State concern&mdash; like Ostlanna Éireann&mdash;would fall for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean anything in excess of 50 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was using that as a descriptive term and I would not wish to be tied to any particular fraction. <Col N="695" /> As I speak I am not certain what companies under the auspices of Gaeltarra Éireann or which have been assisted by Gaeltarra Éireann have their accounts examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I take it that the wish of the House is that such companies as are public companies should fall for examination by the committee.  That is what we are endeavouring to achieve by the amendment without proposing to open up for examination by the committee the operations of private concerns in which Gaeltarra Éireann may have a small shareholding and which shareholdings interest has increased in recent years because Gaeltarra Éireann have been giving assistance more by way of equity rather than as an outright unconditional grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Minister's intention is that in any case where Gaeltarra Éireann have a controlling interest, either full ownership of the equity or at least a controlling interest, such companies would come within the ambit of this committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister does not want to be tied to more than 50 per cent but our understanding is that it is the Minister's intention that where there is a controlling interest by Gaeltarra Éireann that will come within the ambit of the committee. There are occasions where Gaeltarra Éireann start with 30 or 40 per cent interest and subsequently acquire, as part of a funding operation, more equity and would then go over the 50 per cent and have a controlling interest.  Is it the intention where that happens to bring that concern within the ambit of the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it could happen that way.  I do not want to issue statements here which might cause difficulty later on, which might be unhelpful to a firm which Gaeltarra Éireann might wish to help.  I suggest that my amendment is going a long way towards meeting the anxieties of Members.  I am not saying that <Col N="696" /> that is the last word on it but we are providing for a right to add bodies to the committee's responsibility later on. Having regard to the fact that we have only 14 or 15 months left in the lifetime of this Dáil, and therefore to operate the terms of this resolution, it will be more than enough to look at Gaeltarra Éireann and the other concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment, in my view, will have little effect in achieving the aim that our party had in mind in seeking to have Gaeltarra Éireann included in the Schedule.  If the Minister is only referring to companies in which Gaeltarra Éireann have a controlling interest he is excluding a very substantial proportion of the companies with whom Gaeltarra Éireann have involved themselves.  I had hoped that the Minister's amendment would include all companies in which Gaeltarra Éireann had taken shares.  I had inintended to try to convince the Minister to have these companies included by mentioning a company which to all intents and purposes is now defunct as an example of the type of business arrangement Gaeltarra Éireann entered into.  The company I had in mind had locations in Donegal and Spiddal where Gaeltarra Éireann entered into an arrangement with Solus Éireann Teoranta to form a new company called Soltoys, who took over the toy-making division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to obstruct the Deputy but it would be preferable if he did not mention the name of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are no longer in existence and therefore I am not interfering with their present or future trading prospects.  The thing failed. Solus Éireann Teoranta were given about 76 per cent of the shareholding in the company and their investment was £11,000.  The assets of the company were in excess of £500,000 and Gaeltarra Éireann subsequently paid in by way of a grant another £325,000 and did not make any arrangement to participate in the management of that company.  There was gross negligence and wastage of taxpayers' money, <Col N="697" /> voted by this House, in that case and I do not think Gaeltarra Éireann would deny that.  It was a bad decision. In such a case, where Gaeltarra Éireann only retained a 26 per cent shareholding, the Minister would be excluding consideration of that by the committee.  That is negativing the purpose of our amendment: that any of these deals should be considered by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be for the committee to decide whether we have empowered it to examine the trading and commercial activities of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I feel sure they will act in a responsible way.  It is the only way in which I can extend the resolution to bring in the kind of cases to which Deputy Molloy and others have referred.  Perhaps it does not bring in all cases, any more than we are bringing in IDA assisted companies.  We are dealing with 26 major companies and their activities which cover more than 90 per cent of the activities in the semi-State area.  It will be a tremendous committee if it gets even 10 per cent of that work done over the next 15 months which will be the lifetime of this committee.</P>
      <P>The sooner we start the better.  I would hope that, while it might not go all the way at the moment to satisfy Deputies opposite, they will see it is opening up to them an opportunity to explore the situation.  Further, there are 49 companies, as the Deputy said, listed in the 1974 annual report of Gaeltarra Éireann.  It would not be possible at this stage for me to list those which would or would not be within the ambit of the committee. Quite frankly, apart from making an assessment on the basis of those figures before me, the situation might have changed since 1974.  We are going a long way, and it ought to help.  Maybe it will cover the cases the Deputy has in mind.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>Might I qualify what I said in case anybody takes me up wrongly?  I said the company was defunct.  The arrangement entered into has been cancelled between Solus Éireann and Gaeltarra Éireann.  I think <Col N="698" /> there is a company called Soltoys operating in Donegal but the factory in Spiddal closed.  The arrangement with Solus Éireann ended.</P>

      <P>It is true, as the Minister indicated, that the amendment does not go as far as we would like it to go, but it is an advance on the complete exclusion of Gaeltarra Éireann.  To that extent we welcome it.  The physical difficulty in judging the exact effect of the amendment is such that I will take it on trust that what the Minister says it is doing is what it is doing.  On the basis of what the Minister said, while it does not go as far as we would like it to go, we welcome it because it is an advance on the original position.  It may be that, on a detailed examination of the amendment, we might have some questions but I am taking it on trust. On that basis, I am prepared to agree to the amendment.</P>

The next amendment I should like to make is one which also goes a long way to meet the objection which the Opposition recited to the right of the Minister for the Public Service to delete from the Schedule the name of any bodies which he considers no longer to be State-sponsored bodies.

That would mean no company could be deleted from the list unless the committee consented with the Minister that it should be deleted.  As I illustrated before, there has been such a case since the original motion was tabled. The Potato Marketing Board became a private co-operative and, not so long ago, Bord Bainne which was a State concern became a private concern. It is possible that the need will arise to eliminate a company and, rather than requiring a separate motion to be tabled here and in the Seanad, it is better that the consent of the committee should be obtained. I hope that will be acceptable to the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that five, including the chairman, should be members nominated by the Leader of the Opposition, there is procedural difficulty in accepting that.  There ain't no such creature as the Leader of the Opposition so far as our parliamentary rules are concerned.  Whatever about the position in this House, the Seanad is not supposed to have an Opposition at all.  Whatever resolution we pass here will have to be passed in identical terms in the Seanad, in order to allow the Seanad to be a party to the joint committee.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will recall I mentioned this previously.  I said that if this House and the other House are to have a number of committees it would be desirable that we should have the chairmanship rotating or distributed.  I would say the sensible thing is to have a provision that, if there is an equal number of committees in either House, the chairmanship should be divided equally between Government and Opposition and, if there is an unequal number of committees, the Opposition should have one more than the Government of the day.  That situation has to be looked at in the light of the existing committees we have here and in the other House.</P>
      <P>I would hope we would be able to reach an understanding, if not in relation to the setting up of this committee here and now or the chairmanship of it or other committees already in existence, at least as to what should be the position after future elections. On neither side of the House does anybody presume the political pendulum will stay where it is for ever.

However, mere comment upon past successes or failures or shortcomings or achievements would, I think, have a bearing upon decisions, either at Government or parliamentary level, on the operations of the companies.</P>
      <P>On the issue of confidentiality, I have already explained why I consider it necessary to keep a restriction there, because this is the best way of encouraging the semi-State bodies and their representatives to give the fullest information to the committee.  I was going to refer to Bord Gáis Éireann. Deputy O'Malley was quite right when he referred to the incorrect title of the concern in question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in both the original motion and Deputy Colley's <Col N="702" /> draft.  The provision in law is &ldquo;Bord Gáis Éireann&rdquo; and, therefore, if the House will agree, we will omit the word &ldquo;Teoranta&rdquo; in the amendment I have tabled.</P>
      <P>I have already explained the reason why I find at present an inability to accept either Bord na gCon or Bord na gCapall.  They are promotional organisations and they are not trading or commercial activities in the true sense.  Again, in the light of experience of the operation of the committee and when they have their existing workload under control, we may consider adding these or some other concerns. I would say we would be better able to form a mature judgment on that issue when we have had the experience of the workings of the committee over a couple of years. I hope that will help the House to form a view on the original resolution and the amendments which have been tabled to us.</P>
      <P>Briefly, I would just like to indicate that I would be unable to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2 in the name of Deputy Colley.  No. 3, I would respectfully suggest, has been met by the amendment which I have suggested requiring the consent of the committee to the deletion of any name. Amendment No. 4 I find difficult to accept for the reasons I stated in relation to confidentiality and amendment No. 4 (a) which I have tabled would be amended by the deletion of the word &ldquo;Teoranta&rdquo;.  I would suggest that that amendment of mine, together with the further amendment which includes the trading and commercial activities of Gaeltarra Éireann, goes a long way to meet amendment No. 5 of Deputy Colley which I would be unable to accept in its present form because it includes Bord na gCon and Bord na gCapall.</P>

      <P>I could hardly believe my ears when the Minister in his speech last night gave the impression that there was no problem of any great proportion regarding vandalism in the streets of our cities and in the country generally.  One could be forgiven if one felt that the Minister was completely unaware of the reality of the situation. However, the public outcry in relation to vandalism is enormous.  I am sorry that the Minister has not yet arrived, but perhaps, his advisers could inform him of my comments.  The &ldquo;Community Scope&rdquo; magazine of Lower Crumlin has an article which states that on Thursday 14th and 21st October two meetings of the Rathdrum Road residents were held in the senior citizens centre to discuss the problem of vandalism.  Thirty to 40 people attended those meetings including myself, an inspector of the Garda and the area youth officer.  As a result of those meetings a deputation was arranged to visit the Deputy Garda Commissioner on 1st November.  The deputation was received by the Deputy Commissioner along with the Chief Superintendent for the Dublin Metropolitan area.  He was co-operative, courteous and helpful, and assured us that an increase in the patrols in the area would be introduced and, as a result of that promise, patrols increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 9th November a question was directed from a backbench Member <Col N="706" /> of the Government side to the Minister for Justice in relation to the undermanned strength of Sundrive Road Garda station.  In the course of his reply the Minister said that it was contrary to established practice to give details of the arrangements made by the Garda authorities for the deployment of strength in an area.  The Minister also said that special patrols were being introduced to deal with the problem of vandalism in the Drimnagh area.  Sundrive Road would cover the Lower Crumlin and Drimnagh area.  What disturbs me is that, as the Minister for Finance who represents the area knows, the outcry about vandalism in the area is so bad that I am wondering if this question was not prompted by the Minister, because following that question the next evening's papers were pretty full of what was being done as a result of questions being put down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister denied that there was a problem of the extreme seriousness that we put before him last night.  How many deputations have requested meetings with the Minister, deputations from groups of citizens, the Dublin City Council or other county councils throughout the country, and how many of these deputations has the Minister received? Is it not a fact that every day requests come into the Minister's office from citizens concerned about vandalism? Last night the Minister pointed out that there had been a decrease in crimes against the person.  The Minister was talking about the rather large increase of 14.8 per cent, whereas the total crime rate has increased by 20.70 per cent.  Of course, as the Minister said, we can play around with figures as much as we like.  When the Minister refers to crimes against the person he is referring to 1,456 cases. There was a decrease of 253 attacks on persons.  When we are talking about the increase in the number of crimes, that is a total of 48,387, and <Col N="707" /> that was an increase of over 8,000 instances of crime.</P>
      <P>Will the 500 gardaí the Minister has assured us we will get be distributed throughout the country or be kept in Dublin?  If they are to be scattered throughout the country, they will not have any impact on the present crime rate in the city.  Recently I asked the city manager how much in malicious damage claims have been so far decreed by the courts in the current financial year which will fall to be met by the ratepayers in next year's rates, and the city manager replied that since the 1st January, 1976, £807,954 in respect of malicious injury claims have been decreed against Dublin Corporation.  Of this amount £191,000 was deemed to be caused by the use of explosives and could be attributed to the troubles in the North of Ireland.  If these decrees are certified by the chief superintendent of the Garda the amount involved would be recouped by the Exchequer.  Claims to the value of £600,000 in the city of Dublin alone from the 1st January to the end of September have come in. When the final figures are in, it will be well over £1 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins and Deputy O'Kennedy read extracts from the <i>Garda Review.</i> For the Minister's benefit I will read out some extracts from the November issue of the <i>Garda Review</i> which was issued today.  Their editorial states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the management consultants on the Garda Síochána should very soon, if not already, be in the possession of the Minister for Justice Mr. Cooney.  We do not know who else will receive the report. We do not know whom the powers that be consider entitled to read its contents and findings.  But we do know that up to the present moment none of the representative bodies has been officially appraised of its conclusions.  The first thing to be said about the report, therefore, is that it ought to be made immediately available to the various interested parties.  If it is to form the basis for the development of the Garda Síochána in the years ahead it must be a document which is <Col N="708" /> available for full and open assessment.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>We have pinned much hope on this report.  It is important to remind the authorities and the Minister for Justice in particular that they have promised much in consequence of this report.  Very many of the burning issues of the past two years have been put aside by the authorities and allowed to go aside by the bodies on the understanding that they would be regularised in the light of the consultants' report.  The quality and standard of personnel relations within the force, promotion and structuring of senior ranks, the proposals for the creation of a police authority&mdash;these are but a few of the basic and fundamental issues which now have to leap back from the filing shelves for attention.</P>
    <P>If the report referred to is available I would appeal to the Minister to release it to the interested parties and to our spokesman on Justice.  The Minister will appreciate that on every occasion that I have spoken here in the context of crime I have pleaded for the setting up of an intensive care unit to cater for the particularly bad type of vandal.  The courts can do nothing about these young offenders and the Garda know that it is a waste of time to arrest them, that when they are brought before the courts the report from the assessment centre will be to the effect that the offenders cannot be accommodated. Consequently, they would be released again on to the streets with no respect for or fear of authority.  It is time that the Minister thought of erecting whatever type of institution is necessary to cater for these people, an institution that would have a qualified staff.  I do not know what is the figure in respect of malicious damage claims for the entire country but in regard to this city we are talking of a figure in excess of £1 million for this year.</P>
    <P>One of the points I should like to impress strongly on the Minister is that because of the lack of enforcement by the Garda as a result of the many <Col N="709" /> problems with which they are faced the public are beginning to lose confidence in them.  Their problems relate to the cutback in overtime, to the fact that they are over-worked and have areas that are too large to cover with the numbers of men available.  If there is this loss of confidence in the Garda there will be an end to democracy as we know it because the Garda have always been respected and regarded as the guardians of the peace.  They are the protectors of the people.</P>
    <P>There is another item in this community magazine in which the young people who compiled the publication have this to say in relation to the problem of vandalism.  They are relating what one garda has had to say in this regard and I quote:</P>
    <P>We put it to the guard that one of the reasons for this violence was the absence of the man on the beat.  We asked them where they had gone.  He then said that the main reason for this was the New Relief Shift&mdash;introduced by the Dept. of Justice. Another reason was the Security Situation in Ireland, and the overall reason was that there just wasn't enough guards to go round.</P>
    <P>We know that to be the situation but while we are concerned about the overall security situation people are not safe to walk the streets of this city.  I wonder what would be the Minister's reaction on finding, after being away for a weekend, that vandals had entered his home and set it on fire.  Is he aware that when, for instance, windows are broken in a corporation house the tenant must pay for the repairs pending the decreeing of the malicious damage claim, a process which may take two or three years to complete?  The sense of a lack of adequate protection in regard to our citizens is undermining the very fabric of our society.  The Government by their foolish attempt to save money in this area are permitting the institutions of the State of which they are so quick to claim to be the protectors, to fall into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister told us that in raising these issues we were doing harm to the country, that we were creating a situation in which <Col N="710" /> people would be afraid to come here. Yet, as Deputy Collins asked also, was it not this Government who declared a state of emergency and who applied for a derogation from the European Convention on Human Rights?  The Minister for Foreign Affairs told us that that Act was merely technical but it will be interesting to hear the views of the European Convention on Human Rights when the matter comes before them for decision.  The Minister told us that the predicted increase in crime is only 2 per cent.  I do not know how one arrives at predictions of this nature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>A 22 per cent increase in the wave of crime compared with the figure for 1974 is much too high.  Of course the Minister is right in saying that our rate of detection is second to none.  That must be so having regard to the size and the geographical location of our country.  One cannot compare us with such countries as, for instance, the US, Canada, Germany or Belgium in which people can move into different territory by crossing borders. It is of little consolation to those people who are being persecuted to hear that our rate of detection is among the highest in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the day following Hallowe'en a constituent of mine contacted me by phone to tell me of an experience she had had the previous evening when a cider bottle was thrown through the windscreen of her car.  This woman's husband went out and took a garden rake with which he gave a few thumps to some of the culprits of whom there were about 20 in all.  The group then proceeded to throw bricks through the windows of the house knocking out every window.  The Garda were called but they found it difficult to identify these rogues because of the darkness. A couple of days later the owner of the house replaced the windows but the vandals returned and knocked them out again.  I wonder if the Minister is aware of what is going on or if he is so aware how can he tell us that the <Col N="711" /> situation is not as bad as we portray it? It is no exaggeration to say that people in this city are living in terror.  I have the utmost respect for the Garda who are trying so hard to fight against impossible odds but we must back them with the manpower that is necessary and with the overtime facilities that they require to carry out their duties. It is useless for a person to call a Garda station during the night to report a crime if there are only one or two men on duty there.  All these gardaí can do is to dial the emergency code and request that a patrol be sent from the radio centre to the scene of the trouble.</P>
    <P>In Dublin Corporation we are doing perhaps more than the Minister is doing in an effort to combat crime.  At least we are leaving the gates of our parks open at night so that gardaí can enter these places quickly to confront cider drinkers who apparently are the ones who cause much of the vandalism. I understand that they are quite mad after drinking cider.  In order to save gardaí the trouble of climbing over railings we leave the gates open.</P>
    <P>Countless calls for the fire brigade and the Garda were received on Hallowe'en because of bonfires.  Dublin Corporation considered the situation and said they would allocate sites where bonfires could be safely lit and this may well reduce calls of this kind. What I mean to convey is that in Dublin City Council we appear to be doing far more to combat crime. There is still a good relationship between the public and the Garda.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say if this is so: it has been said that the Garda Commissioner in going on what was called a whistle-stop tour of the country told gardaí that they should match their salaries with convictions. Is that true?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to my knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister says that is not true because it is something that seems to be gaining belief.  I sincerely hope it is not, but one has learned to query what the Minister said after his speech last <Col N="712" /> night.  Harassment of the public must be avoided at all costs but the Garda because of their limited number must be on patrol and on the beat in increasing numbers.  The figure for the present strength of the Sundrive Road station given in the Minister's reply on 9th November was 42.  The population of the Garda sub-district there is estimated at 49,000.  Actually, it is far more than that, I can assure the Minister.  When one allows for days off, sickness or anything else, this strength is totally inadequate, amounting to only a couple of gardaí available in any day, perhaps eight or nine &mdash;if that&mdash;to patrol an area.  I do not know the actual figures.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how many deputations the Minister has received, how many he has been asked to meet, how many times did the city council request a meeting and how many times he has been requested to increase the number of gardaí on the beat.  I feel that he is neglecting his responsibilities at the risk of destroying the very fabric of our society.</P>
      <P>We have appealed to the population to support the Garda.  There is no use in a garda going into an area if people do not support him.  Even in this magazine there is an appeal to the people to support the Garda.  The article ends by quoting a reply from a garda who was asked what the ordinary person in Crumlin could do to curb the violence in the area.  In his opinion, an increasing civic spirit would help greatly.  By this he meant that if you saw anything out of the ordinary that in your opinion could lead to an act of violence, or if you witnessed any crime you should stand up and have the courage to give evidence. Many people will not give evidence.  What good is it just to report a crime when the wrongdoer cannot be punished?  This magazine is published by people in their 'teens. The will to co-operate with the Garda is there.  We must not fail these people.  We have a responsibility to see that the Garda are upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reported when addressing the Rathdrum Residents' Association as asking for the co-operation of the people in actually helping the Garda <Col N="713" /> to make arrests if necessary when they saw a garda under attack.  Not long ago I thought I would have to come to the aid of a garda but he managed all right.  He was surrounded by people screaming hysterically.  I can understand the terror of a young garda on his own in such a situation not knowing who may hit him with a bottle or something.  It was with that in mind that I made this appeal.  The Government, and in particular the Minister for Justice, came under heavy attack for not providing enough gardaí in the area.  That attack was not from me but from the people.  The law of the country was also slated for not giving the citizens sufficient protection and offenders sufficient penalties.  This is the feeling of the people who see offenders brought to court and released without any penalty imposed.  Until the Minister wakes up to the fact that we need special institutions to take care of the particular type of offenders to whom I have referred we shall not see any improvement.</P>
    <P>I should like to finish by paying tribute to the Garda and noting something said in another page of the November <i>Review</i>, something that is quite right.  It relates to the drunken driver.  The article is headed &ldquo;The Peeler and the Goat&rdquo;.  It says:</P>
    <P>It's strange, isn't it?  Two or three deaths from drug abuse&mdash;in the sense that we use the term&mdash;and the papers are screaming.  Parents are protesting and TDs in the Dáil are demanding action.  But the weekly carnage on the roads where drunken drivers kill and maim is taken entirely for granted.  It's even more peculiar when one considers that drug addicts generally only kill themselves while drunken drivers take the lives and the limbs of whatever unfortunate innocents they happen to meet on the road.</P>
    <P>They also say that Irish attitudes to the drunken driver are nothing less than a national disgrace.  &ldquo;His crime is in some measure socially acceptable.&rdquo; I agree with that comment.</P>
    <P>They also criticise themselves.  They state: &ldquo;The Garda Síochána have a lot to answer for.  The drunken driver <Col N="714" /> operates with virtual impunity because he knows the laws are seldom enforced. If the gardaí wanted they could catch thousands of offenders&mdash;wouldbe killers&mdash;but they do not.  First they are afraid of the social consequences, that they will be in breach of the unwritten understanding that `people sometimes have a little more than they should'.  Fortunately, that attitude is dying out in the Garda but there is the much more serious one of lack of manpower and lack of man-hours on traffic control.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wish to support the Government amendment and, in effect, to oppose the motion in the name of Deputy Collins although I shall have occasion to recognise the relevance of part of the wording of that motion.  I was not able to be in the House yesterday when this matter was debated but I have read a transcript of the debate and I have also considered reports and comments on it.  I should like to mention one of these comments in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> by Mr. Bruce Arnold in which he makes the point that yesterday evening's debate was devoted to what he called simple, ugly, brutal crime and not to high-minded invective on subversion.  I see of course what he means, my having read Deputy Collins's contribution in particular.  Deputy Collins wished to concentrate the debate on what the motion calls the breakdown in law and order.  He wished to concentrate on the area of what one might call non-political crime, general crime, and of course that is an area which is very important indeed.  I am not minimising its importance in the least.  No Dublin Deputy, or indeed other Deputies, will do so and certainly no Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the present situation could do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins has the right and privilege to determine the emphasis of his own remarks.  I would like in my remarks here to do a little to correct that emphasis because I think that we cannot distinguish between simple, ugly, brutal crime and crime committed for subversive purposes or by members of a subversive organisation <Col N="715" /> for any purpose.  The murder of Garda Clerkin at Mountmellick we would all agree was a simple, ugly, brutal crime. It may well have been also a subversive crime.  Certainly no purpose of gain was to be achieved by the deliberate booby-trapping of a house in an attempt to murder people.  We have reason to believe from claims made that the murder of the British Ambassador was a subversive crime.  It was also a simple, ugly, brutal crime. The distinction cannot really be sustained. I am not suggesting that the particular commentator intends to make any distinction.  I imagine he does not, but the reader of the line might draw that inference from it and I would like to reject that point of view.</P>
    <P>One distinction between subversive crimes and other simple, ugly, brutal crimes is that in the case of the latter, the non-political ones, there is no tendency in society to condone. There is no tendency to idealise them. There is no tendency to minimise them.  But all those tendencies can be found when we come into the area of political crimes.  That is, however, a distinction in attitudes to crimes.  I think the Minister for Justice will agree that as regards the crimes themselves it is often impossible, at least pending the apprehension of the perpetrators, to determine whether they are subversive, allegedly political crimes or not.  For example, in an area which particularly concerns me there were 73 raids on post offices in 1973, 81 in 1974, 140 in 1975, and to date this year there have been about 110.  How many of those raids were committed by subversives?  How many by ordinary criminals, as it is said?  I think there is no definite way of knowing in most of the cases concerned. Similarly, in 1975, £94,000 in cash and £206,000 in stocks were taken from post offices.  How much of that money went to subversive organisations?  How much went into pockets of private individuals?  How much was shared out?  Of course in many cases the perpetrators have not been detected and therefore the Garda unfortunately do not have the information.  In some cases they may <Col N="716" /> have their suspicions and in other cases where people have been arrested it is possible to know.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that subject I would like to note again that the security situation in relation to post offices throughout the country gives me considerable concern as the responsible Minister in that area.  I have met a deputation from the Postmasters' Union; I have been concerned with the improvement of security arrangements at sub-post offices and with the provision of financial assistance to sub-postmasters to instal various security devices, which I obviously cannot discuss in any detail, in their premises and protective screens and so on at their counters.  I am, however, aware that there is no 100 per cent security under these conditions. I must say that, having visited a number of sub-post offices in the city and a few in the country also, I have the greatest admiration for postmasters and their staffs who are exposed to very considerable risks as the result of the criminal activities and the threat of criminal activities, subversive or otherwise.  It does not much matter to the people who may be attacked and whose staff and family may be attacked.</P>
    <P>There are other connections between subversive violence and other types of violence.  The glamorising of the gun which has accompanied at all times subversive violence perhaps in recent years also helps on various forms of armed violence, if only by giving people the idea; by showing them that they can perhaps get away with this sort of thing, that there is a lot of loot going around and other armed men are getting it, and why should not they for their purposes? That has an effect.  The enormous extra strain that armed subversive activities place on the Garda, on the Defence Forces and on the resources of the State is also relevant. Obviously, if there are fewer police available than we would like to deal with some categories of crime because those police have the task of defending the citizens from armed terrorists, then the other types of criminal will expect more scope and sometimes get it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> Deputies opposite have paid tribute to the security forces, and I recognise the sincerity of those who have spoken on that matter.  That sincerity I think is common to almost everybody in this House.  I would like to recognise in passing the international acclaim which the Garda won for their brilliant, patient, restrained and effective handling of the famous Herrema kidnapping, and to pay tribute also to what has perhaps been less recognised, the effectiveness of their police work in recovering a large body of incendiary bombs sufficient to destroy the whole of Dublin. The Minister for Justice said in his remarks and I quote:</P>
    <P>We live in a state of emergency as the result of the existence of a subversive organisation dedicated to the overthrow of the State, an organisation being fanned by the conflagration that is taking place in the other part of this island.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with that statement. Those activities are so fanned because the murderous activities in Northern Ireland get international publicity focused on them, and that publicity attracts money and that money strengthens the IRA not only in Northern Ireland but also here, unfortunately, in most cases.  More than that, not merely are this organisation's activities fanned by the conflagration in the North, but those activities are also fanning that conflagration in the hope and with the purpose of engulfing this whole island, bringing about an emergency and a breakdown in law and order on a scale not yet known.  They seek to use our territory both as a base for attacks on Northern Ireland and through these attacks, ultimately, at overthrowing democratic government in this State through creating chaos in this whole island.  I have no doubt that that is their strategy.</P>
    <P>I stress &ldquo;ultimately&rdquo; because they are a very long way from achieving that objective and we are not going to let them achieve it, but their thrust is that way.  In the meantime their criminal activities endanger and oppress ordinary citizens throughout <Col N="718" /> this country.  They endanger them directly by their armed robberies, arson, use of explosives and their willingness to murder&mdash;examples of all of which we have seen not merely in Northern Ireland but in this territory. They oppress them directly by seeking to spread an atmosphere of intimidation and also by obliging the State to spend large sums in combating terrorism, money that might otherwise be devoted to social and productive purposes and which also, as has been pointed out has relevance to the crime level.  They endanger our people indirectly in a host of ways, for example, by encouraging and emboldening ordinary criminals&mdash;I mean criminals with no political pretensions or pretexts&mdash;and simultaneously straining the resources of the police. At the same time, their activities in the North have the effect&mdash;and this is serious and may be serious in the future&mdash;of precipitating the so-called reprisals here by other equally criminal organisations of a different stripe based in Northern Ireland.  The horrible carnage in Dublin and Monaghan in May, 1974, may have been precipitated in that way.  Again, their activities shade off by degrees through real or pretended breakaway groups, through officially disavowed acts of violence and so on, into the world of all ordinary gangsterism.</P>
    <P>I repeat there is no clearcut line that can be drawn between these categories of violence and crime. When I say &ldquo;ordinary gangsterism&rdquo; I mean gangsterism without political pretentions or pretexts.  The non-political gangsters, who are neither better nor worse than the so-called political kind, benefit from the stimulation of their political colleagues, imitate their exploits, sometimes simulate their motivation and make use of the cover provided for them by the extra burden which the activities of subversive organisations place on the security forces.</P>
    <P>Contemplating this situation I can understand how words like &ldquo;breakdown in law and order&rdquo; as used in the motion might spring to the mind. I agree with the Minister for Justice that these words are not appropriate <Col N="719" /> to the present situation.  Nonetheless, they have a certain relevance to it.  I shall have a little more to say about that later when I come to consider those words more closely.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, in an able speech yesterday, made the point that if the rule of law was being maintained and upheld to the extent that the Minister asked us to express our satisfaction with it, surely that repudiates the case made by the Government in introducing the state of emergency? He said also that the Government could not have it both ways. That is a neat debating point and, like many neat debating points, it can quite easily be stood on its head.  If the Government cannot have it both ways neither can the Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is hard to see how they can say there is a breakdown in law and order but there is no state of emergency. Surely a breakdown in law and order, if it were there, would be one of the more serious emergencies that could possibly exist, probably the most serious emergency in the State.  There is no point quibbing.  There is a real difference in meaning between these contexts, a real meaning in intent. &ldquo;Breakdown&rdquo; suggests, and is meant to suggest, failure of those responsible to meet a situation.  &ldquo;State of emergency&rdquo; suggests a threat which the Government are determined to face. That recognition in the state of emergency is a real one.  The Opposition have the right to make their political point which is intended to stress failure.  The motion reads:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to deal effectively with the breakdown in law and order.</P>
    <P>In a way that is a rather courageous, perhaps even rash, motion for Fianna Fáil to put down.  It invites the question &ldquo;What breakdown in law and order and when did it occur?&rdquo; I shall try to answer that question.  I believe there was a very serious breakdown in law and order and that this Government are dealing effectively with the consequences of that breakdown.  When did that breakdown occur?  I think it <Col N="720" /> can be dated with precision&mdash;16th August, 1969.  On that date, according to the interim and final reports of the Committe of Public Accounts, Order of Dáil of 1st December, 1970, paragraph 20:</P>
    <P>The Government at a meeting on 16th August, 1969 decided that &ldquo;a sum of money&mdash;the amount and the channel of the disbursement of which would be determined by the Minister for Finance&mdash;should be made available from the Exchequer to provide aid for the victims of the current unrest in the Six Counties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How were those powers, conferred in this rather extraordinary and mysterious decision on the then Minister, used?  How was the money spent? Such part of the answer as is known is set out in paragraph 56 of the same report.</P>
    <P>Of the £105,766 spent, £29,166 was spent on relief of distress, £34,850 possibly spent in Belfast on undetermined purposes, £250 on purposes possibly related to the relief of distress, and £41,499 was not spent on the relief of distress.</P>
    <P>A possible clue to the moneys unaccounted for was supplied by Deputy Blaney, a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government at the material time, in this House on 1st December, 1972, when he said:</P>
    <P>Not only did circumstances bring the freedom fighters into existence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Freedom fighters&rdquo; is his term for the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;but so did the promised support of help not just by one but by a lot of other people as well.  The blame lies on me and a whole lot of others who helped to bring into existence shortly after, those who are now condemned as terrorists, murderers, the gunmen of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>There is the beginning of your breakdown in law and order, in the words of a former Minister in that Government.</P>
    <P>The funds which the then Government authorised the Minister for Finance to take and use for aid for the victims in Northern Ireland were <Col N="721" /> applied under his authority for some other purpose.  He has never explained what it was.  He has never explained what happened in that breakdown recorded here, one of the most serious breakdowns in law and order which has occurred in any western European State in recent decades.  Until he gives a satisfactory explanation the shadow of suspicion which Deputy Jack Lynch once noticed on Deputy Haughey still rests on him undiminished. The suspicion is the suspicion of helping to cause that breakdown, some of the results of which we are still coping with in that criminal background which we are discussing here, the suspicion of helping the Provisionals to get started.  These were the victims of unrest who got the taxpayers' money entrusted to him by that mysterious decision of August, 1969, and never properly accounted for or explained.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who has that on his record is now back on the front bench of the party who have now the audacity to put down a motion complaining about a breakdown in law and order.  A party with that Deputy on their front bench will never have credibility in the field of law and order as long as he remains there.  It will never deserve such credibility as long as he remains there.  A front bench with that Deputy on it is a security risk and I believe the country will tell that party so unmistakably in the next election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Collins's motion and in doing so I should like to refer to the report of the Garda Commissioner concerning crime in 1975.  He said that the overall crime picture could only be described as disturbing with substantial increases in crime, first noted in 1966, continuing, with the exception of 1973 when there was a small decrease.  He said criminals were becoming more vicious and mean.  Attacks on old and disabled people in their homes, a type of crime practically unknown here some years ago, he said, was now on the increase. The Commissioner said that the use of firearms and other offensive weapons in robberies was becoming <Col N="722" /> more widespread and menacing.  The Minister must have known of this situation for some time but what has he done about it?  The situation is appalling.  There were 23 murders, eight attempted murders, four manslaughters and 153 armed and attempted robberies but what have the Government done about them?  They have done nothing.</P>
      <P>We have listened to a lot of baloney from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but he has not told us what the Government have done.  It is unfortunate that this appalling situation has to be brought to the attention of the House by our spokesman.  Our people have been subjected to that type of violence and institutional violence because of the inability of the State to take remedial measures to combat the distressing situation.  The Minister told us that 500 extra gardaí will be recruited but it is a long time since this situation first came to light. We have often heard that the suspect is handcuffed but in this case it is the Garda who have been handcuffed. They are unable to do their duty because of the situation in relation to overtime.  The public are calling for more gardaí on the beat.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the terrible tragedies that have occurred.  Having read the Commissioner's report I have come to the conclusion that some of these statements are erroneous, they do not convey a true picture of the situation.  In relation to sexual offences and rape the report records a very small number but we all know that people are being raped in this city, and throughout the country, in large numbers.  They are afraid to report it on most occasions and in other instances they are unable to report because of the lack of Garda.  There are other matters which are not covered in detail in the report.  The only offences recorded are those reported to the few gardaí on duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large scale unemployment that exists is responsible for much of the unrest.  People are doing things they would not normally divert their attention to.  As soon as the Government do something to divert the minds of individuals to work we will <Col N="723" /> have fewer offences committed.  If the Government are concerned about crime and its prevention they should do something concrete to relieve the unemployment situation.  The Garda Síochána are doing their duties under difficult circumstances but they are impeded by the Department.  They are unable to put the time needed in the detection of crime into their work because of the overtime situation. The decision of the Government to cut back expenditure put the country at risk.  The Minister should wake up and take note of what the Commissioner has said.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done to remedy this situation.  The promises given are not good enough.  While it is necessary to continue to patrol Border areas the Minister should also consider that as a result of those patrols our cities and large towns are left without adequate police protection.  Why should people be held up to ransom or put at risk by the Minister or the Commissioner in the distribution of the force?  If gardaí are moved out of the cities and towns to the Border areas then the people in those centres of population are put at risk.  That situation can only be improved by increasing the number of gardaí.</P>
    <P>The situation at Sundrive Road Garda station was mentioned by Deputy Briscoe.  When this matter was raised recently the Minister told us that there was 42 gardaí there to look after 49,000 people.  Those gardaí work three eight-hour shifts and that breaks down to 14 gardaí per duty but gardaí do not work a seven-day week, they work a five-day week with the result that at any time in that area there are less than 14 gardaí on duty, possibly nine.  Of that number some gardaí have to attend court, others are on office duty and others are investigating crime.  How many gardaí are on the beat in the Sundrive Road area at any time protecting the 49,000 people?</P>
    <P>I have attended meetings in that area in relation to vandalism and the development of crime.  Superintendents and inspectors are sympathetic. They know the problem.  They see it <Col N="724" /> growing.  They are anxious to help but they are handicapped by the Government and the Minister. The Government should make more money available to enable Garda patrols to operate.  That would result in a reduction in the crime rate.  A better solution would be to provide employment to enable people to direct their energies in a disciplined way.</P>
    <P>I know the appalling situation that exists only too well.  There are parts of this city through which people are afraid to travel even in broad daylight because of their fear of being robbed. The Minister and the Garda are aware of this appalling situation. What will be done about it?  It is no use O'Brien talking the nonsense he did here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not be allowed to get away with referring to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;all right.  The Government have collective responsibility and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs shares that responsibility as does the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Labour and the Taoiseach.  All are collectively responsible for running down this vital force. We demand that something be done immediately.  It is no good promising something will be done in future. Something must be done now.  The people must be protected.  They must be enabled to move freely where they wish without fear of molestation.  At the moment freedom of movement is curtailed because of lack of police protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another big problem is drinking on the part of youths.  The situation is a grave one.  There are no police to check these youths.  The problem must be tackled urgently.  Deputy Briscoe mentioned the cider drinkers who have no difficulty getting &ldquo;Johnny Jump Up&rdquo; in the supermarkets. These youths use tablets with the cider to get high and they practically turn into drug addicts.  They are a <Col N="725" /> menace to society and nothing is being done about this menace.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ensure people are protected.  Parents are afraid to let their sons and daughters out after dark in parts of this city.  It is no good recruiting 500 men and dispersing them throughout the country.  We want adequate protection in Dublin and we want it now.  If more men are needed elsewhere, then put them elsewhere, but do not leave this city and other cities denuded of gardaí.  That only leads to an increase in crime.</P>
    <P>We know the age groups and the crimes.  The major increase in crime is in the age group 17 to 21.  Over 21 there is also an increase in crime. These are the age groups demanding special attention.  The gardaí take the names of children kicking football in the streets.  Their energies should be directed into dealing with people causing major disturbances and committing crimes of violence.  The larceny of motor cars has become very fashionable judging by the figures.  It is a very serious situation because these drivers are neither taxed nor insured.  Property cannot be left unattended for one moment.</P>
    <P>We demand action now.  The Commissioner tells us in the report that he is seriously concerned about the situation.  Are the Minister and the Government seriously concerned? They do not seem to be.  Wake up.  It will be too late tomorrow.  Wait until a couple of State cars are stolen.  Then they will wake up.  If the situation is not rectified immediately it will be too late.  Every individual is at risk at the moment because of the failure by the Government to take the necessary remedial measures to protect the public.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the men and women in Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Inchicore who are afraid to let their children out after dark.  In these long winter evenings they are virtually prisoners in their own homes.  Let us get back to normality so that people can safely walk the streets of this city after dark.</P>
    <P>In this particular situation, and I would say this is the norm in this city and elsewhere, you have approximately <Col N="726" /> nine gardaí and 49,000 people. Those nine gardaí have a multiplicity of duties.  They are doing a great job in difficult circumstances.  But what can nine gardaí do in an area like this?  Some are engaged in office work, some investigating, some preparing cases and some on duty elsewhere.  This very small section is doing a marvellous job.  The Garda are criticised unfairly. Any fault there is lies with the Minister.  The Minister knows people have gone to police stations asking for protection to enable them to drive their cars through certain areas.  This is fact.</P>
    <P>It is no good the Minister wailing like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. We are not concerned with what happened away back in 1937 or 1969 or in the Stone Age.  We are concerned with the present and the future.  If proper steps are taken now these problems can be solved.  The sophisticated equipment needed for the detection of crime or for its prevention will cost money.  Let the Government and the Minister make that money available now, thereby protecting our citizens against rape and robbery and so on.  Public co-operation is needed.  How often do we hear the Garda ask for public co-operation. Why do the public not co-operate? Because they are intimidated.  There is no protection against intimidation. If people go to the barracks they find the station cannot send a man out. Must they go to a Garda station and then find that there is not a garda available to investigate a situation? The problem here is that there are not sufficient gardaí available.  Every Friday night there is a series of robberies and attacks on people.  Bus drivers refuse to take buses into certain areas because they cannot get protection.  We must protect the public and the institutions and organisations that are prepared to do their job.</P>
    <P>All of us are conscious of the problems in the Dublin city area. Deputy Briscoe and others have mentioned them.  In putting down this motion, our spokesman on Justice has done a great service to the community and if the Minister is <Col N="727" /> open-minded about the situation perhaps it will do a service to him also and to the Government.  What we want is action to cope with the problem at the moment and to meet the appalling situation the Garda Commissioner indicated in his 1975 report, which has just come to hand.  This report has been in the hands of Deputies for a few days only but the Minister had the information for some time.  He was aware of the growing crime rate, he knew which areas were involved and he knew the age groups concerned.  The Garda should be allowed to divert their energies into the real areas that matter.  Let us leave aside the petty and minor items for the moment and examine the serious situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion.  I have received a large number of complaints about the lack of police patrolling in my constituency. There is no substitute for the man on the beat.  What people in the city and in the suburbs want is the reassuring presence of the gardaí in their areas.  Traders, business people and ordinary citizens are living in fear and if the Minister, as a result of this debate, does something about the matter it will be much appreciated by these people.  Despite the promises of a law and order Government there is no law and order in this city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first debate we have had on law and order in the last six years and it is worth noting that it has been debated for only three hours.  Many Members of my party wished to contribute to the debate.  They had important things to say but, because of the time limit, they were unable to do so.  It is interesting to note that no back-bencher from the Labour Party or from Fine Gael participated in the debate.  For the record, I would point out that there was no Labour back-bencher present during the entire course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with some of the points made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs before I start my reply proper to the Minister for <Col N="728" /> Justice.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that the Labour Party Conference finished in Limerick last Sunday and he should have wound down by now. I suggest to him in all humility that his attacks on individual Members of this House, and his attack this evening on Deputy Haughey, was uncalled for and was unwarranted.  If the Minister wishes again to test the credibility of Deputy Haughey, let him make an issue of it as he did in the last general election in the constituency he shared then with Deputy Haughey.  Let the people there decide, as they did last time in a two or a three to one majority in favour of Deputy Haughey.  I have no doubt that Deputy Haughey can well and truly look after himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gave figures this evening of the number of raids on Post Office vans and on post offices for 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976.  In 1973 there were 73 raids, 81 in 1974, 140 in 1975 and 110 so far this year.  I would ask the Minister how many of these vans were guarded?  How many drivers had to travel lonely country roads at 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock each morning, completely open to the gangster and the gunman who had them at their mercy to relieve them of large amounts of money if they so desired? Did the Minister make the case to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, for armed protection for these vans? If he did make the case, he did not get that protection.  It he had got it perhaps the number would not be as staggeringly high as it has been.</P>
    <P>The same publicity should have been given to the amounts of money taken in these raids for subversive purposes as was given to the trip to America by the Taoiseach last March when he urged the Americans to stop sending money to the IRA.  We all agreed with him on that.  We want to stop their source of income but let us be honest about it.  Let us make a decent start at home.  I hope the Minister will be honest with us this evening, that he will tell us that the Cork train that was robbed of nearly £500,000 was not guarded.  That train <Col N="729" /> was not guarded.  Armed guards had been on that train and on other mail trains up to the time the Minister, at the behest of the Government, withdrew the gardaí because they refused to pay them overtime.  That is the truth and it cannot be denied. Security must come under scrutiny if we are to know exactly what it means and what it is worth.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister referred to an extremely important matter.  He referred to the possibility of a referendum to try to remedy the situation which exists at the present time with regard to bail.  We know that many people who are out on bail commit crime after crime because they believe from their experience that they will get the same sentence when they come before the court for their just deserts. The Minister mentioned the referendum. I hope the Government have made a decision on this matter.  I hope the Minister is more serious about this than when he promised to recruit the additional 500 gardaí last June.</P>
    <P>I hope he will introduce immediately the legislation which is necessary to hold a referendum.  If we are to have a six-month delay, as we had in the recruitment of the 500 gardaí we need so badly, then I say to the Minister, if the legal position which existed with regard to bail before the Supreme Court case in 1966 could be restored, it might be satisfactory.  It was satisfactory prior to the 1966 court case.  Perhaps the Supreme Court might have another look at the matter because since their decision in 1966 circumstances have changed and there might be no need for a referendum.</P>
    <P>I believe the Supreme Court have already decided that they can reverse their decision on particular points of law and that they can modify the judgment on the question of bail.  The Minister might do something positive about speeding up the courts.  The backlog could be dealt with much quicker if he and the Government were serious about doing something about it.  I am speaking personally at this stage because my party have not had an opportunity of discussing the <Col N="730" /> matter fully.  In the absence of any concrete proposals I cannot see general agreement being given to the Minister or the Government on the general restriction of bail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that is not proposed.  The Minister will note that I have been extremely careful in my choice of words.  I said: &ldquo;in the absence of any concrete proposals&rdquo;. I checked through what the Minister said last night in the unedited version of the Official Report hoping that I might learn more of what he has in mind.  In the meantime why not have more judges, and more courts if he is intersted in dealing with the backlog and in seeing that those out on bail get their just rewards?</P>
      <P>The Minister last night went to great pains deriding my contribution to this debate.  He greatly disappointed me.  We hoped, in having a mature debate on the question of the breakdown of law and order, that we could enlighten the Minister.  We hoped we would strengthen his hand in his capacity as Minister for Justice so that when he went to the Government and sat down with his colleagues he would have a stronger case to make to restore police work to what it was prior to the Government decision of August, 1975 when they cut back considerably on the amount of money available to the Garda Síochána to do their policing.</P>
      <P>The Minister accused me of many things last night.  I accept these accusations but I reject the truth of them because I told him not what I believe but what the Garda believe.  I quoted from the editorial of the June <i>Garda Review,</i> a magazine produced by the Garda.  I said that the Garda say they are being strangled financially by the Government.  I also said that the Garda and the Garda Representative Body say that the squad cars are grounded instead of patrolling.  There is nobody to drive them because the Minister and the Government are saying that they cannot pay them, or, worse still, they will not pay them. The public know this is true.  I sincerely hope the Minister knows this is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> There is no question, as Deputy Dowling said, of proper police work. The man on the beat, whom we all knew was so effective, is not there any more.  If he is there it is only to maintain appearances in a slipshod manner. We gave the Minister the case of Sundrive Road Garda station where there are 42 gardaí and officers for 49,000 people, which is 14 officers and men for eight hours a day if they are allowed to work a seven-day week. They are not allowed do that because they would not be paid.  Many of them would probably work for nothing if they were allowed.  There are only seven or eight officers and men to look after 49,000 people fulltime.  The Minister may sit, close his eyes and smile at me and say that I am deliberately creating a situation which might cause panic.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will hear far better tonight than he did last night.  I say to him, now that I am sure I have his attention; &ldquo;Put the squad cars back on the beat, allow beat tolerance to continue, let gardaí have the back-up service they need if they are to detect crime and deal with criminals&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister if what Deputy Briscoe said is true, that each garda must report to his superintendent by the fourth day of every month the number of cases he has taken to court and prosecuted? If a direction has gone to the Garda that every garda must have five cases a week and if we are depending on the general public to co-operate with the Garda does the Minister believe it is proper, particularly in rural Ireland, in towns of 2,000 and 3,000 people, where there might be five or ten gardaí that 25 people must be in court every week, 100 a month or 1,200 a year?</P>
      <P>The Minister is going the wrong way about it if he wants co-operation.  He should face up to the fact that he is completely falling down in his job with regard to policing Dublin city and rural Ireland.  He should do something about it while he has the chance. If he cannot he should leave office and there will be plenty to do something which should have been done long ago.</P>
