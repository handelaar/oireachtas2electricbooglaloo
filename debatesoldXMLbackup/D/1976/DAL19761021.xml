      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Taoiseach to request the Minister for Defence to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with regret that I move this motion.  I regret that the occasion has arisen at all.  I regret that the Minister himself has not seen the gravity of the offence in such a way that he would tender his resignation.  I also regret <Col N="156" /> the Taoiseach has similarly not seen the gravity of it in such a way as to demand the resignation of his Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no question here of a witch hunt.  There is no question of pursuing vindictive action against the Minister for Defence.  There is no question of the pursuit of any individual for party political gain.  I want to say specifically that there is no question of this party looking for its pound of flesh as was alleged in the leading article in one of our daily newspapers today, a newspaper apparently that does not see what has happened with the same sense of gravity and concern as its contemporaries do.</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister.  There is, as we all know, in the Irish character a propensity for sympathy for people who find themselves in difficulties or in trouble for one reason or another, and I share that characteristic in many respects. However, sympathy or sentiment can and should play no part in the exercise of one's duty where one's duty is seen to be clear, especially in a case like this. I would have hoped the Taoiseach would see the whole issue in this way and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is involved as detachedly and objectively as we can now at this remove, some three days away from the event.  The Minister for Defence, in an unscripted statement to members of the Defence Forces, at Columb Barracks, Mullingar, was reported to have said&mdash;and these reports were not denied&mdash;that the President of this country was a thundering disgrace. The reason he gave for coming to this extraordinary and deeply damaging conclusion in his statement, damaging not only to the President but to the institutions of the State, was that President Ó Dálaigh had referred a Bill passed by the two Houses of the Oireachtas to the Supreme Court under a provision of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>It was a statement of the greatest importance from a member of the Government, a Minister of State, reflecting on the integrity, the capacity and the constitutional status of the Head of the State from whom he, like <Col N="157" /> every one of his ministerial colleagues, received his seal of office.  It was a suggestion that in some way the President appointed under the Constitution and acting strictly within the terms of the Constitution was behaving in a disgraceful manner.  If some political outcast or some remote person were to make such a statement, one would perhaps understand if not forgive, but coming from a member of the Government, it is neither understandable nor forgiveable.</P>
    <P>A member of the Government deliberately insulted and assailed the President because he disagreed with the way in which the President conscientiously and properly exercised his functions in relation to a measure passed by this Parliament.  Incidentally, when that legislation was being debated here in the House, the Minister himself most arrogantly and undemocratically said that not one iota of that legislation would be changed no matter what this House or the other House thought.  Of course it was changed and changed to some advantage and in a democratic manner.</P>
    <P>Under Article 15.1 of our Constitution the President is one element of the Oireachtas, the other elements being the two Houses of the Oireachtas. Under Article 12 of the Constitution the President is charged specifically with upholding the Constitution. He is the prime guardian of the freedom and other guarantees to the citizens enshrined in that Constitution. He is the prime guardian of the institutions of the State which that Constitution provides, but next to him must come the Government who hold office under that Constitution as the guardian of the institutions of the state.  No other person or no other body has a higher duty in this respect than the Government collectively and in its individual membership.  Yet here we find a member of that Government attacking and insulting the President in language that would ill become any citizen much less a member of the Government, attacking the President because of the way he legitimately and constitutionally performed his functions.</P>
    <P>The Minister's remarks have been <Col N="158" /> referred to by some persons, who would wish us to forget completely that they were ever made, as a gaffe, or <i>faux-pas</i> or a clanger.  I am prepared to accept that it was any one of these or something else but whichever it was, it was a gross insult and, according to information available to me, it was premeditated, calculated and deliberate.  I believe also, as was said in the statement issued on behalf of this party immediately it became known, that it was compounded because of the location and of the people in whose presence it was delivered.</P>
    <P>Under Article 13.4 of the Constitution the President is the Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces. Deputy Donegan was assigned by the Taoiseach, approved by this House and appointed by the President to the office he now holds, that is chief political administrator and executive of the Defence Forces.  Therefore, the fact that the Minister chose this location&mdash;the military barracks in Mullingar&mdash;and his audience&mdash;members of the Defence Forces&mdash;makes his allegation, his insult, his damaging attack all the worse.  When I put it to the Taoiseach yesterday that the remark was, as I indicated in the question, a gross insult offered to the President and a grave reflection on his integrity, capacity and constitutional status as Head of the State, the Taoiseach denied that the remark could be given the particular construction that I had given it and concluded by saying that the Minister had offered &ldquo;a full and unreserved apology to the President&rdquo;&mdash;these were his exact words.</P>
    <P>We read in yesterday's newspapers that, the evening before, the Government spokesman&mdash;presumably the head of the Government Information Services or some official of that office &mdash;told correspondents that an apology had been sent to the President and, quoting his words again, &ldquo;that was the end of the matter so far as the Government were concerned&rdquo;.  If that were the end of the matter it would have shown on the part of the Government and certainly on the part of the Opposition a complete and utter rejection of responsibility, a dismissal <Col N="159" /> of our function as public representatives and as upholders of the institutions of the State.  Of course it could not be the end of the matter and the Taoiseach and the Government must have known that before they authorised their spokesman to say that it would be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>I am not aware&mdash;I did not inquire nor was I told&mdash;of the circumstances in which this apology was delivered. What I have heard and read in the news media is the only information I have, but one is entitled to question whether in fact it was, as the Taoiseach said, a full and unreserved apology.  When it was learned in Government Buildings on Monday and became known generally through the radio and television service that the Minister had made such a remark, a statement was issued by the Government Information Services on behalf of the Minister that the Minister would apologise &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;&mdash;again, as far as I can recollect, these are the exact words. This message was issued by the Government Information Services but one is entitled to question in the circumstances whether it was issued with the Minister's knowledge and authority at the time, and if it was, why did the Minister not there and then make his apology?  Is it not obvious what happened?  I do not have to test the mentality of any individual to come to his own conclusions on this particular issue. Whatever the manner of the apology or its delivery or its receipt, we have here one institution of State insulting and denigrating another, one element of the Oireachtas undermining another, and then we are told it is all over and that it should be forgotten because an apology has been offered. One might ask: can one institution of State apologise to another institution of State?</P>
    <P>I do not know what attitude the President has taken; I have not inquired and we have not been told.  He is a brilliant, scholarly, internationally-respected man and, as I said yesterday, a man of such calibre that we <Col N="160" /> can feel proud to have him as our President.  He is in fact a man who was elected President with the approval of all the political parties represented in the Oireachtas.  No matter how scholarly or how fitted by way of his dedication and integrity the President is for office he is intrinsically a humble man and I do not want to bring him in his personal capacity in any way into this debate except in his capacity as one of our principal institutions of State and one of the two elements in the Oireachtas, the other element being the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Whatever personal hurt the President may have felt, I believe he was aggrieved mainly if at all&mdash;and he must have been aggrieved &mdash;by the attack on the presidency, on the institution, on the office which he holds with distinction.</P>
    <P>In his official capacity the President is very much inhibited by the Constitution in any action he might wish to take in connection with this incident. Under Article 13.7 of the Constitution the President may communicate with or address the Houses of the Oireachtas and he also may, after consultation with the Council of State. address a message to the nation at any time on any such matter&mdash;and the matter on which he is entitled to communicate with the Oireachtas, address the Oireachtas or address a message to the nation must be a matter under Article 13.7.1º of national or public importance.  This is a matter of national and public importance and one on which the President might well feel motivated to address such a message.</P>
    <P>Under Article 13 every such message or address must have received the approval of the Government.  Therefore, if the President wished to address such a message to the Oireachtas or to the nation he would have to get the prior approval of the Government.  If the Government took the same view as the Taoiseach apparently has of the gravity of this matter, what chance would a statement of the President have of ever seeing the light of day? What chance would it have of getting the approval of the Government who, apparently having expressed approval <Col N="161" /> of the Minister's remarks, now condone his remarks to the extent that he had apologised.  How could he expect to get the approval of a statement from a Government who have treated the remarks of the Minister for Defence so lightly?</P>
    <P>There is another important reason that we on this side of the House take a most serious view of the insult offered to the President.  We, as every other citizen does, value our democracy. We seek to protect the institutions of our democratic system.  We ask the people we represent to respect and defend these institutions.  If we ourselves attack these institutions or permit attacks from among ourselves to be treated lightly, then we are undermining the very institutions of State that we exhort the people we represent to uphold and defend.  Are we not then undermining our democratic institutions?  Therefore, any attempt to do so by a Member of this House, especially a Member of the Government, can serve as a means of undermining our democracy.  Therefore, in defence of our institutions and democracy we must demand that the most serious from of censure should follow the attempt to so undermine our institutions.  The remarks of the Minister for Defence must be construed as such.  Failing to do this, we ourselves could be marking the beginning of the erosion of our democracy, the erosion of respect for the institutions of State leading to the undesirable consequences and the type of regimes that we see and abhor in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I have stated our case simply and, I hope, unemotionally.  I have given clear reasons for submitting this motion.  It is now clear that if the Taoiseach, who I know personally to be an upholder of our democratic institutions, wants to ensure that they be upheld by the Government which he heads, it is his duty to dismiss any member who, like the Minister for Defence, has assailed these institutions, if he himself has not submitted his resignation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter arose from a statement made by the Minister for defence On Monday evening <Col N="162" /> he issued a statement to the effect that he proposed to apologise as soon as possible.  The Minister offered to make an apology in person for his remarks.  The President was not available. In view of that the Minister had an apology delivered in writing which was full and unreserved. Yesterday, in the course of my reply to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition I said I regretted the slight on the President and that a full apology had been made.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition mentioned a few matters in the course of his remarks and it would be as well to put them into perspective.  The Minister for Defence did not attack our institutions.  He made what he and I regard as a serious comment on what the President did in a disrespectful way.  He immediately announced his intention of apologising for this comment and offered to do so personally. As the President was not available, the Minister made a full and unreserved written apology.  I regret that the Minister for Defence made any remark which slighted the President. The constitutional functions which the Leader of the Opposition referred to have not been brought into question. We know what these constitutional responsibilities and functions are.  It is in no sense a reflection on the discharge of these functions.  Indeed, it was mentioned that the Minister expressed his regret.  I have made it clear that I regret that any slight was intended.  Whilst I appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition said that he did not intend to indulge in a witchhunt, that he did not seek party gain, that he did not seek a pound of flesh, he had to do his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to realise the efficient way in which the Minister has built the strength of the Army to the highest possible level in personnel and equipment in peacetime.  That fact indicates not merely his dedication to strengthening one of the institutions of State to which, as I have often said, we are all trustees.  So far as this regrettable incident is concerned, the Minister immediately announced his intention of apologising.  It is not open to any interpretation other than the <Col N="163" /> one that has been given.  He offered to do it.  The President was not available and he then made a full written apology of an unreserved character. The extent of his apology demonstrates his regret.  His work as Minister indicates his dedication to maintaining the institutions of State.  I regret the slight and in the Minister's apology he expressed regret.  I repeated that yesterday and I do so again now. So far as that is concerned the apology has been full and unreserved and I do not accept any of the suggestions, implications or fears which the Leader of the Opposition has about undermining the institutions of State. The Minister has been energetic in maintaining them, defending them and building up the Defence Forces. While I appreciate that it is natural to expect that the Leader of the Opposition felt he had to do this, I believe the apology is both adequate, full and sincere.</P>

      <P>The Leader of our party has indicated the general concern in relation to this situation from the point of view of our party and I should like to add my voice to what has already been stated in relation to the widespread concern that has been shown in relation to the statement made by Mr. Donegan in Mullingar on Monday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If an Army officer, NCO or any member of the Defence Forces made the same statement in the hearing of the Press in the cookhouse at Mullingar barracks on Monday, I have no doubt that he would find himself speedily courtmartialled, punished by a long term of detention and expulsion from the Defence Forces.  However, the Minister on this occasion got a pardon from the Taoiseach. One can rightly ask if, under the Present Emergency legislation, an ordinary individual made a similar statement to what extent would there be a reaction to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To indicate the widespread concern about the Minister's remark I should <Col N="164" /> like to quote from a leading article in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Wednesday, 20th October, 1976.  The article puts the position in clear terms.  It states:</P>
    <P>At its mildest, the comment made by a Cabinet Minister about a personage who is not alone President of Ireland, but Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, was not alone a bad gaffe, but an offensive remark.  In other countries he would have paid for it more dearly.</P>
    <P>The nation was proud when President O'Dalaigh proved that his office was not just a rubber stamp by referring the &ldquo;State of Emergency&rdquo; legislation for the imprimatur or otherwise of the Supreme Court.  The court's decision helped to allay their fears.  That the President should be insulted by no less a person than the Minister for Defence is shocking and we hope that there will never be a repetition from anyone.</P>
    <P>That is a clear indication of the concern from that section of the community, the Press.  As we know, the President represents all the people of the nation before the world.  The widespread publicity in the national and foreign Press in relation to his position must compromise him in his external relations and in dealing with foreign personnel.</P>
    <P>The outburst of the Minister was cold, calculated and premeditated.  It was not just a throw-out but cold-blooded in every sense.  Reporters at the barracks were told that the Minister had something else to say other than what was contained in his script. It was not just an off-the-cuff remark; it was a cold and calculated attack on the office of President.  We must uphold the dignity of that office and the Leader of our party has clearly indicated the constitutional position and the problems that will emerge as a result of the undermining of that authority.  Was Mr. Donegan just echoing the comments he heard at Cabinet level and is now being covered up by the Taoiseach?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not just an isolated incident of indiscretion; it is one of a long litany of indiscretions each of which could have been deemed to be grounds for instant dismissal. However, the latest outburst transcends all former indiscretions. The Taoiseach is now under test as to whether he puts the nation and the Constitution before patronage.  I should now like to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of October 19th, 1976.  In the course of an article the political correspondent of that newspaper, Dick Walsh, referred to a statement made by Mr. Donegan and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the months ahead I will have to ask the Army to perform things which they will not like, but because of their tremendous loyalty the Army will go ahead and perform them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, too, was an unscripted remark and, like yesterday's statement, was disowned by the Government. A GIS statement said that no special significance was to be attached to it.  There was no change in the Government's policy on the use of the Army in support of the gardaí, nor was any change contemplated.</P>
      <P>That was in relation to a remark made just 12 months ago.  The correspondent went on:</P>
      <P>The Minister had already become known for his colourful, occasionally tactless remarks, ranging from the suggestion that &ldquo;a boot up the transom&rdquo; was sufficient punishment for the gun running ship, <i>Claudia,</i> to his view, much resented by the trade unionists, that the unemployed should join the Army.</P>
      <P>These may have been colourful, they are relatively harmless.  Now, the Minister has challenged the constitutional authority of the President and revealed what is generally accepted as the Government's resentment over the delay in the enactment of its emergency legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I would call into question the suitability of the Minister in his handling of Army promotions and his statement in relation to the 50 mile <Col N="166" /> fishing limit where he was compromising the situation of the nation.  At Mullingar also he made slighting remarks about the capabilities of the Garda Síochána and made reference to robots.  The placing of cash value on police is another indication of his complete irresponsibility.  Each of the Minister's indiscretions must be taken seriously now in the light of what he said at Mullingar.</P>
    <P>I speak for the ordinary citizen who may not be too familiar with protocol, constitutional procedures or understand the Constitution to any great degree.  However, they all understand and respect their family, their parents and &ldquo;law and order&rdquo;, a phrase much used nowadays.  It is beyond the comprehension of these citizens how a Minister would remain in office so long after such an attack.  I should like to quote from an article by Maurice Hickey and Colm Boland in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, 19th October:</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan already has issued a statement regretting what he said, but the Taoiseach and the Cabinet have to take account of public opinion and the general conduct of Ministers.</P>
    <P>That the President should be criticised in the way Mr. Donegan did yesterday is something that Mr. Cosgrave cannot possibly stand over.</P>
    <P>A leading article in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 19th October, gives a clearer indication of the widespread concern by responsible journalists and others in the community.  That article states:</P>
    <P>He was talking to Army personnel when he described their Commander-in-Chief as a &ldquo;thundering disgrace&rdquo; and no amount of apologising after the event is going to remove that statement from the record.  As a political gaffe and a piece of gross discourtesy, Mr. Donegan's remark yesterday must occupy an unparalleled place, and let us hope unchallenged, in the annals of Irish political discussion.</P>
    <P>Since by definition Mr. Donegan's post is probably the one most charged with upholding and maintaining <Col N="167" /> respect for our institutions of state, his attitude is deplorable, prompting speculation as to how many more of his Cabinet colleagues share his views over the President's decision to refer the matter of the Emergency Powers Bill to the Supreme Court.  But when one considers that he came out with such disruptive statements at a time of national crisis, then the dismay and confusion he caused become so much worse.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record part of the leading article of <i>The Irish Times</i> which sums up the situation:</P>
    <P>But his latest lapse is far out of the &ldquo;kick up the transom&rdquo; category. This time his words and their implications must be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>Whatever their private feelings may be, it is simply not open to Ministers to criticise publicly the action of the President or the Court in a constitutional manner and remain in office....  This raises a question of the utmost national importance: are his views shared by other members of the Government &mdash;above all, are they shared by the Taoiseach?</P>
    <P>The article concluded:</P>
    <P>The best way to make amends is by placing his resignation as Minister for Defence in the hands of the Taoiseach for submission to the President.</P>
    <P>That indicates a fairly wide volume of opinion as to the acceptability of Deputy Donegan for this post.  His indiscretions over a period have been many and varied and colourful language has been used.  But on this occasion he would appear to have the protection of the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>As I asked earlier, if a private soldier, NCO or officer made the same statement in Mullingar barracks in the hearing of the Minister, where would he be today?  He would not get a fool's pardon.  He would be charged and dealt with in accordance with military law.  A statement by a man <Col N="168" /> of the Minister's standing insulting the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in front of commissioned officers who got their seals of office from the President, must be seen as an attempt to undermine the confidence of serving personnel in their Commander-in-Chief.  This is an unforgivable offence.  It is not enough to say that it was an off-the-cuff or a throw-out remark.  It was cold and calculated, as I said earlier because the Press had been warned that the Minister had something else to say that was not in the circulated statement.</P>
    <P>This is not a witch hunt.  If the Government are displeased with the way the President is carrying out his duties there is an Article in the Constitution to deal with that.  Our leader stated that the President is a man of great ability.  Having listened to the comments made during the last few days I realised that there is a widespread concern for the President and his office.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, even at this late stage, will be man enough to spare the Taoiseach demanding his resignation.  He should be prepared to offer his resignation voluntarily because of this final serious blunder in a line of blunders he made in the past. I listened with interest to the Taoiseach's statement but I do not understand what he was trying to convey. He said nothing about the serious matter under discussion here today, except to cover up for the Minister and grant him another fool's pardon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had not been in this House since 10.30 this morning and seen and heard the Taoiseach's contribution to this debate in reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I do not think I would have believed it.  To put it mildly, it was no reply.  It was the most pathetic, half-hearted attempt to half disapprove of what the Minister for Defence said.  While I may deprecate the failure of the Taoiseach and his 14 colleagues to stand up and say that they totally disapprove of what was said and that they take no part in it, at the same time I appreciate the Taoiseach's difficulty in endeavouring to defend a situation which he now <Col N="169" /> knows is indefensible and which his contribution this morning proved patently to be indefensible.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence should have resigned before now but having failed to do so he should be requested to do so by the Taoiseach.  Neither of those things has happened.  There is still plenty of time for the Taoiseach to request that resignation before this debate concludes this afternoon.  It is patently obvious from what we have heard that resignation is now called for.  In the circumstances of what happened the duty in honour and integrity of the Minister for Defence was to resign voluntarily.  If that resignation did not take place voluntarily within a reasonable period, say 24 or 48 hours, it was equally the duty of the Taoiseach in honour and in integrity to ask for that resignation.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach cannot justify what was done.  Equally I say he cannot justify his refusal to follow the logical conclusion of the position in which he finds himself.  He cannot justify his refusal not to request the Minister's resignation.</P>
      <P>Under Article 13 of the Constitution the supreme command of the Defence Forces is vested in the President.  That is not just window-dressing for constitutional purposes.  It is in the Constitution for a very good reason.  It is there because the Army are at all times to be seen to be the instrument of all the people, and to defend all the people of this nation.  It is not in any sense a political tool or the plaything of any particular political group who at any given time happen to form the Government.  That is a constitutional and legal fact which is borne out by the terms of section 17 of the Defence Act, 1954, which sets out the chain of command on both the political and military levels in the Army.  That section commences with the words &ldquo;Under the direction of the President the following shall be the position&rdquo;, clearly recognising the supremacy of the President so far as the supreme command of the Defence Forces is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, therefore, the position that somebody who has a very important <Col N="170" /> function in relation to our Defence Forces, the Minister for Defence, makes in public, deliberately and not simply by way of a slip of the tongue, an extremely serious reflection on the supreme commander of those Forces.  Deputy Dowling has already instanced the case of an NCO or a private making derogatory or insulting remarks about a superior officer and, in the light of that example, I believe a perfectly valid question can be posed: if, for example, a colonel commanding a brigade were publicly, in front of his own men and their officers, to insult the Chief of Staff would that colonel be considered fit to remain in office commanding that brigade?  Would he not be immediately dealt with by the general staff?  Would he not be either courtmartialled or dismissed at once?  Does the same situation not apply down along the line to other officers who would publicly insult an officer higher than themselves?  That is the position we have here.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the President is the first citizen of the land and pre-eminent among all the citizens he is also, in the context of this particular episode, the supreme commander of the Army and the Minister for Defence comes in lower down in the hierarchy.  The Taoiseach this morning referred five times, on my count, to the fact that a full and unreserved apology had been made by the Minister for Defence and that should be an end of the matter.  The apology was made apparently in writing and sent by messenger to the President. We have not seen the terms of the apology and the public are not aware of what the terms are, but we assume it was a full and unreserved apology. We are asked by the Taoiseach to accept that should be the end of the affair.  I can recall a full and unreserved apology in a very much less serious matter being made from these benches by two Deputies arising out of what was essentially a political charge, a charge they unreservedly withdrew and for which they unreservedly apologised.  But that did not satisfy the Taoiseach.  Notwithstanding that apology he pursued <Col N="171" /> these two Deputies.  They had the guts to come in here and stand up and make that apology&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but, notwithstanding that, the Taoiseach pursued them into the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  A form of trial took place there and, then because of procedural difficulties, that trial could not be proceeded with by the Government so they transferred from the committee, where they have a majority, to a tribunal they set up consisting of three judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court in order to continue with the rubbing in the mud of the noses of two Members of this House who had unreservedly apologised at the earliest possible moment.  Even though they had apologised and entirely withdrawn their allegations these two Members made no attempt to justify or to prove the allegations they had made when this tribunal was set up and the judges, after sitting for half an hour, or some short period, brought in a finding that there was no evidence to justify it and the finding of that tribunal, notwithstanding the full and unreserved apology, was brought back to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, laid on the table of this House and debated here.  There was a motion of censure, or whatever it was, from the Taoiseach.  All that concerned a matter totally trivial compared with the matter we are now discussing, a matter which occured in the military barracks in Mullingar last Monday.  It was a political argument, with accusations and counter-accusations thrown across the floor of this House, something which has happened in every year in which this House has existed.  I myself, as were many members of this party, was subjected to far more serious accusations and defamatory statements, but we never bothered setting up tribunals or going before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and we got no unreserved apologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reliance of the Taoiseach now on an unreserved apology, that none <Col N="172" /> of us has seen, is in marked contrast to his refusal to accept the manful apology of Deputy Molloy and Deputy Crinion in a matter infinitesimal compared with that which we are now discussing.  On the five occasions on which this apology was referred to by the Taoiseach this morning he said that the Minister for Defence regretted the remarks and he, the Taoiseach, regretted that the Minister made them.  I should like to inquire now if the Taoiseach has carried his regret to the extent ordinary decency would expect him.  As Taoiseach, has he expressed to the President his personal regret and non-support of these remarks and the personal regret and non-support of the 13 other members of the Cabinet?  This has by no means been made clear and there are suggestions that what the Minister for Defence said in Mullingar last Monday was a public expression of what some of his colleagues in Government had been saying privately up to that and suspicion will remain until they get up and talk and condemn what happened in Mullingar for what it is. Until they do that, by virtue of the doctrine of collective responsibility in this or any other Cabinet, they are to some extent tainting themselves with the utterances so unhappily and so idiotically made by the Minister for Defence in Mullingar last Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling.  It has been alleged that this remark was in some way a slip of the tongue.  It was a clanger dropped and then apologised for.  Deputy Dowling has made it clear that the Press were alerted in advance to the fact that something very important was going to be said and the official text or script given out by the Government Information Services that morning was not important.  God knows, reading it, it is not important.  There were three things said on that occasion in the unscripted speech of the Minister for Defence, each of which gives rise to serious concern.  One was a repetition by the Minister of a statement he <Col N="173" /> had made the previous week to the effect that there was no point in this country getting a 50 mile exclusive fishery limit because we could not police it.  He was criticised for that because, in saying that, he totally undermined his colleagues the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in their negotiating position.  He did that in public.  Instead of trying to get out of that in some way he blatantly and openly repeated it in Columb Barracks in Mullingar.</P>
      <P>This is extremely relevant to the question of whether or not Deputy Donegan is fit to hold the office he does.  He then went on to deal at great length with what the President did not do.  He did not refer various sections of the Criminal Law Bill, 1976, to the Supreme Court and he followed that with the unfortunate and idiotic statement he made.  He finished up a couple of sentences later on a totally different topic.  It is again indicative of the man's frame of mind and of his unsuitability to hold office in Government.  He finished up by saying, and it is the very last sentence of his unscripted speech, that if, if fact, judgment was possible, in retrospect it may have been better in Portarlington to use a robot costing £6,000 than one garda.  That is a very strange statement, to say the least of it.  It is open, I think, to two interpretations, and it has been interpreted in two different ways, but whichever of the two interpretations one takes, I think both of them are deplorable.</P>
      <P>One of them is that the gardaí in some way do not do their job properly and that it would be better to use Army personnel and a robot to do certain types of jobs.  That is a deplorable reflection on the gardaí, and they have certainly seen it as such.  If one examines the sentence very carefully and looks at the precise words that were used, it is capable of another interpretation too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that in Portarlington if judgment was possible, in retrospect it may&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;have been better to use a robot costing £6,000 than one garda. <Col N="174" /> One assumes that the one garda to which the Minister referred is the unfortunate garda who lost his life in Portarlington on that occasion in the course of his duties, and the question that the Minister for Defence seems to have been posing on that occasion was whether&mdash;though he used the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, it is something which should be decided even in retrospect&mdash; it may have been better to use a robot costing £6,000 than one garda. The decision as he sees it is whether it would have been better to have had a robot blown up rather than one garda blown into eternity.</P>

      <P>I think it is a shameful thing to have said and I am afraid it is indicative of the general unfitness of the Minister for Defence on this as well as on various other occasions. There are numerous other occasions that I could refer to and that we could all refer to but I do not propose to do that because some of them would be personal reflections, possibly, on the Minister which I have not indulged in and which none of us has indulged in.  We have simply dealt with public statements made by him in the course of his duties as Minister for Defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, as I understand it, is that Dáil Éireann calls on the Taoiseach to request the Minister for Defence to resign.  I think that brings up the question of the fitness of the Minister for Defence to hold the office which he holds.  I think that is what I have been dealing with.  I have been dealing with it only on the basis of the public statements of the Minister for Defence as Minister for Defence.  Nobody who has spoken on this side has dealt with any of the myriads of matters that, perhaps, we could usefully deal with but which do not constitute the public <Col N="175" /> statements of the Minister for Defence in his official capacity.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech here today the Taoiseach made several statements including one to the effect that there was no reflection on the discharge by the President of his constitutional functions.  Does the Taoiseach seriously believe that statement? Surely the whole point of this criticism is that in the view of the Minister for Defence the President had wrongfully discharged his constitutional function in this respect.  Perhaps the least happy part of the Taoiseach's speech this morning was when he described the efficient way in which the Minister for Defence had built up the strength of the Army and that was his contribution to the support of the institutions of this State.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence should have resigned voluntarily, and the duty of the Taoiseach to ask him to resign was made terribly obvious by the contribution of the Taoiseach here today, who quite patently was unable to defend the situation.  I do not blame him for that but I repeat, in conclusion, that he should now do the logical thing.  Arising out of his accepted inability to defend the situation, he should now ask the Minister for Defence to resign.  It should not be necessary for this motion to be put down in this House and debated in this House because if the Minister for Defence had resigned, or failing a voluntary resignation on his part if the Taoiseach had requested him to resign, then the institutions of State&mdash; and the Minister for Defence has seriously attacked the principal one&mdash; would not be put in the position in which they are necessarily put today by a discussion of this kind.  We would not have to reflect on the fact that the very man who above all lectured the nation on the necessity for respect for law and order and the institutions of State has himself done greater damage to those causes which he espouses than, perhaps, any other individual in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say personally that the situation which has developed and the need <Col N="176" /> for this debate is a matter of regret to me as a Deputy in this House.  As I see it, what is at stake here is the dignity of the high office of the Presidency, one of the three arms of the democratic Legislature of this country. What has occurred is that the Minister for Defence at a public official ceremony denigrated the person of the President and, by doing so, the office of the Presidency, and in the words he used indicated quite clearly that the reason he was doing so was that the President, functioning as a President, in accordance with his duty had referred a Bill which was seen to be controversial to the Supreme Court and the Minister disagreed with this.</P>
      <P>This would be pathetic in a sense if it were not so serious.  Why should any member of the Government consider that he had any right whatsoever to question the Head of State for carrying out a function which he was bound to carry out?  The whole essence of democracy as I understand it is that we follow the rule of law and that we do not simply agree with what is done in the ordinary course of law because we happen to agree with the law at a particular time but when it does not suit us we do not agree.  That is what the Minister for Defence was doing and, so far as one can see, up to the point where the blunder became public, he was doing it in an atmosphere in which one felt that at least many of his colleagues thought and felt the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister denigrated the office of the President simply by implying that the man in that position, whoever he might be, acted in a partisan manner just because the Minister did not like the manner in which he acted. That is an offence against one of the arms of our democratic legislation.  He chose an official public ceremony involving the Defence Forces.  The Minister for Defence hands out commissions to officers of the Defence Forces, on behalf of the President, who is Commander-in-Chief.  If one of the officers who received his commission a couple of months ago from the Minister for Defence, on behalf of the President, at an official function referred <Col N="177" /> to his Commander-in-Chief in the manner in which the Minister for Defence did last week he would lose his commission on that day.</P>
    <P>You cannot have misbehaviour by a Minister glossed over by the head of the Government and then expect the ordinary people to respect the law and institutions of the State.  So far as I am concerned, the Leader of the Opposition, acting in the only way he could act on behalf of the Opposition party in a situation like this, made every move step by step.  He did not seek a debate on this issue yesterday.  He asked a question and when he got no reply the next step was to point out the seriousness of what the Minister had done.  When the Taoiseach said, what has been repeated today, that the Minister apologised and that is the end of it the Leader of the Opposition had then no alternative but to seek a debate.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of the Opposition said, contributions on this matter should not be partisan in terms of party politics and there must be no witch hunt.  I do not want to see the very important role of the Presidency become a matter of contention between the Government and the Opposition.  I am worried that the Taoiseach followed the line he followed.  I do not want to go into too many examples of similar occasions in the past.  In the ordinary course of events if a man, who is so much before the public as the Minister for Defence is, makes a gaffe, or blunders, intentionally or otherwise, automatically what should follow within ten minutes is that his resignation is offered to the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach took responsibility before this House for all members of the Government.  He went to the President with the members of the Government he had nominated.  It is not enough to say, as the Government Information Services said, that the Minister had made an apology and the thing is over.</P>
    <P>The first thing that should have happened is that the Taoiseach should have received the Minister's resignation, whether or not he accepted it. Deputy O'Malley touched on an occasion of much less seriousness than this, which happened some <Col N="178" /> months ago in the House, when a member of our front bench made a gaffe.  Within a few hours of doing so he tendered his resignation as a member of our front bench to our party leader.  That is what all members owe to a leader of a party or the head of a Government, if they blunder.</P>
    <P>I regret that a question like this should come to a debate.  It would be a matter of even greater regret if it became a serious party, political, contentious issue.  I do not see how we can avoid this.  There is nothing personal so far as Members of this side of the House are concerned about which Minister it is.  The case is very clear.  There was improper behaviour in public.  The highest office in the land was attacked by a member of the Government and so far the matter has not been dealt with satisfactorily. Therefore, the Opposition had to put down a motion for debate because we believe that in the circumstances the correct thing which should happen is that the Minister for Defence should submit his resignation and if he will not do so the Taoiseach should ask for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is typical of all the unexpected, and the unpredictable, so frequently happening in political life that we should find ourselves turning our attention once more to constitutional issues.  This is a very basic and important constitutional issue.  In putting down this motion, we in the Opposition are seeking to resolve a serious constitutional matter which has arisen suddenly in a most extraordinary way.  This House should concern itself in discussing this motion with the issue and not the personalities.  It is on that point that there is a real difference between us and the Government.  We see this unfortunate regrettable occurrence as a constitutional issue which cannot be dealt with as a matter of personal relations, which can simply be solved on a personal basis by way of an apology or some other form of atonement of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we see it, two institutions of the Constitution have been unfortunately and regrettably catapulted into public confrontation.  We see this as a <Col N="179" /> serious fundamental constitutional situation.  It is clear by now that we are not really concerned with the personality or the competence of the Minister for Defence.  We could debate that any time we wished.  Personally, I would find the Minister a good statesman and I know that many of us would too.  It is an inbuilt element in all our proceedings in this House that we in the Opposition constantly by our questioning and criticism imply that some particular incumbent in ministerial office is incompetent or unsuitable for the office that he holds.  That is part of our normal procedures and it is implicit in the way we conduct our parliamentary debates.</P>
    <P>This is not simply a clash of personalities; it is a constitutional conflict and it is important that we on this side of the House should endeavour to persuade the Government as earnestly as we can that that is what is involved because quite clearly, the Government and the Taoiseach do not see it in that light.  I find the attitude and the reaction of the Taoiseach in this matter genuinely puzzling and disconcerting.  This morning in replying to the Leader of the Opposition the Taoiseach relied entirely on the fact that something unseemly had happened, a full and unreserved apology had been tendered and that ended that.  It will be accepted by everybody that that was what the Taoiseach's speech this morning amounted to.  The Taoiseach, in effect, said that the Minister for Defence had made a full and unreserved apology and that was enough.  That demonstrates on the part of the Taoiseach and his advisers and on the part of the Government as a whole a remarkable lack of understanding and appreciation of our constitutional processes and their basic importance to us as a community and as a democratic State.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach not see that the very office of the President, the very institution of the President has been damaged by this happening and that, indeed, a vital and important fundamental constitutional procedure has been damaged and denigrated by this <Col N="180" /> event?  Can the Taoiseach not see that it is not simply a matter of one political person slighting another political person and apologising for it?  If a Minister of the Government under provocation or otherwise indulges in an intemperate outburst and insults some other person, the mayor of a town or city in which he is attending a function, or a bishop or some other person in public life, then the procedure adopted is that the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary or whoever is involved, will tender an apology and the other person in the normal course of events would accept the apology and that is the end of the matter.  That sort of thing happens and it is understandable.  This is on a different level.  We are not dealing with one political person in an outburst, intemperate or otherwise. attacking another political person.  We are dealing with two arms of the Oireachtas, the Government and the Presidency being unfortunately brought into conflict.</P>
    <P>It is particularly surprising to me and to many of my colleagues that Deputy Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach should adopt this stance in regard to this incident.  In every democracy every Prime Minister, in ours every Taoiseach, has his own approach to the high office which he holds.  He puts his own stamp on the office while he holds it.  Deputy Cosgrave is no exception to that.  In his own way, by his personality, his approach, his political philosophy the Taoiseach has put his own impression on the office of Taoiseach and has made his own particular contribution to the development of that office.  We all know that in Government and in Opposition if Deputy Liam Cosgrave has had one single political belief to which he has given expression more than any other, it is his desire to uphold and protect the institutions of State.  I think that there would be unanimous agreement on that statement.  More than anything else the desire to uphold and defend the institutions of the State has been the personal <i>credo</i> of Deputy Liam Cosgrave in Opposition and as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach about this <Col N="181" /> matter on a couple of occasions. Speaking here once I asked the Taoiseach were these simply empty, meaningless political phrases carried forward from one speech to another because they sounded well or were they deeply held political convictions on his part.  I think we would all agree among ourselves as politicians&mdash;indeed. I think there would be general public acceptance of the fact&mdash;that Deputy Cosgrave as Taoiseach whether he sought to do it himself or it has been assiduously done on his behalf by those whose job it is to support his cause and protect his image&mdash;that there has been an overall inflexible rectitude of integrity built up by Deputy Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach.  He has constantly given the impression of a passionate adherence to the supremacy of the institutions of this State of ours. Some of us perhaps from time to time have resented his inclination of gathering to himself total responsibility for the protection of the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may.  I want to suggest to him that those who accepted that aura and image, who believed in it, are going to be very seriously perturbed, disturbed and concerned by the stand he has taken in regard to this matter.  I believe it would have been expected by many&mdash;perhaps by a majority of our people&mdash;that the Taoiseach would have moved immediately and without hesitation when this matter was brought to his notice to vindicate the office of President, the rights and duties of the President no matter who was the particular occupant of the office.  I would have expected, and I think many people in this country rightly would have expected, that, perhaps, the first man to move positively and decisively to remove any suggestion of an attack on the institution of President would have been Deputy Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach.  It is incomprehensible to many of us on this side of the House that he simply has not done so.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Taoiseach and the Government to another danger that I see.  I believe it is a very real danger.  Can they not <Col N="182" /> see that it is inevitable that, in the public mind, the Taoiseach's attitude in this matter will be confused, whether or not he likes it, with support and approval for what the Minister for Defence said?  The Minister for Defence said quite clearly and specifically what he had in mind. I want to underline to the Taoiseach the fact that it is inevitable, throughout a large section of our public, that his attitude in this regard, in not looking for the resignation of his Minister for Defence, as soon as these things had been said, will be taken as approval and support of and agreement with what the Minister for Defence said about the President and his action.  I think that is a very real danger.</P>
    <P>I know that members of the Government as well as people on this side of the House are fully aware of what is common gossip in regard to this incident.  It is said freely, openly and widely that what the Minister for Defence said reflected accurately the views of many of his colleagues, that this was the sort of conversation that took place at the Government table, these were the sort of things that were being said and the Minister for Defence, in his usual outright, outspoken fashion, did no more than echo what his colleagues were saying and thought.  I do not go along with that view.  There may be some individual Members of the Government who think along those lines.  I have often spoken here about the occupational myopia from which Ministers suffer eventually, that is, that they begin to see enemies in every corner and behind every bush.  I think there are sufficient members of the Government who have a broader view of our political life than to succumb to that sort of temptation.  But I want to direct the attention of the Government to the fact that this is being said. I am afraid the attitude of the Taoiseach to the statement of his Minister does nothing to negative that gossip, to put it at rest.</P>
    <P>There are many different views genuinely held about our Constitution by different people and different sections of our people.  The effluxion of <Col N="183" /> time has indicated areas in which, perhaps, the Constitution is deficient, where it could be amended to bring it more into line with modern times and circumstances.  But I think there would be unanimous and universal agreement that, above anything else, one of the great successes of the 1937 Constitution has been the office and the institution of the President.  We have been very fortunate in the way in which the situation developed, in the persons who occupied that office, that it has developed into a very important, successful, national constitutional institution.  I believe that there is amongst ordinary men and women a sense of pride in the Presidency, a feeling of security emanating from the fact that we have the office of President with its constitutional attributes. I believe that as an office, the Presidency has established for itself a first-class reputation among those countries with whom we have friendly relations.  Our Head of State is respected and looked up to, not because of any particular personal qualities, I believe, though they are important also, but over the decades the institution of the Head of State of Ireland has become something respected abroad amongst our friends.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is important that we all try to contribute in our own way to the building up of our institutions and traditions.  I am not speaking for a moment now about the political belief of the Taoiseach, to which I have referred, about the need to protect our institutions of State.  As our parliamentary life develops, we should all, as parliamentarians and politicians, make our contribution in our own way, to the best of our ability, to the development, growth and status of our political institutions and traditions. Those are the sort of issues I believe should have been present in the mind of the Taoiseach when he came to deal with this matter.  Surely the office of President, the institution of the Presidency, is of fundamental basic importance to us as a political State, as a nation, as a people?  As politicians, would we not be in grave dereliction of our duty if we here, as a parliament, permitted anything to happen, inadvertently <Col N="184" /> or otherwise, to denigrate or take from the value of the office of President?  Should we not do everything within our power to protect and develop that institution?  We are faced with that sort of question and problem here, not with the competence or fitness of the Minister for Defence.  Unfortunately for him, he has precipitated this situation.  He has brought about a situation where the office and the functions of the President have been brought into immediate and direct conflict with the Executive, the Government, and their Ministers.  That is what we are trying to resolve in this motion.</P>
    <P>Many of us feel, regrettably, that there is no way out of the problem that has arisen except that the Minister for Defence tenders his resignation. It seems to me to be manifest that that should be done and the Taoiseach is guilty of a grave misconception, a deep error of judgment, if he does not see this unfortunate incident in that light.</P>
    <P>We have enough problems to contend with at the moment, economic and political difficulties, widespread violence and all these things.  Surely we cannot afford to add to them at this stage.  We cannot afford to add this totally unnecessary constitutional confrontation because, no matter how we try to disguise it or to set it aside, confrontation it is.</P>
    <P>Let us recall the sequence of events. We were brought back from our holidays to consider very important legislation put before us by the Government. We had a very real parliamentary battle about the legislation. It was a first-class debate.  The arguments on both sides were put forward very forcefully and intensely and the legislation was discussed, debated, teased out, analysed and examined in the greatest detail.  I think it was a memorable parliamentary battle and, when the process of democracy was gone through, when the legislation was passed by the Oireachtas, it was sent to the President for signature.</P>
    <P>In my view, and many people would agree with me, there was a sense of relief throughout the community when the President decided to act in <Col N="185" /> regard to those two pieces of legislation. After the debate here with all the political passions that were aroused, probably there was a great deal of doubt created in the public mind about the legislation, about its effects, implications and constitutionality. Many people on both sides of the political arena were pleased to learn that at least this aspect was going to be decided for them, that the President was there, that he called together the Council of State and that he decided to refer the Bill or to the Supreme Court to see if it was constitutional. It was regarded by many as a final, necessary and desirable step in the legislative process, that when the politicians had their say and fought their battles, that there was this final, mature process to be gone through before the legislation became law.</P>
    <P>I remember reading editorials in a number of newspapers welcoming the decision of the President.  It was not a political act.  It was simply an exercise of a constitutional function clearly envisaged in our Constitution and which has been often invoked before. I do not think anyone can have any doubt but that what the President did was absolutely right, was constitutionally impeccable and had a sort of tacit general public approval&mdash;something that does not happen very often in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>In all those circumstances, the statement by the Minister for Defence about that action was unfortunate and perhaps tragic but I do not think it need have been the end of the matter. Serious and unacceptable as it was, the action moved immediately into the area of the Taoiseach.  The whole matter could have been put right and the institutions of the State could have been strengthened if the Taoiseach, by immediate, positive and decisive action had indicated that he was Taoiseach, responsible to the Irish people, and he always likes to think of himself as the defender of our institutions.  If he had moved positively and decisively to rectify the matter by calling for the resignation of the Minister, the whole matter could have redounded to the credit of our political life and our institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> Deputy Lynch spoke for us all when he said that this is not the sort of parliamentary occasion in which any of us takes any pleasure.  It is something we would prefer not to have to do, something we would prefer not to have to engage in in this House.  Personally I greatly wish that this had never happened but, unfortunately, it has happened.  We consider we must discharge our duty as an Opposition by pointing out to the Taoiseach in particular and to his Government precisely what is involved.  It is not a personal incident; it is not a clash of personalities; it is not one political person slighting another and dealing with the matter by way of personal apology. There is more involved in it than that It is a question of an important constitutional office, of important constitutional functions being damaged. The only way they can be saved, the only way the damage can be negatived is by the action we propose to the Taoiseach in our motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may, I want to begin by saying something about the President who has become unfortunately the centre of the debate this morning.  For me the good faith of the President in the action he took under Article 26 is beyond question. Anyone who followed the President's distinguished career as a judge could not possibly consider the matter as being anything but beyond question. The President, a distinguished lawyer, presided over the Supreme Court during a brilliant period.  He presided over it in a series of judgments which revolutionised Irish constitutional jurisprudence.  Apart altogether from his unfailing courtesy and human qualities, his impartiality, his standing as a judge and his absolute integrity and independence are utterly beyond question for me and for those I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the President remains a human being, capable of feeling wounded by words spoken about him.  I understand that very well and in what I am going to say now about the words spoken and the setting in which we must consider them I want everything I am going to <Col N="187" /> say to be looked at against the background of what I have just said, that the President's good faith, impartiality and integrity are absolutely beyond question.  It would not be fair to say other than that I deplore any incident which would suggest that they were other than beyond question. At the same time, I wish to draw an important distinction between the President as the incumbent of the office at any particular time and the Presidency itself.  The reason that distinction is important is that we have been invited&mdash;first by the Leader of the Opposition and to a lesser degree by the speakers who followed him but particularly by a remarkable speech, which makes me think I have heard everything, in which Deputy Haughey spoke on the subject of the institutions of the State&mdash;to look at this incident as an attack, not on Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh for the time being incumbent of the Presidency, but on the presidency itself.  That distinction is very important.  I reject and deny absolutely that the words concerned, however wrong-headed they were, can be construed in such an inflated sense. Regardless of how I deplore them, to construe them as an attack on one of the institutions of the State is, if intended honestly, a bottomless absurdity.</P>
    <P>By reason of our Constitution the President has very few independent functions.  Even the function of Commander-in-Chief of the Army is, like most all his other functions, one which he must exercise on the advice of the Government.  He has not as much as the power to order a soldier to pour a plateful of soup other than on the advice of the Government. Although anchored in the Constitution, his status as Commander-in-Chief of the Army is merely a ceremonial or a decorative one.  I do not intend any offence in saying that.  That function has no executive power.  It could not have any such power, since the President is not elected to the post on grounds of his military capacity or potential.  Although his status in that regard is one which must command respect and reverence it is purely decorative or ceremonial and <Col N="188" /> comes to light only in such an act as the signing of an officer's commission.</P>
    <P>Most of the President's functions are not independent.  A totally subordinate President who is nothing more than a decorative figurehead&mdash;I am speaking of the incumbent of the office at any time&mdash;deserves, if only because of the code whereby one does not hit a man while his hands are tied behind his back, the courtesy of immunity from public criticism.  But a President who has independent functions and an independent range of action and judgment is not and cannot be immune from criticism in this State or in any other State.  I reject and repudiate the false solemnity which has invested this subject since the controversy began three days ago, because our President, in so far as he has independent functions, few though they may be, must be prepared for the wind of criticism to which everybody else in public life who makes a decision is also subject.  That includes wrong-headed criticism, criticism which you or I, Sir, might deplore; but in no sense is such criticism an attack on the institutions of the State.  It is a criticism&mdash;in this case a deplorable one&mdash;of the mode in which the functions of that office have been exercised.  That is something very different from saying that the criticism is an attack on the institutions of the State.  Otherwise, one might as well say that anyone who criticises the Government of the day is attacking the institution of the Dáil or that every speech made by the Opposition attacking the Government is an attack on the Dáil.  Nobody who has given the matter any thought and who by nature is not a solemn ass would say otherwise.</P>
    <P>Apart from the function of recalling the Dáil or Seanad the President has two substantial independent functions.  One of these, which has never been exercised, is the power to refuse a dissolution to a Taoiseach who has ceased to retain the support of a majority in the Dáil.  Supposing the President found himself in a situation in which either the present Taoiseach or any Taoiseach who <Col N="189" /> may succeed him were to be without a Dáil majority, and if the President should refuse to dissolve the Dáil, must he be immune from criticism?  Would it be the case that the Opposition, who would be ravening at the jaws and anxious to go to the country, ought to remain tongue-tied and not be in a position to criticise the President's decision?  Any point of view of that kind is out of place in a democracy. When anyone from the top to the bottom of this State exercises an independent function and judgment he must be open to criticism as fully as would be the President of the US.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I am not ignoring the fact that there are enormous differences in the constitutional position as between the President of this country and of the US.  But to the extent that our President has an independent function, he must expect to be criticised.</P>
    <P>Occasionally that criticism will include unwarranted abuse.  I regret and deplore the fact that the incident we are talking of should come into the latter category; but when we hear such incredible contributions as that which we had from Deputy Haughey we must ask ourselves to what extent there is a democratic spirit involved here.  We might recall that it was Deputy Haughey who was responsible for exploring thoroughly this institution of the State, when he made it necessary for Deputy Lynch to go to the then President to have the Deputy fired from his post.</P>
    <P>I am all for providing immunity for somebody who cannot defend himself or who has no option but to act in a particular way.  For instance, it would be improper to criticise a President for signing a Bill which clearly it would be a breach of duty for him not to sign.  But the idea that the Presidency is under attack is simply false.  I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to contradict me on that when he is replying.  I have here a transcript of Deputy Lynch's speech, which I hope is accurate, and in which he said that the constitutional status of the President was under attack in this instance.  Deplorable though it was, what the Minister did was to use <Col N="190" /> language of the kind reported about the behaviour of the present incumbent of the office, but nothing that was said could possibly be construed as an attack on the Presidency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred twice to an attack on the constitutional status of the President and went on to say that whatever the manner of the apology or its delivery or its receipt, we had the position of one institution of the State denigrating another, one element of the Oireachtas undermining another. He went on to ask how one institution of State could apologise to another. That construction of the situation is one of which a first-year law student would not be guilty.  With an ordinary respect for and an ordinary use of language, it is not possible to describe the Presidency as being under attack in this instance.  I am not overlooking the special position of the Minister for Defence.  I recognise that factor is part of the Opposition indictment, and rightly so; but bearing that in mind it remains to be said, repeatedly, until such time as the false representation should cease, that in no sense was what happened an attack on the Presidency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to whispers and rumours and I think it was Deputy O'Malley who said that according to information at his disposal the words used were premeditated, that this was a deliberate planned assault on the Presidency.  My information is quite to the contrary.  They were the product of strong feelings, wrong feelings certainly, and those strong feelings, I believe, are the product of the Minister's deep and passionate commitment to his job, a passionate commitment to a job which formerly was a Cinderella among Government jobs.  Who can recall the names of two former Ministers for Defence in the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government?  Many men would be hard put to it to remember the name of even one.  The name of Paddy Donegan will be remembered, and not for this absurd incident.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for this absurd incident, but because he takes a passionate pride in his job and has a passionate love of it.  Against that background, <Col N="191" /> an outburst like the one which occurred at the weekend to me is venial.  I hope I do not condemn myself in the eyes of others by saying so, but to me it is venial measured against what the man is and the job he has to do, and the passionate dedication which he has brought to it, on which friend and foe alike have commented.</P>
      <P>His fault is the product of a hot and generous temper.  If I were to measure in the balance a hot and generous temper, such as Deputy Donegan has, against the whey-faced, cold-nosed puritanism which the Opposition and many outside commentators are displaying in regard to a &ldquo;constitutional&rdquo; problem which they have not even bothered to think about, I would choose Paddy Donegan, and so would many Irish people.  In doing so and in saying that, I do not want to minimise the unseemliness or the wrongness of what he said.  I will not minimise it.  It was unseemly and wrong.  He apologised for it, in sharp contra-distinction to Ministers and ex-Ministers we have seen in this House in the past decade.  He apologised for it at once.  He did not have to have his arm twisted.  He did not have to wait until the papers were screaming at him and until his fault was documented and lay under everybody's nose.  He straightaway regretted what he had done.  He straightaway offered to appologise.  If there was any delay in the transmission of that apology, it cannot be laid at his door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a big difference between the behaviour of the Minister for Defence and the behaviour of a former Minister for Local Government here last year.  That was a sober attempt on the part of Deputy Molloy and Deputy Crinion, persisted in, deliberately repeated, to bring down Deputy Tully, the Minister for Local Government, without a shred of real, serious evidence. These were allegations against him which Deputy O'Malley seemed to think trifling, as though it should be an infinitesimal matter that a man who spent all his life in public service should be hounded from office because of a lie.  Was that a small thing?  Is that trivial?  Is that <Col N="192" /> infinitesimal?  Is that something which vanishes into invisibility compared with an affront to the President? I do not think so.  The people guilty of that apologised only when their noses were rubbed in it.  It was a cold-blooded repeated attempt to blacken and bring down a decent and hard-working Minister.  To this day that Minister has to put up with whispers in his own constituency that there is never smoke without fire.  I do not see Deputy Crinion or hear about him making much of an effort to go around and try to damp down the fire which he lit.</P>
    <P>I do not want to drag up incidents which are better forgotten, but I have not forgotten what went on under the last Government.  I have not forgotten the behaviour of Ministers in the last Government, Ministers like Deputy Ó Moráin, Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland, who behaved like a bunch of gauchos at a rodeo, and whose behaviour time after time was stood over, defended and justified by the present Leader of the Opposition who is now so solemn and who is now so hypocritical in expecting us to ditch a man whose only fault is that he spoke wrongly, at a wrong time, and in the wrong place, and wrong-headedly, but who instantly apologised for what he had done.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Lynch standing over Deputy Ó Moráin when he wrote as Minister for Justice to a constituent of his own telling him to go into a vacant house which did not belong to him and said that he, Deputy Ó Moráin, would cover up for him provided the constituent burned the letter.  There were no apologies for that.  Deputy Lynch did not take the first opportunity in the Dáil to disassociate himself from that.  I do not recall much happening at the time Deputy Blaney put a pistol&mdash;these are old days now certainly&mdash;metaphorically speaking to Deputy Haughey's head with a pre-emptive strike on the budget which Deputy Haughey was due to produce in ten or 15 days' time.  He wanted so much for the farmers&mdash;an attempt to blackmail his Government colleagues into conceding a claim which <Col N="193" /> had to be weighed up in conjunction with every other budgetary claim made on the Government. There was not a word about that misbehaviour.  That was deliberate. That was sober.  There was no apology for that.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Boland when he was Minister for Local Government treating with brutal contempt, week in week out, everybody who stood in his way.  A priest who criticised his housing policy was &ldquo;a so-called cleric&rdquo;. The conservationists who objected to his destruction of Hume Street were &ldquo;belted earls&rdquo;&mdash;because the Guinnesses had not subscribed to TACA, they were abused in this fashion.  I remember Deputy Boland saying in 1968 that the 1959 Electoral Act, which gerrymandered the constituencies, had been struck down by the High Court at the behest of Fine Gael.  He said Judge Budd, than whom there was no more respected member of the Irish Bench, had declared that Act unconstitutional &ldquo;at the behest of the Fine Gael Party&rdquo;.  Was there an apology for that?  Did Mr. Boland come running to offer it even before he was asked?  I remember these things.  Others remember them too.  They allow me to place in perspective the effort being made by the Opposition and by some of the media to soup up this very unfortunate but essentially, in the perspective of even quite a short amount of time, trivial incident into something important.</P>
    <P>I have often noticed about the Opposition that, even during important debates when one might expect to hear something of their own from them&mdash; I instance Deputy Lynch's performance in the last budget debate&mdash;they come in with a shower of newspaper clippings and cuttings and, instead of a speech, we get a series of reflections from newspaper editors.  We cannot all be as wise as newspaper editors.  We cannot all have the instant wisdom and sense of exquisite balance of a leader writer.  Nonetheless these are the gentlemen on whose thoughts the Opposition so frequently rely.  Deputy Dowling did not have clippings.  The Fianna Fáil research office had actually typed out <Col N="194" /> on a piece of paper the quotations on which he was relying.</P>

        <i>The Irish Times</i> said it simply was not open to a Minister to criticise the President.  This pompous empty solemnity is something which I deprecate.  It would be no harm if the Opposition would look around and see the company they are in, in calling for Deputy Donegan's dismissal.  <i>Hibernia</i> in its issue out today calls for his dismissal&mdash;<i>Hibernia,</i> that noted champion of the Constitution, that noted protector of the institutions of the State, that noted enemy of all that tends to pull down what so much blood and effort were expended in trying to put up.  Good company!</P>
      <P>The only honest contribution I heard this morning from the other side came from Deputy Brugha who, in an aside, described what Deputy Donegan had done as &ldquo;a gaffe intentional or not&rdquo;.  Deputy Brugha knows that the reason he put in that disjunction &ldquo;intentional or not&rdquo; is that it was an unintended, unreflected gaffe.  It was that.  If I had made it, I would regret it very bitterly.  I hope I would have been man enough to do what Deputy Donegan did.</P>

      <P>I did not expect I would have to speak here this morning or that we would have to wait so long for an answer to our request to the Taoiseach that he should call on the Minister for Defence to resign. To the ordinary person in the street it is unthinkable that a matter such as this should be dragged on from Monday to Thursday.  I feel that our leader this morning made the case, backed up by our front bench calmly, quietly and effectively, showing the seriousness of the utterance made publicly in the Minister's address to the Army in the presence of his officers, NCOs and men in Mullingar.  This was a calculated remark made by the Minister to belittle the President who is the supreme commander of the Defence Forces.  As Deputy Dowling said, if any officer, NCO or man in the Defence Forces made a similar remark such a man would be stripped of his uniform and drummed out.</P>
      <P>It is laughable that a very short time ago in this House the Minister referred to me as a subversive because of my remarks.  It would be well to consider who is the subversive now and who can be guilty of mutinous talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has decided that he will not take any action.  Possibly it is too late for him now to relent even if he sees the error of his ways.  Would he explain to members of the Army who have contacted me in this matter how he has the gall to expect good conduct and allegiance from these <Col N="196" /> people when he does not demand the same standards from the Minister in charge of the Army?  This is an obvious example of the double thinking and double standards which exist in this riven Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reply this morning, in which he repeated the same thing over and over again, was very puny and pathetic.  He kept repeating that the Minister had made an apology. We are assured here that it was complete and unreserved, unreserved and complete.  That was all the Taoiseach had to say and he said it in different ways.  We in the House are still unaware of the content of that apology. It is essential that we should hear the wording of it.  We do not know the contents of the letter that the Minister has sent to the President.  If the Minister had any guts he would be here this morning to restate his apology and let us and the people at large judge whether it is complete and unequivocal as the Taoiseach would have us believe.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked, very pertinently, whether the Taoiseach had conveyed his own personal apology to the President.  The Taoiseach is the captain of the team, of the 15 members of the Cabinet, and as such it is essential that he should apologise. Common courtesy in an ordinary person would demand that.  How much more is it necessary that the man who leads or purports to lead the Government of the day, should make this apology.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the previous speaker who tried to imply that this was some sort of throw-away remark. One does not give advance warning to the Press that one is going to depart from a script, and one would not, naturally, throw away a remark which we are told was regretted instantly, and then to the Press and ask them did they get that, saying that that remark would surely make headlines.  This proves beyond doubt that the remark was made in a cold, calculated fashion.  Just as his checking-out with the Press indicates that he wished that to go on record, the apology did not come immediately. It came when somebody, probably <Col N="197" /> the Taoiseach, made this irresponsible Minister aware of the gravity of the offence.</P>
    <P>There is an Irish expression, Aithrí Toirní, which is possibly very applicable in the present case.  It is called the contrition of thunder, the contrition that we feel when we hear the thunder and fear the possible effect of the lightning on ourselves.  It is a type of selfish sorrow.  This &ldquo;thundering disgrace&rdquo; brought about an Aithrí Toirní in the case of the Minister. The Taoiseach this morning gave an excuse that Deputy Donegan's behaviour did arise from the great zeal he has shown for the Army and the fact that he had built up the Army to the strength that it now enjoys. His Parliamentary Secretary echoed the same words here in a futile attempt to make excuses for this over-zealous, warm-blooded man whom the country would take to their heart in the morning if they had the opportunity.</P>
    <P>However, I am sure the Minister and the Taoiseach must realise how that remark has undermined the morale of the Defence Forces.  It is possibly the final phase in the erosion of confidence in the Minister's ability. First of all, we had the <i>Claudia</i> affair when the Minister showed his eagerness to use the Army as a plaything, and when his presence was an embarrassment to the members of the Defence Forces and his throw-away, kick-up-the-transom remark was the cause of great amusement to those who would like to belittle the Army now.  That was possibly the first indication that he gave publicly that he is no fit man for the position he occupies. We had later a situation with regard to military promotions when he showed that, no matter what rules had to be bent or what toes trodden on, he wanted his own way with regard to the Army and he would not brook any interference in that respect.  This was another frightful blow to Army morale.  Quite recently the Army would not wait for him in the Glen of Imaal because he was late for a shoot that he had promised to attend, and they had to put up with his insulting remarks.  How the Minister <Col N="198" /> could make the remark that he made about our inability to control the 50-mile limit if granted, and remain in the office he now occupies, I do not understand.</P>
    <P>I have complaints from constituents every day that never was political patronage as rife in the Army as it is to-day during the term of office of the Minister, Patrick Donegan.  His recent shabby treatment of the Chief of Staff is enough to indicate that those who are manly enough to stand up to the Minister and endeavour to put him on the right track and point out his mistakes will be pushed aside. The Army should not be the plaything of any Minister.  No Minister before has ever endeavoured to play toy soldiers with it as much as the present Minister has.  The Parliamentary Secretary's remark that Deputy Donegan will be remembered as Minister for Defence is very true, but he will be remembered in the Curragh of Kildare and the Glen of Imaal and places like that not for the reasons that the Parliamentary Secretary would like that he should be remembered for.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Taoiseach this morning is quite in keeping with his remarks in the Dáil&mdash;not his prepared script, but when he departed from that recently and bared his soul a little which is most unusual for him. He explained the attitude of Fine Gael and how they survived the long years in the wilderness.  He spoke of nasty elements within our party and how we might weed or breed them out though it might take some time.  Then he appealed to the decent people in Fianna Fáil, and he stopped for a moment as if he wondered whether such a person could exist within the ranks of our party and he said: &ldquo;God knows, there are very few who think as little of Fianna Fáil as I do&rdquo;.  Those were the remarks of a man who is supposed to lead this nation.  Whether he likes it or not, when he refers to Fianna Fáil he refers to 50 per cent of the people, and possibly if he were manly enough to put it to the test in the morning he might find the percentage more than 50. <Col N="199" /> This is an indication of the smallness and pettiness of the man and of the attitude that exists in reference to the Army and within his own Cabinet.  If he wants any proof with regard to political patronage he could ask his Minister to let him have the list of those waiting for jobs in the Corps of Engineers, in Gormanston and the Curragh Camp in Kildare, when the Minister has finished with it himself and has culled out those who do not belong to his political persuasion.</P>
    <P>The President, whom we are fortunate enough to have to-day, was advanced by our party and was an agreed candidate.  The Government at that time had no one of the calibre and suitability to oppose him.  In the petty minds of the Cabinet to-day that still rankles, and therein lies the reason for the remarks the Minister has made.</P>
    <P>In a speech the Taoiseach made some time ago on the emergency legislation, he said that during the early days of Fine Gael we in Fianna Fáil had intimidated that party, rented a crowd and brought them in.  He used the phrase &ldquo;tanked them up&rdquo;.  That was the height of hypocrisy to me when sitting beside him was the super tanker of all time; yet the Minister chose to tar us with the brush that could readily be used in his own front bench.  I am satisfied that what is in sober comes out later, and that when the Minister spoke in Mullingar, he only gave public utterances to the remarks of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet.  That is what the people all over the country are saying.  The silence of the Ministers here today, the absence of the Minister who made the remark and the futile apologies of the Taoiseach give full credence to that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Cabinet, if they are to remove this frightful slight on the Presidency and on the institutions of our State, must stand up here and publicly apologise and dissociate themselves from this offence, and if the remarks are seen to have any substance at all the Minister must be <Col N="200" /> removed from the position he occupies.  Every day he remains in the Cabinet is a continuation of this cold, calculated Cabinet insult to the highest office in the land.  We are often reminded of collective Cabinet responsibility. Surely there is also collective Cabinet guilt.  The Ministers' collective silence is very cloquent here today.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary remarked here some time ago that he would choose Deputy Donegan for his hot-blooded, zealous outburst in preference to the coldness of the remarks that emanate from this side of the House.  The people who have approached me about this frightful outburst certainly would not pick Deputy Donegan; all the views lead to the one conclusion, that he should be got rid of straight away.  I know from the people who have spoken to me, ordinary people, members of the Defence Forces, that if they had an opportunity to vote for this motion that we have proposed to the House they would be in favour of it, and it could well be changed so that, instead of Dáil Éireann calling on the Taoiseach to remove the Minister, all Ireland calls on the Taoiseach to remove the Minister too.  The only pity is that the people of Ireland who feel so strongly about this cold, calculated insult would not get an opportunity to translate their feelings into action.  I, for one, and the people I represent would place as much credence on the apologies that were given here this morning and the apology we do not know about which was sent to the President as they place on the promises the Government made some years ago in their 14-point plan.</P>

      <P>This debate has been fairly well balanced.  As our Leader indicated at the beginning, it is not a question of our trying to be vindictive, but that we deplore the fact that it is necessary to have it.  However, it is necessary, and we would be lacking in our duty in Opposition if we did not take the steps we are taking in relation to what is, no matter how anybody else may try to describe it, a serious matter in regard to the institutions of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is noticeable that Ministers have <Col N="201" /> been silent, and we can only assume that they acquiesce by their silence Those who have spoken, and I refer particularly to the Parliamentary Secretary, have confirmed any suspicion we might have had in that respect.  He has simply stated&mdash;and it is on the record&mdash;that the President, in so far as he has a statutory function, is open to be criticised.  In other words, he defended the action of Deputy Donegan, the Minister for Defence, in the slanderous statement he has made. That gives this debate a new dimension. The Parliamentary Secretary went on to say that the function of the President is merely ceremonial and decorative, except in one or two matters, and on these matters he should be criticised like anybody else. He is trying to vindicate what the Minister for Defence had said, while at the same time pretending to regret the words he uttered.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is the person who is used by the Government on occasions of this kind to make statements which they themselves are not prepared to make, I think it is quite transparent what this is all about; the members of the Government are condoning what Deputy Donegan, the Minister for Defence, has said.  No other interpretation can be put on it, and the outburst from the Parliamentary Secretary tends to confirm that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary described the powers of the President as being ceremonial and decorative. The President signifies the complete authority and power of the Oireachtas. We have never in the history of this country&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the Members on both sides of this House&mdash;made any attack on a President or his functions.  In the last analysis, that authority derives from the attitude towards a particular institution.  The prestige that it gathers and enjoys is given to it by the loyalty and respect shown to it by the people.  In that way the Presidency epitomises the absolute authority and respect which is due to the Oireachtas.  That is eroded and seriously put to the test on this occasion.  The Minister's statement <Col N="202" /> is condoned by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach when, speaking for the Government, he says that the President is open to criticism like anybody else.  Do we then go on to criticise the President of the Supreme Court?  Do we attack the Judiciary who are not in a position to defend themselves in this House?  The respect that is due to them and the authority they wield derives entirely from the respect which the citizens, and particularly the Members of the Oireachtas, have shown them.  The same applies to the President.</P>
    <P>The people who occupy these positions may have had an active connection with politics in the past, and I think that applies to practically every member of the Judiciary. In spite of that, immediately they take up the important offices they hold, they get absolute respect and are completely free from political comment in this House or elsewhere by Members of this House and if there were such utterances, they would be looked on as a grave matter indeed.</P>
    <P>This situation is much more serious.  This statement was made in the presence of the members of the Defence Forces of which the Minister is an important part and relates to the man who is the acknowledged Supreme Commander.  When a Member of this House states here that the President's functions are only ceremonial and decorative, he is adding insult to injury, and it is regrettable that Deputy John Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary, should have made such a statement.  It throws new light on this whole debate and makes it more necessary than ever for the Taoiseach to ask for the resignation of the Minister. If the Minister has any respect for the Government of which he is a member, he will not wait until the Taoiseach asks for that resignation but will be prepared to offer it, and I am sure it will be accepted without hesitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally in replying to a debate of this nature, the proposer of the motion is expected <Col N="203" /> to deal with the case made against the motion.  Were it not for the intervention of Deputy John Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary, I would have to say to you, Sir, that no case had been made against my motion and therefore that I had nothing further to say.  The only reason I am standing on my feet is not so much that the Parliamentary Secretary has made a case against the motion, but rather the manner in which he attempted to defend in some way the action of the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>His defence of the Minister for Defence was like the Taoiseach's a rather pathetic one, not relevant to the matter we had been discussing. Instead, he sought to give us a lecture on constitutional law which might have been appropriate in the lecture hall of a university college but was certainly not appropriate to the situation we are discussing here now.  Having done that, he turned a tirade of personal abuse on my colleagues on the Front Bench and on me personally and brought in matters that had nothing to do with the remarks made by the Minister for Defence last Monday.  He sought to create a distinction between the incumbent of the Presidency and the duties that the present incumbent performed and the institution itself. I failed to get the point; the only thing I could get was that the incumbent in exercising his constitutional powers was open to criticism in his individual judgment in the exercise of these powers.  Let us take the corollary of that.  Assume that the President, having been criticised himself by a member of the Government, thought it proper to criticise the Government for the manner in which they exercised their functions and powers.  Is not that a reasonable corollary?  What then would be the position of the President?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary sought in some way to put the President in the same category as any Member of the House, any Government whose actions must be open to criticism but, more, who was able to defend <Col N="204" /> himself or itself against such criticism. The President is not in any way able to do that.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that there was no question of the President's institutional status being involved and he tried to establish this by means of some academic thinking.  This Constitution is permeated with the independence of and the placing above politics of the President in his constitutional position so that it does not matter who the incumbent of that office is, an attack upon or an insult offered to that incumbent must assuredly and inevitably be an attack upon and an insult to the Presidency, the institution itself.</P>
    <P>It is not so much the attack&mdash;and attack it was&mdash;that concerns us.  The burden of the case made by my colleagues today was the damage done by the Minister's remarks to the institution, to our Presidency, to our tenets of democracy.  The Parliamentary Secretary sought to suggest that this was an indiscretion, a throwaway remark. Deputy Power has just given an indication of the facts as they are understood by me.  I do not need to reiterate what he has said but a single indiscretion under stress, a mistaken expression of what the Minister may believe to be the attitude of his colleagues in the Government in regard to what the President had done in connection with the Emergency Powers Bill or a statement made in haste under pressure of questioning or criticism might have been understandable; but for the Minister to have announced in advance his intention of making a headline-winning criticism of the Head of the State who, under the Constitution is Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, whom he was addressing on that occasion, is hardly an unintentional indiscretion.  Having made it, as I think everybody is satisfied, deliberately and intentionally, he made it known that he was in fact damaging the institution of the Presidency, our concept of democracy and thereby put himself into a position that merited the action we propose in this resolution.</P>
    <P>If I may further refer to the Parliamentary Secretary's suggestion that no <Col N="205" /> institution of State had been damaged, when statements are made of a nature like that on this side of the House the Parliamentary Secretary is normally very meticulous and precise in examining what these statements mean.  But if he believes that the Presidency was not damaged in any way, what of the Supreme Court?  Was that not damaged by the remarks of the Minister for Defence who must be presumed to have been contemptuous of the Supreme Court which went out of its way to say that the President was quite right in submitting the Bill as to its constitutionality to the court?  That may be a small point but it is important, especially in relation to the assertion that no institution of the State was damaged by the Minister's remark.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence was not only insulting to the President but he was making a political speech about a person who under the Constitution is above and apart from politics to a group of people who similarly are, or should be, above and apart from politics.  He showed that he felt that the allegiance or duty of the Army should be ranged on his side against a perfectly legal and constitutional action taken by the President.  For a Minister for Defence, with all the power and influence of his office, to make clear to the Army that he assumed that they were ranged on one side of the political divide, ignoring completely the wishes of the 50 per cent&mdash;or more if we take Deputy Power's claim as correct, and I think it is&mdash;is, in itself, behaviour that would entitle him to condemnation and severe censure.</P>
    <P>That is only part of the story.  The real nub of the matter is that the Minister for Defence has deliberately and with malice aforethought insulted and criticised the President, the present incumbent of that office. <Col N="206" /> Whether the present incumbent can be separated from the office itself I do not know&mdash;that is a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary to work out in his own office&mdash;I am satisfied that he did in fact damage severely the institution of State which we know as the Presidency and which with the Oireachtas is part of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything was said by the Taoiseach that calls for any comment.  Because the apology was comprehensive and delivered in one way or another is not sufficient.  It does not mean that his indiscretion or whatever you like to call it should not be held against him because of his great performance as Minister for Defence.  Surely that is his function. It was not the Minister for Defence who built up the Army; it was built by the people themselves, the Oireachtas, the Opposition who, when in Government, had been building the Army and brought it to the strength at which the Minister found it when he came to office.</P>
    <P>No case whatever has been made by the Government in defence of the Minister for Defence.  Not one of his ministerial colleagues, other than the Taoiseach, who spoke ineptly in his defence, has spoken in the debate. No member of the Labour Party has spoken.  Indeed, with a few exceptions earlier in the morning, not one of them has been present in the House since the debate opened.  I do not know what significance that has, Sir, but if they are permitted to vote as I feel their consciences would direct them to vote, then we would have an end to the indiscretions.  Because of the disgraceful behaviour of the Minister for Defence the House should vote in favour of his removal from office by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said I fully supported the purpose, spirit and general principle of the Bill.  It could be improved to a greater extent and for this reason we intend submitting a number of amendments for consideration on Committee Stage. It is well known that in any country economic and technological progress while bringing much material wealth and benefit very often are accompanied by a deterioration of the environment.  It should be the aim of any policy for the protection of the environment to ensure that progress in industrial, agricultural and residential forms of development is not achieved at the cost of environmental damage.  With modern technological advances and proper planning of any development at the initial stage, there should be no inherent conflict between the maintenance of a good environment and the promotion of such development, as is evidenced in many places in the country.  The proper time to deal with a potential environmental hazard is at the planning stage when vital conditions can be attached to the granting of planning permission. One can assume from the contents of the Bill that the Government are giving priority to the area of water pollution.  They may well have been forced to do so as a result of an EEC directive on water quality standards. However, there are many other forms of pollution.  Directly and indirectly, they are tied with water pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to the day when another Bill is introduced to cover all these areas in a comprehensive fashion.  Such a Bill should include areas regarding methods of collection and disposal of trade and domestic refuse, the general prohibition of indiscriminate dumping of trade waste and of litter, the fixing of acceptable levels of noise and heat in industry or any place of work, the cleaning <Col N="210" /> of beaches, the disposal of and recycling of all forms of waste and the setting of quality standards for water in areas used for swimming.</P>
    <P>I have just given a few examples of areas that should be covered immediately by legislation.  It is well known that the extensive pollution of bathing places if unchecked is likely to increase.  I ask the House to bear in mind that a good deal of modern development takes place along our coastline.  It is of interest to note&mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is already aware of this but I would like it on the record of the House&mdash; that although we have approximately 3,500 miles of coastline, including estuaries, we have only 342 miles of sandy beach.  We should bear in mind the seriousness of the position especially when we take into account the fact that our bathing areas are found in only about 20 per cent of the total beach areas or 80 miles of beach in all.  In other words, there are only about 80 miles of beach areas out of our total coastline of 3,498 miles.  These areas constitute a real national asset, as do most of our inland waters.  It is a worthwhile national aim to see that they are preserved and protected.  I am amazed that this Bill does not provide for the systematic and continued monitoring of bathing places to enable the incidence of pollution to be detected at an early stage so that the necessary remedial measures can be taken.</P>
    <P>We all know the main causes of water pollution here and we should set out to eliminate them by legislation. There is pollution by industrial waste, domestic waste, agricultural waste, mining operations, turf production, detergents and waste discharges from ports and ships.  It is essential in my opinion that legislation to prevent water pollution should cover all these areas.</P>
    <P>There is a big difference of opinion as to who should operate the new controls.  The interdepartmental working group in their report, published in March, 1973, favoured control at local level, that is, control by county councils and county borough corporations. I would agree with this entirely <Col N="211" /> were it not for the fact that it is generally accepted that these councils in many instances are themselves probably the greatest polluters.  This has been borne out in fishery reports and in the report submitted by the interdepartmental working group. Neither would I agree that control should be handed over completely to a national board as is done in other countries.  Such an arrangement would present many problems.</P>
    <P>For local control there is no alternative to the county councils and county borough corporations being given the necessary control in legislation, but they should be subject to central Government control.  I also believe that the Minister for Local Government, as our administrative structure at present exists, should take full control and responsibility for the issue of licences to local authorities and supervising their anti-pollution campaigns.  Those licences should be issued to councils in the same way as the councils would issue them to individuals, firms, co-ops and creameries.  This would ensure that waters are kept up to the required standards.  It would also ensure that the councils carry out their responsibilities under this Bill to the general public and the nation as a whole in the same way as an individual or company would.  Should the county councils or county borough corporations fall down on the job of ensuring that their house is put in order, I believe this exercise would be futile.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the Minister for Local Government should take direct responsibility and issue licences to councils is in complete harmony with the Fianna Fáil Party's thinking on physical planning and the protection of the environment.  As the law stands at present, the buck can be passed from county councils and county borough corporations to the water pollution advisory council, various quality control authorities, and numerous Departments dealing with the environment.  I believe the buck must stop somewhere and the Minister for Local Government should accept full responsibility for the protection of the environment and the issue of licences to county councils and county <Col N="212" /> borough corporations in respect of their sewers and of trade and sewer effluents.</P>
    <P>We put down and fought unsuccessfully an amendment in this regard to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1976.  In my opinion it is to be regretted that the Minister would not and did not accept such a responsibility which Dáil Éireann were prepared to give him, namely, that he alone should be responsible for the protection and improvement of the natural environment of Ireland.  The problem at the moment is that there are too many Departments and organisations responsible for the environment.</P>
    <P>To prove my point that this is so there are at least 13 agencies responsible for this one area, an area of immensely valuable amenity affecting the quality of life not alone of our own nationals but of those who visit the country as tourists.  There is, first of all, the Department of Local Government responsible for general policy and legislation, for the clearance of oil spillages, the general supervision of local authorities, for the planning, financing and general control of water and sewerage programmes, for the allocation of grants for the installation of piped water, for planning appeals, for traffic, for air quality and emission standards.  You have the local authorities then who are the planning authorities, who supply and maintain public water and sewerage schemes, enforce conditions under the planning laws and prevent developments which pose a threat to the environment.  They are also responsible for community development and the disposal of both industrial and domestic refuse.</P>
    <P>The third agent is the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries responsible for the protection of fish, fishery waters and food.  The Department are also responsible for licensing discharges which might damage fish life. The Department have responsibility for guiding and supporting boards of fishery conservators.  They have power to help in salmon research through the Salmon Research Trust and they also help the Inland Fishery Trust.  They have a certain responsibility where <Col N="213" /> silage effluent, farmyard waste disposal and the use of artificial manures are concerned.  They have responsibility in the operation of creameries and milk processing factories.  They have responsibility for farm building grants and advisory services.</P>
    <P>The fourth agent is the Department of Industry and Commerce, including the IDA, with responsibility for industrial development and the development of our mineral resources. As far as industrial development is concerned the Department play a vital role in environmental matters.</P>
    <P>Fifth, there is the Department of Transport and Power also involved in environmental matters.  They have a responsibility in relation to oil pollution of the sea, for implementing the Foreshore Act, 1933, for fuel and power policy and for the effect deterioration of the environment would have on tourism.  The Department have responsibility for the ESB and the ESB are the owners of fisheries and waters vested in power stations. The Department have responsibility for harbour authorities and Aer Lingus and are therefore deeply concerned with noise as a pollutant.</P>
    <P>Sixth, there is the Department of Health who have responsibility in regard to health hazards and the control of toxic substances.  No.7 is the Department of Finance with overall financial control in practically all aspects of environmental problems because major grants and loans have to be sanctioned by that Department.</P>
    <P>No. 8 is the Department of Lands who play a very important role in the conservation and protection of wild life, in water pollution, in forestry development and nature trails.</P>
    <P>There is the Office of Public Works involved in arterial drainage and the prevention of the dumping of solid matter in rivers and streams.  The Office of Public Works are responsible for our national parks and for the operation of the Shannon Navigation Act, 1939.  An Foras Forbartha are responsible for environmental research. An Foras Talúntais, No. 11, are responsible for many farming activities, for advice, for setting <Col N="214" /> standards, for farm equipment and farmyard layout.  No. 12 is the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards who act in an advisory capacity in the setting of standards for the IDA.  Finally there is the IDA. That body has power to give grants for industrial treatment plants.</P>
    <P>All these bodies should be amalgamated and all environmental matters should be under the control of one Department.  Protection of the environment is the very foundation of our tourist industry and it is vitally important that everything should be done to ensure the very highest standards. The preservation of the environment is essential to the future of the industry. In fact, the environment faces serve threats, such as water pollution from agricultural, urban and industrial effluent.  There is the destruction of cities, towns, and villages through ill-conceived planning.</P>
    <P>No matter from what angle one looks at it the preservation of the environment from the point of view of the tourist industry is a vitally important factor that must be taken into consideration.  We should ensure that our beaches are kept clean and tidy and that our anti-litter campaign will be developed.</P>
    <P>No generation has the right to use the environment for its own benefit and no one person has the right for his own material gain to despoil the natural environment by cornering for himself scenic amenity areas at the expense of future generations. It behoves all of us, particularly Members of the Oireachtas, to ensure that our natural environment, no matter in which areas, should be preserved and improved for the benefit of future generations.</P>
    <P>In this country we have too many small overworked sewage plants from which effluent seeps through the land into streams, rivers and eventually lakes.  On the question of refuse disposal, both domestic and trade, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government must consider the establishment of large incinerators in Dublin and Cork.  There should be a continuous, not a seasonal, market for waste paper which has a detrimental  <Col N="215" /> effect on the environment when it is not purchased and disposed of.  All these matters are tied in with water pollution because waste materials of all descriptions find their way into waterways and lakes unless properly handled.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves how serious is the water pollution problem in Ireland.  I believe it is getting progressively worse.  I read some time ago a report of a conference on water pollution control which stated that in 1973, 61 lakes and rivers were polluted and that public apathy is the cause of much of the pollution. The report stated that in 1973 it would have cost about £35 million for county councils and county borough councils to clear up the problem within their functional areas. With the rapid rate of inflation in the meantime and the deterioration caused by over-loading existing sewage plants, it would now cost approximately £100 million to enable local authorities to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary blamed the lack of funds in recent years for the present position.  We have to remember that in some counties&mdash; I have a particular county in mind &mdash;no new sewerage scheme has been approved during the past three years although the Department and the Minister have been under much pressure from the local authorities concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave figures for expenditure on sanitary services each year since 1972 and I should like to get a breakdown of the amounts as between sewerage and water schemes.  Taking inflation into account, it will be found there has been no substantial increase in expenditure for sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>The manner in which refuse dumps are maintained, controlled and developed by many local authorities is a disgrace.  In some cases dumps are adjacent to streams and rivers and the effluent seeps into them and into lakes.  Many of the dumps are rat-infested, particularly by water rats, and this creates a serious health hazard.  There should be a complete <Col N="216" /> new policy and direction on the development, control and maintenance of refuse dumps.  I suggest that we should take a lesson from a system which has been worked fairly well in some European countries and in parts of the US, particularly where there are forests.  Most counties here have forests now and there should be established in these forests a central dump with machinery continuously employed filling them in.  I understand in some countries as they clear a piece of forest the authorities fill in the refuse dump at the other end and replant that area so that there is no real wastage of ground at all.  The Department of Local Government should examine this system very closely.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister appoint and train about eight environmental officers and assign them on a regional basis.  Those people should be trained in all aspects relating to the protection and preservation of the environment, particularly in anti-pollution measures of all descriptions. If one of those specially trained environmental officers is assigned to each regional development board district he can supervise the activities of the authorities within that area. The IDA's regional managers are assigned to each regional development board district and each regional development organisation have their own managers.  Those fully trained environmental officers could be the watch dogs for the Minister in relation to any licensing arrangements between his Department and the local councils.</P>
    <P>The disposal of waste oil and the dumping of oil at sea is causing great concern as far as water pollution is concerned.  We have had many instances where our waters and beaches have been heavily polluted by indiscriminate dumping of oil by large vessels far out at sea.  The fifth report on the Developments in the European Communities refers to an EEC directive on the disposal of waste oil.  I understand this directive was approved by the Council in November, 1974 and that member states have two years to implement <Col N="217" /> the provisions of the directive. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us what steps are being taken to implement this directive with regard to the disposal of waste oil and what steps are being taken to bring in legislation to control the dumping of oil at sea, although this may be a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.  Waste oil seeps into rivers, streams and lakes from bogs where heavy turf cutting and other types of machinery consume large quantities of oil during their operations.  This matter should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Young people should be educated in relation to the protection of the environment and reporting any matters which they consider appear to pollute water.  Public apathy has been blamed by some people for the lack of action at governmental level in relation to the environment.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill should be improved considerably.  The provision setting up the water pollution advisory body should be strengthened.  More teeth should be given to this body and the regulations setting it up should be strengthened.  I am very concerned about section 3 (3) where I believe there is a let-out clause whereby if a person pleads that he took reasonable steps to prevent the pollution of water he is acquitted, that it shall be a good defence for him to prove this.  I am slightly worried about this provision, and we will debate it on Committee Stage.  I am concerned too about the fact that it appears that local authorities who pollute cannot be prosecuted under the Bill.  This is more serious than the fact that a polluter who successfully pleads that he took all reasonable steps cannot be convicted. We should make sure that there is no doubt that any local authority who pollutes our lakes can be prosecuted.  It is essential in relation to the system for monitoring the standard of water that there should be a central laboratory, otherwise councils will incur colossal debts for equipment for the setting up of laboratories and for the employment of technical staff.  A central laboratory could carry out the tests and send reports back to the councils.  There <Col N="218" /> are many detailed matters which I intend to raise on the Committee Stage.  Certainly the Water Pollution Advisory Council must be strict.  I am not happy about the exemptions in section 3, subsection (5) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4, subsection (12), is very hard to comprehend.  It states that</P>
    <P>A person shall not be entitled solely by reason of a licence under this section to discharge, or cause or permit the discharge of, trade effluent or sewage effluent to waters.</P>
    <P>There are numerous provisions in this Bill about which I am not too happy and we on this side of the House intend to discuss these matters in detail on the Committee Stage.  When this Bill is finally passed there should be no doubt that all appeals should go on to An Bord Pleanála instead of to the Minister.  The quality standards as laid down in the EEC directives are reasonable standards to be followed.  I hope there will be no conflict between the water quality control authorities and the local authorities or the councils and that the councils within the area of these new authorities will have proper representation on the water quality control boards both at management and at membership level. It is very important that the councils should have fair representation on these boards.  The fishery interests should also have fair representation. Water pollution is the cause of great damage to fish life and causes fish disease.  If good spawning grounds become polluted our fish stocks could be depleted and as a result inland fisheries will suffer and tourism will suffer. Therefore it is important that fishery interests be represented and that they use this Bill to the maximum when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a start to environmental legislation.  It is known that there are numerous EEC directives on the way which must be acted upon by the Government. They are probably in draft form at the moment.  But apart from that it is of vital importance that all the legislation relating to the protection of the environment should be codified. I look forward to the day when a comprehensive Bill codifying all this <Col N="219" /> legislation is brought before this House.</P>

      <P>In introducing this Bill the Parliamentary Secretary said that he expected little objection to the main principles.  I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary's expectations will be fulfilled.  We on this side of the House are anxious to conserve our water supplies and to preserve them from pollution and we have shown our concern in this respect over the years.  We are particularly anxious that the desirable actions which might be taken under the terms of this Bill will be taken.</P>
      <P>We should like clarification of some aspects of this Bill which are not clear to us.  The effects of technological development in recent years remind me of the moral in the famous story, &ldquo;The Monkey's Paw&rdquo;, by W. W. Jacobs.  In that story the person who held the monkey's paw in his hand was granted three wishes.  These three wishes were always fulfilled but the fulfilment of each would bring with it certain undesirable and even tragic consequences.  In like manner the technological advances we have experienced in our own lifetime have bestowed very considerable blessings. They have improved out of all knowing the standard of living of our people and of people in the developed areas of the world.  They are also helping to raise the standards of those who live in undeveloped areas.  On the other hand, they have brought in their wake very considerable problems, putting the environment at serious risk and if not checked, they could negative the benefits to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this country have an opportunity to protect and conserve the environment, an opportunity which has not been granted to the same extent, at any rate, to the more industrialised countries of the world. In Ireland for historical reasons, industrial development came much later than in many of our neighbouring countries.  Therefore we can learn much from the mistakes they made and the successes achieved by them in combating pollution problems.  Because of our late entry into the industrial <Col N="220" /> field, fortunately we have much which is worthy of attention left to us.  Industrial countries that woke up to the problem late in their industrial development found that much that had been beautiful in the environment had already been destroyed.  At least we are fortunate in this respect, in that many such beautiful things remain intact.</P>
    <P>It is particularly fortunate in one sense that only in very recent times have we begun to develop our mineral resources because we are in good time to take the necessary measures to ensure that as little environmental damage as possible will be done.  When one notes the ravages which resulted from similar-type development in Britain and other mining countries one appreciates how necessary it is that we pay particular care to this aspect of our industrial development.  It is a development we are all anxious to see go ahead.  We are in the satisfactory position that while on the one hand we can develop, on the other we can retain the beauty and value of our environment.</P>
    <P>Also because of our late entry into the area of industrialisation we are afforded a worth-while opportunity of controlling pollution.  However, it is equally true that there is a considerable amount of industrial development and development of our natural resources ahead of us if we are to absorb into employment the very large numbers of unemployed people, including the thousands of young people who recently left school and who have had no jobs over the past couple of years.  The provision of new jobs in the industrial area and the development of our natural resources are of vital necessity.  But this very action will bring pollution problems in its wake.  Quite obviously there is no time to be lost in preparing to combat these problems. Here we can profit from the experience of other countries as well as from the considerable research carried out by ourselves in this field.  The siting of certain types of industry invariably gives rise to conflicting and sometimes diametrically-opposed <Col N="221" /> groups&mdash;on the one hand, the conservationists and, on the other, those who see the creation of jobs as the first priority.  I feel there is no need for this type of confrontation in many instances. Educating people on the facts, and not the myths on which much of the opposition is based, should be a priority.  Industrial development has to continue in this country, but at the same time we must ensure that the quality of life is maintained and improved.</P>
    <P>We in the Fianna Fáil Party are particularly concerned about the whole question of the protection of the environment.  We are considering the setting up of a Department for the protection of the environment to spearhead the attack on pollution, to co-ordinate the workings of other Departments, where such Departments are concerned with environmental protection, I am only too well aware of the constant struggles taking place between Departments having a responsibility in this field as to who controls what.  It is not sufficient simply to set up an inter-departmental committee to overcome that type of problem.  During our time in office there were committees whose responsibility it was to endeavour to overcome the conflicting views of the various Departments. They succeeded to some extent. Nevertheless, we are convinced it is essential that there be a Department of the Environment set up for the purposes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The setting up of such a Department would be nothing new.  Such Departments have already been set up in many countries, in Canada, New Zealand, Britain and others.  I understand that the position in New Zealand is much as it is here, in the sense that there are several Departments bearing responsibility in relation to the protection of the environment. What we had in mind was the setting up of a Department which would not unnecessarily disturb existing administrative structures but rather would have authority in its own right and would act to co-ordinate the <Col N="222" /> efforts of other Departments having a responsibilty in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have referred briefly to environmental problems generally.  In this Bill we are dealing with a particular aspect, that is, water pollution.  It is some time now since western European countries began to show concern for the protection of the environment. It is true to say that the obvious need to protect fresh water from pollution highlighted the need to protect the environment as a whole.</P>

Can we take it that they will not be stuck for cash because, as the Minister knows, this is a very important board for the education of farmers, whether they work on their own farms or have to look for jobs?

      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that there is very serious unemployment in Limerick city and that this contract is at least a semi-permanent one that would give worth-while employment in an abattoir that is under-utilised at the moment?  It has to be subvented by the ratepayers because it is losing between £30,000 to £40,000 per annum.  In these circumstances would the Minister reconsider his decision about the corporation's application for an export licence?</P>

      <P>I would ask the Deputy if he is aware that originally when the abattoir was being built they were told that it could not qualify for export trade.  No other abattoir in the country is allowed to be used for export trade and that is a good decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of experience of this during the years. The only abattoir that ever had such a facility was Dublin and I saw the occasions when what I would call fly-by-night operators were involved. When the trade was good abroad and when there was a demand for sheep meat they dived in with no capital expense or investment and they unscrupulously carried on trade.  Old mountainy sheep carcases were sent from this country as lamb and an immense amount of damage was done to the export trade.  The people concerned were able to get out because their reputation did not matter and they were not leaving any investment behind them.  It would be very bad to start using municipal abattoirs because of the facility they provide for people who have no experience of processing or exporting carcase meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in this case the contract has been obtained by a reputable and substantial co-operative in County Limerick that is not a fly-by-night operation?  Would the Minister grant an export licence limited to this co-op and to this contract?  I do not want to name them but they are a nationally known co-op that have been in existence for many years and, hopefully, will be here for many more years.  Will the Minister allow them to avail of this opportunity?  Will he allow the most depressed city in Ireland in terms of unemployment, that has lost umpteen factories, to avail of the opportunity now there and also to save the ratepayers of Limerick a figure between £30,000 and £40,000 a year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel so strongly about this matter that I have refused every public representative in Limerick and I think the Deputy knows that.  I <Col N="225" /> have had approaches from Deputy Coughlan, from the Minister for the Gaeltacht and from Senator Russell. This has been going on over a long period.  I am totally opposed to it because of the history of this whole business.  In addition it is completely unrealistic for them to say that they are going to slaughter 5,000 sheep per week.  That would represent 60 per cent of the total slaughtering in all the abattoirs in the country.  How can they get 5,000 sheep each week in Limerick?  It is just not possible.  No matter how reputable a firm they may be, and whether they are a co-operative, that number of sheep is not there.</P>

      <P>I cannot say what was the position obtaining at the time I mentioned because I am going back some time.  It is true that there is an inspector in the abattoir but it is amazing the way things can happen. Sheep meat can get out of the factory on the pretence that it is for other purposes, for instance, that it is for supplying the local area and it may be exported subsequently.  It is a very difficult business.  I would not be so firm on this if I did not believe it undesirable to allow it to happen.</P>

At least prior to this the beasts were collected in lorries hired by the Department for removal to the factories.  Presumably the vehicles were disinfected after each load whereas a small producer who is found to have one or two reactors might transport those animals a distance of 30 or 40 miles in a trailer attached to the back of his car and might be negligent regarding the disinfecting of the trailer afterwards.</P>

One of the peculiar features of the whole eradication effort in Europe is that, while it is all right to use the flesh of these cattle on a national basis, it is not in order for them to be consumed in other member states.  For example, cattle here which may be classified as having TB although they may have no lesions <Col N="229" /> can be eaten on the home market but not on the markets of the other member states.

A series of measures designed to deal with youth employment and training have been introduced. These include the expansion of the activities of AnCO to enable 9,000 people to be trained in 1976, the introduction and expansion of the community youth training programme, and the introduction of the carrer training programme.

      <P>Consideration has been given to the question of the inclusion of the construction industry but it has been decided that the programme could not be appropriately extended to that industry for the reason that it would not be possible to provide satisfactory and adequate safeguards against possible frauds.  The question of the inclusion of the service sector has also been examined.  It would not have been possible to extend the scope of the programme to all sectors of the economy and, accordingly, the programme was confined to those industries hardest hit by recession.  In addition the service sector has a somewhat seasonal employment element and payment of premiums might, it was considered, involve subsidisation of normal seasonal increases which it was wished to avoid.</P>

There is, however, the survey to which I referred in my original reply carried out by the National Manpower Service in 1976 of the 1975 second-level school leavers.  This revealed that seven per cent of the 48,477 covered by that survey were still unemployed.  The number who found employment was 49 per cent.  Other listings are: Returned to school, 8 per cent; got jobs on family farm or were not seeking employment, 5 per cent; emigrated, 2 per cent; went on to full-time higher education, 19 per cent; destination not known to the schools, 10 per cent.

The Minister maintains quota restrictions against imports from 16 low cost countries and his Department participated in discussions which resulted in agreements between the EEC and certain third countries to regulate trade in clothing and footwear. Following an investigation by the Dumping Commission, the Minister imposed anti-dumping duties on certain clothing imports.</P>

      <P>There are, of course, elements common to our positions but the British Government have other and wider interests to which they give a high priority.  Obviously, it would be inappropriate for me to speak for the British Government in the matter and perhaps the best thing would be for me to put into the Library of the House the statement made by Mr. Hattersley, then Minister of State of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at a meeting of the European Council of Ministers on 4th May, 1976, which has been confirmed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. Millan, on 13th October, 1976, as remaining the British position.  It is better to let the British Government speak for themselves than for me to seek to speak for them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, having regard to the extension of the fishery limits by American, Canadian, Icelandic and Norwegian Governments, there would be a strong desire on the part of the British Government to accommodate the displaced fishermen who had been fishing in those areas in alternative fisheries such as the Irish fishery waters?  Is it not perfectly clear from the general British stance on the matter that the British Government are seeking at least quota facilities within the Irish 50-mile limit fishery waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is in no way clear at this stage.  What the British Government are seeking, among other things, together with other members of the Community are mandates for negotiation with the countries mentioned by the Deputy to enable their fishermen to continue to fish there.  That is what is clear.  It is not at all clear that the position is as stated by the Deputy.

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the recent EEC communique on the prospects of a 12-mile fishing limit, he will now make a statement of unilateral intent to declare a 50-mile exclusive fishing limit for Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>EEC Council Regulation 2141 of 1970, which was adopted prior to our accession to the European Community, laid down a general principle of equal access for all member states to each others' coastal waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty of Accession provided for certain derogations from this <Col N="248" /> principle which in the case of Ireland allow us to restrict fishing to Irish fishermen in the inner six mile belt around our coast and in the outer six mile belt from Lough Foyle to Cork Harbour.  We may also, and in fact do, restrict to Irish fishermen fishing for shellfish in the outer six mile belt between Carlingford Lough and Carnsore Point.  These derogations are due to expire on 31st December, 1982. Certain countries have traditional rights in the outer six mile belt under the London Convention of 1964.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that the Common Fisheries Policy is being reviewed in the light of the general movement towards extending national fishing limits to 200 miles.  In the negotiations we have been seeking to secure a guarantee of the future development of the Irish fishing industry and as a means towards this end have proposed for Ireland an exclusive national band of up to 50 miles subject to provision for the exercise of traditional rights by other member states' artisanal fishermen with boats of a limited size in the outer part of this band.  The Deputy will appreciate however that there exists no legal competence on our part to declare such a zone unilaterally <i>vis-á-vis</i> vessels from other Community states.</P>
    <P>We are prepared and indeed anxious to extend in common with the other member states of the Community our fishery limits to 200 miles from 1st January, 1977.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles is a national prerogative supposed to be exercised by the State itself.  The fishery zones thus created, if this action is taken by all member states of the Community are, however, under the terms of the 1970 regulations in the Accession Treaty subject to the operation of the Common Fisheries Policy as set out in those <Col N="250" /> negotiations.  While we can unilaterally extend the 200 miles, the zones thus created are subject to the common fisheries policy and are not capable of being dealt with unilaterally by us once they come into existence.</P>

      <P>What is the present policy of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of our policy is to protect existing fish stocks which in a number of instances have been seriously affected. The extent to which they have been affected is not widely realised.  For example, herring catches in the Celtic Sea have fallen from 19,000 tons in 1970-71 to 6,500 tons in 1975-76, which represents a fall of over 65 per cent.  The stock position is serious because of over-fishing immediately outside our present limits.  Obviously the question of ensuring adequate conservation is a vital part of the current negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that on entering the EEC we had to accept the Common Fisheries Policy as it then operated; but that being on the inside we are now in a much stronger position to fight for the rights of our fishermen?  Would the Minister also accept that if the Government had been taking the steps suggested in this House we would have a much stronger hand to deal with the EEC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment on whether different terms could have been secured in the negotiations.  I have no information on that matter.  I have not had the time to seek ammunition to give the Opposition that point.  The facts we face are that the terms negotiated give us no protection from 1982 onwards and our problem is to put that right.  In seeking to put that right we start from a difficult position because the other member states know that, if these present negotiations do not succeed and if they simply wait it out and ignore the case we are making, they will find themselves in 1982 in the advantageous position secured by the Accession Treaty.  Our job is to try to renegotiate in the present circumstances of the extension to 200 miles, using what <Col N="251" /> bargaining counters come to hand in the new situation to retrieve the position which we inherited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The obvious need to protect fresh water against pollution highlighted the need to protect the environment as a whole.  For too long the existence of what appeared to be large quantities of water of a high quality created the general impression that all was well.  When Governments began to recognise that supplies were limited, particularly in this technological age, they realised that it was vital to make the best possible use of the available water.  They wakened to the need to limit the pollution of fresh water and to establish measures for its management.  I referred specifically to the technological age because it was at that time, when the usage of water increased immensely, that the rapid deterioration of the environment took place.  The pollution of fresh water, with its obvious physical signs, alerted the public to environmental problems in general.  If as has already been recognised, water is limited in quantity, then the restriction on supplies caused by pollution could be disastrous.  Therefore decisions were taken in many countries to legislate for water management.  We have been tardy in bringing in the necessary legislation.  Perhaps this relates to the fact that for quite some time our problems were not as acute as the problems elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this side of the House we have some fears about the efficacy of the Bill because it grants powers only to local authorities to take action to control pollution.  It could be said that the activities of local authorities to date do not give room for optimism.  There are other options open to the Government. As the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="253" /> said, it may be decided that these options should be availed of in future. The problem is that we are not certain whether local authorities were the accepted authorities on the basis that they were already in existence or whether the Minister and his Department believed that the local authorities were the best organisations to use.</P>
    <P>As this is a serious problem, we should concern ourselves with controlling the spread of pollution.  The local authorities have been given a large share of the responsibility for the control of pollution.  I first tended to take the view that this was like setting a thief to catch a thief.  None of us can be proud of our performance in the past in regard to pollution.  Indeed, Deputy O'Leary mentioned that local authorities have been serious offenders in the past.  The advisory body have stated that this Bill represents a significant improvement on past legislation. Were it not an improvement on past legislation we should be wasting the time of the House discussing the Bill. We must be satisfied that the Bill will bring this problem under control.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that the excellent Summer has highlighted the problem of pollution.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the low level of the rivers.  In addition to the low level of the rivers the seepage from silage pits and from slurry containers into rivers which are sources of water supply for many towns and villages has played havoc with supplies.  The supply in my own constituency of Clogherhead in County Louth became so polluted it was declared unsafe for human consumption.</P>
    <P>This, unfortunately, happened at the height of the tourist season.  The situation was so bad that even when the health authority declared that the water was again safe for human consumption few in the village were satisfied to drink it so frightened were they of the fact that a product such as paraquat could have been in the water. The taking of paraquat could result in death.  That case underlines the need to inspect the water supplies to our villages and towns and to endeavour to anticipate the problems of this kind rather than waiting until the problem <Col N="254" /> occurs and then taking action.  This would cost money but money must be found if we are to deal effectively with the whole problem of water pollution.</P>
    <P>Where a local authority is responsible for such a water supply and where it will mean considerable extra expense for this authority to carry out its obligations under this Bill, can we assume that it is likely to act expeditiously if it is not assured that money will be made available to carry out its obligations?  I am anxious to know what type of financial assistance will be available to the authorities under the Bill.  It is proposed to exempt discharges from sewers from licence control under the Bill and I can understand the reasoning for this. I suppose it would look rather silly if the licensing authority had to licence itself.  But at the same time, because of the fact that control of discharge from public sewers is important, we cannot afford to leave it to the discretion of each local authority whether they would look after in a proper manner the discharge from these sewers.  Failure of even one local authority to carry out its proper function in this field would have serious consequences.  There is another reason why I feel we should consider that exemption and that is by insisting on licensing in this area we would bring the local authority within the ambit of the regulations laid down. We would keep them on their toes and see to it that they would not only be concerning themselves about pollution caused by other persons but also with pollution caused by themselves.</P>
    <P>At present from a legal point of view the position is that a victim of pollution is only able to obtain redress if he takes action under the law of civil liability.  This refers to all types of pollution&mdash;water, air and noise.  Such action was supposed to act as a deterrent, but even before the relatively recent intensification of pollution generally this was ineffective.  I can recall a case in my constituency where the victims of pollution took court action but by that stage the damage was done.  Of course the taking of such action by an individual is an expensive matter and it is usually an individual against a large concern which is more <Col N="255" /> able to carry the cost.  It is now accepted that such action is not preventative and the introduction of this legislation by the Minister points to the fact that he accepts this.  I should like to add that when an individual takes such action he may find that because of his limited resources it may be impossible for him to prove the identification of the polluter, because it is now known that a variety of pollutants interact on one another and the type of pollution changes form and therefore is difficult to identify.</P>
    <P>Modern society is much dependent on surface water for waste disposal and the use of fresh water for agriculture and industry.  It is difficult therefore to impose an absolute prohibition on any pollutant.  What means will the Minister place at the disposal of the local authority to deal with pollutants before they enter our rivers, streams and lakes?  We can learn a considerable amount from the way these matters are dealt with in other countries which have great experience in this field.  I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department have been concerned about this.  I believe it is by no means sufficient to rely on deterrents such as fines.  I agree that fines are necessary as also is the withdrawal of licences and permits where appropriate.  The Minister should try to visualise a situation where an industry is providing a large volume of employment and where a heavy fine or the removal of a permit might result in closing such an industry temporarily or permanently. Theoretically it is easy to say that where such an industry persists in breaking the law it must accept the penalties, but the practicalities of it are that a Government faced with the prospect of large scale unemployment would be more likely to be swayed by that fact rather than environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the need for the development of all technological aids to be put at the disposal of industry and agriculture so as to avert such a situation. The Minister proposes to give power to a local authority charged with responsibilities in relation to <Col N="256" /> pollution of fresh water to take action outside the confines of the area for which it has authority if it believes that the source of the pollution is from outside.  This is a good section; it is reasonable.  But I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has had any discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities on this matter.  Will there be any co-operation in this field with them?  Many of our rivers and streams have their sources in Northern Ireland, and obviously the authority granted in this Bill to take action outside a local authority domain will not apply in Northern Ireland.  I should like to know what the Parliamentary Secretary can do to ensure that where pollutants enter streams in Northern Ireland there will be co-operation between both sides to reduce the damage done.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that local authorities have endeavoured to have a certain amount of co-operation across the Border, although not successfully.  If we are to concern ourselves with the country as a whole it is essential that we should have the necessary co-operation in this field.  Penal sanctions are being imposed on those responsible for polluting our waters and this is as it should be.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary should set in motion a campaign designed to show the great value of the environment and the elements which go to its making.  This would encourage a positive approach by those involved to see the value of protecting the environment and would be more valuable in relation to overcoming environmental problems than sanctions can ever be in the long term. It is necessary to create a consciousness of the real and worth-while benefits accruing to the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that for a very long time the environment was regarded as not having any economic or social value or significance.  It was only when we began to realise that the various elements of which our environment consists were in danger, beginning as I said earlier with the recognition of the dangers of water pollution that we began to appreciate the immense value <Col N="257" /> and exceptional contribution they made towards the quality of life as we know it and to appreciate the disaster which would quickly overtake our mode of life if pollution were allowed to continue unabated.  The Parliamentary Secretary at some stage said that the water pollution advisory council had something like this in hands.  I have not seen the exhibition to which he referred but it would be very useful if we knew exactly what the council were doing in relation to that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>On the management side it is essential that public authorities, on whom the responsibility will now devolve, should endeavour to ensure that available fresh water is used in the best possible way to satisfy the needs of the people and of industry.  They must arrange that the quality of water is not unnecessarily impaired.  As I mentioned a few moments ago, there is a growing realisation of the psychological, economic and social value of the natural environment.  Therefore, apart from any other consideration, the need to protect our rivers and lakes as essential elements of the countryside is being appreciated.  At a time when the stresses and strains of modern living are so intense, anything that will ease these tensions and provide for a better and fuller life is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have been surveying our water resources and monitoring the conditions of fresh water.  In 1969 a water resource division was set up in An Foras Forbartha and the country's major water courses have been catalogued and the level of pollution ascertained.  The work done in this field by An Foras has been excellent and provides us with the kind of information that is helpful in identifying what action must be taken as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>If I might for a moment revert to the point I was making about the assistance needed to help purify waste water, I would again like to point out that it is not enough to prohibit the discharge of pollution into rivers, streams and lakes, but we must provide, where possible, for the elimination of such subjects.  Obviously water <Col N="258" /> must be used by people, by agriculture and industry and a solution could be to purify waste water.  I admit that this is a very costly affair and I do not know if it is necessary in Ireland.  It would be necessary to give a considerable amount of financial assistance to local authorities concerned with responsibility in this field.  It would also be necessary to give financial assistance to industries responsible for the discharge of pollutants into rivers and lakes so that they could do their duty to avoid pollution.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of considerable urgency.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to introduce rules and regulations to control effluents and for sanctions where they are contravened, and at the same time not to make provision for assisting financially these local authorities and industries to provide for sewage disposal and sewage treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister decided that the local sanitary authorities will be responsible for operating the regulations when this Bill becomes an Act.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary given any consideration to giving some type of representation on these bodies, for this purpose only, to representatives of industry who are very large users of water and who are responsible for quite an amount of pollution?  It would be a very worth-while exercise to involve in some way such groups in our efforts to overcome pollution problems. If they were given some right to participate in our efforts to overcome pollution problems they would get a broader view of the problems than they previously held.  To them it would no longer be a purely sectional interest but something which affects everybody in the country including themselves.</P>
    <P>What I have said already about fresh water pollution applies in equal measure to the protection of the air, the countryside, wild flora and fauna and so on.  It is disappointing that at this stage we in Ireland are only making a beginning, and that in reference to water only.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would let me know what discussions have <Col N="259" /> taken place with his opposite numbers in other countries where a considerable amount of work has been done to control pollution, what information he has gleaned and how it can be of assistance to him.  A considerable amount of study and research have been carried out in western Europe into these problems, into noxiousness of effluents containing a variety of metals, into the effects flowing from certain highly polluting branches of industry with very special environmental problems, the effects of detergents in water and so on.  As I said before, we can learn a considerable amount from other countries.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know what study has been made in respect of the effect of pollution on bathing areas, in both fresh and sea waters and its effects on fish life, including shellfish.  If we are to know were we are going it is vital that these studies be carried out and that we learn from successful efforts at home and abroad how to continue our treatment and our efforts to overcome the whole problem of water pollution.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a very close connection between fresh water pollution and the pollution of certain areas of the sea, the discharge through rivers and estuaries being one of the main sources of marine pollution.  This is also covered in the Bill.  Therefore, it is essential to study the problems of both together and in this way help the authorities responsible for water pollution in rivers and lakes in their area also to control pollution in their coastal area.  The methods used to control pollution would be basically the same, irrespective of the type of area in which the pollution occurred, and it would not be possible to deal in isolation with marine pollution in so far as this is caused by polluted rivers.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter which has already been raised by Deputy O'Leary is that this country is very dependent on tourism.  Because <Col N="260" /> of that we must be especially concerned about pollution of our beaches which could result in the destruction of bathing facilities. The same is true to some extent in relation to rivers and lakes.  From the point of view of our tourist industry we must ensure the preservation of marine life.  This, of course, is vitally important where our fishermen are concerned, apart altogether from the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to marine pollution, it is interesting to note that when concern was first expressed about a growing pollution problem in our rivers and lakes little concern was shown for the same problem in regard to the sea.  It was apparently considered large enough to act as a recipient of all kinds of waste.  We are only too well aware now that this conclusion was incorrect and the seas and oceans are in much greater danger from pollution than we thought.  Some years ago at a conference in Helsinki I was told that the Baltic was severely polluted and was causing a great deal of worry to those countries bordering on it.</P>
    <P>As I said, we know now that fresh waters and the seas are not isolated. We know that discharges from rivers are one of the main sources of pollution of the seas.  It is a fact that results achieved in dealing with fresh water pollution can be applied to marine pollution and, of course, the opposite is equally true.  Quite obviously the preservation and enhancement of the quality of the marine environment is highly desirable and every effort should be made to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The greatest pollutant of our waters is untreated domestic and urban sewerage.  We have had a report on this as a result of a survey initiated by a former Minister for Local Government. The bulk of the pollutants come from synthetic detergents and human waste.  The dangers to health are obvious and the damage done to the quality of life does not need to be described.  We have all had experience of it.  When one looks at the condition of our larger rivers and at many of our streams one can only regard the situation as deplorable.  In the past many <Col N="261" /> poems were written about the sparkling waters in our rivers and streams. Looking at the havoc now one can only wonder how it was possible to write in that manner about our rivers and streams.  The health hazard is obvious.  The danger to fish and vegetation is equally obvious.  Both find it difficult to survive in some instances.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, industrialists, farmers and others who have a responsibility in this regard should shoulder that responsibility.  Every effort must be made to ensure that regulations designed to reduce the dangers attendant on pollution are observed.  I am aware that it has been possible statistically to point out that the serious water pollution rate in our rivers was 7 per cent.  We must remind ourselves that this survey was undertaken back in 1971 and a considerable deterioration has taken place since then.  In any case that particular figure is an overall figure. If we were to take individual samplings we would find areas, especially where rivers pass through towns, with a much higher pollution rate.  The evidence is so obvious we do not need scientific proof.  The proof was quite patent during the recent hot summer.</P>
    <P>The problem of fresh water pollution is one well within our capacity to control.  It is growing more serious with the passage of time and there are more and more complaints all over the country about increasing pollution and the damage to fish life.  It is clear that many local authorities have not taken the necessary steps to deal with the pollution for which they themselves are responsible.  This may be because they have not got sufficient powers.  We can only hope that with the greater powers given to them under this Bill the problem will be solved.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to note from a report on British tidal waters that the situation there has improved considerably.  According to the report one mile in every ten of river classified as heavily polluted two years ago has been improved. This was achieved as a result of considerable capital expenditure <Col N="262" /> allied to strict control of all discharges. Fish have returned to the Thames at London.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing to learn in the Inland Fisheries Report that a serious pollution problem has occurred in our inland waters, is increasing in intensity and becoming more widespread as a result of industrial development and intensive farming methods.  The problem became very apparent when water levels dropped in the long summer. A call is made for urgent action. This is a call we can ignore only at our peril.  The point is made that fish life is an important indicator of water quality and any measures taken to preserve fish life must be beneficial to other water users.  A good environment, which includes pure water supplies, makes for better living.  We are in the fortunate position of being able to protect an environment which is still to a very considerable degree wholesome.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce argued that there was a conflict between the needs of industry and the protection of the environment.  My view is that that need not be the case, that there need not be conflict if we manage and develop our resources in the proper manner.  Protection of water supplies and of the environment generally is not the duty solely of the bodies nominated in this Bill: it is a matter for all citizens and each of us has the capacity to make his or her contribution.</P>
    <P>Environmental policy cannot exclude development.  It is a matter of giving development a more human aspect.  Production and consumption are not ends in themselves.  Social and human progress should be the aim. Up to now the main function of local authorities has been to repair the damage caused by pollution and to take action against offenders.  Neither their resources nor their powers were adquate and they were unable to strike at the main causes of pollution and they moved only when its ill-effects were apparent and the health of the community was at risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> The proper implementation of environmental policy relating to water pollution is not a simple matter.  It will be a painful process and will invariably clash with vested interests, industrial and agricultural, and very often the economic exigencies of the moment will determine the public attitude.  Because of the cost factor, industry is loath to take the measures necessary.  Therefore, I again request the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the position.  When technologists provide solutions the Government should lay down pollution toleration limits and the need to assist financing the programmes must be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>In relation to the control of water, and indeed all kinds of pollution, which are inter-related, there must be a co-ordinator because otherwise there will be a continuation of the haphazard approach which can end only in disaster.  The Minister for the Environment in Britain has the task of co-ordinating efforts in this field and we are considering the possibility of setting up a similar Department. To expect the large number of agencies who deal with environmental matters&mdash;they were mentioned by Deputy John O'Leary&mdash;to achieve even a semblance of unity on their own is to look for the impossible.  I had listed the many groupings involved in this matter but Deputy O'Leary mentioned them and it is not necessary for me to repeat the long list.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear to most people that so many varied interests must have their particular attitudes and viewpoints co-ordinated, because otherwise we will return to haphazard methods in our endeavour to control pollution and this will have a seriously detrimental effect on our environment generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to set up a water pollution advisory council on a statutory basis.  As Deputy O'Leary said, we should like to see that council having some teeth, appreciating that there will be certain difficulties because the council are to be an advisory body. However, their findings and recommendations should be made available <Col N="264" /> to the public as well as to the Minister. If they issue reports of their activities and recommendations the public will be alerted to the problems and the dangers of water pollution and they will be consequently much more anxious to co-operate and to help to provide the finances which will be necessary to combat pollution.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said it is not proposed to set up new administrative structures.  I hope that with experience, if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister find it possible to set up a more efficient structure than that provided for in the Bill, they will have no hesitation in coming to the House looking for an amendment to the Act to that effect.</P>
    <P>I note that the licensing authority in the matter of water pollution is to be vested in the administrative counties, including the urban areas, and where it relates to discharges from local authority sewers, urban councils will have functions as well as the county councils in regard to the issuing of licences.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on that.</P>
    <P>We accept the Bill.  We agree that it is vitally important&mdash;in the past we have shown our concern about this&mdash; that water pollution should be controlled. Any assistance we can give we will gladly give.  On Committee Stage we propose to put down amendments which we believe will tighten up the Bill and we will be glad for favourable consideration of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's brief is fairly long and explanatory and we have had two speeches from Deputies O'Leary and Faulkner dealing with all aspects of the Bill.  Therefore, I will not take up much of the time of the House. One point which strikes me very forcibly about water pollution is whether we have treatment that will control sewage disposal.  As happened this year, our lakes and rivers go very low and I should like to know if it is possible to treat sewage in such a way that it will not affect such low water levels so that the water can be used for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I drive into Dublin on a <Col N="265" /> hot summer day my sympathy goes out to anybody who has to live near the Liffey because the stench is certainly not a tourist attraction.  Would it be possible to treat the Liffey in such a way that we could get rid of its polluted condition?</P>
    <P>We have been blessed in this country, because we were held in subjection for so long and were not allowed to develop industries, that we are fairly free from air and water pollution. We want things to go on like this.  Deputy Faulkner mentioned that there may be a difference of opinion between environment and industry. When we industrialise we will not be able to have as pure air and possibly as pure water as we had when we were almost completely residential.  Irish people living abroad liked to have estates here so that they could come to them for holidays.</P>
    <P>I remember going to England some years ago with some other people and many of us who had weak chests were delighted to touch down at Dublin to get fresh air because of the bad air in some of the highly industrialised cities in England.  We have to be very careful that when we industrialise the country we will do everything possible&mdash;I support this Bill because it is trying to help&mdash;to try to prevent pollution as far as humanly possible.  When one industrialises a country it is not humanly possible to keep the air as pure as it was previously.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that our State industries have done as much as they should have to prevent pollution. I refer to Bord na Móna and the ESB.  I refer particularly to peat silt in the Shannon.  The Parliamentary Secretary should know as much about this as anybody.  I do not believe settling lakes were arranged in the initial development of bogland. This would have stopped the silt from going into the Shannon. I know that one cannot prevent peat silt, or turf mould as we know it, but I believe more could be done to prevent this getting into the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that Bord na Móna should not have engaged in turf development or that because we <Col N="266" /> have turf mould in certain areas we should curtail the development work of Bord na Móna.  I am not satisfied that enough is being done to prevent pollution.  All the scientific methods that can be used should be employed by the State companies to prevent pollution.</P>
    <P>I understand that from now on the licensing authorities will be the local authorities.  I know that one can appeal to the Minister but I am worried that State companies and local authorities are polluters.  Many speakers referred to dumps all over the country which are a disgrace. Everybody wants refuse collected but nobody wants it dumped near where he or she lives.  I am not making any comparison between itinerants and dumps.  Everybody wants to see itinerants settled but not at one's back door.  Everybody wants to see refuse collected but not dumped at one's back door.  Local authorities will have to face up to this problem. They should all see that they do not do anything to cause pollution.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the attitude of the Department of Local Government and other Departments in relation to housing.  I do not believe in building too many big villages and big towns for too many tourist facilities have to be provided. The sewage has to be disposed of somewhere.  I am not fully satisfied about the treatment of sewage.  Many people could be housed out in the country where septic tanks have been very successful but everything is geared against people doing this at the moment.  Encouragement should be given to people to build houses out in the country where septic tanks can be used.  This would cut down the expense in providing for large sewage disposal.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, county councils cannot afford to provide many sewerage schemes in fairly big villages or towns.  If decent grants were given to people, as was done in the case of group water schemes, to engage in group sewerage schemes this would be a great help. People could get together and have sewerage schemes in their own villages. <Col N="267" /> I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider this point seriously.  If we are waiting until county councils are able to provide sewerage schemes for all the villages in the different counties we will be waiting a very long time.  The present grants for sewerage schemes are completely inadequate. Extra money needs to be provided to encourage group sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been referred to as a bad source of pollution.  I can assure the people who may not have a great interest in agriculture that very stringent measures have been taken by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to ensure that people do not cause unnecessary pollution.  Anybody who wants to put up a silage unit will not get a grant if there is a danger of pollution.  A person must comply with the regulations of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  A silage unit cannot be set up anywhere near a lake, and slurry tanks must be put in.  We have been pressing the Department for a long time to give grants for slurry disposal outfits.  All these things have to be done at present, so that I cannot see any real danger in relation to silage units.  Before these regulations came in there may have been bad planning in relation to silage units, but I can assure everybody in this House that there is no danger now that anybody in agriculture can get grants or put up silage units that do not comply with all the regulations necessary to prevent pollution.  It is important that there should be propaganda about the effects of pollution because nobody in the country, farmers, labourers and so on, want to see the environment destroyed by pollution.  The advisory committee the Minister proposes to set up should be a balanced committee which would take into consideration that everything humanly possible that experts can do should be done to prevent pollution.</P>
    <P>If we want to industrialise this country we cannot have clear air and water, and we cannot hope to survive in this country without industries. Bord na Móna are polluting the Shannon to a certain extent, although it may not be a very dangerous pollution. <Col N="268" /> We in the west had to make a decision whether we would have Bord na Móna and the consequent employment with the minimum amount of pollution.  It was a unanimous decision that, provided Bord na Móna did everything possible to minimise pollution, we would accept something that would benefit the people, even if we would not have as clear water as we had before Bord na Móna extended their developments.  There must be a balance between industrial expansion and the prevention of pollution.  We just cannot have pure air and pure water if we are to industrialise the country.  Nobody would suggest that we should abolish industries in order to have clear air and water.  We are in the privileged position that we have a reasonably pure country, except for the Liffey.  I do not know why something is not done about that.  If there is treatment for pollution, why is the Liffey not being treated?</P>
    <P>From what I see in the Bill the local authority will be the licensing authority. One of the things that worry me about this is that local authorities are inclined to be polluters.  If they are polluters it would be the private individual who would have to take them to task, and that would be a very big and expensive job for the private individual to take on.  The licensing authority, I understand, do not come within the Act at all.</P>
    <P>I am fully behind these provisions. This is a very necessary measure and it is important that both industrialists and environment protection people should be represented on the advisory committee, and should have a say in regard to what industry would be suitable to any given place.  There has been too much conflict between organisations which have been set up to protect the environment and the people who want to industrialise the country. They should all meet together and let common sense prevail, so that everything humanly possible will be done to prevent pollution without harming industry.  Many people in this country are leaving the land; there is a lot of unemployment and industries must be brought in so as to employ these people.  The rules and regulations laid <Col N="269" /> down by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries at the moment are very strict, and you cannot be a polluter and get any grant, and you cannot develop without grants.</P>
    <P>We may have more to say about this Bill on Committee Stage.  This Bill has been debated in the Seanad, and I am sure many amendments were made to the Bill.  However, there are a few points yet to be teased out.  Will there be any control over the licensing authority, which is the local authority, because I would not like private individuals to have to take a local authority to law over a breach of the pollution laws?  It would be very unfair for a private individual to have to spend that amount of money to get his normal rights.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if somebody would clear my mind once and for all&mdash;I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to do so in his reply&mdash;on the whole question of treatment of sewage disposal if and when it is put into effect.  For instance, this year the level of the rivers was never so low. If a large town is built beside a river I want to know if the sewage can be treated in such a way that if the river is nearly dry it is all right?  I doubt it.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, why is not something done about the River Liffey in the summer?  People come here and say &ldquo;Dublin is lovely&rdquo; and so on, but I can assure the House that, as a man reared in the country, I would not like to spend a couple of hours down on the quays of Dublin on a fine day. Why is not all of this excellent treatment put into effect?</P>
    <P>Those are just a few of the points I should like clarified with regard to this whole question of treatment of sewage.  I really want to know is the treatment effective no matter what the proportion of water it enters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome this Bill, the object of which is to make arrangements <Col N="270" /> more effective for the control of pollution.  Any Bill endeavouring to do that is to be welcomed and is worthy of support.  However, I am not so sure that it will work out so well in practice.  Certainly I have some very strong reservations.  The main one is the control being given to local authorities in this area. As we know, in the past local authorities have been prosecuted and convicted for breaches of the Pollution Acts.  I know of several such local authorities.  I put down a question not so long ago in this regard, when I received information on the number of local authorities that have been prosecuted and convicted for breaches of existing laws.  For that reason I too am sceptical about this provision that local authorities should have the say in this vital area.</P>
      <P>Many problems are involved in an area such as the Shannon Estuary and the catchment area of the River Shannon, which probably touches on something like 13 counties.  I wonder whether consultation will be possible between, say, all the authorities that would be involved in a catchment area of that size, with the fishery boards and all of the other interests involved. That is something I feel that is not adequately covered in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has decided to set up an advisory council.  I should like to know who will be represented on this council.  I should like to recommend that the fishery boards be fully represented.  They have done magnificent work within the limited powers available to them up to now. In the fisheries legislation which we were told today would be introduced next year I hope the revised boards will be placed in a position to give valuable information and advice to this advisory council.  I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind and ensure their fullest representation on the advisory council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 25 there is a new departure. The section proposes to establish new local authorities.  I am not so sure that this is desirable.  However, as Deputy Callanan said, we can go <Col N="271" /> into that in more detail on Committee Stage.  If there are to be new local authorities established there would have to be far more provision than has been included in this section.</P>
    <P>In all of the sections of this Bill I fail to see any reference to the payment of damages in cases where pollution occurs, accidentally or otherwise. Thousands and thousands of pounds worth of damage can be done overnight to salmon, trout and other fish stocks.  There is no provision in this Bill of any power, to local authorities or anybody else, to sue for damages arising from discharges, accidental or otherwise.  That is a serious omission from the Bill and I should like to know what the Minister has to say in that respect.  Perhaps the Bill could be amended in some way in order to introduce power to claim damages where such may be serious. I know of cases where damage overnight was estimated at £10,000 to £15,000 to fish stocks.  At a later stage I hope some provision will be inserted in the Bill whereby either local authorities, the advisory council or the Minister will have power to sue people in cases where damage is done.  I know that the cost of actions and so on is covered, but provision must be made for sueing people where damage is done through such discharges.  I am not sure about the length of time that can elapse while appeals and so on are pending.  While an application for a licence is being pursued, if pollution and damage continue there should be some provision whereby a temporary stop could be put to discharges until such time as the application for the licence has been decided.  There could be a lapse of some six to 12 months while an application for a licence was under consideration, during which time pollution can continue.  Some provision should be included here which would prohibit such discharges taking place pending a decision on whether or not a licence is to be granted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of a monitoring system to check on discharges. I hope some council will be established or officers appointed to tackle this at the very early stages.  When damage is <Col N="272" /> done at a very early stage it is difficult to rectify later.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a whole is welcome.  I am not so sure it will be as effective as we would like.  I hope the Minister will bear the points I have raised in mind. If section 25 is to remain I hope we will be given more details of what the Minister proposes with regard to the powers to be given to the new local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly.  Indeed, I welcome any Bill dealing with water pollution.  I say this because I am in the unique position of being the only Deputy of this Dáil who had a Private Members' Bill on water pollution prior to the last election.  As a result of the dissolution of the last Dáil, that Bill fell.  It probably was unique inasmuch as it was a rare thing for a Private Members' Bill to be allowed a Second Reading.  At different times in the lifetime of this Dáil I was proposing to have it put again on record that I wanted that Bill reintroduced.  However, I had an assurance from the Minister for Local Government that he intended introducing such a Bill.  I am glad this Bill has been introduced and even though it does not contain all the provisions I would wish at least it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I do not claim to have a greater knowledge of pollution than any other Deputy but probably my attention was particularly drawn to it in that the constituency I represent had to cope with the problem of pollution.  The boundary of the constituency is the Liffey and everyone knows that that river is famous for its smell.  Dublin Bay is another boundary and the Tolka flows through the middle.  During the 1969 election campaign the weather was abnormally fine and at that time the effects of the pollution, particularly in the Tolka, were evident to the people of the area. It was one of the major complaints I received during that campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately after that I approached Dublin Corporation with regard to pollution of the Tolka and I am sorry to say that they professed not <Col N="273" /> to be aware of any problem in that area.  They said the pollution was due to the abnormally dry spell and the fact that the river was at a very low level and they expressed the belief that when the fine spell passed things would be back to normal or near normal.  However, the people of the area were not prepared to believe this and, in conjunction with some others in the area, we had tests carried out and water samples were submitted to the IIRS.  They told us in no uncertain terms that the Tolka was heavily polluted We got in touch with the medical officer in the corporation and sent him a copy of the report.  He told us he was fully aware that the Tolka was polluted and that it was in a very serious state.  If flows through probably the most scenic part of Dublin, the Botanic Gardens.</P>
    <P>As a result of this I put down a motion asking the previous Government to introduce a water pollution Bill but they did not regard it as necessary.  Their main reason was that compared with other countries we were free from pollution, that we were not nearly as badly off as others.  I was not prepared to accept that.  It is an old and true saying that prevention is better than cure and in a small country like this with limited resources I did not think we would have the necessary resources to combat the problem if it got out of hand.  However, the then Government thought otherwise and they decided not to introduce a Bill.</P>
    <P>My next step was to introduce a Private Members' Bill to deal with the problem.  I did not think there was any other effective way of coping with it. At that time practically every Department was connected with it in some way but nobody had direct responsibility. The Departments of Local Government, of Industry and Commerce, of Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="274" /> and of Lands were all involved in some way but there was not one definite Department to accept responsibility.  I was anxious that if we could not appoint a Minister at least a Parliamentary Secretary should have responsibility for dealing with pollution.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is not possible to change the whole pattern of life overnight. Certain industries are sited near rivers and they may cause a certain amount of pollution.  When they were established probably they conformed to whatever rules and regulations were in force at that time and it would be entirely wrong to expect them to effect changes overnight, probably at a considerable cost to themselves.  Many of them might not be able to do so and it might necessitate their closure.  Nobody would expect them to effect changes immediately but we would expect them to conform gradually and to the best of their ability to any new regulations that may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan said that agriculture has been blamed for much of the pollution.  Probably it is true that that industry is responsible for a certain amount of pollution but the laws and regulations of the time did not forbid them doing what they did.  I have in mind the case of pig slurry which is supposed to be one of the major causes of pollution in our rivers.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to expect farmers to undertake grandiose schemes at a tremendous cost to themselves in order to conform to modern requirements. It will have to be a gradual transition. Another cause of pollution is when milk or dairy products get into rivers. In the River Tolka there was a case of effluent from a slaughter house flowing directly into it.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 26th October, 1976.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the action his Department intend to take in order to rectify the unsatisfactory nature of the telephone system in the Hill-of-Down area of County Meath; and if he proposes to provide more trunk lines between Hill-of-Down and Enfield in view of the fact that there are only three trunk lines, which are grossly inadequate to meet the needs of the 40 subscribers and the four industrial and commercial concerns of the area.</P>

      <P>The difficulties referred to at Hill-of-Down exchange are due mainly to shortage of trunk lines.  Plans have been made to provide extra lines but major cabling works will be necessary which are unlikely to be completed before the latter half of next year.  In the meantime the working of the exchange and existing trunk lines will be given special attention.</P>
