      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in the compilation of unemployment figures any attempt is made to ascertain the total unemployment figure including school leavers and other categories not eligible for unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>

      <P>The only regular up-to-date statistical information available on unemployment levels and trends is that provided by the weekly and other analyses of the live register. The live register covers all claimants for unemployment benefit, all applicants for unemployment assistance, except smallholders, and applicants for credited social welfare contributions, except those affected by a trade dispute.</P>
      <P>Alternative sources of information only arise periodically in the form of household inquiries such as censuses of population and labour force surveys. In these inquiries the criteria for classifying persons as unemployed do not depend on the receipt of social welfare benefits or assistance and so they provide independent estimates for the period to which they relate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is satisfied that all reasonable measures are being taken by his Department to establish whether there are abuses of the welfare system; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that all reasonable measures are being taken by my Department in the matter of the detection of abuses of the social welfare system. These measures include the operations of officers whose responsibility it is to ensure that the requirements of the Social Welfare Acts are complied with in the matter of the payment of social insurance contributions and the receipt of benefit.  Outdoor officers of the Department are also responsible for the investigation of the means of applicants where such a qualification must be satisfied, thereby ensuring that not only those qualified receive their due entitlement but also that those not satisfying the prescribed conditions do not incorrectly receive payments.  These officers also pursue inquiries into cases of suspected fraud and other irregularities in relation to the claiming and receipt of social welfare payments generally.  I may add that to make these measures more effective and to provide greater deterrents very substantially increased penalties for abuses of the social welfare system were provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1976, which was enacted in July last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Act came into operation in July last and most of these cases come to light some time after the alleged crimes have taken place.  The question of prosecution is not a matter for the Department.  The Department furnish the available information of alleged abuses to the appropriate authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and it is a matter for him whether or not to instigate proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>If some abuses are found and it is discovered that the people concerned are not drawing the benefits at present, will the Parliamentary Secretary deal lightly with them, because a lot of benefits were drawn as a result of the action of over-enthusiastic politicians who told people they were entitled to something they were not entitled to?  They did so in order to make themselves popular and give the impression that everybody could draw social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last three and a half years the Department have engaged in an advertising campaign at considerable expense informing people as to what their entitlements are under the social welfare code.  There has been a considerable improvement in the booklet available to prospective recipients setting out their entitlements. With regard to over-enthusiastic politicians, I do not think there has been much enthusiasm on the Deputy's side regarding social welfare during that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reasons for the exclusion of over 50 per cent of social welfare recipients from the recently announced 5 per cent increases for long term social welfare recipients; and the categories so excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government decision as announced on the 12th October, 1976, to increase long-term social welfare payments by 5 per cent, increases are to be made in the weekly rates of old age contributory and noncontributory pensions, widows' and orphans' contributory and non-contributory pensions, deserted wife's benefit, invalidity and retirement pensions, occupational injuries, death benefit pensions and social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and elderly single women, with effect from 30th September, 1976, or 1st October, 1976, as appropriate. Increases were also to be made in the rates for adult dependants and dependent children of recipients of the foregoing payments.  Approximately 404,000 persons, including adult and child dependants, will benefit from the increases, which in the current year will cost about £3 million.</P>
      <P>The increases do not apply to social welfare payments of a basically short-term nature.  These are disability benefit, unemployment benefit and assistance, maternity allowance and occupational injury benefit payments other than death benefit pensions.  The total number of recipients of these payments, including adult and child dependants, is approximately 554,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> In the announcement of the Government decision regarding the increases to which I have referred, it was stated that the Government's decision must be seen against the background of the general economic situation and of severe budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>The total number of supplementary pension and allowance books to be issued exceeds 348,000 and the Deputy will no doubt appreciate that the processing for issue of such a large number of books cannot be done overnight. The work is in hand and every effort will continue to be made to complete it in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary described unemployment as a short-term condition.  Would he explain to the House in more detail why he did not give the increase to the genuinely unemployed, or why his party particularly precluded the genuinely unemployed, from the benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy refers to &ldquo;genuinely unemployed&rdquo; it gives the impression that he thinks there are a substantial number of people in the country drawing social welfare payments who are not genuinely unemployed.  That is an implication I do not accept.  As the Deputy is aware, since this Government came into office pay-related benefits were introduced and there was an extension of the period of qualification for those benefits on two occasions and for the payment of the flat rate to 15 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the unemployed being short-term or long-term, the position is that a survey has been carried out in regard to unemployment in which my Department participated. It was discovered that in a particular week when there was an increase in the unemployment figure of 4,000 persons, that figure was made up of approximately 3,000 persons actually signing off and the rest coming on.  While the numbers of unemployed remain exceptionally high, they are not necessarily composed of the same people.  Therefore, it must <Col N="747" /> be accepted that unemployment comes under short-term benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that certain members of his own party indicated that if the benefits were not substantial they would take certain action by way of resolution, or by Private Members motion, indicating their distaste for what has happened in relation to the recent increases.  Has there been any movement within the Labour Party to give effect to such&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 1st July last in reply to a similar question, it was decided to defer the making of the ministerial order, which is necessary to bring the provisions of the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Act, 1975, into operation, as negotiations were in progress between the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the appropriate unions regarding the conditions of employment of the staff concerned.</P>

In regard to the second part of the question, I still regard it as a matter of urgency that this legislation be implemented but the claim which is under discussion was not submitted by the unions concerned until September 2nd.

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was paid unemployment assistance up to 8th June, 1976, on the basis of the rate of means shown on his qualification certificate which had been determined by an appeals officer.  Payment was suspended from that date when a question arose following the re-investigation of his means by a social welfare officer as to his continued right to hold a qualification certificate, possession of which is a necessary requirement for entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>As a result of the officer's report the case was referred to an appeals officer and arrangements are being made for an oral hearing of the case in the near future.

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim for unemployment benefit made by the person concerned on the 24th January, 1976, was disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground that the statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit which requires a claimant to be available for employment was not satisfied.  She appealed against this decision and, following an oral hearing at which the claimant attended and gave evidence to the effect that she was available for part-time work only, the appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the determination of claims for unemployment benefit is a matter for statutory <Col N="754" /> deciding officers and appeals officers and that neither the Minister nor anyone else can give instructions to those officers in the exercise of that function.

There has been a considerable improvement in that situation in the past few years so that children between the ages of 16 and 18 who are engaged in full-time education or who are serving recognised apprenticeships qualify for children's allowances.

      <P>The numbers of houses completed by local authorities and by private enterprise in the six months ended 30th June, 1975, were 3,957 and 9,452 respectively.  The corresponding numbers completed in the six months ended 30th June, 1976, were 3,436 and 8,163, respectively.  However, I am satisfied that over the four-year period ending 31st March next, the Government's target of 100,000 new houses will be achieved.  I would remind the Deputy also that the total number of houses completed in the last four years of Fianna Fáil administration in this country was 66,982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to find the Minister lumping four years together now.  He used to do that in respect of our houses.  Would the Minister agree that it is deplorable there should be such a fall in the number of private houses built in the first six months of this year as compared with the first six months of last year and is he aware that the downgrading of the SDA loans by his refusal to increase the maximum income limit and by refusing to increase the loan limit is largely responsible for the fall in the number of houses built in the private sector and will he now consider and review the matter as one of some urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I lumped one year, two years and three years together and now we are coming up to four years so I am lumping four years together. You know, it is a little bit better when you look at them that way as against taking the years individually.  The average is about 14,300 taking them in the four years and before that they were down to 12,000.  I do not think the fall is catastrophic because I believe we will have our target again before the end of the year.  I would <Col N="761" /> also point out that the amount of money available for housing this year is well up on previous years and there is no shortfall.  In fact, and this is one of the things Deputy Faulkner quoted to me across the floor of the House some time ago, the sales of cement, which are supposed to be a good indicator of activity in the building industry generally, totalled from January to September a 4.9 per cent increase on the corresponding period in 1975. Deputy Faulkner's suggestion, not for the first time, that the building industry is collapsing is a little off beam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the money being made available may be higher in current terms but in real terms it is much lower than it was previously?  Is the Minister further aware that unemployment in the building industry has increased by 99.7 per cent over the past two years, that there are now 25,000 building workers unemployed, one fourth of the total workforce?  Is he not concerned about this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most ridiculous argument I have heard in the House from Deputy Faulkner and I have heard a number of ridiculous ones.  There is no onus on this or any other Government to be the only agency from which money is made available for house building.  In view of the fact that other agencies in the country are making fantastic amounts of money available for house building, there is no necessity to provide this extra money.  Some of it has been diverted to very useful schemes.  Perhaps Deputy Faulkner will object to them.  The suggestion that people who want to build their own houses are unable to get the necessary money is too ridiculous to bother going into detail about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner's question is just about as intelligent as his views on socialism.  I know what views he and his people have on socialism in the country.  There is no question whatever that there is a scarcity of money for people who want to build their own houses.  Deputy Faulkner must know this because in Country Louth more houses are being built than he thought ever could be built in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Making personal attacks on me will not solve anything. It certainly will not reach the conclusion the Minister would like, that I would not ask him any further supplementary questions.  Is the Minister <Col N="764" /> aware that any person with an income of over £45 a week cannot get an SDA loan?  Is he also aware that it is impossible for people with an income slightly above this level to get a loan from any of the other agencies, particularly if that person lives in a rural area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies to Deputy Faulkner if he thinks I was being personal.  I did not think he was so sore about his views on socialism. Deputy Faulkner said that the amount of SDA loan which could be got for those under £45 a week was entirely inadequate and that they had to borrow elsewhere.  They are now borrowing all the money elsewhere although there is still a substantial sum being borrowed by people under the SDA loans throughout the country.  There are certain areas where it is not being used.  A substantial amount of money is being borrowed under the SDA loan in certain areas.  I have not yet met people who can tell me they are unable to get loans to build houses if they wish to do so.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the increased costs in the building industry are much higher than the general inflationary rate? The costs have increased by 99 per cent since May, 1973, when the maximum SDA loan levels and qualifying income limits were fixed?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to follow the ramifications of this long question if it was a question.  The situation is that the houses are still being built.  Deputy Faulkner does not seem to have understood this.  We still have up to 25,000 houses per year being built and the money is being made available.  There was a time when people said that the amount of interest was so much that they wanted to stay on SDA for that purpose. They also used the amount of money available.  Deputy Faulkner claimed it was not enough and they would have to borrow elsewhere.  I assume he was talking about building societies.  There has been a big reduction in the number of people who are using this amount of money where houses cost extra money.  In a number of areas, including the one where Deputy Faulkner lives, there are quite a number of people who are still using the SDA amount they are getting. However, the amount of money which is required to keep the housing programme going is available for anybody who qualifies and wants it.  This is a very big number, amounting to almost 25,000 this year.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that, as Drogheda and Dundalk are among the largest towns outside the county boroughs, the persons who fill the position of town clerk in these towns are among the ablest in the local government services, and as they cannot compete for the position of county manager with any hope of success without first being county secretaries it is inevitable that movement of town clerks from these towns will continue to the detriment of both towns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way in which I could alter the situation. There is a proposal from Drogheda at present that I should give consideration <Col N="767" /> to the creation of a separate post as manager for the borough but that is not possible.  Officially, Drogheda has a population of only 19,000 while Dundalk has about 21,600.  There is no way that this matter can be dealt with at present.  Dún Laoghaire with about 55,000 of a population have a town clerk so unless some proposal is put up I cannot alter the situation.  I am as perturbed as Deputy Faulkner about Drogheda and various other towns where town clerks are appointed and stay only a short time.  This is a pity but Deputy Faulkner's suggestion is not the answer.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give the situation some further thought?  Would the Minister agree that the duties and responsibilities of town clerks in towns like Dundalk and Drogheda are at least equal to and in some instances even greater than the duties of some county secretaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.  I agree that they are very big.  Deputy Faulkner will agree that there are places with three times the population of Drogheda and they are on the same scale.  The top scale for Drogheda and Dundalk is now £6,711 as compared with £7,066 so there is about £400 per year of a difference at the top of the scale.  I hope to do something about this in the new legislation in regard to local authorities because it is disgraceful that some people stay for only a few months and then move on.</P>

In 1971, 9,000 grants were allocated and 7,000 paid; in 1972, 9,000 were allocated and 8,000 were paid; in 1973, 10,000 were allocated and 9,000 paid; in 1974, 11,800 were allocated and 8,500 paid; in 1975, 12,514 were allocated and 10,162 paid. In January-September, 1975, 9,054 were allocated and 7,569 paid.  In this year 11,077 were allocated and 10,678 paid.  People are reconstructing their houses.

I would ask the Minister seriously to consider that, with the amount of money made available for private people to build their own houses, it just is not on, and they are all looking to the local authorities <Col N="773" /> to build their houses.  If loans and grants were increased, this would take a big load off the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities have long lists of people who have been waiting for houses.  We are trying to deal with that list.  The biggest trouble is here in this city.  Last year I gave an extra £11 million, £12.7 million to £23.7 million, for Dublin city because I felt there was a big need for it.  It is ridiculous to say we are building houses for people who would build their own houses if the grants were higher.  We are providing the money. When that backlog is dealt with perhaps there might be another approach. Plenty of money is being allocated by building societies.  This year they propose to give £85 million as against £43 million given three years ago.  There is plenty of money for people who really want to build their own houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate in the early part of this session that we should discuss the serious issues raised by this motion which seeks support for our economic and social policies.  We had a discussion in the summer on the economic situation.  The Dáil has discussed the economic situation very frequently in the past two or three years in a difficult period of recession, and it is appropriate that we should come back <Col N="784" /> to that fundamental and serious discussion.</P>
    <P>In commentary on the economy recently, we have had a good deal of what I would term unnecessary gloom and doom.  I do not suggest, nor will any other Government speaker, that we do not face serious problems, but it would be our submission that progress is being registered.  Given the agreement of all concerned, there is no doubt that this Government have the capacity to turn the economy round in the direction of growth and increased employment.  Without striking too partisan a note, it is only fair at the start of this discussion to indicate some of the encouraging features in the present economic situation.  I have no doubt that members of the Opposition will correct any imbalance they may feel is created as a result of my remarks, and that they will point to some of the disquieting features which undoubtedly exist also in the present economic situation.</P>
    <P>At the outset it must be stated that over recent months the economy has been moving decisively into the first stage of recovery.  This has been happening unnoticed by many commentators, some of whom, for partisan motives of prejudice perhaps, do not wish to note it.  Others seemingly fail to notice these encouraging economic indicators.  Many, perhaps, are victims of that deeply ingrained national inferiority complex which suggests at all times that, as a people, we are incapable of overcoming obstacles, economic or political.  These encouraging indicators have not been receiving the attention they deserve.  For the whole year of 1976 our growth estimates must be revised upwards due to these hopeful signs in the economy. The growth rate of 2½ per cent which we mentioned as a realisable target in the Green Paper will be surpassed.  In fact, the EEC Commission, who in the past have had harsh things to say about our economic performance, recently forecast a growth rate of 3½ per cent in GDP, recognising this undoubted trend in the economy at present.  The pessimistic predictions voiced in so many quarters earlier this year must be corrected.  Indeed, remembering <Col N="785" /> statements and speeches made in the June debate in this House, many Opposition Deputies may now with some justice have cause to revise some of the assumptions on which their speeches at that time were based. It is fair to say that the ESRI may have contributed to some of the statements made by Opposition speakers in their gloomy forecast at that time because the ESRI suggested at that period we would have a ½ per cent growth for the year.  All of these predictions of earlier this year most people now recognise must be revised upwards.</P>
    <P>The volume of manufacturing output has increased in the second quarter of 1976 compared with the corresponding quarter of 1975 by a whopping 13 per cent.  There is a substantial and continuing improvement on the 8.2 per cent increase in the first quarter of 1976 over the first quarter of 1975.  Output of both manufacturing industry and transportable goods industry as a whole, when we allow for seasonal adjustments, has been rising since the low point of the second quarter of 1975.  I would be the first to admit that this increase in output will take some time to be reflected in employment, and I will come back to employment in a few minutes.  But it is correct and proper that this House should note this very marked improvement in national output in industry.</P>
    <P>Also it is wise that we should note that exports have continued to grow rapidly throughout this year, reaching rates of increase over the corresponding month in 1975 of up to 51 per cent. The September export figure for this year is a substantial 38 per cent over September, 1975.  Exports for the 12 months up to the end of September this year are running at 26.7 per cent greater than exports for the 12 months up to the end of September, 1975. Therefore we can say that these basic facts on the performance of the economy encourage the justified belief that the first phase of recovery from the effects of recession is well under way in the Irish economy.  These facts suggest that our industrial recovery is equal to if not better than that of any other EEC member country.  By contrast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister on the question of the 26 per cent increase in exports to which he referred, is that limited only to industrial exports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  So by contrast with our EEC neighbour, Britain, on our industrial performance in terms of output and rate of increase in our exports, our record in infinitely better.</P>
      <P>I accept in making these initial points that the unique challenge in our situation is that we must do infinitely better than our trading neighbours if any impact is to be made on our levels of employment.  In our situation industry is called upon to provide relatively more jobs in the circumstances of our economy than is the industry of any other EEC country if we are to satisfy our ambition of maximum employment for our people.  We have had a 6 per cent improvement in the first quarter of 1976 over the last quarter of 1975. All of these figures of output, of exports, suggest that the economy is moving towards a growth position.  Of course, I would be the first to admit that our industrial exports have been aided by the devaluation of sterling in non-sterling markets, but we can say without fear of exaggeration that a major recovery is on the way in the economy.  We are coming out of the recession in terms of output at a rate at least as good as and at as high a level as most of our EEC partners and in some cases better.  We have had growth before in this economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Green Paper pointed out, the growth that occurred in this economy in the 1960s did not result in any significant change in the pattern of employment. The total at work between 1961 and 1971, as pointed out in the Green Paper, scarcely changed, with a figure in 1961 of 1,052,000 to 1,055,000 in 1971.  The central problem of our economy, that of providing employment for all our people, was not settled in that period of growth.  The question before us now is whether at this point in our recovery we can lay plans for tackling that central problem of our economy over the years ahead.  We must remember in looking back over the period 1961 to 1971 that those employment figures I have <Col N="787" /> given were accompanied by a decline of 100,000 in agricultural employment. That was the main factor that resulted in no net increase in employment over that period.  Unemployment increased, as is made clear in the Green Paper, between 1961 and 1971. We must remember that between the late 1950s and the early 1970s over 300,000 Irish men and women emigrated from this country.</P>
    <P>Therefore the task before us, even if it is true to say that in this year of 1976 it is possible that we may attain a 4 per cent increase in output, is to continue that figure, year on year. The Green Paper suggests an average objective of 6 per cent repeated annually if we are to make any impact on unemployment.  We have never been able to achieve that before, and it is fair to point out that that is the magnitude of the task before us. Previous policies directed towards increasing employment have not been successful in bringing us anywhere near that figure, and presumably with emigration having stopped, the discrepancy between our social benefits and British social benefits having ended, the distortion that always existed between benefits in the North and in the rest of the country having ended, it means that from now on we cannot mask the true unemployment situation as could be done in the past by seeing our unemployed disappear in those emigration figures.  If our unemployment rate throughout the 1960s did not exceed 6 per cent on average the main thanks for that may be given to the number of Irish men and women who were forced to seek work abroad.  Presumably no Deputy of any party in the House wants to see that remedy adopted again by any Government in this House to mask the true unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>It will not be sufficient for us then simply to do as well as other EEC countries because the magnitude of the problems before us calls on us to do far better than any other EEC country because of our long-standing structural unemployment problem. The increase in unemployment generated by the recession, the fact that <Col N="788" /> many young people did not enter the labour market in the late 1960s due to the change in policy to full-time education which absorbed many young people at that time plus the increasingly youthful nature of our population, all of these things taken in conjunction, mean that in the years ahead the task of providing sufficient employment for our people will call for changes in attitudes on the part of all the main economic interests in the country.  In the future more young people will be seeking jobs and if we are to meet the demand for jobs our growth rate must be higher than other more mature economies and our policies must be targeted primarily at growth and employment creation.  In the short-term these requirements must mean that incomes need to be restrained. We need incomes restraint if we are to provide a sound basis for any long-term planning.  We need it if we are to maintain the competitive position of industry and we need it also in the short-term if any budgetary arrangements are to be made to free resources for employment creation expenditure.</P>
    <P>The problem of answering the magnitude of the growth task before us, of providing sufficient employment, the problem as shown in the Green Paper, has this short-term and medium-term dimension.  For success in policies on employment we are dependent on growth in all sectors, in agriculture, industry and in services.  Growth in industry is of critical importance because in the long-run growth in the service sector will depend on it. Growth in industry is dependent on maintaining as much as we can of the home market but it is primarily dependent on expansion of exports. When we speak of the necessity of maintaining our competitive position it must not be forgotten that we are talking of industries that provide more than half of our industrial jobs based on export markets.  Our target growth in manufactured exports must be 15 per cent more in volume terms with significant contributions from existing and new industries.</P>
    <P>There is a trade-off between income growth and employment creation in a <Col N="789" /> competitive economy.  If we are serious about one we must be serious about the other.  In recent years, especially throughout the period of recession, budgetary allocations for the public capital programme and other employment creating activities have grown substantially.  Within the limits of our resources&mdash;the Minister for Finance will be speaking on this during the debate&mdash;and within the constraints of our borrowing requirements and the necessary social obligations of policies of the Government productive employment creating expenditure will assume a crucial importance in the years ahead.  In providing this growth both the public and the private sectors have complementary roles to discharge.  We have State manufacturing and service companies who sell their goods and services on the open market.  We have native-owned domestic industry now recovering from the recession.  We have new grant-aided industries from abroad who bring in a higher level of technology. All of these together have a part to play in providing the growth that will be necessary in the years ahead. The task before us is a larger task and is more difficult of attainment than that which any other EEC economy is called on to fulfil.  However, we can take some confidence from the figures I mentioned with regard to output and exports that the economy at last is moving in the right direction.  If the improving position of output and exports has not as yet made any significant impact on the unemployment situation, we can record cautious optimism on the employment front.  The analyses of the live register by individual industrial groups are now available for the first seven months of this year and they show that the rate of increase in unemployment in the major sectors of the economy slowed down during that period.  A feature of virtually all the industrial analyses of the live register available for 1976 has been a decrease in unemployment in some industrial groups, notably in clothing and footwear, in metals, engineering and textiles.</P>
    <P>No one pretends that the unemployment <Col N="790" /> figure will fall appreciably without the kind of changes in behaviour that the Government have been calling for in recent months.  If, as we have been arguing, employment creation must be the major national objective, then it is clear that there are obligations on all major economic groupings in the country, employers, unions and the Government.</P>
    <P>The worst effect of the recent recession has been found in the area of employment.  Unemployment began to rise steeply in the second half of 1974 and it continued throughout 1975.  The increase continued in the early part of 1976; but since the spring of this year the trend in the actual figures, ignoring the seasonal factors, has been downwards.  That gives a basis of cautious optimism. There are signs that the worst of the unemployment crisis is over.  The increase in unemployment is now at its lowest level since the latter part of 1974.  In fact, actual unemployment has fallen since last year in the north-east region of the country and the increase is less than 1 per cent in the western region and in the midlands. It is a feature of our statistics of unemployment that as we approach the winter months the employment situation disimproves generally.  It is heartening to note that the seasonal rise has scarcely started this year and the present unemployment figure is below that experienced during the summer.  It is also good to note that redundancies notified to my Department in 1976 under the redundancies payments legislation are running at below 70 per cent of the corresponding 1975 levels.</P>
    <P>To hear certain spokesmen speaking one would think that the phenomenon of unemployment had just been discovered. No one denies that our unemployment figures have been at a very high level.  However I could take more seriously the shock of certain spokesmen regarding the high level of unemployment if they would also put it in perspective with what has always been the shock that should be registered by looking at our unemployment situation as far back as the late '50's. We must not forget that before this recession <Col N="791" /> made our unemployment situation worse, the average figure for percentage of insured persons on the live register for the years 1969 to 1974 was 8 per cent and therefore increases brought about by the last recession must be added to that base.  If we hear Deputies during this debate speak of the dimensions of the unemployment situation it will be instructive to hear how they connect it with policies tried in the past to correct the unemployment situation.  It will be instructive to hear how they feel a continuation of these policies will help in dealing with unemployment.</P>
    <P>During the sixties the total at work here remained relatively constant. Over the same period 300,000 people emigrated, most of them either actual or potential members of the labour force.  The reversal now of that historic process of emigration means that the task of providing sufficient employment for our people is a very formidable one and calls from all who desire to contribute to its solution for a little bit of honesty in terms of the overall question of the provision of employment for our people.  If we are to give priority to the creation of employment certain consequences follow. We are in a free trade environment and nobody owes us a living, however much we might think they should owe us one.  The growth of employment requires enterprise, public and private, native and foreign, to generate investment to provide the necessary jobs. Giving priority to employment requires discipline and temporary sacrifices from those at work, because output can only be expanded if we remain competitive.  The jobs we require are productive and sustainable ones which will give the workers in those industries security into the future.</P>
    <P>That is why the Government, trade unions, and employers have been discussing and defining the policies that would aid growth and employment creation in the years ahead.  The House will be aware that tripartite discussions have been taking place on the availability of resources, employment, welfare, prices, public revenue, expenditure and all forms of income. <Col N="792" /> These preliminary series of discussions have taken place and negotiations recommence on Thursday at Employer Labour Conference level.  Deputies will recall that at the discussions between the Government, unions and employers which led to the interim national agreement the terms of reference for the tripartite discussions were agreed.  Tripartite discussions on economic and social strategy for the next two years took place in the context of that interim agreement.</P>
    <P>The major objective of the Government in those discussions was to gain acceptance of the major economic interests for the proposition that expansion of employment must be our primary economic objective.  Acceptance of this proposition entails obligations and commitments for employers, unions and the Government.  For the employers there is the necessity of increasing investment, of ensuring managerial efficiency, of reinvesting profits in productive projects and of engaging in aggressive marketing, with the support of State agencies, directed to improve our marketing endeavours abroad.  For the Government there is the necessity of earmarking resources for productive employment creation, and for the unions there is the obligation of moderation in income demands, recognising that in our situation expansion of employment requires moderation in incomes.</P>
    <P>In the course of those talks the Government outlined the likely developments in the economy in securing agreement on incomes which would maintain and improve the competitive position of industry.  It is true to say that there would be real danger to employment and output were an inflationary wage settlement fixed as the primary target in any discussions to govern the incomes situation next year.  In order to ensure that the incomes situation in 1977 corresponds to the employment needs of the economy, the need for employment expansion, to ensure that further tax increases can be avoided next year, and in conformity with the requirements of the need of a longer term plan for the development of the economy, the Government outlined a possible package <Col N="793" /> of income tax reduction and employment creation which would be combined with a pay pause during 1977.  That package has the following elements: £50 million to be devoted to relief on personal income tax; £50 million to be spent on job creation projects and the introduction of a scheme of income-related social welfare contributions.  This package would increase take home pay without disimproving the competitive position of industry.  It would also result in giving our industry a significant competitive edge over the United Kingdom by the end of 1977.  Lower paid workers, including women, would gain from the change in social welfare contributions while higher paid workers would gain from the income tax concessions.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the take home pay, as a result of the tax concessions, would increase by about 3 per cent. This increase would be in addition to the 4 per cent carryover effect of the 1975 and 1976 national agreements into 1977.  Much work remains to be done at tripartite conference level, but Government policy will continue to be directed to reconciling income expectations for the period ahead with the overall primacy of employment creation, subject, as always, to the availability of resources.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a clear interaction between the discussions at Employer/Labour Conference level, which reopen on Thursday, and the extent of the contribution which the Government can make in such areas as tax reduction or job creation.  The proposals made by the Government at tripartite level form an integrated package which must be considered together. In a word, upward movement of wages and salaries next year will necessitate examination and revision of the Government package just outlined.</P>
    <P>While most of our discussions in the tripartite talks have been concerned with the short-term situation and the actions necessary to consolidate the success that is implied in the turnabout in the economy already taking place, I want to make it clear that the Government are committed to the preparation of a national plan for economic and <Col N="794" /> social developments up to 1980.  We are committed to consult fully with the social partners on the institutional arrangement necessary for the evolution of such a plan.  I am glad to inform the House that both sides in the talks are in agreement with us on the necessity for devising such a plan.  Congress in their submission consider it imperative that there must be a comprehensive economic and social plan covering the next few years and that such a plan must include targets for growth, output, employment and living standards. This plan must set out the needs by which these targets can be achieved and provide for planning structures that will ensure the implementation of the economic and social policies necessary to achieve the objectives of the plan. The Irish employer confederation made it clear from their statement that while the immediate considerations relate to the short-term the results should lay the foundation for a clearly defined plan for economic growth for a longer period of time and this plan should set out agreed economic and social priorities.</P>
    <P>The point has often been made that Fianna Fáil favour economic planning. Some of them have suggested from time to time that this Government are less than enthusiastic for economic planning.  There has not been the basis for such doubt in the past, but I hope we will not hear that red herring introduced in this debate by Opposition spokesmen because, as I said, the Government position is quite clear on this matter.  We are committed to the preparation of such a plan in agreement with both unions and employers.</P>
    <P>As a Government we are committed to the preparation of a national plan. We are also on record as committing ourselves to co-operate with the other major economic interests in the institutional arrangements necessary for the evolution of such a plan.  It is interesting to note that when we took office in 1973 not even the genesis of a plan existed.</P>
    <P>There was a memory going back to the late fifties, a rumour of a programme which operated at that time. The last effort at planning, what was known as the Third Economic Plan, <Col N="795" /> had covered 1969-72.  So far as I know its expiry was unlamented by the then Administration.  That plan had been prepared in desultory fashion.  It set no policies geared for the achievement of precise targets and no arrangements for consultation with the social partners were a feature of that plan.  It was interesting to note that no effort was made to produce a plan by that Administration, a plan which would see us through the early years of EEC entry, even though it had been a fundamental part of that Administration's economic policy as far back as 1966 that we should enter the European Community.  The negotiations which preceded our EEC entry were in top gear from at least 1969 onwards, with the objective of achieving a five-year transition period after entry into the Community.  Yet no arrangements were made for preparing a plan, in consultation with the various interests, for what must even then have appeared to be a period of great difficulty for our industries and services.  Apparently no plan was considered necessary to tide us over those early years of EEC membership.</P>
    <P>For this Administration during this recession the bottom fell out of the known economic world with the oil crisis and the extraordinary vicissitudes the world has been passing through during that period.  Only at this point can we say that it is possible that we may now, with some hope of achieving anything, set down to work constructively with the social partners in devising a plan for the years ahead. Any planning arrangements that may be entered into will require very close consultation with unions and employers because in a democracy such as ours the success of any plan will depend on the support given by the unions and employers.  The success of any plan must depend on the voluntary commitment to that plan, especially in the incomes area, by unions participating in it.  That has been absent from any plan in the past. If future planning exercises are to be more effective than past efforts, we will require that voluntary commitment on the part of the unions and employers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> When the Leader of the Opposition suggested recently that we were simply seeking the aid of the social partners in our policy ideas on how to run the economy, I do not think he wished to be taken seriously, because he understands the necessity of full consultation with the social partners and the gaining of their commitment if any plan is to be successful.  It is a necessary precondition for the success of national economic policies in a planning context that genuine consultation with major economic interests should take place, as we see in every EEC country where similar exercises are taking place.</P>
    <P>During this debate it is correct that the Government record <i>vis-à-vis</i> the economy should be examined by both sides of the House.  Perhaps it is understandable that we shall be pointing to the encouraging features of our record in this regard and that the Opposition shall be emphasising what they regard as the less encouraging features.  I should hope, however, that a feature of the debate would be also some examination of the Opposition's proposals for the remedying of some of the problems facing our economy. There are such proposals in existence even if they have only been made known to us recently.  For my guidance I should like to hear from Fianna Fáil as to how they intend implementing some of the proposals contained in their document.  After all, they have had the experience of many years in government.  Consequently, their ideas must not be treated lightly but must be examined seriously.</P>
    <P>In their policy document the Opposition talk of a two-year wage freeze but we are not told how this is to be achieved.  Perhaps their spokesman would enlighten us during the course of the debate.  Perhaps, too, they would indicate whether they envisage a statutory wage policy during that period.  Another point on which we might hear from them is in relation to their proposals for borrowing. During previous debates on the economy we have been castigated by Opposition spokesmen for our policy in this area but it seems to me that what they are advocating by way of <Col N="797" /> borrowing requirements will result in a deficit next year of almost £400 million.  We have been criticised by them for having borrowed during the recession in order to minimise the adverse effects of external conditions on employment at home.  Deputy Colley has warned us repeatedly of the consequences of our borrowing policy. What kind of conversion have we had on the part of Fianna Fáil?  If I read their policy document correctly, the borrowing they advocate for next year would be far in excess of anything contemplated by us.  It would be an interesting exercise at this stage to aggregate the amounts of money which Opposition spokesmen have talked of spending in every area during the past few years so that we might get an idea of the imaginary deficits involved.</P>

      <P>Unless I have missed out on something in the document, their capital programme would appear to remain fairly constant during the next five years.  I should be interested in hearing how employment is to be maintained at the figure they envisage taking into account their figure for the capital programme.  Up to now Opposition spokesmen have told us that borrowing should be used to finance productive investment. Here, again, there appears to be a switch in their policy in regard to borrowing requirements since in the main they talk of devoting borrowings or a good portion of them to the public sector.  I do not wish to be taken as being critical of the Opposition in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears from the figures in their <Col N="798" /> document that they have foregone the effort required to maintain consistency between their expenditure proposals and the facts as dictated by the revenue situation.  That is surprising for a party so recently out of office. However, it is difficult to know which is the official or which is the unofficial policy of the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I have been pointing to the figures in the policy document. An example of what I have in mind and which is a vital element in the matter of the consistency of the figures is the question of the success of the Buy Irish campaign.  This success is central to the package put forward because the Opposition contemplate that such success would result in a switch of 3 per cent in consumer expenditure as between imports and home produced goods.  There is in existence a guaranteed Irish campaign which most Irish people support but even those of us who are most enthusiastic about that campaign would not pretend that it is possible to switch compulsorily consumer choice in the fashion envisaged by Fianna Fáil.  Can they tell us how this aim is to be achieved?  The extent of the increasing employment resulting from the increase in Government expenditure depends for its success on this campaign.  Likewise, there are other figures mentioned in the document which do not appear to be consistent either in relation to the current or to the capital side.</P>

      <P>The promise of 20,000 jobs extra immediately and a further 50,000 in 1978-79 is reminiscent of previous policy promises from Fianna Fáil in this area.  I trust that the Opposition spokesmen will correct me if I am wrong in regard to the inconsistency of their figures.  First, I should like to know how the wage freeze is to operate for a two year <Col N="799" /> period because this, too, is a central feature of their plan.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Opposition will explain it further because the figures do not seem to hang together.  Secondly, I should like an answer to the question I raised regarding the switch envisaged as a result of the Buy Irish campaign and there is also the question of the amounts to be devoted to the capital programme. Also, there is the question of the switch to investment in the public area as distinct from the productive area.</P>
      <P>I raise these questions because I consider them to be as much an integral part of this debate as are any of the objective facts I have been outlining. There are other factors in relation to this document which must be considered.  Can Opposition spokesmen tell us, for example, if the figures mentioned previously by their spokesmen are absorbed in the figures mentioned now or are they to be additional to them?  There was what was known as a jobs for jobs' sake policy announced by their Health spokesman earlier this year.  That policy proposal was based on the diversion of £100 million from the existing capital programme of £600 million so as to create a minimum of 10,000 jobs.  That was Mr. Haughey's plan.</P>

      <P>I thought I did refer to him as Deputy Haughey.  I apologise to the Deputy in his absence.  He announced this policy of jobs for jobs' sake.  I think it was in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 11th May, 1976. I did not see any subsequent rebuttal of the policy proposals on his part or by any of the support groups of the Fianna Fáil Party so I take it that it was considered party policy at the time and it may still be taken as party policy side by side with the party policy adumbrated in September.  He wanted the diversion of £100 million from the existing capital programme. <Col N="800" /> He did not say which part of the capital programme would suffer as a result of the removal of this sum.  He explained: &ldquo;The normal return of investment criteria would not apply and the programme would be undertaken as a shot in the arm of emergency measures undertaken as much for its multiplier effect as for itself.&rdquo; A month ago in Dromoland Castle, no less, the leader of the Opposition in the Seanad, addressing all 17 members of the European Progressive Democrats said, and I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of the following day: &ldquo;If only the Government would impose strict economic controls and budgetary disciplines and guidance suggestions made by experts from the EEC Commission there would be practically no limit on the amount of financial aid Ireland would receive from the other Community countries.&rdquo;  The same Senator speaking on a radio programme as a result of some strange voting by the members of the Opposition in the European Parliament on a fisheries motion talked about the possibility of getting a £60 million loan to increase our fishery protection service.</P>
      <P>I just mention these figures.  Having been in Opposition myself, I understand Opposition mentality.  In Opposition one does not have the responsibility of saying where the money is to come from but I would suggest that here there is quite a good deal of inconsistency in Opposition policy over vital areas of the economy and I hope that during this debate Opposition speakers will attempt to restore some consistency into certain of their policy objectives over these vital areas.  I have recorded certain things that engender a mood of encouragement, things which suggest that, given the right decisions in the months ahead, we can continue the increase in output already recorded this year.  EEC experts suggest that a 3½ per cent increase in output is attainable this year. I believe an increase of 4 per cent is possible of attainment this year.  That is my personal opinion.  I have quoted reliable impartial sources which suggest 3½ per cent is attainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Paper talks about the necessity of a 6 per cent increase in <Col N="801" /> output year by year if any benefits are to accrue in employment expansion. One could say we would need a 6 per cent increase in output into the indefinite future if we are to make any impact on employment and give any hope to those looking for work. Even then we would not be solving the employment situation satisfactorily. That is the magnitude of the task before us.  Welcome though a 4 per cent increase will be this year, after the decline of the previous two years, that will have to be continued into the indefinite future and improved upon if we are to make some impact on employment.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of that and its importance calls for a most serious contribution to this debate from all of us. Those who are unemployed look to debates here for evidence on the part of speakers that they seek more than partisan advantage.  They look for a serious discussion on this issue which has been with us now for so many years.  No Administration has brought forward adequate proposals for tackling it.  I would claim for ourselves that the direction of Government policy is well defined.  The consultations we are having with the various groups, the proposals we have been making and the responses we are seeking will ensure if given that next year we can continue the trend already evident this year and I hope that in the course of this debate Members will be fair and not add unnecessary discouragement.  They must understand that we must be responsible and, while speaking about the difficulties, also note the achievements. It is no small achievement that this small economy, which has always known unacceptably high unemployment, in membership of the European Community since 1973, with so much of its trade with overseas countries, should have weathered the storm so well and these figures I have mentioned in output and exports should be recorded this evening as evincing achievement on our part. A good beginning has been made. These figures are a good beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We pressed for this debate because we wanted an opportunity <Col N="802" /> to bring home to the Government, if it has not been brought home already, even at this late stage the seriousness of the economic dangers that beset us and, worse still, the gross irresponsibility of their failure to act. The failures of this Coalition have been many and manifest but nowhere has their failure been so complete, so obvious, so unnecessary and so damaging to the future of the nation than it has been in the field of economic policy.  We asked for this debate two weeks ago.  We were denied it.  For what good reason, I do not know.  We have been discussing Bills like the Consumer Protection Bill and the Water Pollution Bill and, important though these may be, I think I see the reason now.  It was expected that whatever outcome there might be of the tripartite talks we would have heard about them from the Minister today, but now we have been told that the preliminary series of the tripartite talks have concluded.  I wonder is the Minister being really frank with the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was described as a major economic debate and one would have expected the Taoiseach or, failing him, the Minister for Finance or, failing him, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or, failing him, the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is a man of acknowledged accomplishment in the field of economics, to have outlined the Government's proposals in this debate.  One would have expected senior Minister of the Government to deal with the debate and justify, if possible, the Government's failures.  I wonder is the Taoiseach being fair with the House.  Instead of senior Ministers they have entrusted this task to the Minister for Labour, whose main brief in Government is, so far as he can, to avoid the incidence of industrial unrest, to reduce, where possible, the effects of industrial unrest and reduce as well, so far as he can, the worst effects of the massive unemployment we are now encountering. Nevertheless, the Minister for Labour, not any one of the other members of the Government to whom I have referred, has introduced this most important debate, a debate on what many people regard as the <Col N="803" /> real crisis, the economic crisis now being experienced in the country.</P>
    <P>I will deal in the course of my contribution with some of the remarks, the suggestions and the questions asked by the Minister for Labour.  It seems to me that the only inflationary sign I noticed from the Minister's contribution was the deflated manner in which he delivered the opening Government brief here this afternoon.  It certainly reflects no great credit on whoever gave him that brief.  Unfortunately, I suppose those who had to write it did the best they could.  The Minister tried his best to embellish at the very end.  He embellished in a way that seems to me to be a complete reversal of what one would expect in the course of a debate on the economic performance of the Government.</P>
    <P>He tried to justify his economic performance by drawing on figures, which are as unreal, as far as growth is concerned, as they could be.  He clutched at any old straw of a ½ per cent increase there or a 10 per cent increase here, completely ignoring why those increases have taken place. He did, in fact, refer to the effects that devaluation might have and are having on our exports.  The Minister instead criticised the economic policy of the Opposition.  Is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that in an economic debate of this nature it is not the economic policy of the Government that seems to be in question but that of the Opposition?  I suppose it is not extraordinary because the Government have no economic policy and the Opposition have.  That is the answer to the Minister for Labour's funny turn of the ordinary type of debate in relation to what he had to say.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to catalogue the extent of the economic ills we are suffering from because they have already been spelled out at length by so many different economists and other commentators that by now everybody is aware of the terrifying problem, our rampant inflation and our reckless and disastrous level of borrowing, especially borrowing from foreign <Col N="804" /> lenders.  The most recent reminder we have of this appears in the <i>Financial Times</i> of today's date.  On page 4 under the broad title of &ldquo;European News&rdquo; the most prominent headline on that page reads: &ldquo;Ireland running &lsquo;headlong for disaster&rsquo;, says report&rdquo;.  I will read a few passages from that report to indicate how seriously other people regard the disaster that we are running headlong towards.  The opening paragraph of this article reads:</P>
    <P>A confidential report on Ireland's worsening economic outlook now being prepared by McKinsey and Company severely criticises the Government's current policies and states that on its present course the Republic is running &ldquo;headlong for disaster&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It says that this study was conducted by McKinsey apparently on commission from the Bank of Ireland.  It says it is a confidential report.  The reporter of the <i>Financial Times</i> must have had sight of it because he is able to quote from it.  Later in this article it says:</P>
    <P>Ireland heads the EEC league tables for both unemployment and inflation; the former is officially put at 12.1 per cent&mdash;and unofficially much higher&mdash;and inflation is running at 18.5 per cent.  The Government's economic performance is reportedly putting strain on the ruling Fine Gael-Labour Party Coalition, with Labour backbenchers expected to register their dissatisfaction in this week's Dáil debate.</P>
    <P>I hope they do.  I welcome their comments which might at the same time reflect the same kind of thinking we have heard from certain members of the Labour organisation, certain leaders of labour unions, one no more recently than yesterday from one of the most respected men in trade unionism in this country, who so decisively expressed his dissatisfaction with the performance of the Government.  I refer to Denis Larkin.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of this article the reporter has a side swipe at the previous Fianna Fáil Administration and says:</P>
    <P>Both the present Government and the previous Fianna Fáil Administration <Col N="805" /> are censured for economic policy shortcomings. Cosgrave Government's actions are firmly criticised as &ldquo;short term expediency&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This presumably is referred to in the McKinsey Report.  That is an indication of what outside observers think and, as it appears, from this very influential newspaper, is a reflection of the kind of view that people who could help us by investment, people who read this newspaper from day to day, will obviously be deterred by reports of this nature, which obviously reflect the true situation and for which the Government alone are responsible.</P>
    <P>These problems have also been described in Fianna Fáil's policy document published in September.  This document set out the immediate positive practical actions which the Government could and should take to deal with the economic dangers before they destroy us.  The immediate response from the Government to those proposals could hardly have been more disappointing.  We found instead the long awaited, much heralded Green Paper, which was supposed to set out the Coalition's policies, produced in rather a hurry. This proved to be another piece of Coalition cowardice and failure to face up to realities.  Although it is called a Green Paper it is in white with green print on the cover but it might more appropriately have been yellow.  Its other colourful contribution was to produce red faces amongst Coalition supporters.  This is perhaps best illustrated by Deputy Barry Desmond's denunciation of it as not being worthy of a pass in the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said, keeping up the colourful sequence, that he hoped we would not put forward any red herring here today about the Government's commitment to planning and programming.  If this is the result of three years' expression and implementation of that commitment then I am afraid the Minister will have to expect quite a lot of red herrings of this nature from across the pages of this Green Paper during <Col N="806" /> the course of this debate.  The Minister for Labour said that nothing was done to gear industry for entry into the EEC.  Was the Minister being honest or being frank?  I took a note of what the Minister said.  He said: &ldquo;No attempt made to organise industry for entry to the European Economic Community&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the lack of a plan for the period of transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used these words, and they can only mean that nothing was done to organise industry. Does the Minister forget the Committee on Industrial Organisation and the industrial grants that were made available when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Does the Minister choose to forget the new programme under the auspices of the Committee on Industrial Organisation under Deputy George Colley when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce? It is little wonder that what the Minister says will be treated with that kind of incredulity that people have come to expect from some of the pronouncements made by him and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>While the evasion of the Green Paper may buy a little more time for the Government and postpone the vitally needed action to save the economy, those economic problems have not diminished even since September. On the external scene we have witnessesd the further collapse of sterling, which will add more fuel to our inflation in the coming months, and at home we have been treated to yet another sorry spectacle of Coalition bungling in the handling of the tripartite talks.  The Coalition's capacity for action, which was never great, appears to diminish as week follows week, so that it is increasingly driven to plead plaintively for consensus and support from all sections of the community in the hope that it will be presented in some way with proposals which have that magical property of pleasing all of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not suggest, nor have I ever suggested, that all our economic ills are of the Coalition's making; and I <Col N="807" /> will not suggest that there has not been an economic recession which has had its effect throughout the world.  But the Central Bank reports repeatedly attributed up to 50 per cent of our inflationary difficulties to the Government's action and inaction.  Every other country with which we have trading relationships and every other Government who operate under the same kind of democratic system as we do, have taken steps, some with great success, others with moderate success, to overcome this recession.  The Coalition Government have failed to take any realistic worthwhile steps to overcome the effects of that recession in this country.  By pursuing the wrong budgetary policies, as they now admit, for the past three years, and because of inaction in other vital areas, they have contributed to the deepening of that recession.</P>
    <P>The reality of political life is that difficulties and problems have to be faced with courage and conviction and dealt with speedily and decisively. Sometimes this requires painful and unpopular action on the part of the Government, but it is foolish to pretend that the unpleasing can always be avoided.  There is no point having in Government, as we appear to have, only fair weather sailors.  The Green Paper is the most recent published example of this evasion of responsibility and flight from reality.  The early sections of the paper admit what we in Fianna Fáil have been saying and what many people have known for a considerable time: that the Government's present policies have failed and cannot be allowed to continue. The Green Paper itself is a damning indictment of the Government's policies.  Page 26 states:</P>
    <P>To sum up, the key features of the projection of existing trends are continuing high inflation, mounting balance of payments deficits, drastic cuts in public expenditure, an unacceptable level of taxation, an impossible borrowing requirement and growing unemployment&mdash;in short an intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>The Government say that to continue with present practices&mdash;I hesitate to <Col N="808" /> call them policies&mdash;would lead to an intolerable situation.  After this belated admission of their shortcomings we might reasonably expect some firm purpose of amendment and that no time would be wasted in trying to set the country back on the road towards renewed economic and social progress. Instead of any clear and forthright statement of the options now open to us, instead of any detailed examination of the merits and demerits of our policies, we are given a few skimpy pages&mdash;one year's work&mdash;made up of pious platitudes and pie-in-the-sky prospects which appear to have been culled from the backs of envelopes and from lunch-hour typewriters.</P>
    <P>The rosy picture which is sketched on the closing pages of the Green Paper, with its suggestions of over 60,000 extra jobs by 1980 and its expectations that unemployment and inflation could be brought down to the levels that prevailed when Fianna Fáil were in Government, have no foundation in theory or in fact.  Various commentators have pointed to such features in the Green Paper as the peculiar nature of the population projection needed to produce the happy prospect of an early fall in the unemployment rate.  In effect there must be a slowdown in population growth or extraordinary trends must occur in the growth of output per employee in the industrial and services sector in order to produce a rapid growth in industrial employment.  The Director General of the Confederation of Irish Industries said that the Green Paper suggests a labour force of 1.7 million people by 1980, while NESC suggests a much higher figure, 1.23 million at least. Thus, on NESC's figures, the Green Paper is writing down the size of the labour force by 16,000 people.  This means that we might get a reasonable reduction in unemployment figures by 1980 if our population does not increase at the rate it is increasing now and therefore does not add to the available labour force.</P>
    <P>The same applies in relation to the output per employee in the industrial and services sector in regard to the numbers to be employed.  The output is expected to increase by less than the <Col N="809" /> output in the services sector and only by half of the increase in the agricultural sector.  This is an indication of the Government's thinking&mdash;writing down the population in order to create a better balance between the employed and the unemployed, writing down the increase that should reasonably be expected in productivity in the industrial sector in order to push up the figures of those likely to be employed by 1980.</P>
    <P>Even more extraordinary is the belief that these improvements, which are not in fact improvements, can be achieved while Ireland continues to suffer a rate of prices and cost inflation higher than that of most if not all of our European Economic Community partners.  Of course there is no need to analyse any of these estimates in detail because I do not believe any member of the Coalition Government believes them.  If I am wrong in this view I would welcome some Coalition speaker who would fill in the missing details and supply the missing theories to make sense out of this Green Paper nonsense, and particularly the tables we have been given in pages 32, 33 and 34 as to prospective growth in employment and in productivity.</P>
    <P>However, the important and urgent task is not to waste time, as this Green Paper seems to have done, on fairy tale suggestions as to what might happen by 1980.  Instead, we should concentrate on what is happening now, and see what can be done to bring about a rapid improvement.  It is highly revealing in this context to note that the Green Paper, despite its apparent ability to predict what will happen in 1980, has nothing whatever to say about the likely situation in 1977.</P>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil document published in September, we suggested that inflation might fall from 18 per cent this year to 12 per cent in 1977, and that output might grow by about 2½ per cent in 1977.  Since that document was prepared and published, the fall in sterling has gone on space and this will have the effect of worsening our inflation rate and, as a side bonus, of <Col N="810" /> improving our growth performance. It now seems as though inflation next year will be in the region of 14 per cent if present policies are to be continued. The fall in sterling certainly helps to make Irish exports more competitive in European and overseas markets, and this already appears to have boosted somewhat industrial exports this year.  The Minister for Labour took credit for that boost but without referring to the real cause or the main cause of the boost, that is, the devaluation of sterling and the making of our goods more competitive in non-sterling foreign markets.</P>
    <P>It now seems that output might grow up to about 3 per cent both this year and next year, but this is only a short-term improvement and it would be not only wrong but dangerous if too much were read into that short-term improvement.  One reason for this diminished enthusiasm is that it will take more Irish output to buy the same quantity of imports at the new higher import prices.  This adverse effect of higher import prices on the terms of trade could well swallow up the whole of any 3 per cent rise in output, so that we would be no better off here as a community. In effect, we would have to run faster just to stand still in terms of paying our way in the world.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in relation to this output increase, there is no evidence that this slightly better output growth will do anything to ease the unemployment situation.  The bulk of additional exports appear to be coming from the more capital-intensive firms, leaving the older and more labour-intensive firms still in difficulties and, indeed, having to face mounting difficulties, again, I allege because of Government inaction and a failure to take the courageous kind of steps any Government with a sense of their full responsibility to the workers should take.</P>
    <P>The depressing conclusion is that unemployment will continue to rise rather than to fall over the coming year so that, once again, we must look forward to the grim prospect of 120,000 people out of work this winter or, more accurately, I should say 120,000 <Col N="811" /> officially registered.  The figure possibly goes up to 150,000 persons since the true numbers of unemployed are not known because of the fact that school leavers and other young people are not registered on the unemployed register.  The figure which is widely believed to be the true figure is 150,000 when account is taken of all the school leavers and other young people.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil say that is an intolerable situation.  For three years running we will have well over 100,000 people officially out of work.  This is an appalling all-time record and one which cries out for urgent and radical action.  There is no sign of that urgent and radical action coming from the Coalition.  There is no sign of it in the Green Paper, and no indication from the Coalition benches that it is likely to come in any event.  How extraordinary and how shameful that the Labour Party&mdash;and not one member of that party is present in the House at the moment, notwithstanding the fact that the previous speaker was a Labour Minister&mdash;should support a policy which will do nothing to reduce unemployment in 1977.  What a sorry, miserable state they have been reduced to, when their contribution to Government is seen not to be the provision of work for those who want to work, but the creation of record-breaking dole queues.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper did not actually say that, even if its proposals were acceptable, employment would rise next year.  It did not say anything at all about what might happen in 1977. How far from reality can this Coalition Government get?  Here we are faced with a crisis level of unemployment, a terrifying inflation rate, an appalling level of borrowing, crippling taxation, all calling for urgent action.  What are we told?  Nothing.  Not a single solitary word about the immediate action to be taken.  Of course, the reason for this shattering silence is obvious.  In the first place, it would need some agreement between the partners on the Coalition benches on economic fundamentals, that is, if any clear-cut action were to be taken now.  That type of agreement simply does not exist in the Coalition <Col N="812" /> set-up.  It is not possible, as we know it now, to produce such an agreement from the ideologically divided partners in Coalition.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, we have the Green Paper falling back on the old and welltried formula of the need to consult the social partners in the hope, of course, that the social partners would be able to tell the Government what to do, and thus avoid the need for the Government to make up their own mind.  We accept the admonition of the Minister for Labour&mdash;or the excuse if you like to put it that way&mdash;that the social partners should be consulted. We have never failed to do that, but we have consulted them on the basis of being able to make up our own minds and telling them what we want done, rather than asking them what they feel we ought to do.</P>
    <P>So we are led to the tripartite talks, and what happens?  Yet another sorry spectacle of Coalition Members agreeing to disagree with each other. If I may refer to what I said at the outset and what the Minister for Labour said, the tripartite talks have just concluded and are described to us in the newspaper headings and columns, at any rate, as having been a failure.  We are now told this was the termination of the preliminary series and the Coalition partners are going to discuss at employer-trade union level what arrangements have to be made for wage negotiations in the coming months, and what agreements are likely to ensure.  As far as can be judged, not one positive suggestion came from the Government which was remotely acceptable to either of the social partners in the course of the preliminary series of talks.  Are they to be resumed?  If so, will some members of the Government tell us when?</P>
    <P>In relation to the choice of words by the Minister for Labour, it was interesting to hear him talk about the recovery he said was taking place.  As his speech developed he was becoming more and more euphoric about the recovery he seemed to have found in the state of our economy.  He started by saying that over recent months the economy has been moving into the first stage of decisive recovery.  These were <Col N="813" /> his words as I have noted them.  Then he said there was a major recovery under way, and later he referred to the turn-about that has already taken place.  Does the Minister for Labour realise he is fooling nobody?  Where is the evidence of this recovery?  Certainly not in the spurious figures&mdash;not spurious to the extent that they were accurate, to some extent at any rate&mdash; of the growth based on a premise on which he was not entitled to rely as evidence of growth but rather as evidence of further difficulties for us. I refer in particular to the devaluation of the pound.  Then, incidentally, he referred to a 2½ per cent originally rejected increase in our gross national product, then the 3½ per cent which he said the EEC or some other international body had said was possible, and he elevated that off the top of his own head to 4 per cent.  If this is the kind of woolly thinking, if these are the unfounded theories of the members of this Government and especially the member of the Government sent in to lead an economic debate, it is no wonder we find ourselves in the dire condition we are in.</P>
    <P>To come back to the tripartite talks, we will remember that the Minister for Finance was able to tell the media at the outset&mdash;although less apparently well able to tell the trade union representatives&mdash;about the gravity of the Government's financial position and about the size of the pay rises and tax cuts which could be afforded next year.  Thus, we learn on the opening day of the talks, when the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour were both present, that two pay rises of 3 per cent each at six-monthly intervals might be acceptable to the Government and that cuts in the region of £30 million for income tax might be managed despite serious financial restrictions. But of course he said no extra money could be afforded this year so that if the unions insisted on increase of social welfare payments, which incidentally some people have thought some Ministers have promised, then there would have to be an ICTU budget.  I say an ICTU budget advisedly because the Minister for Finance obviously told the members <Col N="814" /> of the Irish Congress of Trade Union delegation who came to meet him that if they insisted on an across-the-board increase in social welfare payments then there would have to be a savage increase in taxation.  Therefore, if there was to be such an increase in social welfare benefits, such a savage increase in taxation on the usual hardy annuals&mdash;beer, tobacco and things of that nature&mdash;then the responsibility would be that of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and not of the Government.</P>
    <P>Here again, I must digress to note that again on that occasion there appeared to be some more of the Alice in Wonderland arithmetic which is such an enduring, though not endearing, feature of this Coalition.  To finance the modest amount needed for such improvements and benefits would call for savage rises in taxation on all the old reliables as well as heavy increases&mdash;and, mark this, as well as savage tax increases, heavy rises in the social welfare contributions of workers and/or employers.</P>
    <P>Having delivered himself of this reasonably clear although rather peculiar statement on the shape of economic things to come, the Minister took himself off to Manila.  He was doing important international work, but following his departure a rather different picture emerged.  Within a week the remainder of the Government, those who were still at home, found some extra money or else held different views on financial matters, for lo and behold, some increases in welfare benefits could be made after all without any need for extra taxation to pay for them.  I leave it to others to expand on the inadequacies of the increases which have been made against the promises, the firm commitments made in relation to them in the budget and subsequently by those immediately responsible for the management of our social schemes.</P>
    <P>When the tripartite talks resumed a somewhat different picture emerged also.  Almost heretically the Minister for Labour was able to make suggestions&mdash;he was apparently making suggestions anyway&mdash;which sounded very like the Fianna Fáil proposals of a <Col N="815" /> month earlier, namely, tax cuts to hold down the pace of inflation accompanied by increased Government spending to give a rapid boost to employment.  The only difference from our proposals was that the amounts suggested were only half of those recommended by us, but then I suppose the Coalition have always been half-hearted anyway.  This is in many ways an even more interesting development than the about-face on payments of social welfare increases because of the discrepancies it reveals between the statements of senior Coalition Ministers. First there were the different sentiments in the statements of the Minister for Finance, apart from the statements at the opening of the talks to which I have already referred.  He also denounced the Fianna Fáil proposals as rubbish at the time of their publication.  Of course this denunciation could hardly be taken too seriously because even if the Minister had read them at the time, and I doubt that, he certainly did not have time to study them in any great detail when he made this pronouncement about their quality.</P>
    <P>But that was not all.  In one of his rare departures from pretending that the economy, much less our economic difficulties, does not exist and that if it does he has no responsibility for it, the Taoiseach delivered himself of the view that increased public spending had no part to play in the solution of our economic ills and that the country could not afford more teachers, gardaí or public employees.  This view is, of course, suspect because it ignores what the situation was when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  It ignored what the record shows: that the country could afford improvement in health, education and other services.  As well the record shows that substantial and worthwhile improvements in these areas took place in the 1960s and 1970s and more importantly, that these improvements did not rely on borrowed EEC money or any other EEC funds but were paid for out of the higher incomes and output generated from a soundly managed economy.</P>
    <P>Then in a different way we heard the <Col N="816" /> dissenting voice of Deputy B. Desmond.  Not only did the Green Paper fail, according to him, the leaving certificate, but the Fianna Fáil proposals were, to use his word, pitiful.  This criticism, too, might have carried more conviction if Deputy Desmond could have pointed out the specific errors of our ways to mortals like us who perhaps are not endowed with his superior insight.</P>
    <P>I would regard it as Deputy Desmond's duty in the national interest to tell us all where we have gone wrong.  What kind of proposals for action would win his acclamation and support?  In the absence of any such revelation of a new and superior economic vision, we must assume that his brief, critical reference to the Fianna Fáil proposal was simply an insurance to guard himself against any inference that he is so fed up with the Coalition bungling as to secretly support our views.</P>
    <P>Whatever the explanation, clearly the Minister for Labour was not distracted by these criticisms, either from the Taoiseach, from Deputy Desmond or from any other source.  However, before we allow ourselves to cast the Minister for Labour in the role of a brave David adopting the Fianna Fáil view in the face of the Coalition Goliath, we must pause and ask ourselves the question: was not the Minister for Labour supposed to be representing the Government at these talks and, therefore, in that capacity, was he not representing the Government's views?  Was he not chairing these talks with some of his ministerial colleagues, cast in the roles of supporting actors with various walk-on and walk-off parts?</P>
    <P>As he was the Government's representative, chairing the talks with other Ministers at his side on occasions, his views must surely have represented Government thinking on this issue and, in turn, this must represent another about-face on the part of the Government.  If that is so and if they have accepted the Fianna Fáil view, then we welcome their conversion.  If they have, we must hope they will not leave implementation of these proposals too late.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> We all remember that when we put forward suggestions in 1974 they adopted them belatedly.  The House and the country will remember that in the late autumn of 1974 we put forward certain proposals which included the provision of temporary subsidies on certain essential goods and services.  If these proposals had been adopted by the Government, then they would have had the effect of keeping about 10,000 people in employment who lost their jobs and, by holding off price increases, they would have headed off the inevitable wage demands which served only to fuel inflation in the first half of 1975. Having ignored our proposals in the January budget of 1975, the Minister for Finance, obviously with the agreement of the Government, included them in his budget of June, 1975. Unfortunately, they did this belatedly and half-heartedly and by then it was too late.  The cumulative effect of higher prices and higher pay demands caused the inflationary spiral to get even more out of hand and this Government have failed totally to catch up with it even since then.</P>
    <P>We are still left with the Green Paper and there is no indication that the Government intend in any way to adopt positive policies such as we propose. If the pattern of the Green Paper is anything to go by, it will be more realistic for us to assume that the Government have not made up their minds, that they are keeping open all their options until they see what is the line of least resistance or what course of action will avoid too much unpopularity. If it will help to encourage the Minister for Labour and the Government to press ahead with what Fianna Fáil believe to be the correct action, I should like to emphasise some points.</P>
    <P>First, the proposed tax cuts of up to £50 million mentioned in the tripartite talks are not really tax cuts. They are simply the amounts needed to prevent a rise in the real burden of income tax.  The reason for this is obvious.  With inflation at a rate of 18 per cent, or more this year, the real value of income tax allowances is being reduced rapidly and to compensate <Col N="818" /> for this inflation a substantial increase in tax allowances is needed.  For example, the allowance for a married couple would need to increase from the current £1,010 to, say, £1,200.  The allowance for a single person would need to increase by about £110 and the child allowance by about £45.  All of this would not improve the situation but would be an effort to keep pace with the rising rate of inflation.  The cost of these improvements would be in the region of £50 million.</P>
    <P>These improvements should be made without any suggestion that they are a concession because they are not. They are simply the amounts needed to offset the ravages of inflation.  If the Government fail to make these improvements in tax allowances, they will be using inflation as a convenient method for raising the real level of income tax this year.</P>
    <P>We should call a spade a spade. There should not be any confusing or wrong suggestions that the first £50 million of improvements in income tax allowances are real tax cuts.  As I have tried to demonstrate, they are not.  If the Government want to press on and make real tax cuts&mdash;and we believe and insist that they should&mdash;they must go much further than the £50 million suggested in the tripartite talks.  Fianna Fáil believe that inflation must be curbed if the country is to be set on the path of recovery.  Action to lower inflation here in Ireland would lead to other important long-run consequences.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council had this to say in paragraphs 39 and 40 of their report on inflation published in June, 1975&mdash;a report, incidentally, which urged the Government to adopt the policy which Fianna Fáil at that stage had been advocating for months, namely, to make tax cuts in order to bring down prices:</P>
    <P>39.  In present circumstances, therefore, the aim must be to avoid devaluation and to create the conditions in which the link with sterling could be broken and/or the Irish pound revalued if strong inflationary trends continue outside Ireland (notably in the United <Col N="819" /> Kingdom).  The only way to do this is to bring the rate of inflation in Ireland down below that obtaining in the United Kingdom.  This would restore the competitive advantage of Irish goods, making revaluation against sterling (and therefore better insulation of the economy against external inflationary pressures) a feasible step.</P>
    <P>40. This cannot be achieved instantaneously but it can be done over a relatively short period.  If for a few years the rate of inflation in Ireland could be kept below that in the UK (say, by 3 to 5 per centage points), and there was some prospect of this margin being maintained, then a revaluation against sterling could be contemplated and would have some prospect of being successful.  Considering the likely rate of inflation in the United Kingdom, this would not imply draconian measures to reduce the Irish inflation rate. Rather it implies that if, for example, the Irish rate can be reduced successfully by domestic policy to 10 per cent (assuming a UK rate of about 15 per cent), then after a relatively short time the sterling link could be broken, and the Irish pound could be revalued against sterling, thus offsetting some of the external inflationary forces.  If the efforts to restrain domestic inflation continued to be successful, and if the external inflationary forces remained strong, further periodic revaluations would be feasible and desirable.</P>
    <P>The footnote is also worth quoting. It states:</P>
    <P>In practice, once the link with sterling was broken, the Irish pound would probably be linked to a stronger currency or currencies. The maintenance of the new link would probably mean continuing and gradual revaluations against sterling.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of policy which Fianna Fáil have been advocating. Our policy proposals would enable the Irish inflation rate to be brought <Col N="820" /> below the UK rate by about 5 per cent in 1977, and further substantial cuts of perhaps 3 per cent to 4 per cent should be feasible in the following years.  Once this trend towards falling inflation has been established, and once it was accompanied by a rise in employment&mdash;as it would be with the operation of our other policies&mdash;then Ireland would be in a position if we so decided to break the link with sterling and cut itself off from the malaise of sterling and link it with the more stable currencies of the EEC.  In this way it would be possible to make sure that any initial success in curbing inflation and restoring economic progress would not be dissipated by some future bout of sickness on the part of sterling or the British economy.  If we took such action it would be a logical culmination of the process which we initiated when we joined the EEC and so started to reduce our trade dependence on Britain.</P>
    <P>That is why the recent fall of sterling, which must inevitably give a further push to price rises in the near future, should cause the Government to put a halt to the dithering and shilly-shallying and get on with the job of providing work and stable prices.  Now there is an even greater need for urgency, determination and vigour in tackling those of our economic difficulties which are of our own making and which can be cured by our own action.  In this respect I am appalled at what appears to be the thinking of the Minister for Labour when he refers to our capital programme and our intention to hold it in or about the same level over the next three or four years.  Does the Minister realise that all employment is not generated by the capital programme? The real employment is generated by forces and resources outside the capital programme.  If this is the thinking of the Minister for Labour it is little wonder that the private sector is finding itself in such dire difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is true that the only possible difficulty or reservation which has been raised in connection with the <Col N="821" /> Fianna Fáil proposals is that they would give rise to some initial increase in Government borrowing. That is a difficulty which we recognised and answered.  We believe that it is possible to finance the temporary programme of action needed to set the economy on the road to recovery.  Moreover, we believe this can be done by harnessing domestic savings and resources and without the need for any expensive foreign borrowing.  Since our September proposals were published, events have strengthened our view. In particular it is interesting to note that for the second year running the original January budget estimates of the likely scale of borrowing needed by the Government will show an error in the region of £100 million.</P>
    <P>Last year the final deficit, and therefore the extent of borrowing, was more than £100 million higher than the original budget expectations. This year it seems as though the reverse will be true.  The trends for Exchequer revenue and spending suggest that the current deficit will be considerably less than the budget forecast of £327 million, perhaps in the region of £250 million or less.  If there is indeed a cut in borrowing of, say, £75 million then that sum would be available to finance our programme.  The net sum needed for our package was estimated at £100 million.  The real truth of the matter is that the Government's finances are so out of control that the Minister cannot be sure even to within £100 million what the situation is from one year to another.  In these circumstances it is absurd to oppose the correct economic policies, the realistic policies, which Fianna Fáil have put forward.  They were opposed with arguments based on extravagant arithmetic which is certain to be proved wrong within a matter of months if not weeks.</P>
    <P>It took less than two weeks for the arithmetic of the ICTU budget to dissolve, and for social welfare payments to be afforded.  How many long political weeks will it take before the Government finally and openly admit and accept what their <Col N="822" /> Minister for Labour is already halfheartedly saying to the tripartite talks, namely, that the Fianna Fáil programme of tax cuts and job creation is the correct and rapid path towards a soundly based economic recovery?  I have confined myself to the broad economic issues. Other Fianna Fáil speakers will deal with other specific areas like prices, unemployment, especially youth unemployment, the decline of the building industry and so on but we will all be urging that no further time be lost.  The country has already suffered from three years of wasted time since the oil crisis, three years of contradictory policies, three years of exhortations, of calls for action and three years of failure of will on the part of the Government, failure of policy, and failure of leadership.  The price for that failure is there for all to see.</P>
    <P>We entered the oil crisis in a much stronger position than many of our EEC partners.  We had a large agricultural sector which is less dependent on oil and we were poised to take advantage of the higher prices and secure markets which were opened up by our membership of the EEC.  We had a record influx of new industries, attracted by the combination of access to EEC markets, a skilled Irish work force and generous financial incentives and these new industries should have enabled us to offset any losses in traditional industries.</P>
    <P>However, instead of emerging from the recession with a stronger employment and income position we, in fact, end up with the worst combination of inflation and unemployment in the entire community.  Worse still, we have added to our burdens the millstone of enormous foreign debts which have been piled up on a prodigal scale with as little benefit as the prodigal son's own squandering.  The time for action is running out.  The problems will not go away of their own accord.  There must be radical, determined, positive action to restore the economy to health and vigour and that action must be taken now.  I am satisfied that that kind of action is not forthcoming from this kind of Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> I do not delude myself, nor do I have the temerity to try to delude the public, that Fianna Fáil now promise that when returned to Government we could do all this quickly or easily.  It will require courageous decisions.  It will require on the part of the public as well as the Government that we face up to the realities of the need for these decisions.  What Fianna Fáil promise and undertake is that we will show the initiative and have the courage to do what is necessary.  We have the will and the unity of purpose to restore that most precious of all national attributes in times of difficulty and uncertainty, confidence; the confidence of our people in themselves and in their country.</P>

      <P>I gather that the Opposition have been trying to make a meal out of a crumb which they gleaned today from the <i>Financial Times</i> which referred to a report bespoken by the Bank of Ireland from McKinseys.  There is one thing certain: if you pay consultants a fee to produce a report they will produce one and, secondly, the production of a report does not necessarily mean that the recipients of the draft report agree with all that is said in the report and particularly with the tendentious language in the report. The word &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; is used in the headline of the <i>Financial Times</i> today and I gather in some subsequent reports that have been issued in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the people of Ireland that McKinseys are associated with one of the most disastrous inflationary influences in Irish public expenditure, that is, the creation of the health boards of recent years.  They might like to compare their immoderate language in the draft report, which is not necessarily the report of the Bank of Ireland, with their own injection of inflationary tendencies in public expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with a report in today's <i>Financial Times</i> which purports to be an account of <Col N="824" /> a draft furnished to the Bank of Ireland and to comments thereon.  I want to speak in this debate very calmly, coolly and objectively.  The issues upon which I want to talk are the recovery of our economy, the dangers of unjustified pessimism, the priorities of economic policy in 1977, the appropriate economic and social policies for Ireland to 1980, some very badly thought out Fianna Fáil suggestions as to how to deal with the difficulties of the situation, and finally, but governing all our thoughts, expenditure control and the need for discipline in a national plan.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the usual practice, Fianna Fáil are well behind the times.  A year ago they might correctly and objectively have spoken of a deteriorating situation.  But they waited a year of recovery before they recognised that there had been a difficult situation.  They now have the temerity to put down a motion at a time when the Irish economy is recovering.  The fact that it is recovering does not for one moment remove the real problems with which Ireland has to deal, problems from which Fianna Fáil ran away in 1973, when, to the total surprise of the nation, they declared a general election because at the time some harsh economic realities were brought to their notice by the Department of Finance.  Rather than let the Irish people see those realities, they decided to go to the country while the people were living in a very easy situation.</P>
      <P>A year or 18 months ago they might have dealt with a deteriorating situation but that situation is no longer with us.  While I will very properly, statistically and objectively draw attention to the very substantial improvement in our economic performance, I am not for one moment suggesting that there are any grounds for complacency nor am I departing from the very clear lesson that is preached in the Government's Green Paper on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition and some people in our community have failed to recognise that economic recovery has been under way since the autumn of 1975. The facts do not support their allegation of a deteriorating situation.  Consequently, <Col N="825" /> the present motion is completely uncalled for, unless the motivation behind it is to attempt to generate more pessimism than is justified.  That is a subject to which I will return.</P>
    <P>During this year, up to the present hour, the main indicators of economic performance have evolved in a manner which justifies a revision upwards of the estimates for the growth rate in Ireland.  At the time of the last budget, which was severely criticised by the Opposition, the estimated growth rate was about ½ of 1 per cent.  The Fianna Fáil Party before the Summer Recess were still using that ½ of 1 per cent as their estimate of the economic performance this year. Their own foolish proposals recently published estimate that the growth in Ireland in 1976 will be a mere 1 per cent.  They suggest tax concessions of £100 million, extra borrowing of £100 million, rates relief of £58 million an increase in the deficit of about £300 million on the basis of a 1 per cent growth rate which is now as dead as the Dodo.  The likely growth rate for 1976 will be in the region of 4 per cent.  That means Fianna Fáil are four times wrong in their estimate of Ireland's economic performance for 1976.</P>

A comparison between our performance in 1976 and that of our EEC partners puts us well up the league of performance of <Col N="826" /> other countries&mdash;exceeding that of several countries including Britain and most of the Benelux countries, and very close behind the performance of the economic successes of the modern world, Germany and France.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any doubts about the recovery in our economy can be dispelled by examining the trends and the main indicators of economic activity.  Industrial production grew strongly in the first half of 1976. In the first quarter the output of manufacturing industry rose by 6 per cent on the final quarter of last year and suggests a further rise since then.  As a result, output in the second quarter was about 13 per cent above the level of the same period of 1975 and is now certain of getting back to the pre-recession peak.  I would like to remind the nation generally that the peak performance of the Irish economy was as a result of our budgetary performance of 1975.  Activity in the building industry, as indicated by the sales of cement, has also improved this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first 9 months of this year cement sales, in volume terms, are 5 per cent above the same period in 1975.  The main stimulus to industrial performance has come from industrial exports.  In the period January-September they showed a value rise of 40 per cent over the same period of 1975.  This represents an increase in volume of 16 per cent. This marked improvement on last year's downward trend, which was less in Ireland than the downward trend in other European countries, serves to highlight the extent to which our economy depends on a favourable external environment for growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the inadequacy of supplies continues to restrict the volume of <Col N="827" /> exports, the buoyancy of external markets has led to much better prices and, in value terms, agricultural exports showed an increase of 8 per cent in the first three quarters of 1976.  This increase represents a considerable advance on what was reasonably expected earlier this year.  Domestic demand, also, has improved in 1976. The revival in consumer confidence has contributed greatly to a very significant recovery in consumer demand.  The strength of this recovery may be gauged from the fact that in the first 7 months of the year the volume of retail sales was 5 per cent greater than the level for 1975. Further evidence of this is available from the trend of new car sales. Members will recall that earlier this year it was forecast by our opponents that the tax changes in the budget would destroy the Irish car trade. However, registrations of new cars increased by 29 per cent in the first three quarters of this year and for 1976 as a whole the growth in domestic consumption will be well above the level of the years 1974 or 1975.  This will go a long way towards relieving the difficulties experienced by firms which were dependent largely on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>All of what I say about the domestic situation is supported by the very significant increase in the trend of exports.  In Ireland this trend is always a prime indicator of domestic activity.  In the first nine months of this year imports increased in value by 36 per cent.  That is equivalent in volume to 20 per cent.  The most encouraging aspect of these imports is that they are for further investment, for further production purposes. Most heartening of all is the revival in demand and output which has now begun to work through to investment. Improvement of that kind is a sure sign that the recovery is based soundly and is recognised by investors as being such.</P>
    <P>The latest indicators suggest that the volume of investment which, of course, is the seed of growth and of future prosperity, has begun to rise. The increase in cement sales points <Col N="828" /> to a pick-up in investment in building and construction while the trend in the imports of producers' capital goods suggest that investment in machinery and equipment also is moving ahead fast.  They increased in value by about 30 per cent in the period January to September.  These increases are attributable to two reasons.  They are attributable to the stimulus provided by the Government's policy of increasing substantially the volume of public capital expenditure, a policy which at the time was derided by the Opposition and which was sneered at again by Deputy Lynch during the past half hour.  This declaration of confidence by the Government has been absorbed by the private sector so that we now have a very significant increase in investment in Ireland.  It is a vote of confidence that is very useful not only for the immediate future but in the long term interest of our economy.</P>
    <P>With this very satisfactory improvement in demand and output the employment situation has shown a significant improvement.  Indeed, the improvement here in this sphere is better than is the case in several other EEC countries where growth in the economy and increase in output have not produced a commensurate increase in the number of people employed.  In the first and second quarters of this year employment in industry increased by 1 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are those who would sneer at this achievement but having regard to the global situation of deterioration in the number of people employed this 1 per cent was an achievement.  The indications are that the improvement since then has been even greater.  Regarding employment in the building industry, the index of employment in the private sector has shown an even greater improvement in recent months.  The improving prospect for employment is beginning to have an impact on the level of unemployment and that factor, too, is significant.  Despite the advice of every objective commentator Fianna <Col N="829" /> Fáil anticipate an increase this year of 12 per cent in the labour force. The more accurate figure is 8,500. But although there has been that increase in the number of people in the labour market we have reduced the number unemployed.  Unfortunately, however, our unemployment figure remains at an extraordinary high level but the underlying trend during the past few months has been distinctly downwards.  The total number on the live register is now much lower than it was at the beginning of the year notwithstanding the fact that there are 8,500 people extra in the labour force according to the figures issued by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>Despite these improvements we are not boasting because we do not think that the rate of progress in this regard is such as to justify boasts but we say that, despite the irresponsible claims of a deterioration in the economy, the facts are to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our economic performance this year is blighted by the disappointment we are experiencing in relation to the rate of inflation but the rate this year is lower than that of last year when it was 24 per cent and would have remained so if the Government had not taken measures in the June budget to reduce it.  This year the figure is likely to be 18 per cent or a reduction of 6 per cent.  This reduction has been achieved at a time when we are dealing with an appalling injection of inflation, with the extraordinary developments in relation to the value of the £ sterling with which the Irish £ is linked and which in turn increased substantially the cost of our imports which represent about 50 per cent of our total consumption.  We are not saying that the rate of inflation has been reduced by as much as we would have wished but if the Government's policy of a pay pause in 1976 had been adopted our rate of inflation this year would be 14 per cent or a reduction of 10 per cent from the early 1975 figure of 24 per cent.  This would have represented a gigantic performance and one about which we could crow.  However the Government's policies were not acceptable to the social partners and were obstructed not merely by the <Col N="830" /> social partners but also by the incitement on the part of the Opposition against the acceptance of a pay pause this year.  Six weeks ago, though, the same Opposition advocated a similar policy for 1977.  We would have our unemployment figures down below 90,000 this year if our policy had been adopted and if we had had even a modicum of support from the Opposition. I am encouraged now at the end of 1976 that at least Fianna Fáil has had the courage to come out in public and advocate a pay pause to the end of 1977.  That is a reversal of their previous policy.  That is a very late declaration of support for the policies of this Government.</P>

      <P>If they had acted with more responsibility a year ago our unemployment figures now might be around 88,000 and our rate of inflation might be down to 14 per cent instead of the figures at which they now operate.  But I suppose one must forgive past omissions and welcome even a late conversion.  It is at least clear now to everybody that as between Government and Opposition there is no disagreement on the desirability of having incomes moderation as the main injection towards long-term economic health.</P>
      <P>We have made progress but we need to make a great deal more.  Our difficulties this year are certainly accentuated by the performance of the £ sterling.  This is a subject to which I shall return later, but it would be idle for anybody to think we can find a solution to our difficulties by an adjustment in our currency alone. No adjustment in our currency relationship with the £ sterling, with the European stake, or with world currency could occur without very firm discipline in relation to domestic performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad once again to have Deputy Colley's support for that.  I believe the way in which this <Col N="831" /> country can break out from the economic stranglehold of our past financial and economic links and our current difficulties is to perform at home in a way which shows a complete understanding of the fact that our economic salvation lies primarily in our own hands and no combination of international relations or adjustment of international economic or currency policies can compensate for the advantage which could flow to this country from a proper adjustment of domestic policies on both the incomes front and the public expenditure front.</P>
      <P>The recovery, as recovery there has been, in the Irish economy in 1976 was helped by the growth of our trading partners.  It was also helped by the stimulus afforded by the Government's fiscal policies for 1976. It was a matter of some disappointment that we did not have in January of this year the support we are now getting from Fianna Fáil for many of our economic policies, but Ireland is not peculiar in the fact that the Opposition is endeavouring to make a meal out of our current difficulties. I meet monthly with my financial colleagues in Europe and I have, therefore, some first hand experience of what is happening in their economies, and throughout the European Community all financial Ministers, all Ministers in charge of the economy, have come under very strong attack, with each nation tending to blame the Government of the day for the difficulties experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to draw a contrast between Ireland's performance in the last three difficult years and the performance of the European Economic Community as a whole. The European Economic Community economy grew at an annual rate of nearly 5 per cent in the six years up to 1973 but it declined very grievously in the years 1974 and 1975.  Their imports which, between 1968 and 1973, had grown in volume at an annual rate of over 10 per cent, fell by more than 6 per cent in the years 1974 and 1975.  In that situation the likelihood <Col N="832" /> was that without a radical change in policies the output of the Irish economy would decline in a similar way.  But we did not decline at the same rate as the rest of Europe because this Government, notwithstanding the opposition of Fianna Fáil, took temporary&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;&mdash;measures to correct the imbalance.</P>
    <P>We recognised the threat.  We recognised the threat to employment and it was in response to this threat that we adopted financial policies which were viciously opposed by the Opposition. This involved necessarily a high rate of current deficit and a very high level of borrowing but it was, of course, a policy which was entirely supported by the foremost authorities, by the EEC, the OECD and particularly the IMF in the aftermath of the oil crisis of 1973-74.  The beneficial effects of our policy, which Fianna Fáil opposed, are now evident because Ireland's GDP rose during the years 1974 and 1975 whereas throughout the rest of Europe it declined. We did better than all of Europe in those very difficult years.</P>
    <P>Even more significant was the development of unemployment.  Fianna Fáil had the temerity to say today that Ireland has the highest level of unemployment in Europe.  So she has but that happens to be the legacy of nearly 40 years of Fianna Fáil Government.  We started from the highest level but we did not increase at the rate which the rest of Europe did.  Throughout the rest of Europe the rate of unemployment doubled in those difficult financial years.  In Ireland it increased at half this rate. But it would most certainly have doubled if we had followed the economic policies of Fianna Fáil, policies which, in their latest exhortation, they now admit to be false.  But they are too late with the remedy.  The remedy is no longer required.  The patient has recovered.  There is no need to administer the medicine they want to administer, but there is a need, and I want to emphasise this, to look at the situation here calmly and objectively and Fianna Fáil's motion today is deliberately designed to prevent a <Col N="833" /> calm and objective assessment of the situation.  There is a real danger of too much pessimism and there is a danger that Ireland could denigrate her own achievements.  We have achieved success in the most difficult period since the foundation of the State.  All the economic indicators now establish that our policy was right and we are now moving in the right direction.  Considerable harm could be done by prophets of doom who paint our present economic situation as one of continuing crisis whereas it is, in fact, one that now offers us more hope than we had at any time since 1973.</P>
    <P>Without confidence we would not have realism.  If people were to panic there is the danger they would go for panic stations.  I believe it is the objective of the Fianna Fáil motion to try to stimulate that panic.  That is the kind of panic that could easily occur as a result of irresponsible or tendentious phrases, such as that used in the McKinsey Report, to which I made reference earlier.  We have seen what has happened in the neighbouring island where some of the Jeremiahs of doom have now sent the £ sterling plunging well down below its true value.  We do not want that kind of thing happening here. I plead with Fianna Fáil, who I believe have some modicum of patriotism and loyalty to the Irish people, not to endeavour to generate gloom and disappointment in Ireland in 1976, when it is not justified by the facts.</P>
    <P>I want to now come to the economic outlook for 1977.  It will depend largely on ourselves how the economy fares in 1977.  We have no reason to be apprehensive about developments in the outside world.  There is recovery throughout the world, although it is not accelerating at a very fast pace.  It may be all the better for that because at least it will avoid any international inflation.  The policies elsewhere are, quite rightly, distinctly cautious.  That must also be our policy for 1977.  The question is whether or not we can take advantage of the improved climate in the outside world, a world on which we are very largely dependent because of the need to sell our goods abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> We cannot take advantage of this outside situation unless we maintain a competitive edge in costs, and we will not do that unless we lower our income demands.  There is no disagreement here between the Opposition and the Government, between the Central Bank, NESC and the Economic and Social Research Institute, between any objective economic commentator on the Irish scene.  I want to say this very calmly, because I sincerely believe it.  Living standards cannot be maintained in Ireland at their present level without causing very substantial unemployment among our younger citizens.  I make this plea to all parents today very objectively and sincerely. Are they prepared to make a short-term sacrifice for the sake of their children?  Would they be prepared to forego 5 per cent per annum over the next four years in wage increases in order to provide employment for their children?  It is my conviction they would.  It is my plea to them to say so and to insist that their own leaders translate that into the kind of incomes policy necessary for Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is certain that we cannot maintain our existing living standards and at the same time give our young people the employment opportunities which they deserve and which each father and mother would want to give them. We need now to translate individual love of one's own children into a national policy for economic salvation. The priorities of economic policy for 1977 as the Government see it, must be firstly to maintain competitiveness by reduction in our rate of inflation; secondly, to reorientate public expenditure away from areas which do not generate employment into investment and other areas which provide jobs; and, thirdly, we must curb the growth of public expenditure.  This policy is not always popular but must be regarded in Ireland in 1976 and 1977 as one of the prime objectives of national policy, even though it means that some people who previously got benefits or hand-outs from the State no longer receive them.</P>
    <P>I do not have to dwell on the need for the maintenance of competitiveness because it is an agreed policy between the Opposition and ourselves.  It <Col N="835" /> is an agreed policy among all sane people in our society, but the best way to maintain it is to achieve very substantial moderation in income demands.  We need to reorientate public expenditure away from areas of the conferring of transient benefits to areas which will generate employment. This is not easy because those are the very areas which generate the greatest political difficulty.  Once again one must make an appeal to the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to the nation to recognise the absolute need for a change in many of our public expenditures which were tailored at a time when some sections had to receive special support from the Exchequer because they were then deprived but which are not suitable to the circumstances of 1976 or to the opportunities which will open for those sectors in 1977 and 1978.  I, as Minister for Finance, will have to do everything in my power to ensure that the proportion of Exchequer resources devoted to productive capital investment continues to rise and that we shift funds from nonproductive expenditures to the productive ones.  I shall return in a moment to the support which any Minister for Finance in any Government in any democracy needs in order to achieve that difficult goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a need to curb public expenditure in Ireland which today absorbs 52 per cent of the gross national product.  That is much too high a figure.  It is one which was justified in the recession years of 1974, 1975 and early 1976, when the private sector was discouraged from investing and spending but it is a percentage we cannot maintain in the years of growth which have now begun without depriving the private sector of the funds which are so necessary in order to generate employment.  Once again, this cannot be achieved without support from the Opposition and from all leaders of all sectors in Ireland.  I can understand very well why Deputy Wilson <Col N="836" /> smiles.  He is obviously inferring that I am asking too much.  Most of us on this side of the House have spent more years in Opposition than we did here, but the scene has changed. I believe that public opinion and popular support today is available and will increasingly become more available for reductions in public expenditure rather than increases.</P>
    <P>There are immense constraints on the budgetary options open to the public in 1977.  The need to order public finances on the lines I have indicated, our EEC commitments, the amount of funds which the Government can attract by way of loans either at home or overseas demand that our rate of borrowing should be substantially reduced.  This is where I must say that the Fianna Fáil suggestion that we can grab even another £100 million by way of borrowed money is simply unreal. We have to reduce our borrowing requirements, not increase them. They have come late in the day.  I am glad they now acknowledge that, albeit by interpretation and by inference and not by acknowledging the correctness of our policies in the last few years.</P>

      <P>This is the wrong time for Governments to increase borrowing.  Now is the time to decrease it so that the money is available for the private sector which is now exhibiting more confidence than it did for the last three years.  The alternative to taking steps to curb the growth of public expenditure is the imposition of massive new taxes.  I do not want to stand up here in two months' time and announce new taxes. I do not believe it would be right for the economy or desirable, but that would become inevitable unless in the meantime the demands from several sectors fell off, so that Government expenditure necessitating new taxes has not to be increased.  I will do all in my power in the meantime to oppose additional expenditure but no <Col N="837" /> Minister for Finance in any Government or democracy can resist the demands for new expenditures and new taxes unless people are prepared to forego their demands which generate the need for extra revenue.  As the Estimates for several Government agencies and Departments have already been presented to me, it would require an addition of about £150 million in taxation next year.</P>
      <P>We operate under the old British system which even they have now discovered has many disadvantages, a system under which the Government of the day is regarded as being solely charged with the control of expenditure and that the Parliament has no function in this regard.  The time has now come to consider whether or not Parliament has a function in relation to the control of expenditure.  At present we have a Committee of Public Accounts whose only function is to examine whether or not money has been spent in the way that the Dáil has dictated.  It may not examine the current expenditure patterns of Departments or identify where it thinks weaknesses arise in relation to public expenditure.  I will not rely on my view of the situation, a view no doubt accentuated by the experience of inflation on public expenditure, a view which will be supported by all previous Ministers for Finance in this country. I will rely on the views of the National Economic and Social Council in one of the few reports which they published and from which the representative organisations in NESC did not dissent. This was the view which drew attention to the weakness of control of public expenditure in Ireland arising from the fact that so many spending Departments and several State agencies are regarded as not being successful unless they spend more and where immense pressures build up, to the point of embarrassment, so that additional expenditures are regarded as being unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1975 the Government came to a decision which it promulgated to all the State agencies that expenditure should not exceed allocations in any area no matter what the compulsion was for additional expenditure <Col N="838" /> and that if it were apparent that the allocations were going to be exceeded, policy changes should be made so as to live within the allocations. This year we have exerted far greater control over expenditure than at any time in the history of the State so that now in the concluding weeks of the financial year 1976 we can point to a remarkable change in Government finances.  Deputy Lynch referred to it but he does not know the extent of it yet.  We are now in a happy situation in which Government borrowing requirements for 1975 will probably be about £100 million less than anticipated last January.</P>

      <P>1976.  This has resulted from two things, firstly because of very stringent control on public expenditure and because we resisted the vehement demands by the Opposition and by other well-intentioned people for more and more expenditure. I accept that many of those demands were made by people genuinely anxious to see various services improved.  It has been a heartbreak to refuse the additional money but it had to be refused because it would not be good for our economy to give in to these demands.  We have succeeded because for the first time we have held Government expenditure at the level which we anticipated.</P>

      <P>Secondly, the growth in our economy is far greater than even we optimists expected as a result of our budgetary proposals last year. At that stage I said that as a result of our budgetary policy and the overall economic climate we could expect a 2 per cent growth rate.  Our growth rate is now pushing to 4 per cent and is likely to reach 4 per cent before the end of the year.  That is not a deteriorating situation but an improving one.  The Rip Van Winkles are 18 months late, they have missed the bus just as you will also miss the opportunity of success in the next general election.  The population will <Col N="839" /> follow the economic prescription that we the realists have produced to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>While listening to the Minister for Finance putting on his performance, I was wondering whether I was in the same country.  A Kafkaesque situation seems to be developing and the Minister seems to be talking about some other place.  I would like to punch home the Minister's last remark about how much better off he would find himself at the end of this year than he had anticipated. The fact is that other people as well as the Minister for Finance read the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the figures there show that the Minister has taken in by way of increased income tax and increased value-added tax colossal sums of money due to direct budgetary policy.  The Minister should have told us that and should have also told us that the consequences of taking in that money were inflationary.  They put pressure on people and the people put pressure on their employers and this assisted the curse of inflation which is afflicting this country.  The whole thing had a Kafkaesque quality.  Anybody who would stand up and say the Government were performing well, where you have inflation of 18 per cent, where you have official unemployment statistics of 108,000 plus all the school-leavers who are not on the register, has powers of acting, has histrionic ability which would command the highest sums of money in its proper field, that of acting.  The Minister did not tell us that his estimated 4 per cent improvement in GNP was helped by the very thing he was decrying, namely, the weakness of the £.  I suppose the Minister had to make the best of his brief and nobody will blame him for that 108,000 provided nobody takes him too seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the starkness of the economic crisis in Ireland has registered with most people.  It certainly does not seem to have registered fully with the Government.  The jargon of Government announcements obscures the gravity of the situation.  The party Leader referred to Deputy Desmond's assurance that chapter three of the Government's Green Paper would not <Col N="840" /> merit an E mark on the leaving certificate pass Economics paper, and this is the chapter which should contain the ideas for taking Ireland out of our economic nose dive.  There are no ideas in it.  The same chapter tells us that the development of the smelter for Navan's zinc is being actively pursued. Again the cover-up jargon is obvious. The taxpayer, as I mentioned a few moments ago, and as is proved by looking at the figures in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, is being actively pursued.  Foreign bankers are being actively pursued by the Minister for Finance on the touch for loans.  Some social welfare recipients are being actively pursued and hounded by rising prices and the failure of the Government to help them.</P>
    <P>The economic emergency is all the more dangerous and depressing to national morale coming as it does when, for the first time in our history, we have thousands of well-educated, energetic and ambitious young men and women coming on to the labour market.  The National Economic and Social Council is not in any doubt about the quality of our young labour force, and our labour force generally. Indeed, if one meets experienced industrialists from other countries, many of whom were employed in a specialist capacity in our provincial towns when the Fianna Fáil Governments of the past were getting our new industries under way, one could get assurances from them about the high quality of the Irish working man, his intelligence and adaptability.  Now, on top of that natural intelligence and adaptability he or she has a formal education which is bound to be of advantage, no matter what pursuit the young person takes up.</P>
    <P>The NESC report, &ldquo;Prelude to Planning&rdquo;, states that the potential for growth in terms of numbers and quality of workers is probably greater in Ireland than in any OECD country, with the possible exception of Japan. The case has been well made that we have now, and will have in the future, large numbers of good quality workers looking for jobs.  They will have a good basic education.  Through AnCO and other agencies the facilities exist for special training and, indeed, we <Col N="841" /> hope money will continue to flow from the European Social Fund to be used in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some of us have qualms and doubts about how the money is being used at present.  We find young people are doing courses and we know for a fact there are no jobs on those lines available to them after the courses are finished, AnCO courses and courses in various regional technical colleges. The certainty that, if the proper conditions prevail, home investment is available to promote industrial development, and also the certainty that investment money will come from abroad to develop industry here, cannot be challenged provided the conditions, which can be improved by the Government, are right for such investment.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees on this: basic to the whole idea of industrial development is the fact that we must be able to sell at home and abroad, but especially abroad because we have a small market at home.  We must be able to sell at home and abroad at a profit, competitively.  We must be able to compete.  If we are not able to compete we will not be able to export, and we will not be able to sell at home with all the barriers coming down fast, and there can be no development.  The very fact that there is an international recession&mdash; and we hear this used as an excuse for all the failings in our own economy&mdash; makes it more difficult to compete with other countries in foreign markets. That makes it all the more imperative that we should see to it that we are competitive.  Otherwise there will be no future expansion.</P>
    <P>In the economic debate which has been going on against a very dreadful background of inflation and unemployment, we have not heard enough about the conclusions which Dr. Llewellyn drew from a study of the OECD countries with regard to development.  This is outlined in the 26th report of the National Economic and Social Council.  The main burden of his conclusion is that there is a close correlation between growth on the one hand in the agricultural and manufacturing industries and, on the <Col N="842" /> other hand, growth in commerce, public utilities and the whole major services sector.  The late Seán Lemass put it more colourfully when he said a rising tide lifts all boats.</P>
    <P>In that study Dr. Llewellyn pointed out that what happened in the OECD countries he studied was that where agricultural output and manufacturing output grew, the other sectors of the community grew with them.  As the correlation has been established in a cause and effect way, should we not concentrate our efforts on those areas in the assurance that, if development takes place in those areas, development will take place over another large field which can provide work opportunities, jobs in other words, for increasing numbers of young trained people?</P>
    <P>As public representatives, at all our clinics and all our meeting places we have a trek of young people to our doors, crowds of young people, men and women, who have certain educational attainments, looking for jobs. Their hopes are diminishing day by day.  Some of them never had jobs. Some of them got a few weeks work, a taste of what it was like to be in employment, and were then let go. I am not making any up in the air statement about this.  I know exactly what I am talking about.  I have these people coming to me and the situation is becoming more pathetic day by day.  I do not want to be simplistic or facile in this.  I do not want to say growth can be achieved easily.  We need the rising tide in manufacturing industry and in the agricultural industry to lift the boats of commerce, our communication and transport, the boats of public utilities and the construction industry. As I have said, this tide will rise if we are able to maintain competitiveness. We must be able to compete. The conclusions are forced inexorably on us that that is basic to the whole problem of our economy.  When questions are being asked in the House about the footwear and textile industries it boils down to that each time provided the competition is fair &mdash;I know from low cost countries there can be unfair competition and <Col N="843" /> steps should be taken to deal with that&mdash;with our own EEC partners we will have to be able to compete.</P>
    <P>The prospect of the development in manufacturing industry of bringing with it the development across the line in our economy is a bright one.  It is one that should encourage us, that should demand from the Government the strongest possible unified effort to achieve the proper position for manufacturing industry.  In commerce if this happens, inexorably it seems the correlation has been established.  Our young people will have more jobs, more job opportunities in wholesale shops, retail shops, restaurants, hotels, the banks and finance houses, insurance and transport.  To take an example from my own constituency, since we went into the EEC there are several companies now hauling meat to Europe and doing other business, collecting other goods on the return journey.  Here we have an increase in employment, office employment, employment for transport workers, drivers and so on.  More technicians would be needed, telephonists, engineers in communications, all following inexorably from the development of the two sectors, agriculture and manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>In the employment field of the public utilities the job opportunities will increase also for people in offices, for engineers, technologists, technicians. Gas and electricity should get the required boost when the other development has taken place. Although the study does not see as close a correlation between the development in the construction industry on the one hand and agriculture and manufacturing industry on the other, nevertheless, such development will bring about a boost in the construction industry which will also provide more employment for our young people.</P>
    <P>It is clear then that a serious effort to increase agriculture and, especially in the context of this country, manufacturing output will not merely give an increase of employment in agro-industry and in the other manufacturing industries but will also bring a <Col N="844" /> great increase in all the other fields I have outlined.  It will revitalise sectors of the economy such as I have mentioned, commerce, including shops, banks, insurance, various public and private services.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to wish and to hope that this can be done.  It is vital that we should do it.  The sad spectacle of our youth with certificates, degrees and diplomas, all academically dressed up and nowhere to go, will have to be made disappear.  We cannot afford it, and if we cannot deal with this we are going to encounter very serious social problems.  In the context to which I refer&mdash;and this is important in rural Ireland in particular&mdash;there will be increased job opportunities in local authorities.  Additional office staff, additional technological and technician staff will be required for all kinds of development where manufacturing industry is increasing in spread and in output.  It is called infrastructural nowadays.</P>
    <P>I think this has been well covered by the thirty-sixth report of the National Economic and Social Council. I do not know how much attention is being given to that report. The trade union representatives felt that, due to the discussions that the social partners were carrying on at that time and also to the oncoming talks on new wage rounds and so on, they could not sign it.  They did not dissent from it.  They went on with discussions which are extremely important but if we accept the conclusions of that report the way is clear to economic recovery.  Logic demands that we accept the conclusions that the market sector of our economy is very important and that its importance should be recognised.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to point out the parlous position of the exposed or unsheltered section of the market sector, the section which is exposed to foreign competition.  When we had tariff barriers here the competition did not exist to the same extent.  It was not so important in the home market.  Nowadays the competition is in the home market for a small market but, above all, in the foreign market where we must export.  We must <Col N="845" /> export to live and in order to export we must be competitive.  Special attention from the Government, from the trade unions, from this House, from all of us, must be given to this sector. It seems that the case has been well made that the headlines for incomes must be taken from that sector and not from the sector which can increase incomes and recover without any fear of competition in the open market.  The cold breeze of competition can kill in this sector.  This House week in, week out, hears about industries in Dublin city and various towns throughout the country which have been killed simply because they are not able to compete.  It is particularly the Government's business if the competition is unfair, if there is a question of dumping, but if in fair competition an industry is not able to sell at home or abroad then that industry will die.  Whatever factors contribute to its death will have to be looked at closely because the death of an industry, especially in a small town, often means the death of half the town.  It seems to me that it is in this domain that Government initiative is lacking.  There is a lack of leadership here.  It may be due to the fact that in the Administration there are two strongly contrasting points of view on where the headlines for incomes should be set.  If that is so it cannot be remedied unless the Government choose to resign.</P>
    <P>One would have thought it would be an easy enough task for the Government, with the resources at their disposal, to draw up a full comprehensive list of industries in that particular exposed, unsheltered section of our economy.  One would have thought the next step would be to convince industrialists and employees of the necessity to remain competitive, to convince them of the truth that death will follow a lack of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil economic document suggested two ways that could help the workers and employers and not damage competitiveness.  We suggested there should be a cut in income tax for the employees and a reduction in the contribution by the employers <Col N="846" /> to the social welfare fund.  If that kind of remedy were applied and if its effects were seen in increased competitiveness, I think the manufacturing industry section could be set under way once more.  I do not want to be too facile, I do not want to sound too simplistic about it.  It would need careful diplomatic handling and it would need strong leadership from the Government and the trade unions. In addition, it would need strong public opinion behind it but all these could and should be made available. They could be successful if combined and concentrated on that problem.</P>
    <P>In effect, the Fianna Fáil suggestion would make firms more competitive at home and, more important, more competitive in foreign markets.  It would be an increase in real income to the employee and it would give a relief to the employer.  It would be part of the duty of the employer to see to it that the monetary advantage he obtained would be used for the benefit of the industry.  The day has gone when a private industrialist, any more than a semi-State company, can disregard everything other than his own aggrandisement, his profit and his own private wealth.  I am sure that most men engaged in private industry, with all the headaches that go with it at the moment, would accept that thesis.  The day of the vulgar display of large cars, jet setting and so on is gone.  That cannot be tolerated in a society where there are so many people unemployed, where so many trained and educated young people are coming on to the labour market now and will continue to do so in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The duty of addressing themselves seriously to the problem falls on the industrialists as well as on the workers. It is true to say that in all periods of crisis in our history since they first organised themselves the trade unions have served this country well.  If they were given a proper lead and guarantee by the Administration, if the element of suspicion could be removed, I think they would see to it that this highly exposed section of our economy would be put in a strong competitive position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> The workers will accept economic leadership but there is no such leadership from the Government at the moment.  The Government have one foot in each camp.  The workers will accept economic leadership if they are convinced that their real incomes and benefits will be safeguarded.  If they are convinced that the salvation of the industry in which they work is in their own hands, I have no doubt they will behave responsibly and accept the proper kind of leadership, as they have always done.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is no real sense of urgency about the situation. A short time ago we had a performance by the Minister for Finance and it beat hell.  He got up and spoke for 45 minutes and he gave the impression that there was nothing wrong with the country.  It was a Kafkaesque situation.  Any sensible person listening to him would say that it was impossible to take the Minister for Finance seriously.  They would feel they did not share the same planet with him.</P>
    <P>We are awaiting proper leadership from the Government in this area. The Government were supposed to have almost a monopoly of economic expertise but we have not seen any of it.  Perhaps the people with the economic expertise are not free. Perhaps when they say that this is the only policy to follow, that this is the only way we can survive, there is something that keeps them from following that path&mdash;that something being the divided counsel of the Government.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers deserve proper leadership also.  Every increase in employment&mdash;I want to emphasise that&mdash;and every success in the export field should be monitored, appreciated and rewarded.  The manufacturer or industrialist who is giving extra jobs deserves the support and appreciation of the whole country.  It is dreadful to feel totally impotent in a political clinic when streams of young people come in.  If there is some man in the area who by hard work, investing his own money or getting it from the IDA, makes jobs available, then I am <Col N="848" /> inclined to burn incense in front of him at present.  In fact, we should consider tax reliefs related to money that is reinvested for the provision of more jobs in industry.</P>
    <P>What are the initiatives that the Government are taking to convince the employers and the unions, particularly those working in those key sectors to which I have referred, that there is a solution to our economic problems?  Fianna Fáil&mdash; pooh-phoohed of course by the Minister for Finance, but then of course he is Winnie the Pooh&mdash; have suggested means by which our products can be produced and sold at competitive prices without causing further inflation but with benefit for the worker and for the industrialist. They include the relief to workers I mentioned, income tax, and the relief to industrialists by reduced payments into the social welfare fund.</P>
    <P>At this moment, at the eye of the storm, we have a Government who are inept, incapable of any kind of ameliorating action that I can see. They welched on social welfare for some people in the recent past, and they are watching unemployment rise.  The Minister for Finance says everything is all right; we have only 108,000 people unemployed, and of course the school leavers as well. They are watching this scene quite smugly and complacently, and it is absorbing 55 per cent of GNP for Government expenditure.  Fifty-two per cent is what the Minister for Finance said; he may have more up to date figures than I have, but at the time the NESC made their report the figure was 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is the Government who were to solve our economic problems for us.  They are taxing the people both directly and indirectly at a rate which the country has never experienced before.  They are borrowing abroad at an unprecedented rate as well, and on the Minister for Finance's own admission tonight, inflation this year will be as high as 18 per cent. The fact that there is massive unemployment, chiefly in manufacturing industry and among school leavers, means that those sectors of the <Col N="849" /> economy about which I have been speaking from the beginning, in particular, the manufacturing industry section, are being impoverished, and the areas of the Government&mdash;again the Minister for Finance referred to them&mdash;which depend on transfers, are being badly hit.  We have already had an example of social welfare payments being welched upon.  I have myself knowledge of notices of dismissal going out to certain employees in the public sector in the last couple of weeks.  I would like to quote from the NESC report in one particular before I go on to the next section of what I have to say. This report talks about an alternative area of growth:</P>
    <P>For example, it might be argued that growth in Ireland could be initiated and led, not by the goods producing sectors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is, the sectors I have been talking about, manufacturing industry and agriculture&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the sectors whose outputs depend, directly or indirectly, on the growth in the goods sectors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is to say, the commercial sector, the public utility sector that I mentioned already carrying with it employment in shops, wholesale and retail business, banks, insurance, personal services and so on.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;but by the expansion of public services such as education, health and welfare.  But this argument has not been developed and articulated. Nor are there any historical examples of fast growth been started and maintained by policies of this kind.  Indeed, the discussion in Chapter 5 below&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is in the report.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;confirms that in present circumstances economic growth cannot be initiated and sustained by an expansion of public expenditures.</P>
    <P>One may agree with this, or one may not, but nevertheless there are areas where, for a comparatively low public expenditure, improvements&mdash;and small improvements, the added few people employed here or there over the country in all the small towns&mdash;will <Col N="850" /> make a difference, has an impact. These are human beings and if you are providing them with employment you are being successful, in my opinion.  As I said, for comparatively low public expenditure improvements in employment and consequential improvements in the educational and social spheres can be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quickly give a few examples.  Example No. 1, the pupil-teacher ratio in many primary schools, particularly in the larger cities and in other urban areas, is very bad.  There are some very large classes to contend with.  This is the Minister for Education's biggest failure.  He failed to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  There is employment available for the building of classrooms for these pupils.  There is employment available to teachers for teaching in them.  Again there are consequential educational and social benefits to be got, in that children will not need remedial education to the extent that they would do if left in classes of 40 and 45.  There is work in that line, building extra classrooms and so on for tradesmen, technicians, heating engineers, electricians and so on.  An increase of work in that regard would be welcome at present.</P>
      <P>As of now and because of the harm done by large classes, there is also potential for employment of teachers for remedial work.  Again a great expansion is being called for here as well as in the field of career guidance teachers.  In fact, in today's paper there is published a list of all the vocational education committees who require four, five and six career teachers each.  Again, there is employment potential.  I do not think people realise this.  We more or less take for granted that in all cases children can be dealt with in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer quickly to the third level grants system.  These are ridiculously low and are definitely keeping out of the universities people who are listed as unemployed at the moment. If the grants were adequate they <Col N="851" /> would be at third level institutes of education.  It is a fact that a worker with a wage as low as roughly £30 a week with only one child will not get a full grant for that child.  There is also a large field of potential employment in the development of the National Institute for Higher Education, the physical institute in Dublin. A large capital expenditure there would give employment in construction to people.  It would also make available for manufacturing industry, which I have shown is such an important element in the development of our economy, trained technicians and technologists.  There are also ideas in the current journal of the Institute of Management in Ireland put forward by Professor O'Donoghue for increasing employment.</P>
    <P>My time is at an end.  I shall end by saying: it is time for the Government to stop blaming the international recession for unemployment and inflation. It reminds me of the hero of the Boston flood.  There was a flood in Boston and he saved many people from drowning but he became a colossal bore and for the rest of his life he was telling everybody: &ldquo;I am the hero of the Boston flood&rdquo;.  He was quite annoyed if people did not recognise him as such.  He went to Heaven when he died and picked what he thought was a suitable person. He told him that he was the hero of the Boston flood.  The man was singularly unimpressed just as Fianna Fáil are singularly unimpressed by the statement that this recession is too great to cope with.  The man to whom the hero of the Boston flood was talking was Noah who had to cope with a much greater flood than the Boston hero had.</P>

      <P>This debate is a timely one.  We are at an important stage in the process of trying to pull this country out of the economic difficulties which resulted from the oil crisis a few years ago.  I welcome the debate because I think it provides an opportunity first, for reviewing what progress is being made and secondly, for seeking a measure of agreement&mdash;<Col N="852" /> which I think exists&mdash;in this House on a number of things that need to be done to convert the recovery that exists at present into something that will make a real impact on employment and on inflation.  Necessarily, in this kind of debate there is a certain amount of point-scoring.  Naturally, the Opposition's job is to criticise what the Government have done or what they think the Government have not done but nonetheless I think that in this debate a certain common element is emerging.</P>
      <P>The support of the Opposition for a policy of incomes restraint is important and so is recognition of the extreme urgency of the employment situation and the necessity to take measures, even unpopular ones, to deal with that.  There is there a measure of consensus.  There is inevitably divergence because, being in Opposition, the Opposition have the luxury of proposing that we do a whole series of contradictory things at once, including cutting taxation and increasing expenditure and reducing borrowing.  The Government have more difficulty in squaring that circle because they actually have to do it.</P>
      <P>Some of the Opposition proposals are inherently unrealistic as they involve attempting to undertake these three quite different operations at the same time.  Nevertheless, the existence of a consensus on some of the main elements of policy is important and to that extent this debate is timely, coming as it does when the income prospects for next year are under consideration by the social partners and have recently been under consideration by them with the Government in the tripartite talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers in this debate have already pointed out the significant recovery that has taken place in our economy at present.  It is rather curious that this has attracted so little attention.  It is important that it should not be taken out of context or exaggerated or seen as suggesting that our problems are resolved.  They are not; but it is a mistake to put down a motion talking about the deteriorating economic situation when every single economic indicator without <Col N="853" /> exception shows an improvement in the economic situation.  It is unwise to try to increase the amount of gloom one tends to get hanging over one towards the end of an economic depression of the kind we have had.  It is unwise to discourage initiative and enterprise by talking about how bad the situation is when the situation is significantly recovering. We must be more sober, realistic and factual about it.</P>
    <P>The economic situation has improved markedly over the past year. This is only beginning to have an impact on employment and the effect it will have on unemployment, unless there are radical changes in areas such as the growth of income, will be quite inadequate.  We must face that, but the recovery is occurring.  Some of the figures have been given already: the increase in manufacturing output of 13½ per cent in the past year.  Incidentally, one should add to that that there has been an increase in productivity of about the same magnitude at this stage.  We have had an increase in manufactured exports which is running at just under 40 per cent in value and as the Minister for Finance pointed out there is an increase of about 20 per cent in volume terms. That is very substantial and with the usual lag of nine months from the point when the economy begins an upturn, employment is now beginning to recover in manufacturing industry also.</P>
    <P>It is a classic pattern, so far as I recall, in every recession we have had in the past 20 years.  They have all been much milder than this one because on this occasion we have had the world economic crisis precipitating our difficulties.  In all these past recessions the time lag between the recovery in output and recovery in employment has been nine months and so it has been on this occasion. The recovery in output began in the third quarter of last year and the recovery in employment in the second quarter of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it mainly restocking &mdash;that recovery?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, on the contrary, all the indications are that the recovery is export-led.  It is interesting to compare increases sectorally in output with increases in exports relevant to that sector in volume terms.  We can see how much of this growth is coming from exports.  In sectors representing roughly one-half of manufacturing industry we have growth output of between 15 and 30 per cent and in each case growth of exports of the same order and magnitude in volume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any difference over the period of the nine months? Is restocking not fairly obvious at the beginning of the period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was some restocking at the beginning or very near the beginning of this period. The Deputy possibly is right in thinking that at the end of last year some stimulation came from restocking but as we can now look back over six months of industrial output figures and nine months of export figures it is clear that during this year restocking has not been a significant factor.  Much of the growth comes from exports.  If we look at different sectors we see in textiles over the past year a 17 per cent growth in output and a roughly similar increase in exports.  There is a rather small but still significant growth in the furniture industry&mdash;14½-15 per cent increase in output and 30 per cent in exports.  In the important chemical industry there was a 30 per cent increase in output and 23 per cent in exports.  In electrical engineering the figures were 15 per cent increase in output and 33 per cent in exports. In other manufacturing industries there is a 21 per cent increase in output and 15 per cent in exports. There are six sectors in which you have by far the highest increase in exports and in output and it is quite obvious that the linkage is there, that there is an export and output recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is beginning to have an effect on unemployment.  We have had the first upturn in employment in the second quarter and seasonally adjusted unemployment figures have <Col N="855" /> been declining in the past couple of months.  There are indications that this decline may have started earlier but it appears to have been interrupted by some phenomenon in July which I have not been able to track down. Certainly, in the past couple of months there has been a significant decline in unemployment seasonally adjusted.  Again, this is the time lag one expects.  It always takes some time after employment begins to recover before unemployment begins to show a drop.  We are, therefore, at an important stage in our economic recovery and it is reflected in every economic indicator we have: electricity sales, adjusted for temperature, up 12 per cent; car sales up 28 per cent; consumer retail sales generally up by about 5 per cent overall in volume terms.</P>
    <P>This recovery was to be expected at this period and it reflects recovery in external demand in the world generally. Our exports have been helped in this period by the devaluation effect, I suppose, but that effect which has helped to boost our exports also helped to boost our inflation.  We are both gaining and losing through the devaluation of sterling.  One should not look at the good without looking at the bad.  We have had this significant recovery in our economy reflecting external conditions.  It would, however, be absolutely foolish to be complacent about this and to think that this means we are out of our difficulties or that we can sit back and do nothing because first, we cannot necessarily expect that external conditions next year will remain as favourable as they have been this year.</P>
    <P>There are indications of a slowing down in growth in some of the more important countries, particularly the United States, and after the Presidential election there may well be a further setback in that respect.  This, at a time lag of six or nine months could affect us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not deliberate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a repetition in pattern relating to <Col N="856" /> the four-year cycle.  We cannot assume that external conditions will remain favourable.  We must take advantage of the boost we have had to achieve a genuine take-off that will be sustained even if external conditions become less favourable.  We have to face the fact that whatever recovery we have now, even if it is continued along these lines, would not, unless it were accelerated further and maintained for a long period, achieve results in terms of the reduction of unemployment that we need.  In this country, as in every other country, the level of unemployment is extremely high at present because the period since the end of the recession and the beginning of the upturn has not been very long and the unemployment figures still carry over.  During this recession there has been a shaking-out of labour courts in every country and the structure of unemployment will not disappear as output recovers to the level it was at before the recession began.  We cannot expect this to happen here or elsewhere. It will require exceptional economic expansion over an exceptionally long period to get unemployment anywhere near to where it was previously in Ireland or in any other country with an important industrial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem is soluble only in certain conditions.  The first condition is the maintenance of incomes restraint on a more marked scale than we have had in the past year.  We have been helped in the past year by an element of restraint.  Since September of last year the level of wages has risen by approximately 10 per cent which is much less than previously.  By any standards it is still much too much and tighter restraint is needed in the year ahead.  What we have had has helped us to achieve this recovery under very favourable external conditions.  The issue of incomes restraint is fundamental because the choice is between giving ourselves higher living standards and leaving massive unemployment or of being willing to share what we have with the unemployed by incomes restraint. There is no other way in which this unemployment problem can be <Col N="857" /> tackled.  Any other method is inherently short-term and self-defeating over any period of time.  This is the only way forward in this respect.  Anyone who persists in pursuing sectional interests in terms of income is deliberately choosing to keep out of employment tens of thousands of people who could be employed.  That choice has to be faced and no one is entitled to hide that choice from himself or to pretend that he is not making that choice if he presses for significant increases in income.</P>
    <P>There also has to be restraint in the growth of public expenditure and taxation. In this period there has to be a halt in the growth of current public expenditure and a reduction in taxation. Only in those conditions can one expect to see a sustained growth in the private sector based on domestic and external demands.  In the present year the budget prepared a year ago has the unique characteristic that the non-pay elements in it were held down to or just below the previous year's figures in real terms.  This is something which has rarely if ever been achieved in the past 20 years by any other Government. That was an important contribution to the task of returning the economy to normal and overcoming the problem of inflation.  In the period ahead we will need to do more than that.  In this past year we have kept non-paying expenditure at or below the previous level.  Increases in other areas meant that the level of public expenditure generally was higher than in the previous year.  Our target has to be to hold the total public expenditure level with this point.  This will mean difficult decisions and tough measures.  If they are not taken there cannot be the conditions in which the kind of changes in taxation that are needed can be undertaken.  The Opposition are simply not credible when they seek simultaneously, as Deputy Wilson betrayed himself into doing just now, increases in expenditure in various sectors, even one as deserving as education, and tax reductions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Modified expenditure. It has a multiplier effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="858" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt it has a multiplier effect.  If we attempt to increase in real terms the level of current expenditure at this time, the multiplier effect on our economy is very weak because of the linkage to imports which constitutes half of our total consumption.  Such a policy has a minimal effect in generating growth as against a policy of increasing capital investment.  At the same time it would make reductions in taxation quite impossible, reductions which are now extremely urgent if we are to create conditions for the expansion of enterprise.  Above all I am speaking of reductions in income tax which are psychologically important at this time. It is not possible to do this in a situation where the Opposition have criticised the level of borrowing.  It is inevitable that there has been a high level of borrowing but it has to be brought down from the level that was appropriate during the recession.  You cannot justify maintaining borrowing at a high level a year after the recovery has begun nor will you get support from those who lend the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition are rightly concerned with the level of borrowing. The indications from their side are that it should be reduced.  That has not stopped them from proposing a hundred million increases in borrowing. They have called for reductions in taxation.  I think they are right in that.  They cannot simultaneously call for increases in expenditure without being utterly unconvincing and undermining the logic of the case they are trying to put forward.  It is not just a question of holding the level of public expenditure down and preventing it from increasing in real terms. The pattern of expenditure has to be reorientated: we have to turn from current towards capital.  Within the capital programme we have to try to ensure that investment is directed towards the creation of employment as rapidly as possibly.  The existing patterns of public expenditure inherited from the past, a process of annual accretion to the budgets of different Governments, is not a pattern of expenditure that is related to the needs of the country.  We require a significant reorientation of expenditure <Col N="859" /> within the constraint of the present level of current expenditure, in particular, shifting it towards anything that will help employment and cutting back on areas of expenditure which have no impact on employment.</P>
    <P>We are at a stage now where, after a year of economic recovery, there exists a climate for growth which can be made permanent if we pursue the right policies and tackle the problem of inflation courageously.  However, to do that requires support from other sections of the community.  Sometimes one hears people say: &ldquo;Why do the Government not give a lead?  It is up to the Government&rdquo;.  Of course it is up to the Government but the fact that it is up to the Government does not relieve any sectoral group of responsibility from playing their part. No one is entitled to say: &ldquo;We are going to demand all the things we want.  It is up to the Government either to give us these things and still get the economy on course again or, alternatively, to refuse to give us these things&rdquo;.  That kind of attitude is unrealistic. There has to be a measure of co-operation from all sections of the community in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot act simply in a totally arbitrary way without the necessary public support.  That public support must be not merely the support of general public opinion but must involve a willingness to set aside sectional interests, a willingness on the part of each of these sectional interests. It is in those conditions that we can achieve something.  Without those conditions we will not be able to tackle the problem of inflation and unemployment as it exists today. However, the opportunity exists. There are a number of encouraging elements in our situation if we can exploit them to advantage.  We have the industrial export boom which exists already and which is helping us towards domestic recovery.  In the agricultural sector we have a potential for growth which we have to tap, the possibility at present and likely future levels of prices of increasing agricultural output and intensifying the use of Irish land.  In realistic terms that possibility is enormous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> One of the most striking features in the last few years&mdash;since it was clear we were going to join the EEC&mdash;has been the increase in agricultural output, averaging 5 per cent per annum over the last five years or so in contrast to the increase of two-thirds per cent per annum which characterised all the earlier decades of this country's independent State right back to the twenties.  We see already how agriculture is able to take advantage of the new situation in the EEC to achieve dramatic increases in output. In the current year this has not been happening because of the after-effects of the cattle cycle, the cattle surplus situation of 1974 and the impact of that on the cattle herd.  This has had an exceptional effect on agricultural output, which is not buoyant in the current year.  The remarkable thing is that we are achieving such a level of economic growth&mdash;it seems clear now it will be well in excess of 3 per cent&mdash;in the absence of any contributions from agriculture for exceptional reasons in the present year. But the potential for growth in agriculture is there.  The conditions, in terms of security of access to markets and price levels available now and in the immediate future of the farming community, provide the climate for a further rapid increase in agricultural output in the period immediately ahead even if in this year, for these exceptional reasons to do with the cattle cycle, we have not been able to achieve it.  Of course, when agriculture is pulling its weight again, in terms of increases in output&mdash;as one hopes it will from next year onwards &mdash;then it will be much easier to achieve high growth rates in the economy as a whole and get towards the 6 per cent growth level which the Government have suggested as a target in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>In this connection we have the complex issue of the green £ to consider. The Government accept that the green £ rate, for the purposes of the common agricultural policy, must be adjusted appropriately from time to time so that the monetary compensatory amounts on Irish agricultural exports do not become excessive and do not remain for too prolonged <Col N="861" /> a period.  These are tax on our exports, which inhibit their growth and affect the income our farmers can get from them.  The Government are also concerned that the extra benefit for the economy and the balance of payments, which results from changes in the Irish green £ rate, are distributed fairly throughout the whole community.  The objective of achieving a more equitable distribution of these gains, as the House knows, is being discussed with representatives of the farming community in the context of an economic and social strategy for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There are other sectors too, with prospects for growth.  The one which now has prospects for dramatic growth is, of course, the fishing industry where the agreement of our Community partners last Saturday to our development plan provides prospects for growth of a kind which up to now our fishermen had not conceived possible. The fact that the Community has been willing to commit itself so to apply the common fisheries policy as to secure a doubling of the catch over the next few years is a major breakthrough indeed.  The means by which this aim will be secured have yet to be worked out.  As the House knows, in our view, a 50-mile coastal band is necessary for this purpose.  That battle has yet to be fought to a conclusion and will be so in the months ahead. But the commitment is there.  In discussing with the Commission and other member countries how that commitment is to be implemented our demand for a coastal band is on a firm basis because we can objectively point to the scale of fish catch that they have agreed is appropriate for us and the securing of which requires a coastal band.  But the immediate prospect is certainly an encouraging one. The problem we must face now is how do we in fact ensure that the opportunity thus provided is made use of.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear on radio the other day&mdash;in a discussion I had with Deputy Gallagher&mdash;Deputy Gallagher expressing scepticism about our ability to catch the fish which the EEC are willing to agree should be caught by us; they are willing to create the conditions for this to happen and <Col N="862" /> yet doubts are being expressed here as to whether it can be achieved.  We should turn our attention immediately to this question and ensure that all steps are taken, whatever increases in the through-put of trainees and number of boats are necessary to ensure that we attain that target, incidentally a target for 1979 beyond which there must be further expansion of the fishing industry with appropriate operation of the common fisheries policy towards that end.  Therefore, fishing is to be a dynamic sector in the period immediately ahead under the new conditions created by this Community agreement.</P>
    <P>The mining sector is already a dynamic one.  We have also the gas production sector which will be coming into play in 1978.  We have had the deferred hope, over the past two years&mdash;something I hope will be achieved&mdash;of the discovery of oil. Indeed the activities involved in seeking this oil is itself a major factor in helping to maintain economic expansion in the period ahead.  The total expenditure on oil exploration is in itself an important factor.</P>
    <P>The goal in all of this has to be the achievement of reduction of inflation and of unemployment, not just a reduction but a massive reduction in unemployment.  These two go hand in hand and the same policies can be directed towards both ends.  One cannot achieve a reduction in the rate of inflation from its present level without incomes restraint.  One cannot achieve an expansion of employment without incomes restraint.  This is an essential ingredient of any policy directed towards those two ends, which are the primary concern of Irish people at present so far as economic policy is concerned.  Of course, the sources of inflation are complex.  It is not only a question of incomes.  Incomes are a major element.  The other elements to which we have regard at present include the agricultural price element, the import price element and the question of taxation which itself can affect prices.  So far as agricultural prices are concerned it would be very foolish of this country&mdash;given the enormous proportion of its farm output which is exported&mdash;to reject the <Col N="863" /> possibility of better prices for farm produce on export markets.  We must be prepared to accept the consequences of that on consumer prices at home.  If consumers are to accept that, of course there must be the corollary, a situation in which the benefits of these increased agricultural prices are passed on to the rest of the community, and a system through which the farming community contribute in this way towards the prosperity of the rest of the community.  This is something which has to be tackled and is under discussion.  We have to find an appropriate solution to that but it would be cutting off our nose to spite our face if we turn down the possibility of improved prices, whether through green £ adjustments or otherwise, because the effect on our balance of payments and on increased prosperity at home, far exceeds the adverse elements deriving from that, a defect on consumer prices.</P>
    <P>If we are to go wholeheartedly towards the goal of achieving the best prices we can for Irish farm produce abroad we must both ensure that the benefits are spread throughout the community and that other causes of inflation are brought under control. The fact that the correct policy for us is to push for the best possible results for agriculture in terms of prices is going to contribute to inflation at all means that all other possible sources of inflation must be brought under control to compensate for that.  What we have been doing is to add to that element of price inflation all other possible elements of price inflation. This is something which obviously has to be effectively tackled in future.</P>
    <P>The rise in import prices has been a major element in our inflation throughout this period.  During last year it was less important than previously but it is disturbing to see how rapidly import prices have been rising during the current year and from the indicators it is clear that the increase in import prices over the previous year is rising all the time.  The latest figure we have for the month of August shows an import unit value index number which is about 17 per cent <Col N="864" /> higher than a year earlier.  This reflects the effect of the devaluation of sterling, a devaluation which is helping to boost our exports but which is also helping to boost our inflation. Unless this can also be brought under control by our neighbours it will be very hard to get inflation down to single figures rapidly here.  That must be our aim.  Given the devaluation problem, given the desirability of securing what increases we can in farm prices through the EEC, it follows that all other sources of inflation must be held down.  These include taxation on expenditure and excessive growth in incomes.  We must so manage our affairs that large increases in indirect taxation, necessary in order to finance the maintenance of the level of economic activity in a period of economic difficulty, cannot be continued in the period ahead.  We must try to ensure that we do not have to have large increases in indirect taxation to push up prices.  If we do not manage to achieve a reasonable stability as far as indirect taxes are concerned the target of reducing inflation would be very hard to achieve.</P>
    <P>Similarly, with incomes the need for incomes restraint is the key to everything else.  Without that there can be no possibility of putting people to work again and no possibility of getting price increases down to the kind of level which is tolerable in any community such as ours.  What we come back to always is the question of employment. In the Green Paper the Government set out targets for development in the years ahead on two hypotheses.  One was the hypothesis that we continue as we have been going in terms of growth of incomes and the other, a more favourable kind although some think an optimistic kind, showing what can be achieved if we can so manage our affairs in terms of incomes and taxation policy, as to secure a 6 per cent growth rate in the economy as a whole.  One of the most striking features of the Green Paper is the fact that even with a 6 per cent growth rate over four years, something which is not easy to sustain and is more than we have ever achieved before over such a period, at the end of it we are left still with a disturbingly <Col N="865" /> high level of unemployment, a figure of 80,000.  It is that figure towards which our attention should be directed.</P>
    <P>The figures in the Green Paper have been prepared with care and represent the best assessment of the likely outcome of favourable policies leading to a 6 per cent growth rate.  It is a measure of the ground lost by this economy and all other industrial economies in recent years during this recession that even such a prolonged period of sustained growth could leave us with a level of unemployment higher than anything we have been used to in recent decades.  It reflects, of course, the fact that the old solution to our problems, emigration, has come to an end and that for some years past there has been net immigration instead of net emigration.  We have net immigration as workers come back here bringing the skills they acquired abroad and bringing also children born in another country. They are adding to the numbers of children seeking education here.  One of the most remarkable features is that we have had an increase in the school population quite beyond anything we expected to have on the basis of the number of children born here.  That was because of the number of Irish workers returning and bringing their children with them.  As these children grow up they will seek employment and we have now a long term employment problem, for the next 25 years.  It will be on a scale which will require a rethinking of our traditional attitudes over the whole range of economic policies.</P>
    <P>It was always on the cards that this would be the case if we were going to eliminate emigration, as we always hoped we would do.  It was bound to be the case that the effect of eliminating emigration by the eighties would be that a new generation would grow up here&mdash;a generation who on past form would grow up in another country&mdash;who would be seeking employment as we went into the nineties. What has happened is that the elimination of emigration has occurred much sooner than any of us dared to hope.  It has come in the early seventies, not in the mid-eighties and we, <Col N="866" /> therefore, have the problem arising from this of a very rapid increase in the labour force and the fact that the children of this increased labour force will be looking for employment sooner than we thought likely when we thought of emigration as something that would go on until the eighties.</P>
    <P>The figure of 80,000 unemployed in 1980, on the most favourable hypothesis, is one to which everybody should direct his attention.  The Government in publishing it were conscious of the fact that it is a disturbing figure but it is the result of economic calculations made impartially by experts.  It is a figure which should not be hidden from the public gaze; we should concentrate our attention on it. The fact that it is so high is an indication of the scale of the problem we face, the urgency of facing it and the fact that we cannot allow anything, any type of selfishness by any group in the community, to stand in the way of achieving the most rapid rate of economic growth in order to get unemployment down as soon as we can and as far as we can.  In the Green Paper we put forward for consideration a number of suggestions of changes in policy which we thought would be useful to discuss with the social partners.  The reluctance of the social partners to get down to talking about these things is disturbing because if we are going to modify a number of traditional policies and take a number of new initiatives the effectiveness of these changes in policy and new initiatives will be inevitably greatly influenced by the amount of public support they have. We need a willingness to discuss these proposals and as far as possible a consensus for implementation.  If that cannot be secured most of them will have to be gone ahead with anyway but they will not be as effective as if we secured a consensus on them.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the main features of the proposals we put forward, the need, first, for a clearly defined plan for economic growth, the setting out of agreed priorities and offering a sound basis for investment in the private sector.  It is interesting <Col N="867" /> to see how strongly committed the private sector is now to such a plan. In the past the private sector has taken a sceptical and even a hostile view of the concept of planning.</P>
    <P>In the climate of uncertainty that has been created by the world recession the private sector now sees the importance and value of having a clear-cut economic plan for the future, and the demand for such a plan comes as much from the employers' side as from the workers' side.  What has not come to the same degree from either side is a willingness to sit down and work with us on the preparation of such a plan and we need that co-operation if it is to be effective.</P>
    <P>The second point we made was the question of incomes restraint&mdash;I will not go over that again&mdash;and the third is a favourable tax environment.  The tax burden on established domestic industry, though not high by international standards, is higher than we would like to see it in a country at this stage of development, and the disparity between the tax environment of new industries coming here and the tax situation of the existing established industry is disturbing.  One of the things that is worrying about our situation has been the sluggishness of growth in the established sector of Irish industry in recent years, even before this world recession occurred.</P>
    <P>Figures of 2½-3 per cent have been suggested as the kind of underlying growth rate of this sector in recent years.  That simply is not sufficient if we are to retain a strong competitive and expansionist domestic industrial sector.  One of the problems here from the beginning has been that the old-established sector of Irish industry has always tended to be exclusively orientated towards, first, the domestic market and then, as their horizons widened in the fifties and sixties, towards English-speaking markets&mdash; Britain, America, Australia and Canada.</P>
    <P>They have shown a marked reluctance to turn their attention to the extremely prosperous markets that exist within the EEC where, as the <Col N="868" /> years have elapsed since we joined, the tariffs on our goods have been rapidly removed and favourable conditions created for exporting.  The removal of tariffs over the last three or four years, combined with the effective devaluation in making our goods competitive in these countries, means that Irish goods can now be sold in EEC countries on very favourable terms indeed. Anybody who had occasion to look in a shop window on the Continent during the last few months as the pound drifted downwards, and in some cases rocketed downwards, and who converted their prices into our currency can see the disparities now arising and how much cheaper our goods are in many cases than goods manufactured in those countries.</P>
    <P>That is no help if established Irish industry do not turn their attention to these markets.  This has been a defect from the beginning.  In 1955, when I was working with the then Federation of Irish Industries on the impact of free trade, we sent a questionnaire to the whole range of Irish industry.  The benefits they saw coming through increased access to EEC markets were tiny.  I think they saw only an extra 6 per cent of sales coming from the elimination of tariffs on these markets.  They did not regard them seriously as markets and were not prepared to turn their attention to them.  What was true 11 years ago, though less true today, remains the case to a disturbing degree.  Now the opportunity exists for a massive increase in exports not just for new firms who establish themselves here in order to sell to the EEC countries, but also for domestic firms.  If they can redirect their attention towards that market instead of struggling to make inroads into a rapidly eroding British market, they would have a much better chance of growth in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that so much of our industrial growth has to come from new firms.  We need new firms and we welcome them.  We create the climate so that they want to come here and they are giving us the possibility of increasing employment. Nonetheless we want our domestic industries <Col N="869" /> to be prosperous too.  That requires a favourable tax environment. It also requires enterprise on the part of the people concerned and, above all, enterprise in marketing their goods not in an eroding market such as Britain but in the rapidly expanding markets of the EEC countries where our goods are now becoming so competitive in terms of price.</P>
    <P>The question of the favourable tax environment affects not merely company taxation but also personal taxation. The marginal tax rates we pay are too high by any standards.  Even if there were no question of reducing the level of taxation, even if that was not an issue at all, we ought to be able to do something about the disparity between the marginal and average tax rates.  Only 15 per cent of all income in this country is paid in tax on income.  That is not the impression people have.  Most people feel that the amount taken in income tax is much greater.  The reason they feel this, psychologically I think, is because of the very high marginal rates.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that a workman who may be paying only 10 or 15 per cent of his income in tax should be paying 38½ per cent on every extra pound he earns.  It should not be necessary to have such a disparity. Similarly a manager who may be paying about 40 per cent of his income in tax, should not be paying 77 per cent on his extra income, which is a discouragement to enterprise.  We have to tackle the problem not merely of an excessive level of personal taxation&mdash;that too must be tackled and at some cost in budgetary terms &mdash;but we must also tackle the disparity between marginal and average rates.  The high marginal rates are a disincentive not merely to executives but to workers.  It should be possible to narrow that gap without major cost in terms of tax reductions, although tax reductions are also needed.</P>
    <P>Connected with this as part of our taxation system is the social insurance system we inherited from Britain, which we never sought to change, which is based on a flat rate contribution <Col N="870" /> system.  In recent years with the pay-related benefit there is a pay-related element, but the basic contribution is still flat rate.  The burden this represents on workers on low wages and on industries in which the level of wages and salaries is below the average is excessive by any standards.  It is not acceptable that we should have a situation where labour intensive industries, in which perhaps wages may not be as high as the technologically advanced ones, should have an excessive burden of social insurance relative to other industries where the pay is higher and the social insurance flat rate contributions bear much less heavily.  The entire question of the impact of taxation, including social insurance contributions, on industry and enterprise has to be looked at as a whole and not taken simply piecemeal.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of things we need to discuss with the social partners, just as we need to discuss with them a proposal for a private investment trust or development bank, through which new enterprise would be promoted with substantial Irish private participation.  In future we would have new enterprises established jointly by Irish private enterprise and foreign enterprise and not foreign enterprise exclusively.  We need also to talk to the social partners about the idea of an industrial development corporation, the idea of a national development fund as outlined in the Green Paper, the ideas we put forward to promote productivity by associating employees more closely with the enterprise and its financial results.  These are all things that cannot be done simply by the Government plucking ideas out of the air and seeking to implement them without consultation, without getting back the views of those who will be affected.  For that purpose we need the co-operation of those concerned in discussing with us these proposals designed, like so many proposals in the Green Paper, to secure rapid economic growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 3.30 this afternoon I heard several speakers.  I do not know what an economist would think of the speeches from the Government <Col N="871" /> benches.  Would he reject them as not being sound economics? I am sure there is one person who will make a collection of these speeches and that is anybody interested in Irish folklore and fairy tales.  Government speakers have refused to face up to the realities of the economic situation. This is one of the causes for our present economic troubles.  It is an insult to suggest that everything in the national garden is lovely.  The fact that there may be over 100,000 unemployed, that there is a shrinking industry, and a housing crisis, means nothing to the Government.  Their basic weakness is probably that they speak in divers tongues on the economy and on the national scene in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned the desirability of consultation in relation to the issues that arise. If the Government had had the wisdom and the courage to speak to the people in real terms, to tell them that things were bad and that unless we all took steps to remedy the situation we would be in real trouble, the situation might not be so bad.  Occasionally there are Ministers who speak in such terms.  I am thinking, for instance, of the Minister for Finance but we find other Ministers speaking at social functions and telling us that the country is in great shape, that the future looks wonderful.  These Ministers forget about the masses that are unemployed.  One day we are being told to tighten our belts and the next we are told we will achieve such and such growth rate next year so that everything will be fine.  If we had had some straight talking from the Government the people would have responded.  The workers, for instance, would have responded to the Government's requests if the Government had been prepared to meet them and discuss their problems with them.  Instead, the Government harp on the question of achievement when we all know that they have achieved nothing.  The workers in the factories and in the fields have lost faith in this Government and that is why there is a negative reaction from them when they are <Col N="872" /> asked to accept the word of the Government on anything.</P>
    <P>In saying this I am not accusing Ministers of telling lies but I accuse them of not facing up to the facts.  In that sense they must accept the major portion of the blame for our present situation.</P>
    <P>One of our greatest evils is inflation. The Government's efforts in this regard have failed miserably.  I admit that a good deal of the inflation problem is attributable to outside influences but may we not lay some of the blame on the Government's continued and colossal borrowings?</P>
    <P>The situation in the construction industry is always a yardstick of the state of the economy.  If that industry is working to its full capacity, not alone are many more people in employment directly in the industry but there is also the factor of the employment provided by its ancillary industries. On coming to office the Government found the construction industry in a healthy state.  At that time people found it much easier to get loans and so on but that situation has changed very much and one of the major causes of the difficulties facing those who wish to buy houses is the blindness of the Government in this sphere and their failure to tackle the housing problem.  The result of all this is that many couples who otherwise would have been in a position to purchase houses are not now able to do so. However, I pay tribute to those young people who, despite all the difficulties involved, have the courage to involve themselves in the effort and sacrifice involved in providing homes for themselves.</P>
    <P>The situation has become almost impossible.  Some figures I have here will indicate some of the reasons for this.  For example, under the SDA scheme a local authority is empowered to grant a loan for house purchase to anyone who qualifies for such within the terms of the scheme.  On coming to office this scheme was amended by the Coalition so that the limit of a loan was increased to £4,500 while the income limit was increased to £2,350. However, the average price of the type of house being purchased then with <Col N="873" /> the aid of this scheme was £5,900 whereas today the same type of house is costing almost £8,000.  How can a couple be expected to provide a home for themselves under this scheme with the loan limit being £4,500 and their income being only £46 per week? From where are they expected to find a deposit of £3,500 or how are they to meet their repayments from such a low income?  If the Government had any sense they would amend this scheme immediately so as to bring the loan limit up to, perhaps, £6,000 and to increase also the income limit. In that way the construction industry would be given a much-needed boost. Not only would young married couples avail of these loans but older people would be prepared to seek loans in order to buy new houses.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago the Minister for Local Government told us that there was so much money in the SDA fund that he intended to use it for providing sanitary services.  No doubt the reason for there being so much money in the fund was that the people could not afford to borrow from it.  The scheme has become totally irrelevant as I shall prove by some further figures.  Let us take the situation in Dublin Corporation.  I admit that the corporation have not a great deal of land within the city: most of the building land is outside the city boundaries.  However, for the first nine months of last year loans were given to 182 people for new houses while for the first nine months of this year a mere 42 people got loans for this purpose.  The corporation lend money also for older houses and in this context loans were granted last year to 590 people while only 200 such loans were given for the first nine months of this year.  In regard to Dublin County Council the situation was that in the first six months of last year, 446 loans were issued while for the comparable period this year the figure was 290.  In the first six months of last year Cork County Council gave 739 loans while this year the figure is 401.  These are the official figures issued by the Government.  I may be told that people can have recourse to the building societies but these institutions <Col N="874" /> have just increased their lending rate to almost 14 per cent which is quite a hefty increase for a borrower to meet.</P>
    <P>The property supplement issued by the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 22nd October referred to crippling mortgage rates and said</P>
    <P>Already one of the societies has been forced by these factors to reject any new loan applicants for the time being</P>
    <P>I do not know how long &ldquo;the time being&rdquo; is, but the prospect for a potential house purchaser is not a happy one.</P>
    <P>I have given the two alternatives. There is a third option.  The person anxious to be housed can decide to go on the local authority housing list.  I do not know about other local authority housing lists but in Dublin there are 8,000 applicants on the waiting list.  The list is comprised of some fairly big families, some small families and some individuals.  Successive Governments in the past have provided money for housing and sometimes they have increased the amount during the year.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday there was an announcement in the newspapers about housing finance.  I have been a member of a local authority for many years but I have not yet seen the particular document.  I tried to get a copy but so far I have not succeeded.  A colleague in the Dublin City Council, who is not a member of my party, says the document will mean an increase in the rates of 52p.  Already we are adding 40p to the rates, so ratepayers will be faced with the problem of meeting an increase of 92p in the £ in rates.  I do not altogether accept my colleagues figure, but it may be correct, for all I know.</P>
    <P>Now the Government have not taken the people into their confidence. Presumably all this is Government policy.  We cannot blame the Minister alone because there is collective responsibility.  This week we will have an opportunity of discussing this policy again because the next meeting of the council will adopt an estimate <Col N="875" /> for many millions of pounds.  None of us has been furnished with a copy of this most important document which will add 52p in the £ to the rates.</P>
    <P>This is crazy Government and we will end up with a crazy situation. When we were in Government a great cry went up from the Opposition on one occasion for a declaration of a housing emergency.  I did not know what it meant then but I do know now that the Government by their mishandling of the situation have actually created an emergency in the building construction industry.  That emergency can only be met by an injection of capital into the industry to put 23,000 workers back into employment building houses in order to provide people with decent housing conditions.  Not alone would the building construction industry recover but builders' providers would also become viable again.  The furniture industry would be called upon to provide furniture for these new homes.  All those industries which provide household utensils would have to meet a new demand for goods of all kinds with new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The building industry must be rescued.  In 1974 the output in the construction industry was £196 million. Now the experts tell us there is a drop of 4 per cent.  Work out what that means.  In the private sector there were 1,275 fewer houses built in the first half of this year compared with last year.  Once momentum is lost in the housing drive it is very difficult indeed to get it back.</P>
    <P>Building workers drawing unemployment would prefer to be paid for building houses.  They would infinitely prefer to be working rather than kicking their heels at street corners.  There is no emigration now, and that is a very good thing, but its absence poses greater problems for us.  The Government have a magnificent opportunity of rising to the challenge by making the construction industry viable once more by properly financing it and thereby ensuring people will no longer find themselves on a waiting list and young couples will not be deprived of housing loans at reasonable mortgage <Col N="876" /> rates.  They should immediately in-increase the £4,500 limit under SDA to at least £6,000.  They could increase the income limit to about £46 a week. They could put in an inflation clause so that if there is increased inflation the loans will increase accordingly.  I believe they could take the building societies and other financial institutions into their confidence and tell them: &ldquo;We have to keep the financial investment in the housing drive at a high level in both the public and private sectors&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Few people quibble at paying increased taxation if it means more housing.  The Government do not do any of the things I have mentioned. They tell us about all the money available for people who want to build or buy their own houses, but the money is not there.  Any public representative, whether on the Government side or this side of the House, must know the misery that thousands of young people are living in.  Many of them are living in very bad housing conditions.  Some are being overcharged for flats because they cannot afford the deposit needed for new houses or because they are not high enough on the local authority waiting list.  They have to see their children being deprived because they are living in substandard dwellings.  If one of their children has to go to hospital some of the expenses has to be paid for.</P>
    <P>A wise Government would see that it is very important to invest in housing. One of the most important reasons for doing this is that good housing means good health and bad housing must have a great influence on bad health.  I am not suggesting that everybody living in good housing conditions is in good health.  I have suggested to the Government what they could do to ease the housing problem for many people.  I warn them that unless they take steps very soon to ameliorate the position of many young people on the housing list, unscrupulous forces in the city will use that position to advance their political thinking.  This has happened before to a lesser extent but it could happen to a greater extent in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> Every week people in Dublin come to their public representatives looking for houses.  They cannot get loans and they cannot afford to go on paying the high rents for flats which their landlords are asking them to pay.  This very often results in the wife going back to her people and the husband going back to his people.  We often talk about the strain on marriage.  I believe this is the greatest strain anybody can have. Pious sentiments are uttered about our young people.  We may even at times deplore the way they are acting.  I salute the young people who, having got married, try to battle it out in very bad conditions because the Government have shown their ineptitude in the housing drive and the whole housing construction programme and offer no hope to those young people.  It would be very easy to ease the burden for those people by injecting sufficient capital into the housing industry to ensure that we can go on building the maximum number of dwellings and that we can go on making grants for the repair of existing dwellings so that we can conserve existing houses.</P>
    <P>Every day the housing situation is becoming worse so that the Government will find it more difficult to arrest the decline.  When the next Government succeed them they will have a very difficult task.  The housing situation is a challenge which must arouse the imagination of any public representative on how it can be tackled.  The Government have to show much more imaginative thinking than they have in the past.  In the early days of the Coalition Government we were told that they were <Col N="878" /> building more houses than the previous Government.  They were able to do this because the Fianna Fáil Government initiated most of the schemes which were finished in the last three years.</P>
    <P>This has now come to an end so that even in Dublin we cannot afford any money to add to the land bank in the county area which will be needed in future years.  I believe&mdash; many people on the far side of the House share this sentiment with me&mdash; that inner Dublin should be preserved and the houses there should be preserved by the payment of improvement grants as well as the contributions from the tenants.  I am convinced the Government's new thinking on housing will mean a lower standard of house maintenance than we have had in the past.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation many years ago converted some of the Georgian houses into flats for the people.  Some of those houses, which were built around the time of the Act of Union, now need more maintenance than ever but because of the cutback in housing subsidies we will not be able to give them this high degree of maintenance. Not alone will we not be building so many houses but the existing houses will deteriorate further. Once those houses start to deteriorate, the rate of decay will accelerate unless it is attended to.  All the figures I have quoted tonight are official figures.</P>

The claimant appealed against the disallowance of benefit and in connection with his appeal he was again examined on 3rd August, 1976, by a different medical referee who also found him to be capable of work.  The appeal is proceeding and an oral hearing has been arranged for 12th November, 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to be eligible for <Col N="782" /> free transport under the terms of the free transport scheme, a child of less than ten years of age, must reside at least two miles from the nearest school and a child of ten years of age and older must reside at least three miles from the nearest school. According to the information available to the Department, there is only one child from the families mentioned who is eligible for free transport and he is already being carried on the transport service to Tullamore.</P>
      <P>Children who are ineligible for free transport may be carried as farepaying passengers provided there is spare accommodation on the vehicle after those who are eligible for free transport have been catered for and provided that no extra cost is incurred in doing so.</P>
      <P>The bus on which the Cappincur children might be carried as fare-paying passengers has already a capacity load.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice when the Land Registry registered the titles of 23 vested cottiers (details supplied) under the Portlaoise Town Commission; the names of the house owners; if Portlaoise Town Commission has yet been notified of the establishment of the titles; and when the 23 people can regard the houses as being their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Transfer orders in respect of 23 houses were submitted to the Land Registry on 5th February, 1976.  One transfer order was withdrawn by the Portlaoise Town Commissioners on 26th April, 1976, and this has not since been resubmitted to the Land Registry.  Registration in the remaining 22 cases was completed on 13th May, 1976, and Portlaoise Town Commissioners were notified to this effect on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the practice, and I consider that it would be inappropriate for me, to publicise the names of persons who have been concerned in transactions in the Land Registry.  The Land Registration Rules, 1972, contain provisions <Col N="783" /> whereby, subject to certain conditions, documents, folios, and so on, may be inspected in the registry.  In regard to the final part of the question, I can only suggest that the Deputy communicate with Portlaoise Town Commissioners in the matter.</P>
