      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to refer to today's Order Paper and, specifically, to the meeting of the Special Committee on the Wildlife Bill called for this afternoon at 4 o'clock. The practice in connection with these committees is that arrangements for future meetings take place at the commencement or termination of business. In so far as at 6 o'clock last Tuesday the Chairman indicated that business had already been completed and that the business of the next meeting had not been taken, you will accept the suggestion that a meeting has been arranged does not hold?</P>
      <P>I would direct your attention to the fact that Members received this morning a motion in my name which indicates the attitude of our party to the Committee in question.</P>

      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>

      <P>When I concluded yesterday I was inquiring as to the effect of amendment No. 11, in the name of the Minister deleting the words &ldquo;with effect as on and from the 6th day of April, 1975,&rdquo;.  The consequence of that is that subsection (2) would then read</P>
      <P>the said section 21 of the Finance Act, 1974, is hereby amended by the substitution...</P>
      <P>The Minister explained that there is a loophole which has been uncovered and to which attention was drawn by the publication of this amendment.  The consequence of drawing attention to it was that persons had claimed, in effect, artificial losses for earlier years.  The Minister says that the effect of deleting the words &ldquo;with effect as on and from the 6th day of April, 1975,&rdquo; is to preclude such persons from making these artificial claims of losses in respect of previous years.  May I take it that genuine claims will not be excluded by this amendment?  If the Minister is satisfied that that is so, on what basis can he be so satisfied?  If he can be so satisfied, how does he achieve this and how does he exclude the non-genuine cases of this kind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to apply or decline to apply that adjective to them.  A claim can be a genuine claim once it is made.  Claims have been made by the extension of the <Col N="1221" /> existing provisions, claiming that just as an artificial notional profit emerges from the application of the notional formula, that notional loss can also arise, and the claim is that that should be available for application against future notional or real profits.  A claim has to be made where there have been very substantial real profits but the notional formula generates a loss.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 27 to 29, to delete subsection (4A) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4A) Subsection 4 shall apply&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  as respects the year 1976-77, and</P>
      <P>(b)  as respects any year of assessment for which an individual elects as provided for in subsection (1) and makes, on or after the 30th day of March, 1976, a claim for relief under section 307, 308, 309 or 318 of the Income Tax Act, 1967&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have already said.  This stops a person from making an effective claim after 30th March, 1976.  Any claim made on this basis after that date is by this section rendered null and void.  In other words, the notional loss will not be available for setting off against future profits.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section <Col N="1222" /> 18, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that this section proposes to continue the notional system for a further year.  The Minister will be aware that there was a report from the NESC recommending that the notional system be extended for four years, that there was a minority view on that, representative of farming organisations in general, urging a different approach and urging the maintenance of the notional system virtually indefinitely but on a basis whereby the multiplier on the PLV would be increasing each year in relation to the average earnings of farmers.  I do not want to go into the details but my purpose in raising this is to inquire whether the Minister has yet adopted any attitude in relation to these matters.  If he has not, may we take it that the provision of this section represents a kind of holding operation?  When may we expect a decision by the Minister and his colleagues on this recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed by the farming community that the notional system should be adopted indefinitely. The question of the multiplier is a matter that must be considered.  I should like to know from the Minister when he intends making a decision on this matter because farmers are very worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was received on the last day of February. Since then we have been considering it and shortly I shall be having meetings with the farming organisations to discuss the matter with them. Following that, I will give the matter further consideration and I will report to the Cabinet.  At this stage I am not in a position to say when a decision will be taken on the report.  As Deputy Colley pointed out, conflicting views were presented in the report and we shall have to try to balance them.  In the meantime we are providing a continuation of the existing system.  Deputy Colley correctly described it as a holding operation.  Obviously there are many issues involved that need mature consideration <Col N="1223" /> and Deputies may be assured that in the process of considering them we will be consulting with the farming organisations.  In fact, I have an appointment to meet them next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the report to which the Minister has referred there are certain paragraphs that have an anti-farm bias and the farming community are worried about the matter. They consider the fairest way is to continue the notional system and I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I will give the matter serious consideration. There are no grounds for saying that there is an anti-farm bias involved when 95 per cent or 96 per cent of farmers are not subject to tax at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers have no objection to paying their fair share of tax but the problem is to have a fair system.  It is very easy to assess a cash income but difficulty arises when an estimated income is involved.  The farming community think that the notional system is the best system at the moment although we accept that it is not perfect.  When a person has an income of £2,000 there is no difficulty because it is a cash income but problems arise with regard to a proper system of estimating income. I want to make it quite clear that what we are concerned about is the system, not about paying tax.  There are many fluctuations in farming and it is difficult to estimate income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an anti-avoidance measure aimed at schemes devised by certain people with farmland of rateable valuation exceeding £100 so as to bring their farming profits outside the scope of the charge to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> One of the schemes that has been thought up involves the transfer of ownership of the farm to a company set up by the farmer.  The company then let parcels of land either rent free or at a nominal rent to the original owner and to one or more members of the family.  In this way a farm with a valuation of £150 could be let in two parcels so that each occupier is deemed to occupy land of less than £100 valuation and is not chargeable to tax on farming profits. If the land is let rent free there is no tax charged to the company.  If let at a nominal rent the charge is insignificant.</P>
    <P>Another type of scheme is one in which the ownership of the land is retained but the owner claims the existence of a partnership with other members of the family.  As a result of the scheme all or most of the farming profits can be said to flow to other members of the family each of whom is deemed to occupy only part of the farm and is thereby outside the scope of the tax charge.  The present section counters these avoidance devices by providing that the £100 threshold will not apply in such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister be a little more specific as to how the section counters these devices?  In particular, will he indicate if he is satisfied that in countering these devices innocent cases will not be caught?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any prospect of an innocent case being caught.  For instance, if farmland is owned in partnership the section will have no effect.  In other words, if a son is genuinely brought into partnership, including ownership partnership, no problem is created.  If a farmer with a rateable valuation in excess of £100 disposes of part of the land and confers ownership on someone else that is an effective severance.  It means he will be outside the scope if he disposes of property so as to leave him under the £100 rateable valuation.  If he operates the device of setting up a company that effectively is himself and if the company lets the land back <Col N="1225" /> to him free of rent or at a nominal rent that is an obvious device and we would not regard such as being a genuine disposal of land.  If there is a disposal to somebody who is not connected and there is not this movement backwards again towards the real owner that is an effective severance and avoids liability to tax.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In the case of a man owning land with a rateable valuation of £400 who decides to divide that up among three or four children in lots of £60 to £70 valuation will that type of a transaction be caught?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that. When I was a young lad I was involved in the division of an estate which had a rateable valuation of £100 and I genuinely got a portion of that estate with a rateable valuation of £50.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the effect of the proviso to subsection (1)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That proviso deals with cases where the rateable valuation is already under £100.  That section will not apply in such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a little confusing. Subsection (1) of this section states that section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, shall not have effect for a year of assessment in the case of an individual or his wife and so on.  That section also states:</P>
      <P>Provided that this section shall not apply in any case where the farm land is owned by an individual or his wife, if the individual or his wife is an individual to whom section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, applies for the said year of assessment.</P>
      <P>Is there not a contradiction there?  We are told at the beginning of the section that section 15 (3) of the 1974 Act will not apply in these cases but the proviso seems to say that the section shall not apply where section 15 (3) applies. In effect, is it not repeating what is said at the beginning of the subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If we had not this proviso we would be capturing for tax purposes people whose holdings are under £100 valuation and applying this section to them.  They are not within the tax net and it would be wrong to apply this section to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How would the Minister catch them assuming he did not have the proviso?  The section states that section 15 (3) shall not have effect for a year of assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 (3) of the 1974 Act states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) shall not apply, as respects any year of assessment, in <Col N="1227" /> the case of an individual who shows that the rateable valuation of all farm land occupied by him did not, at any time during that year of assessment, amount to £100 or more.</P>
    <P>That is saying that subsection (1) of section 15 will not apply where the rateable valuation does not amount to £100 or more.  Section 19 of the Bill states that that particular subsection is not to apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That would mean, therefore, that subsection (1) of section 15 of the 1974 Act would apply unless we have the proviso in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>This section, which follows on Financial Resolution No. 10 passed on budget day, contains transitional provisions to curb the abuses of sub-contractors' certificates.  All certificates were recalled for authentication following the budget.  As from 1st March, 1976, principal contractors have been required to deduct tax at 35 per cent from any payment to a sub-contractor who does not produce a duly authenticated certificate.  This will apply until 6th December, 1976, when the new scheme which is set out in the next section governing the issue of certificates will come into operation.</P>

      <P>As I have stated, two of them repeal the word &ldquo;Income&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;the Income Tax Acts&rdquo;&mdash;that is dealt with in amendments Nos. 13 and 15&mdash;and by so doing convert the expression into the &ldquo;Tax Acts&rdquo; which is defined in section 155 (2) of the Corporation Tax Act as meaning the Income Tax Acts as defined in section 3 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the Corporation Tax Acts.  Amendment No. 16 adapts the provisions of the original section for corporation tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that section 21 amends extensively section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970; the amendment runs to six pages of this Bill.  This means that the legislation governing the tax treatment of payments to sub-contractors will be partially in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, and partially in section 21 of this Bill. <Col N="1229" /> However, I would propose to bring in an amendment on Report Stage which will reproduce in consolidated form section 17 as now amended.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section contains the provisions for the revised arrangements to be applied as from 6th December, 1976, and which are intended to counter the evasion of tax by subcontractors in the construction industry.  These arrangements are being introduced because of the abuse of certificates issued under the present system.  The new scheme provides that subcontractors will have tax deducted from payments made to them on or after December 6th 1976, unless they obtain a certificate of authorisation for the use of construction payments cards.  A number of conditions must be satisfied before such certificates will be issued.  These conditions are designed to ensure that certificates will be issued only to those subcontractors who comply with, and have been complying <Col N="1232" /> with, their tax obligations. Provision is made for the cancellation of certificates and for the imposition of substantial penalties in cases of fraud or evasion.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (g) replaces the existing section 17 (7).  The new subsection (7) sets out the conditions which a subcontractor must satisfy before a certificate of authorisation may be issued to him, which will entitle him to receive payments in full without deduction of tax.  These conditions are: first, that the applicant for a certificate of authorisation is or is about to become a subcontractor in the construction business; second, that the business is carried on from an established place of business with equipment, stock and other facilities which the Revenue Commissioners consider are required for business purposes; third, that proper records as defined in section 6 (2) of the Finance Act, 1968, are being kept. These are such records as are necessary to enable true returns to be made for the purposes of computing the profits or gains of the trade for the purposes of income tax under Schedule D; fourth, that the applicant &mdash;and in the case of partnerships and companies, each partner, proprietary director or proprietary employee&mdash; has throughout the qualifying period of three years complied with his tax obligations in relation to the payment of tax, the delivery of returns of income, and the supply of accounts or other information to the inspector; and that there is good reason to expect that the applicant will continue to keep proper records in respect of periods ending after the end of the qualifying period.</P>
      <P>However, the Revenue Commissioners have discretion to disregard the failure to fulfil any of the conditions for the granting of a certificate, if they consider that it is reasonable to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will note the use of the wording that &ldquo;there is good reason to expect that the person will comply with the obligations referred to&rdquo;.  That, of course, is a most unusual and, indeed, imprecise form of words <Col N="1233" /> to use in a taxing statute.  Nevertheless, I am not complaining about it.  I would normally express grave reservations about it, but I am not in these circumstances because I recognise the enormous difficulty for the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with the problem involved in this section.  Although some of the provisions which have previously been made to deal with this were quite elaborate, it is obvious that even more elaborate arrangements are required and that many of the persons sought to be affected by this&mdash;lumpers in the main&mdash;have both a natural ingenuity and an acquired knowledge from, perhaps, other jurisdictions of the various loopholes that exist.  Consequently, I am not objecting to the use of this wording.  I merely draw attention to the unusual nature of it.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister in regard to the other definitions that have been now substituted in paragraph (g) what the conditions are on which a certificate will be granted.  He quoted them and I will refer him again to subparagraph (i) at the top of page 19 of the Bill which reads:</P>
      <P>that the person is or is about to become a sub-contractor engaged in the business of carrying out construction contracts.</P>
      <P>Other conditions also refer to the future.  It is my experience in the past that even people who have been engaged in this kind of activity found it very difficult to get the certificate.  Conditions were being imposed by the Revenue Commissioners which appeared to go beyond or to be much stricter than those laid down because they found that the situation was being abused.  I wonder if there are any cases in which people have got certificates heretofore who had not been engaged in the business up to now and were about to become engaged but, nevertheless, managed to get a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been certificates issued where the Revenue Commissioners were satisfied that legitimate business was about to commence but, obviously, the number of such was not very great because, in the nature of the occupation, they <Col N="1234" /> tended to be starting in a very small way, perhaps a single individual, but if a number, for instance, came together to form a partnership or business and had premises and so forth they would have received certificates in the past.  It is desirable that one would make the facilities available to one genuinely starting off in business.  That is the purpose of this provision, but obviously, it is hard for such a person to provide the proofs necessary.  I do not think there is any way around that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that such a provision is necessary, at least in theory, because a person who complies with the law is entitled to this certificate and he should not be prevented from starting off in business because he cannot get the certificate.  The practical position is rather different, and I would be very surprised if anybody were able to set up in the subcontracting business with a fixed and permanent place of business and all the other requirements and still get the certificate, even though he was just starting off.  In practice he has to suffer the deductions of tax from all payments due to him for a considerable time before he will get the certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. I feel that while in theory provisions should be made for a person about to become a sub-contractor, in practice this phrase is mere lip service and no such person is going to get the certificate at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We prefer to provide the means to give a certificate. Having regard to the fact that if there were a number of new checks being built into the system, there is a possibility that certificates might be more liberally issued because the certificate has to be presented to the principal who then has to obtain the sub-contractor's signature on the return to the Revenue Commissioners and ultimately a construction payments card is issued and that also has to be signed by both parties.  The opportunities for fraud have been severely restricted by this new scheme.  The genuine person should, therefore, be more easily facilitated than in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is right because I know of a number of genuine people who have found it extremely difficult to carry on business because of the regulations which had to be made to catch those who were trying to avoid their liability.</P>
      <P>There is what might be regarded as a drafting matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  On page 17, line 3 the Minister will see &ldquo;such operations as are described above&rdquo;.  I presume that that means such operations as are described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), but it seems an unusual method of description in a Bill.  I merely draw the Minister's attention to it.  I am not making any issue.  He may wish to have it worded differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major point I want to raise on this section concerns a matter that has been drawn to the Minister's attention, I understand, in the form of representations from certain accountancy bodies who visualise certain problems arising under this section.  The main contractors will have to obtain a construction payments card from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of each sub-contractor before he can make any payment to that sub-contractor, that is, make a payment without deducting tax. The new procedure that is envisaged in this way will possibly result in main contractors having to deduct tax from the first payment they make to a sub-contractor because of the administrative problems that can arise initially in construction payments cards.  This can also arise in the case of sub-contractors who are employed on a small contract which is carried out over a short period.  The result could well be that small sub-contractors in particular who are probably accounting for their taxation liabilities, will have serious cash flow difficulties. I understand that a recommendation was made to the Minister that to try to deal with this problem he should consider providing that each main contractor would be authorised to make payments not exceeding £200 in any tax year to any one sub-contractor without deduction of tax, provided a sub-contractor produces a valid certificate issued under section 17 of the <Col N="1236" /> Finance Act, 1970.  This seems on the face of it to be a reasonable suggestion because I can visualise circumstances in which small sub-contractors could find themselves in the position of having 35 per cent of the tax deducted when it should not be.  This can be a very crippling situation for any sub-contractor but particularly for small sub-contractors and I do not see any amendment from the Minister which would meet this suggestion.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would indicate his reaction to the suggestion, that is, the suggestion that the main contractor be allowed to make payments not exceeding a total of £200 in any tax year to any one sub-contractor without a deduction of tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fears of the committee would not be justified in the light of experience.  It is intended that construction payments cards will be issued to sub-contractors by the Revenue Commissioners on the day the application is received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a good intention that I hope will be discharged. In the unlikely event of any delay occurring it will be arranged that any amount retained on account of tax by the principal will be refunded to the sub-contractor on receipt of the appropriate construction payments card.  There should not be any adverse effect on the cash flow and, accordingly, I would not feel justified in amending the legislation.  There will be another separate unit dealing with this.  It will be worthwhile doing it because I believe the return in tax will be considerable because there has been quite an amount of evasion in this field and we will see how the new system works.  There should not be any serious cash flow problems.  It will be at most a matter of some small delay which will hardly generate a cash flow problem.  The case that Deputy Colley makes is for a small sub-contractor and a matter of a few days will not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the interjection about the road to hell, because I recall what I said when I was in the Minister's shoes when introducing <Col N="1237" /> the section which he is now amending to deal with lumpers.  I gave certain assurance, in good faith on the basis of advice given to me in good faith, as to how it was intended to deal with certain matters arising in particular with claims for repayments. I know that in practice what has happened since does not conform to what was intended at the time and that is solely because of the sheer pressure and volume of work involved. I am rather afraid that the same thing can happen here.  I fully accept that it is intended to issue wherever possible&mdash;hopefully in the vast majority of cases&mdash;construction payments cards on the day of application. I feel in my bones, and the Minister must suspect, that this is simply not going to happen in a number of cases for one reason or another and that there is going to be a hold up for administrative reasons in the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about very small contractors.  This is obvious when we talk about authorising the payment of £200 to the sub-contractor from the main contractor in any one year.  Because they are small sub-contractors small sums of money and small delays can be extremely important to them in a way that would not register at all with even medium sized contractors.  Furthermore, I would strongly urge the Minister to consider the implications in the minds of such persons if there are even relatively short delays which arise in the Revenue Commissioners' Office, not on the part of the contractor or sub-contractor. The reaction of persons who have tax deducted at a very high rate for payments due to them, and as a consequence may be left without any income at all even for a few days, is that they will go berserk.  If you stand back from it and are not directly involved, it may seem as if it is something that is unfortunate and nothing else but if you are on the receiving end you can go virtually berserk when this happens to you. The Minister should not run the risk of this kind of situation arising. There is no great risk involved in the suggestion that has been put forward <Col N="1238" /> and the Minister must know that he cannot with reasonable assurance say that there will be no delays in the issue of these cards or that there will not be delays in the issue of refunds of tax where tax has been deducted and has to be refunded on production of cards.  The Minister must know that there will be cases of delays under each of these headings.  They will be unfortunate, they are not intended, but they will exist for one reason or another.  A sub-contractor, particularly a small sub-contractor genuinely complying with the law who finds himself without money on a Friday and unable to hand over any money to his wife as a result of this measure, should not be put in this position.  But it will happen, simply because the Minister cannot guarantee that no delays will occur.</P>
    <P>Some effort should be made to cover that possibility by adopting this suggestion or something similar.  It is not good enough merely to say that it is not intended to have any delay and to leave the case rest on that.  We know there will be some delays but the genuine sub-contractor who is complying with the law, particularly when he is in business in a very small way should not be the one to suffer because of a delay of that kind, a delay which everybody hopes will not occur but which we know will occur at some stage.  Can we not make some arrangement to cover that sort of situation?  We may not be able to overcome all the difficulties but we will at least avoid the worst excesses of what can happen if a sub-contractor finds that there is a very large deduction from the payments due to him and about which he can do nothing for a few days.  These may be vital days so far as he is concerned.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's anxiety that nobody would be inconvenienced but he understands my <Col N="1239" /> problem and the problem of the Revenue Commissioners in this regard. The new system will operate from 6th December so we will have time before next year's budget to have had some experience of how the system works.  If correction is needed, it can be effected then with the minimum delay.  However, these sub-contractors are not unknown to each other and I am sure they could arrange suitable accommodation among themselves in order to avoid the hardship which the Deputy visualises occurring occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well for the bigger or even the medium contractor but the smaller fellows are not in that position.  I understand that the Minister has certain difficulties in this regard but I do not think they are insuperable. I am a little unhappy at the attitude that sub-contractors and, by definition we are talking about the smaller ones, can afford to wait and see how the system works.  They should not have to depend on the question of whether the system works smoothly. We must make every effort to prevent even one case of hardship arising.  The general attitude should be that the taxpayer, be he a small sub-contractor or otherwise, would get the first consideration and that we should not adopt a wait-and-see attitude in relation to a new administration scheme.  It may seem reasonable to say that if the scheme produces hardship it can be changed but we should not risk somebody being put in dire difficulty.  A sub-contractor who has some credit is not likely to find himself in real difficulty because of this scheme but I am concerned with the one whose weekly income is buried in that 35 per cent deduction.  He is the one who will be held up to ransom because of some delay or difficulty in the administrative procedure.  He will not understand why he should be subjected to this kind of difficulty and hardship simply because something goes wrong with the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister very strongly to consider some method whereby these kinds of hardships can be avoided.  He may not be able to make the change <Col N="1240" /> now but he should endeavour to do so before the Bill is finalised.  He should not rely on the approach of waiting to see how the system works and then deciding in next year's budget whether it should be changed.  If only one or two sub-contractors were to be left without money for themselves and their families for a week-end, the price would be too high to pay in order to determine how the system works.</P>

      <P>This section provides that benefits in kind enjoyed by persons, employed here by non-resident companies, and whose remuneration arises outside the State are to be charged to tax to the same extent as similar benefits enjoyed by employees whose remuneration arises within the State.</P>
      <P>The benefits in kind legislation which applies to employees generally is contained in Chapter III of Part V of the Income Tax Act, 1967, sections 116 to 123, and covers expense payments, provision of accommodation, entertainment and cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 119 applies the provisions of Chapter III to employments the emoluments of which would fall to be assessed under Schedule E.  There are a number of people resident in the <Col N="1242" /> State who are employees of companies not so resident.  If such employees derive their emoluments from the country of residence of the company the emoluments fall to be regarded as income from a possession outside the State.  As such, the emoluments fall to be assessed, not under Schedule E, but under Case III of Schedule D. Because section 119 applies only to Schedule E, benefits in kind enjoyed by an employee whose emoluments are chargeable under Case III of Schedule D fall outside the scope of the charge.  This position leaves the door open for some tax avoidance as well as creating anomalies in ordinary cases.</P>
    <P>An anomaly may be illustrated by the following example.  Assume that a British company has a subsidiary in this country.  The subsidiary provides a rent free house for its manager.  The subsidiary being resident here, has to operate PAYE for the manager and he is liable in the normal way in respect of the benefit flowing to him from the rent free house.  The parent company in Britain also employ one of its own managers for duties in this country and provides him with a rent free house.  His emoluments arise in Britain and are chargeable under Case III of Schedule D.  He, therefore, escapes tax on the benefit flowing to him from the rent free house. Because he is being paid from Britain he enjoys an advantage over the man who is, in effect, his colleague, who is paid in the State.  If the legal position is not corrected, employees of British and Northern Ireland companies are likely to ask their employees to make arrangements to take advantage of the position.</P>

      <P>They are a very obvious area where benefits are given in certain categories of employment and it appears the Minister is bringing certain benefits in kind into consideration for taxation which were not heretofore subject to tax.  Since he is doing that, it would seem an appropriate time to consider which should not be taxed and why.  I know the Minister will say he is simply taking the position as it is and that what is applied under one Schedule will be applied under another.  Why should a rent free house be assessed for the purpose of tax but a house being purchased with the aid of one's employer, we will say at 1 per cent interest, should not be taxed?

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section imposes a minimum charge of £300 or, if greater, 15 per cent of the cost of the car, on employees or directors who are chargeable under the provisions of section 117 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, on the benefit in kind accruing to them from the private use of a car provided for them by their employers or companies.  The minimum charge applied for 1976-77 and subsequent years of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> The section also secures that where the taxpayer enjoys the benefit of the car for portion only of the year of assessment, for example, where he commences with a new employer, the amount of the minimum charge will be determined by apportionment of a time basis.  The yield from this measure is expected to be about £4 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Section 117 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is the section which provides that benefits in kind, including an employee's private use of a car supplied by his employer, are chargeable to tax under Schedule E.  Where a car is owned by an employer and is placed at the disposal of an employee or director, the liability to tax is computed by reference to the sum of (a) the annual value of the use of the car and (b) the running costs borne by the employer less such part of that sum, calculated normally on a mileage basis, as is shown to relate to the use of the car in the performance of the duties of the office or employment.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;annual value of the use&rdquo; of the car is taken as 12½ per cent of the purchase price.  In practice, however, the assessable figure in the case of employees normally ranges from £100 to £200.  Attempts to have those amounts increased to more realistic levels, to take account of the present-day cost of running a car for private use, lead to time-consuming correspondence and endless disputes.</P>
    <P>The fixing of the minimum amount of the benefit at £300 or 15 per cent of the cost of the car has two advantages: (1), it quantifies the value of the benefit at a more realistic figure and (2), it will simplify administration of the benefits in kind code by ending the protracted disputation as to the extent of the private use of the car and the measure of chargeable benefit. It will not, of course, preclude the charging on the existing basis of the benefit in kind in respect of the private use of a car in a case where such benefit is of an amount that is greater than the minimum of £300 or 15 per cent of the relevant cost of the car. The &ldquo;relevant cost&rdquo; of the vehicle <Col N="1246" /> for the purposes of this section is as defined in section 31.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason, as I understand it, for the proposed change of the law is to avoid time consuming correspondence and protracted negotiations. One can understand the desire to avoid these things but I wonder if this section will avoid anything. Surely the Minister expects that there will be many taxpayers who will argue with the inspector and engage in protracted correspondence as to the amount that should be allowed under this section.  Is there any gain from the point of view of administration in this section?  I doubt it.  From the point of view of the taxpayer, the introduction of this minimum&mdash;am I right in saying there is not a minimum at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It can work out quite unjustly, because if one were to calculate in certain cases what the value should be, it could well be below £300.  The wording of this section is that the amount to be charged shall not be less than the greater of the two amounts, either £300 or 15 per cent.  This section is now laying down a minimum, assuming in a particular case that the 15 per cent is smaller than the minimum of £300.  On what basis can one justify either the principle of a minimum, irrespective of the facts of the case, or, in so far as one accepts that there should be a minimum, how does one arrive at £300?  It seems to me to be much too arbitrary an approach and an effort to subject what should be a question of negotiation and judgment by the Revenue Commissioners to a kind of a machine operation.  Hopefully that is what is thought will happen: there will be a push-button arrangement which will simplify matters for the Revenue Commissioners, without any great regard to the justice or equity of what happens to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is objectionable from the point of view of the lack of concern <Col N="1247" /> for the justice and equality being meted out.  In addition, it will not give the benefit hoped for administratively and we will have the worst of both worlds. We will have the failure to get the benefit administratively, and at the same time, we will have introduced a very doubtful principle, as is being done in this section, of having a minimum allowance in the case of this kind without reference to the facts of any particular case.</P>
    <P>The existing provision is section 117 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which appears to give the Revenue Commissioners plenty of scope for taxing the benefit arising from the use of a car and gives them the option and discretion to make an equitable judgment in the light of the facts in each case and, in particular, of the apportionment as between business and private use.  I am not aware of any major complaints in regard to how this has operated.</P>
    <P>It would appear from what the Minister says that so far as there are complaints, they are coming from the Revenue Commissioners, not from the taxpayers. I do not really think it is good enough to try to approach a problem of this kind&mdash;presumably there is a problem or we would not have this section&mdash;in this purely arbitrary way. Clearly, although the section does not say so, the intention is to say to the people: &ldquo;Look, it will be £300 or you prove otherwise.  We will not encourage you very much to prove otherwise because it involves protracted correspondence and negotiations.&rdquo;  I freely admit that that may be exaggerating the position somewhat, but not grossly.  The thinking involved in this section is fairly clear.  It is putting expected administrative convenience and saving ahead of any question of justice or equity for the taxpayer.  It is disregarding the facts of particular cases that can arise.  It is saying: &ldquo;I do not care what the facts are.  The minimum charge to tax in respect of benefit in kind, or a car, will be so much, irrespective of the facts.&rdquo;  I do not know how anybody can justify that kind of approach.  Certainly, administrative convenience, even were it to be achieved, would not justify it.  However one may talk about equity in <Col N="1248" /> taxation, there can be no equity in a situation in which irrespective of the facts, one lays down a minimum.  I would hope the Minister would think a little further about what is involved in this and whether he is really achieving anything at all by this section.</P>
    <P>In my view the likely result of this section is that every taxpayer will argue like hell with the inspector about the value being placed on his car and the administrative work will be even more than it was heretofore.  The consolation to the Minister may be: well, at least there is a minimum figure.  I do not know.  Is it assumed that the inspectors are incapable of enforcing what they consider to be the correct or reasonable value or is it really seriously thought that by introducing this section most taxpayers involved are simply going to take it lying down and not raise any arguments or queries?  Because, if that is what is thought, I venture to suggest that the Minister is in for a rude awakening.  I do not believe that is what is going to happen at all.  The volume of work involved in dealing with claims of this kind will be increased considerably if this section is enacted.  Therefore, we would have the worst of both worlds&mdash;no gain administratively, possibly even a loss.  Certainly, the introduction of a section which proposes to lay down a minimum charge, irrespective of the facts, is something that can hardly be justified on theoretical grounds, whatever practical grounds the Minister may advance from an administrative point of view to try to justify it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps then my calculation is wrong.  I am fairly sure that there are some cases where cars are used exclusively for the individual rather than for the business.  But, in the majority of cases, the use of a car is an essential part, particularly for people who are agents or travellers. The £2,000 against £3,000 is almost approaching sole use for the individual. I do not dispute the fact that there may be some cases.  Certainly, in the case of any person who is a commercial traveller, who is travelling five days a week, he cannot do his travelling in any kind of an efficient way unless he has a car. Therefore, the five days' travelling is being done in connection with the business.</P>
      <P>If one takes the £2,000 the Minister set out against the maximum £3,000 allowable for a car, he is being charged on that car as if he had its full use for two-thirds of the week, I think.  To my mind that is what it is working out at.  The Minister says the value of a car at £300 is £3,000 and the maximum allowable is, what, £3,000 or £3,500?</P>

      <P>What the Minister is saying here is that the minimum value of this car is never going to fall below £2,000, where it could easily.  I can see in my mind at present a few cars that are valued at approximately £400 to £600.  If the commissioners had discretion, that is fair enough but they do not have it here.  It says quite clearly in the explanatory memorandum: &ldquo;...£300 per annum or, if greater...&rdquo;.  It amounts to charging the individual with something over half the total use of the car even though it is for his job.  I am speaking now of individuals who have to have cars for their jobs.  I agree that there is a separate area in which there are people who can hardly be described as using the car for the benefit of the business; it is probably more for their own benefit.</P>
      <P>Taking the £300 or 15 per cent&mdash; the Minister mentioned 12½ per cent as being the annual value of the car&mdash; there arises the question of tax and insurance which are fairly substantial now, apart from the running costs of the car.  If the running costs are being paid by the employer, is the annual tax or proportion of it and, if so, what proportion and the insurance and what proportion, to be added to the minimum of £300 or 15 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no question of adding on the items of motor tax or insurance.  The £300 charge is calculated after taking into account the average cost of running cars, including&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the capital cost, insurance, tax, fuel, depreciation, average repairs and so on.  When one considers that 15 per cent of a week is just marginally more than a day that the average person works a five day week&mdash;he does not work for 18 hours during the average day either but proceeds to and from his place of employment, often in his private car and uses the car in the evening time&mdash;one can see that the figures we have in mind are quite reasonable.  Some months ago&mdash;this was last year and, like everything else, car costs have increased since then&mdash; the Automobile Association calculated that the lowest running cost of a car&mdash;this would be in respect of a small car&mdash;was £16 a week.  The running costs of what might be called the average car were not less than £20 a week.  By any reasonable assessment the figure of £300 is a fair measure of what might be regarded as the private use of a car.  The tax laws do not allow a deduction in respect of the cost of going to and from one's place of employment and there are very good reasons for this.  It amounts to a considerable part of what is called the private use of a car; probably it accounts for a large proportion of most private car use.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that since we made our announcement last January in the recently introduced Finance Bill in Britain they have introduced not dissimilar provisions to deal with the same benefit in kind.  Clearly what is involved is a benefit in kind.  If a person is provided with a company car he is not obliged to put up the capital and usually he is not required to pay either insurance or tax.  Even the car repairs may be discharged by the company and that is a very considerable saving.</P>

      <P>Having a minimum will avoid a certain amount of argument. Those of us who have professional experience in this area will be aware of the appalling disputes that can arise between inspectors of taxes and taxpayers regarding the car.  It seems to generate more emotion than any other possession or benefit in kind.</P>
      <P>In Britain they have produced a most elaborate system.  There are nearly 30 or 40 different rates, depending on the cylinder capacity of the car in cubic centimeters, the value of the car where they have not got cylinder capacity and so on.  Their system is probably more arbitrary than ours.  I agree that we have an arbitrary minimum but it should avoid a great deal of disputation.  We can go to 15 per cent of the cost of a car if it is greater.</P>
      <P>It is a reasonable system.  It will avoid a lot of the argument that must frustrate the taxpayer as much as the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and it will help to achieve finality in relation to accounts at a much earlier time than is possible now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the argument about saving the time of highly paid officers in the Department. However, I regard the fixing of a minimum as unwise even from the economic point of view.  If an employee is to be charged at a minimum he may look for a new car every second year on the principle that if he is to be taxed he should have the maximum value.  It is a non-economic approach.  A fixed charge on the value of the car as written into the books would be a more efficient and a fairer way of approaching the matter.  I accept that the problem of time arises when dealing with the question of running costs.  If the Minister puts in a provision regarding the greater figure it will be necessary to work out the cost of the car for the year.  The Minister has said that he will take the 15 per cent of the value of the car as being the overall figure including running <Col N="1253" /> expenses but I do not see how he can avoid checking the running costs as the inspector and the accountant do at the moment.  It will be inevitable.</P>
      <P>The fixing of a minimum is not wise because it will keep up the cost of the car.  There will not be an efficient use of transport and some individuals will also have a sense of grievance about the matter.  A person may say that his car is worth only £1,000 but he is being charged an extra £150 tax for the use of the car. The question then arises if the employee is charging the firm for the use of the car during his private time, perhaps in the evenings or at weekends. There may be a number of people who are not charging up the expenses for running the car unless it is being used for business purposes.</P>
      <P>I would recommend the Minister to look at the matter again.  It is not a question of trying to persuade him to reduce tax; it is a question of being reasonable.  We should not create a sense of grievance among some sections, particularly as this is an annual fixed charge, either £300 or 15 per cent, whichever is the greater.</P>

      <P>I should like to get some experience of the operation of this new system before considering what changes, if any, should be made. I appreciate the arguments of the Opposition but I would point out that none of us can make any clear judgment on what would be the most appropriate way of handling the matter. When we have some experience of the new system we will see if it produces any wrinkles that need to be ironed out.  If that proves to be the case, certainly we will do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument is that the Revenue Commissioners will have no alternative.  They will have to make the charge irrespective of the circumstances and I do not think that is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Brugha on this.  Whatever the Minister may say about getting experience of how this works he can be sure now, without any experience, that it will produce a sense of <Col N="1254" /> grievance among a number of taxpayers for the reasons spelled out by Deputy Brugha.  It is a minimum and in a number of cases the charge being made will be demonstrably greater than should be made on the basis of the value of the car and the facts.  That arises because there is a minimum there.  Whether it is going to save administration costs is, of course, a matter for estimation and judgment.  Nobody can be certain whether it will or will not do that. My belief is that it will not save administration costs but even if it did it will not be justified having regard to the fact that it is proposing to lay down charges irrespective of the facts appertaining in the case of a particular taxpayer.  That will cause trouble and dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>Apart from that aspect of the matter, I should like to know how the situation is envisaged in the case of a person like a commercial traveller who is supplied with a car by his employer and who spends most of the week, and sometimes part of the week-end, using the car for business purposes.  What will be the situation as regards such a person? On what basis will his use be assessed?  How will that compare with somebody who is supplied with a car but does not use it for anything like the same amount of his time?  How are the two different cases to be approached under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is arbitrary but I think it will operate to the advantage of several people although possibly to the disadvantage of some.  It is hard to think of any situation where the availability of a car to a person is not worth £300 per year.  Just think of the costs of hiring a car for a day in every week and it will exceed £300 per annum.  The figure is a small one.  I know people quickly overlook the actual costs of running a car.  One thinks of it when buying or when one has major repairs carried out on a car or when one has to pay tax but the continuing depreciation of cars, loss of value and so on all add up to a considerable sum.  People overlook the actual cost then if they are providing the sole cost themselves and if they have the cost at the expense of their <Col N="1255" /> employer they certainly are not aware of the tremendous advantage it is to them.  It would be very difficult for anybody to argue that the availability of a car and even its modest use is not worth at least £6 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases of commercial travellers who leave Dublin on a Monday morning, travel around the country during the week and return late on Friday night or on Saturday. It depends on the business the traveller is engaged in but for some businesses the Friday evening can be important for doing business and if travellers are far away from Dublin they may not return to the city until Saturday.  In such a case all the use from Monday morning until the traveller returns has been for business purposes.  Are we saying that the benefit in kind he is assessed as having got from the use of the car for his own benefit is a minimum of £300 or, if it happens to be a car worth a reasonably large sum which a traveller would have if he travels long distances, it would be more than £300 because 15 per cent of the sum involved is more?  Is this what is to happen under this section?  Is the Minister saying that it is a kind of average arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>£450 would be a fair average for such a person.  The car would hardly be worth less than £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did the same in relation to the blood content of persons charged with drunken driving.  There are many cases where the Legislature have to act arbitrarily because it is the only feasible way of administering something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may seem like a good example to the Minister but it is not a good example from his point of view.  No matter what the alcohol content in the blood shown in a sample it is still possible to convict a person of being drunk in charge of a car, if he was drunk, irrespective of the content of <Col N="1256" /> alcohol in his blood.  I do not think it is a pursuasive factor.  If he acted in a drunken manner that could be given as evidence.  In other words, there is one arbitrary thing to go by but one must also allow for the other flexible approach which is what we are urging on the Minister.  There should be a flexible approach here related to the circumstances of the case.  One can easily pick out extreme cases and show how badly they are going to be affected by this but that is not our purpose. Our purpose is to show that one cannot have an average approach in this and that seems to be what the Minister is trying to imply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brugha raised an important point and I am not sure that the Minister replied to it.  It was in relation to the 15 per cent.  To what figure is that to apply?  Is the value of the car to be reduced every year and the 15 per cent to be applied to the reduced value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still £300 when the car falls below £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>And then one is operating with a car which is clearly, under the method of valuation provided in the Bill, below the value of £2,000 and going lower.  Nevertheless, the £300 minimum is being charged as though the car was worth £2,000.  The clear anomaly that arises in such circumstances is something that at least requires some explanation or some attempt at justification by the Minister. In his reply to Deputy Brugha I do not think the Minister attempted to justify the anomaly or to acknowledge that it existed.  There can be no question but that such an anomaly exists and for that reason some explanation is required for the deliberate creation of it under this section.  This section, combined with section 31, would clearly create this kind of anomaly.</P>
      <P>Another point I should like to touch on is the necessity to increase the £1,500 per annum limit provided in section 119 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in order to even keep pace with inflation since then.</P>

      <P>On Report Stage of the debate in the Seanad it was suggested that there was a technical defect in the wording of this subsection which could mean that the authority and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission could be liable to legal action by performers under the Performers Protection Act, 1968, if recordings were retained for longer than six months.  I indicated at that time that the issues raised would need to be considered in greater detail than was possible in the time available, and that if, following further consideration, legal advice was that amendments were necessary to ensure that nothing in the Performers Protection Act, 1968 or the Copyrights Act, 1963, would prevent retention of recordings made under section 7 of this Bill for as long as they are required, I would introduce amendments accordingly on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I have since been advised that amendments are necessary to ensure that recordings made under section 7 may be retained for as long as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission consider necessary to enable <Col N="1258" /> them to complete their investigation of any particular programme.  The amendments proposed are intended to achieve this, and I hope the House will agree to them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is agreed now that with the Minister's amendment the authorities can retain recordings for an indefinite time.  It is desirable that this type of proof, which is so necessary if the complaints commission are to carry out their job effectively, should be available.  I do not think there is any obligation placed on them to retain these recordings.  The only obligation that will be placed on them is the 60 days.  I think that certain obligations should also be placed on <Col N="1259" /> them beyond the time laid down in the Bill.  I believe that 60 days is not a sufficiently long period especially for the complaints commission and also for the public generally in regard to making a complaint.</P>
      <P>I think I mentioned when we were discussing the Bill last week that people may take an action against the Authority, but there is no obligation on the Authority to produce the necessary proof when this action takes place six or eight months later.  There should be a provision to oblige them to retain recordings beyond six months seeing that the Minister has provided that they can retain these recordings for an unlimited time for the purposes of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, without infringing copyright.  I would like to see provision for the retention of material for up to 18 months.  Complaints can be protracted and if the type of cases I have in mind arise these recordings will be necessary in a court of law.  The Authority might be requested to produce these recordings as evidence to protect themselves, or, indeed, the plaintiff could very well require the recording to prove his case. Therefore, I believe the 60 days is not long enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Deputy's points with attention, but I wonder whether this may not be adequately met by part of the wording of section 7 (2) which provides that such recordings be retained for at least 60 days or for such other periods as shall be agreed by the Authority and commission, so that if something comes up the period can be extended. I would be reluctant to make it mandatory on the Authority to keep recordings for as long a period as 18 months in all cases.  The House will understand that in view of the tremendous amount which is broadcast by a fully functioning broadcasting station, putting out a great deal of sound and visual material that a mandatory requirement that 18 months of this whole output would have to be kept would involve the station in heavy expense.  If it were absolutely necessary I would say O.K., <Col N="1260" /> but do we all feel that it is necessary? This is not a contentious subject between us.  If Deputies opposite feel strongly that it should be kept for as long as that, I would be prepared to have another look at the matter between now and Report Stage and see what sort of scale of expenditure is involved, what RTE think and so on.</P>

      <P>There is a point on which the Minister might be able to relieve what I would call the public mind generally, and that is how does one ensure that a broadcast&mdash;news commentary, or whatever it might be &mdash;is retained even for any period?  I am speaking of the ordinary member of the public who is not conversant with the manner in which one appeals to a commission against something that has been said and so on.  There is some degree of public anxiety in regard to things that may be said on radio and television, and before the individual, who is relatively ignorant of these things, can get around to finding out how to do anything about it the material has been destroyed and there is no use in arguing.  Could the Minister relieve the public generally on that aspect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I can. Section 7 (1) obliges the Authority to record every broadcast made by the Authority and there is no exception to that now, provided, as regards a television broadcast, that the sound should suffice, and these recordings will be then retained necessarily for 60 days in all cases.  It is a matter of experience that if a broadcast becomes an object of debate if it is considered in some way improper by any section of the public, its impact is virtually immediate.  Whatever controversy there is follows immediately on that, so that all concerned are alerted if a broadcast in fact leads to complaints. One can hardly envisage a case in which a broadcast occurs and more than two months later somebody complains about it.  It is very unlikely.  It is conceiveable that somebody returning from the forests of Borneo where he has been isolated will return and learn something.  This possibility can be <Col N="1261" /> imagined, but one does not need to pursue these unusual cases.  I think that is really the answer, that the contention, if there is any, would follow immediately on the broadcast.</P>

I would expect the Broadcasting Complaints Commission when appointed to consider the period of 60 days laid down in section 7, and if they consider it desirable that the period for mandatory retention should be longer than 60 days I would agree this with the Authority. RTE considered it desirable that a period of more than 60 days should not be made mandatory, and I think their sole consideration there was money.</P>

      <P>In regard to section 7, which requires the Authority to record every broadcast, the point touched on by Deputy Brugha, I would like to elaborate on it.  In regard to maintaining a number of sporting programmes, can the Minister tell the House, say in regard to race meetings, hurling matches, football matches, the length of time that extra special items of sport are retained in RTE?  Will they be retained for only the 60 days, for 18 months or indefinitely?  I mention this because I believe that the outside broadcasting unit of Telefís Éireann in covering a number of sporting programmes&mdash;and I refer particularly to last Sunday's match between Clare and Kilkenny&mdash; have not sufficient cameras allocated to cover these events.</P>

    <P>In watching the replay of the match on Sunday night there was no replay in slow motion.  Two goals were scored and there was no replay in slow motion of either of the goals scored, in my opinion two brilliantly scored goals by the Clare team.  This match, a national league final, deserved far more elaborate treatment than it received.  The number of cameras there was not sufficient.  I do not want to draw comparisons but some of our major sporting programmes <Col N="1262" /> are not on a par with Match of the Day as broadcast by the BBC.</P>

We should be in a position to have items like that recorded by Telefís Éireann in slow motion. For a lot of these sporting items it is necessary to have more cameras present.  I appreciate that the Minister has to work within a limited budget and that he has some difficultes but it is necessary to provide cameras and sufficient personnel and equipment to have these items televised.</P>

      <P>This section deals exclusively with recordings and the preservation of recordings, and in particular with what shall be mandatory on RTE in that connection.  We do not envisage making different mandatory provisions affecting different categories of material.  This applies to all matter broadcast which must be preserved for at least 60 days and may be preserved longer by arrangement between the Authority and the commission, and we are dealing here with a matter that might lead to complaints; that is to say, in answer to the Deputy who is concerned quite legitimately with sporting programmes, that the material must be preserved for 60 days, may be preserved longer by arrangement between the Authority and the commission.  Nothing in this section or in the Bill prevents material which is regarded as historically important&mdash;which would apply to <Col N="1263" /> a sports programme of classical interest and high standard performance &mdash;from being preserved indefinitely. But the judge on that would have to be the archives section of RTE and the Deputy's remarks will be brought to their attention.  They will sympathise with the objective they have in mind and as broadcasters they would also be concerned with having a good sporting archive.  Although I agree with the general points I do not think it is necessary to cover this point by statutory provision.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a very detailed and comprehensive reply to the points I made for which I thank him.  He mentions that this section deals with recordings and the preservation of recordings of RTE.  In relation to the match last Sunday it is impossible to retain something if it has not been filmed properly.  I would like to know if there are sufficient cameras allocated to cover some of these sporting programmes.  I would also like to know why in a large number of sporting programmes we do not see a replay in slow motion of some of the more spectacular items.  I do not know whether or not a particular item can be relayed in slow motion at a later time&mdash;I presume it can be&mdash;but for the people who are in the recording and preservation section if it were recorded and relayed in slow motion at the time of showing it would give them a more intimate knowledge of it so that they would be able to recognise the value when deciding whether to retain a recording. In order that there would be better televising and recording of these events I believe more television cameras would be needed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright's remarks put me in a difficult position, in so far as I am constrained to speak very directly to the section, and the section deals only with the question of recording and preservation of recordings and not with such questions as the number of cameras assigned to a particular task or slow motion.  I sympathise with the point the Deputy is making, but it is <Col N="1264" /> not totally and strictly relevant to every point of the section.  I will see to it that his remarks are brought to the attention of the Authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister partly agreed with me when he mentioned that the 60 days could be extended by an agreement with the commission and the Authority.  The Revenue Commissioners have laid down a requirement that accounts of all types of business should be kept over a statutory period of six to seven years.  I do not want to complicate matters at Montrose by suggesting that this infliction be imposed on the Authority.  They would need a new department to retain all recordings for that length of time.  To give discretion to the Authority to discard recordings after 60 days is too short.</P>
      <P>The preservation of recordings of sports programmes is an important point made by Deputy Enright because a lot of people would like to ensure that an historical or outstanding final in Croke Park or somewhere else could be shown three or four years later and that the Authority would not destroy it within 60 days.  The two amendments that the Minister brought in indicate that the Authority are anxious to keep some programmes longer than the limit of 60 days which otherwise they would be compelled to destroy due to the Copyrights Act.  There are programmes which they would like to preserve in their archives and which would make very entertaining programmes in five or six years' time.  Apart from entertainment, evidence could be needed, in relation to an action taken against the Authority in a court of law or, perhaps, taken against some employee even, not an employee in the Authority. Sixty days is too short in such matters. It would be damaging to the plaintiff and the defendant if certain material was not available.  It would not be destroyed deliberately.  The complaints commission may be hampered to a certain extent in their findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said this will arise only on rare occasions and he is probably right because complaints will be made within a short period.  I do <Col N="1265" /> not know how long it would take to initiate a civil action against the Authority but it could be well beyond the 60-days limit and the material could be destroyed.  I should like to see the time extended but I do not want to make things impossible for the Authority.  I am sure Deputy Enright will concede that in regard to outstanding events in sport and entertainment the Bill does not compel RTE to keep records of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly, we are dealing with two distinguishable classes of material which ought to be preserved, evidential and historical.  As regards the evidential part, that is what is envisaged in section 7, the reason why we make it mandatory to preserve for a certain period certain classes of material is because any broadcast may lead to a controversy, to complaints, and it is vital that the material by which the complaints commission can judge be available.  The question is whether 60 days is long enough.  If Deputies opposite fear it may not be long enough, I should like, assuming we allow this section to carry, to consult with the RTE Authority between now and Report Stage and see whether the views expressed can be met without significantly adding to the Authority's budgetary and administrative difficulties. Then I would report to the House on what appeared to me as a result of this examination and we could look at the Bill again in this respect.  I hope that procedure will be agreeable to the House.</P>
      <P>The other matter which Deputy Enright and others raised is in regard to historical archives.  When I speak of history I am not thinking of political history.  I include also under that denomination the history of any particular activity, including sport which is an important aspect of social history.  This comes under the general heading of archives policy which I think is rightly left to RTE themselves to decide on. Certain matters are obviously of historical interest, for example, the funerals of Presidents or ex-Presidents. Irish people would wish that a record be preserved of such events, and it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> There are other more marginal matters. If I may speak a little informally, if there are Deputies interested in an archives policy&mdash;it is an interesting theme and takes us pleasantly out of the political arena for the time being&mdash;I am sure the RTE head of archives would be glad to discuss archives policy with them.  If such Deputies would give me their names we could, perhaps, have a meeting at some convenient time with the head of archives, solely for the purpose of finding out what the historical policy is.  I am sure there are a number of Deputies interested in it and it would be of interest to the Authority and to the public to have matters discussed in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very interested in having such a meeting in the future.  There are many matters which I should like to find out about for my own information and, perhaps, it might be of interest later to have some of them discussed in the House.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of section 7 we have a provision stating that it shall be the duty of the Authority by means of its own facilities and in a manner approved of for the purposes of this section by the commission to record for those purposes every broadcast made by the Authority, and so on.  I was with a number of people last Sunday watching a match and I compared it with the coverage of &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; which is televised on Saturday nights.  The difference in camera coverage was obvious.  It is quite clear that the programme &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; had more cameras to cover it than the Clare-Kilkenny match last Sunday.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that there are not sufficient cameras available at such events to keep a proper record of them and the section provides that it shall be the duty of the Authority to keep records of certain events.  I appreciate the difficulties there may be from the social side.  On the evidential side also there are difficulties and I am glad <Col N="1267" /> the Minister will be reporting back later in regard to the 60-day limit.  As somebody practising law, I know the delays that occur.  A person watching a programme may think it is injurious to him.  He may have to consult with his family to decide whether to take an action.  He has to go to his solicitor who may not have seen the programme. The solicitor may wish to consult counsel and counsel may have to give an opinion.  There may then be some time lag before a letter is written to RTE on behalf of the person who feels he has been injured.  It can take a considerable period of time. I presume that any material about which a protest letter might be received would be retained at least for the period during which proceedings can be initiated but I can understand the difficulty for the authority in this regard since, for instance, letters are sometimes written frivolously.</P>

On the historic and evidential question again may we take it from that subsection that it will not be necessary for the Authority to retain a visual recording?</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This means that the visual recording will not be retained but from an evidential point of view one can be slandered on a television broadcast in more ways than by the spoken word.  Therefore, there will be a weakness in the section.  So far as sports programmes or those of an historic nature are concerned there is no way of preserving them on a recording basis only.  I doubt if the <Col N="1268" /> complaints commission will be furnished with sufficient evidence on a recording basis only to enable them to reach a balance in regard to complaints. There are several ways of creating imbalance apart from the spoken word and this is true particularly of television.  Take, for instance, a commercial.  There may be a conflict between the words spoken during a commercial and the images shown, images that might be slanderous to any company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the Deputy's point is very material, possibly the most material point that could be made in relation to the section. I should like to say how it comes about that the section provided for mandatory recording in sound only. As Deputies are aware there is no statutory obligation at present on the authority to make or keep recordings for any purpose.  They keep recordings primarily for historical purposes and partly, I presume, from the evidential point of view where dispute may arise.  This section imposes an obligation on them to keep recordings. When creating new obligations one tends to be somewhat parsimonious and to listen carefully to those who are affected.  We were advised by RTE that retention of all broadcasts by way of visual records as well as sound would involve considerable expense and storage space.  From now on I shall be confining my remarks on this section purely to the evidential aspect which is the mandatory one.  We have wandered a little far on the historical aspect which is of interest but is not involved directly.  RTE suggested that sound recordings only should be adequate.  The Complaints Advisory Committee were consulted on the matter and they were satisfied with the provision as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Deputy I was not entirely happy with the provision and it is something that I would need to look at again with RTE.  The point about expense is very material but the point the Deputy makes, that is, that an unfair or unbalanced impression may be given by images while the sound may be perfectly above board, <Col N="1269" /> is valid.  We have all seen and heard programmes in which what we would object to, rightly or wrongly, would be the visual but I would like to take up the matter again with RTE.  I take it that Deputies will appreciate the Authority's point about expense in preserving visuals but we might consider a compromise measure regarding the preservation of visuals for a shorter period and of sound for a longer period but I should not like to enter into any commitment without further consultation with RTE.  I agreed with them on this question but since the Deputy has expressed his view I should like to explore the question further and to come back to the House on it at a later stage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is a pity we have not the complaints commission established now, when I would like to submit this section to them.  It is very important that visual tapes be kept; for what length of time I do not know.  I take the Minister's point that it may be expensive but, if certain people's characters are damaged in any way, then one does not count expense until their characters have been cleared. This can very easily happen on television. I do not want to get the Authority involved in a highly expensive operation but I think it will be necessary.  Probably we will have to make it mandatory that, for a short length of time, some visual tapes should be retained, especially on the evidental section.  I would be rather concerned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new complaints commission, when it does come into being, would feel very hampered and the evidence available to them inadequate if a person&mdash;whether <Col N="1270" /> through advertising or a particular programme&mdash;felt that his character or business was damaged in some way or, indeed, on the question of balance.  I do not see how the complaints commission will be able to do their job effectively with resort to sound recordings only.  It would be a task in which they would find it very difficult to give a balanced judgment.</P>
    <P>Without the visual tape in any evidence in court it would be very difficult also for any jury or judge to decide.  The Minister should take a serious look at that part of Section 7 which reads:</P>
    <P>...the Authority shall be regarded as complying with the requirements of this section if it records in sound only the broadcast.</P>
    <P>As time goes on, we will find that we will be back in the House, probably with a request from the complaints commission for clarification when they will be confronted with some complaints.  In this respect one programme springs to mind immediately. At present there are two programmes the subject of complaint.  I refer to the programmes on the Dublin Bay refinery.  It was what one saw on those programmes that made a big impression on one's mind as much as what was said on the programmes. Were the Authority to retain recording of such programmes in sound only, for the life of me I cannot see how a complaints commission could adjudicate on them.  To my mind that would present them with an impossible task, rendering a balance judgment impossible also.  I am sure there are numerous other programmes of that type where, without the visual tapes, what one would get on sound would be useless.  Of course, the Minister has correctly admitted that images on advertising can be slanderous at times, when again the visual part of the programme would be of vital importance.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister has in mind.  It is important, certainly important when the complaints commission comes into being if and when a case should ever arise of a serious slander in which damages are involved against the Authority, perhaps, in <Col N="1271" /> respect of a company or its reputation. Were there a court case 12 months later for substantial damages against the Authority and all the Authority could produce at that time was a recording of the programme, I am not sure what would be the remarks of the judge of the day.  Some provision should be made, for a short length of time, to ensure that the visual tape is available both to the complaints commission and as evidence in court in any case being heard.  The Minister did say he intended to have a look at it on Report Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed I did.  I take the Deputy's point very seriously, indeed.  I wish to have it explored and will report further on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>There is only one additional point I should like to make&mdash;as we will be coming back to this on Report Stage &mdash;whereas the complaints advisory committee did not object to the wording of the Bill, as it stands, I think they had very much in mind also the financial restraints on RTE and the difficulty of preserving visual records over any prolonged period.  I do not wish to suggest that they were necessarily satisfied with the preservation of sound records only.  I am sure they would be much more satisfied were it possible to provide for visual records also.  I want to look into the question of how expensive that would be and whether we can provide for a minimum mandatory period which would not involve RTE in excessive expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am reasonably clear on what has been said.  May I ask the Minister if I am correct in thinking that when a set of letters originates from a firm of solicitors on behalf of somebody, proceedings are commenced and served, even then&mdash; as the situation obtains at present&mdash;the sound recording only is retained as distinct from the taped film?  I think the Minister is in agreement with everybody on this point&mdash;that sound is one thing but that gestures, appearances, approaches of people on a television screen, even an inflection in a <Col N="1272" /> person's voice or expression on a person's face can have an entirely different bearing on the matter.  May I take it that, once proceedings have commenced, both the sound recordings and the taped film will be retained?  I appreciate that proceedings may not commence for a long period, of say, nine or 12 months, when, in many instances, such recordings and films may have been disposed of. Perhaps the Minister would let me know exactly what is the position there.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is considering the matter with regard to the future.  In my opinion there should not be any great expense on RTE in retaining films that may have repercussions and likely proceedings being initiated in court because the number of programmes in respect of which that is likely to happen would be limited.  The Minister is very much in agreement with Deputy Fitzpatrick in this matter and says he is giving it his serious consideration. Perhaps the Minister would let me know what is the position when proceedings are served because I believe there must be a duty then on RTE to retain all of the material involved.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be crossing from one section to another with regard to evidential as distinct from the historical aspect.  To return to the historical aspect of it in my opinion we should make every effort in regard to our national sports, hurling and football, to promote interest in them.  During the last few months we have seen some of the most wonderful exhibitions of hurling ever.</P>

If the film was distributed throughout Europe and the world many people who never tried to play hurling would become interested in attempting to play the game.

      <P>There are two points I would like to make.  I would like to confine myself, under your ruling, strictly to the section.  The matter of existing practice has been raised, which does not strictly arise under the section.  As I pointed out, there is at present no statutory obligation on the Authority to make or keep recordings for any purpose.  They preserve recordings but generally these are, at present, matters of day to day presentation proper to RTE and I do not think we should expand on their present practice here.  The question before us as legislators is what obligations we wish to make mandatory on them.</P>
      <P>As I said, Deputy Fitzpatrick's point about the preservation of visual records is highly relevant and I will have it studied.  I would also like to make the point, because some references here seem to imply that everything that was broadcast could be preserved, both visually and in sound, that a very considerable proportion of television broadcasts are live and there is no record.  That is one material existing limitation there.  Of course, filmed material can be preserved.  The question is do we make it mandatory to preserve such material and if so for how long?  As I have indicated, that is a matter about which I would like to consult with RTE and come back and talk to the House again about it on Report Stage.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 22, after &ldquo;such functions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in respect of the carrying out of subsidiary activities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister discussed an amendment similar to this in the Seanad.  Section 8 empowers the Minister to assign to the Authority further functions beyond those which they already are empowered to carry out. Our belief is that in inserting this section any duties which the Minister deems necessary that the Authority should carry out should be of a subsidiary nature to those carried out at the moment.  As the Bill stands, it is quite evident that it would be possible for the Minister to ask the Authority to carry out other functions of a different nature altogether.  It is for this reason, and to be more precise, that we are putting forward this amendment.  I believe this amendment would improve the section and the Authority would know exactly where they stand.  At the moment I doubt if the Authority could understand what activities the Minister could request them to carry out.</P>

      <P>A similar amendment was debated in the Seanad as the Deputy is aware.  I indicated that I had some sympathy with the intention behind the amendment but I did not accept it at that stage.  There were two reasons for <Col N="1276" /> that, the second of which was really the decisive one.  First, I considered that the fears expressed regarding the excessively wide powers embodied in this section were perhaps somewhat exaggerated seeing that under subsection (3) a Minister proposing to make an order assigning additional functions to RTE would have to lay a draft of it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Either House could then prevent the making of the order by resolution passed within 21 sitting days.  I felt that the fears might be somewhat exaggerated.  I still would have been prepared to meet the point except that at that stage I was advised on the legal aspects that the amendment as drafted was not acceptable. I have, however, had the matter further examined in the meantime, especially in the light of the amendments tabled by the Deputy.  I have now been advised that no objection need be raised to the amendment on legal grounds.  Having regard to that, and in order to allay misgivings about the section&mdash;even though I may consider the misgivings somewhat exaggerated, still I have to accept that they are there&mdash;I am prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I thank the Minister for accepting this amendment.  Our reason for putting it down was not to impede the Minister, much less the Authority, but to find out more precisely where the Authority stood.  We wanted to find out exactly what duties the Minister had in mind.  I am sure the duties he will ask the Authority to carry out will be of a subsidiary nature.  I doubt very much if we would oblige them to carry out duties beyond their existing powers.  They will now know just what functions the Minister has in mind.  What kind of additional functions will it be necessary for him to ask the Authority to undertake from time to time under this section?</P>

      <P>In other sections the Minister is anxious, when taking decisions, that they should be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  To be consistent this draft should be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas before the order is made and after a given time.

      <P>I support what Deputy Fitzpatrick said.  Most people will agree that the laying of a draft before the Houses is a less active way of dealing with an order which is not likely to be accepted or to which any exception is taken.  I am influenced in favour of this amendment because it is not possible at any given stage to visualise what a Minister might feel should be additional activities by a broadcasting company.  Therefore, in my opinion, it should be a subject of discussion and approval by both Houses rather than the automatic laying of an order before the Houses and being passed after 21 days.  I do not think any Minister could tie himself <Col N="1278" /> down as to what additional activities an organisation like RTE could possibly carry out in future years.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that adequate protection against abuse should be provided and that is in line with general thinking in the Bill, as Deputies opposite said.  In relation to any particular matter, the question arises as to how restrictive and protective we ought to be, how serious the danger of abuse of a particular section, for example, may be. That does not seem to me to be very high in relation to this section.  I have thought the matter over and I consider the proposed amendment is unduly restrictive, considering what is involved here.  The need for a resolution of either House should arise, in my view, only if the House feel the order should not be made.  That provides inherently adequate protection against abuse of the section. Wherever there is this feeling, the House has the remedy.  That, in my view, is enough.  The wording of the subsection is not new.  For example, it is almost identical with that in the Transport Act, 1950, under which at least three subsidiaries have been set up by CIE.  I am afraid I cannot agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Perhaps the Minister would tell the House what the cable television companies are paying to the Department. It is quite right that they should contribute to the Authority and I should like to know from the Minister what is the sum involved.  I think it is calculated on the basis of a certain amount per house.</P>
      <P>The Authority have come in for a considerable amount of criticism with regard to increases in the licence fee and with regard to programmes.  The amount of money they receive will play a big part in the programmes they can offer and any deductions the Department make with regard to the collection of fees will have a bearing on the amount of revenue available to the Authority.  There is provision in a section to deduct expenses with regard to collection of certain fees.  To some extent I can see the point in that but I am not totally satisfied that the present deductions are justified and they are inhibiting the flow of cash to the Authority.  I am not sure how this can be got over but I should like to know what percentage of the licence fee is deducted before the moneys are transferred to the Authority.  I am informed that this is substantial.  It would have a bearing on the amount of money available to the Authority to carry out their work.  Has the Minister taken into consideration what has already been deducted?  Has the Minister considered any alternative way of collecting this money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was dealt with by the Broadcasting Review Commission. The Minister should investigate this and see if the deductions made are justified and if they can be reduced. <Col N="1282" /> The Authority do not seem to have any say with regard to the amount of money that should be deducted.  In criticising the Authority people will draw attention to the fact that they pay their licence fee annually but they do not bear in mind that the Authority are obligated to carry on with the money transferred to them by the Department.  The Authority should have a say as to how the cost of collecting licence fees could be reduced. They have a right to put forward any scheme which would reduce the cost of collecting these fees.  The views of the Authority should be taken into consideration because RTE are the sufferers if the system of collection is bad, not the Department, or the Minister.  I accept that the Minister must listen to a certain amount of criticism when the licence fee is increased but by and large it is the Authority who are involved.</P>
    <P>In this day and age we are all trying to economise and if it is found that the present system of collection is not efficient we should have a look at it. I believe suggestions were put forward that the fee could be collected, on an experimental basis at first, through ESB accounts.  Has the Minister teased out this possibility to see if the amount being deducted for collecting fees by the Department can be reduced? What percentage is contributed by the cable television companies and what percentage of the licence fees is deducted by the Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Fitzpatrick on the points he made with regard to the collection of licence fees.  On a number of occasions when I was connected with RTE I put forward some alternatives.  This question has been discussed over the past ten years and various methods of collection suggested including getting the ESB to collect the fee on behalf of RTE.  It strikes me that if this was a private enterprise economy and if the Post Office and the ESB were private enterprises the executives of one side would get in touch with the executives of the other side in an effort to collect the fees.  Something in excess <Col N="1283" /> of £500,000 is charged by the Post Office for collection of these fees, and that is a significant item but times are difficult and economies and efficiency are more mandatory now because we have so many State bodies. If it was a case of private enterprise it would respond to the discipline of efficiency more rapidly than State companies.  For that reason the Minister should take another look at that problem.</P>
      <P>There is the question of the portable set but I do not think there are many of them and I do not think the problem of collecting the fee in respect of those sets would be any different.  Certainly, it is not possible in the case of more than 99 per cent of television sets to run one unless one is paying an ESB bill.  Therefore, as with the hire-purchase system which the ESB employ in the sale of some electrical goods, there should not be much difficulty in collecting the licence fee through that system provided there was an effective arrangement between the two groups.</P>

      <P>Deputies Fitzpatrick and Brugha have raised a number of interesting points some of which I would like to consider at more leisure and some of which I have had occasion to consider a good deal over the years. One suggestion was that a different method of collection of the licence fee would benefit RTE.  That is not strictly so.  When licence fees are being increased the new fees are fixed at a level which will give RTE the increase in income which the Government consider they need and the Department's costs of collection.  If the cost of collection could be reduced, something we all think very desirable, the public, not specifically RTE, would be the beneficiaries. Of course, that is not a reason for not looking for economies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A number of queries were raised about the payment <Col N="1284" /> to RTE of net wired broadcast relay licence fee receipts which is provided for under clause (b) of section 9. Under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974, cable operators are required to pay an annual licence fee equivalent to 15 per cent of their rental receipts and so on from customers or £2 per year per household connected to the system where there is no identifiable income from the systems.  Net receipts from these licence fees amounting to £185,000 were paid over to RTE in 1975.  The thinking behind this system is that the extension of cable systems has reduced RTE's attractiveness as an advertising medium because of loss of viewers to BBC and UTV programmes, as Deputies and the public are aware. It seems only reasonable that those viewers who enjoy the benefit of cable systems should contribute towards the consequential loss of advertising revenue to RTE rather than that the full cost be borne by viewers generally.  The Broadcasting Review Committee recommended in their report that a levy should be paid by cable operators to compensate for the estimated loss of advertising revenue to RTE arising from the development of cable television. That recommendation was, generally speaking, implemented and, I believe, with general support here.</P>
      <P>The expenses deductible from the licence fee receipts before they are paid over to RTE, referred to at paragraphs (i) and (ii) of subsection (a) of the present section are identical with the provisions of the previous Bills, that is to say, the cost of collecting TV licence fees and the cost incurred by the Department in connection with the control of interference.  The former amounted to about £.63 million in a recent 12 months; the latter, which are really insignificant, are incurred mainly by RTE, dealing with the cases of interference with TV or radio reception in accordance with the statutory order made by the Minister under section 12 (A) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, inserted in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision at (iii) of subsection (a) is new, although not very significant. It provides for deduction from <Col N="1285" /> licence fee receipts of the costs of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to be set up under the Bill.  These are expected to be relatively insignificant. For example, the cost of the existing Complaints Advisory Committee has been estimated by RTE at about £250 during a recent 12 months.  As Deputies are aware, the members of the committee are not remunerated.  The possibility for the remuneration of the committee exists, but I have commented on that elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The question of RTE taking over collection work has been mentioned. RTE did request that responsibility for collecting licence fees be transferred to the Authority.  The Broadcasting Review Committee recommended that this be done.  Consideration of this matter has been deferred pending study of the possibility of securing more efficient licence fee collection by computerisation of the system.  A feasibility study of computer processing of licence fee collection was completed recently and indicates the possibility of fairly substantial savings, but the initial cost of implementation would be high.  The viability of the project is being studied at present.  There does not appear to be any guarantee that a body such as RTE could do the job of collection more cheaply than the Department.  A major drawback would be that they would not, under existing legislation, have access to the information about transactions in TV sets supplied by dealers under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>The question of collection by arrangement with the ESB has been mentioned, and that would be a very tempting idea.  It has been explored by the Authority and, as far as I know, rather informally with the ESB, but so far no proposals have come before me in relation to this matter.  However, I should like to assure the House that I am naturally concerned about the question of reducing collection costs. I am very anxious that anything that would result in economy in this area should be done, and I shall certainly take into consideration with my Department any suggestions that may be made in this House in this area.  I agree that these matters arise generally in <Col N="1286" /> relation to section 9, but I do not think they would require changes in section 9 as it stands.  However, we have covered the question of amendments.</P>

      <P>That is why I raised the point.  Here we are dealing with annual amounts which the Minister has to pay over to RTE.  RTE itself spend quite a lot of money warning people against what it would cost them to be caught without a television licence.  It seems remarkable, I had thought&mdash;and it was only some nagging doubt that prompted me to ask the question&mdash;that if I were brought to the district court for not having a television licence and I were prosecuted, usually the fine exceeds the amount of the licence.  The Minister in his reply told me that he on behalf of RTE does not get that fine, but I am wondering, if the fine is twice the licence fee.  Is there not an arrangement whereby whoever it is, the Department of Justice or the Paymaster <Col N="1289" /> General, who gets the money pays over at least the equivalent of the licence to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for transmission to RTE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the spirit of the Deputy's suggestion.  Needless to say, I would like if these fines went to either RTE or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but they do not at the moment.  I make the point that the payment of the fine does not relieve the person concerned of the duty to pay his licence fee.  Both the threat and the reality of the fine are a means of making the person concerned come to the point where he pays his licence fee, so in that respect RTE do benefit but the fines themselves do not come to my Department or to RTE.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I have little to add except to ask the Minister if he would look again at the system as regards collection.  It does seem rather a high percentage, the cost of £.63 million to collect the fees.  Of course, it is RTE who have to carry this burden.  The suggestion was put forward by the Authority, as the Minister stated that it could be collected through the ESB accounts.  If this is feasible and economical, the Authority should be given the right to carry out this collection.  Economies are important in every section and if the RTE Authority can effect economies along this line they should be allowed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the House, methods of cutting the costs of collection are under study at the moment and I hope to be able to report to the House at a later stage what the outcome of that study is.  I have no prejudice in favour of one way of collecting this more than another.  If I were satisfied that collection by RTE could cut the costs, I would go for that, or if agreement were reached with the ESB whereby that could be done, I would be very happy about that.

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Could the Minister give any idea as to what is the present financial situation where RTE borrowing is concerned?  I understand that the Authority were rather anxious that this section should have gone through about 12 months ago because that borrowing is confined.  I would like the Minister to inform the House through what channels RTE carries on their borrowings within the confines of what is in the 1960 Bill as to where they got the money over the past 12 months to expand and develop RTE 2.</P>

      <P>Section 10 amends section 23 (2) (b) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 and raises from £4 million to £15 million the limit on the amount the Minister for Finance may advance to RTE for capital purposes by means of repayable advances out of the Central Fund. The Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, set a limit of £2 million on the amount that may be advanced to RTE by means of repayable Exchequer advances. The limit was raised to £3 million by the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1964, and to £4 million by the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech on Second Stage of the Bill on 28th October, 1975, volume 285, No. 3 of the Official Report, columns 387, 388 and 389 I explained why it was necessary to provide for a large increase in the limit of the Exchequer advances that may be made to RTE by the Minister for Finance for capital purposes.  In 1975 and 1976 Exchequer advances totalling about £6 million have been approved for RTE.  They have estimated that in the five years 1975 to 1979 their capital requirement would amount to £14.7 million of which £5.4 million represents the cost of renewing the transmitter network for the existing TV services and providing the new transmitter for the second service.  It also includes £2 million for renewal and expansion of television production facilities and provision <Col N="1291" /> of regional studios, £1.5 million for improvement of coverage of the existing TV service, £2 million for renewal of miscellaneous TV and radio equipment and £3 million for miscellaneous works such as monitoring and control equipment, building improvement, radio coverage and so on.  Extra capital will also be needed for RTE 2.  The House will agree that it would be unreasonable to expect RTE to finance a programme of this magnitude from their own resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act came into operation on 1st April, 1975.  Between that date and 7th May, 1976, the number of applications made to court officers and received by the Master of the High Court for transmission to the reciprocating jurisdictions under the Act was 16.  Of these, 15 were for enforcement in England and Wales and the remaining one for enforcement in Northern Ireland. Statistics are not available as to any applications that may be at present before the District Court or in transit between the District Court and the Master of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No information is available as to the number of orders now successfully enforced as payments are made directly to the payees by the court officers in the reciprocating jurisdictions.  However, as the new Family Law Act provides for the transmission of maintenance payments through District Court <Col N="1301" /> clerks, it is expected that in future the great majority of such payments will be routed through the courts here. To that extent, the statistical information as to the level of compliance will be available in future.</P>

      <P>However, as I indicated in reply to a question on 21st May of last year the Act&mdash;of which only section 4 remains &mdash;is one of those that will come to be reviewed when other more urgent matters have been attended to.

      <P>Existing staffs employed by local authorities on health work were transferred to the health boards with effect from 1st April, 1971, not 1st October, 1970.  Direct comparisons between the situation which existed then and that which exists now have been complicated by the introduction, as from April, 1974, of a new grading structure for clerical and administrative staff in health boards and local authorities following agreement with the staff organisation concerned.</P>
      <P>The new structure is comprised of seven grades and has been introduced into all health boards with the exception of the Eastern Health Board where its introduction is still being discussed with the staff organisation concerned.  Subject to the limitations mentioned above, the information requested by the Deputy is given in three tabular statements which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In studying the tables it should be borne in mind that in general, only those engaged wholetime on the health services were transferred to the health boards.  Some additional appointments were needed to replace the part-time services of staff which remained with the local authorities. Additional staff was also needed to service new developments since 1971.</P>

      <P>Children's allowance books are issued to the post office of payment for collection by the payees, or, in the small number of cases where payment is made through a bank, direct to the payees themselves. The issue of renewal books containing orders payable from 6th April, 1976, was completed before that date.  However, I am aware that for a variety of reasons such as, in particular, failure to notify changes of address to my Department, books did not reach the payees in a number of cases.  As these cases come to light the position is rectified as quickly as possible.  If the Deputy is aware of any case in which a renewal book has not been received I will have the matter looked into without delay if he will let me have the details.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy and with the man he is speaking about but there is no trace in the Department's records of an application or of any correspondence in reference to it having been received prior to this date.  Normally forms are sent out within 24 hours of the receipt of the request.  The applicant was requested on 4th February to furnish details of his income and valuation to decide whether under new regulations he would qualify, but we have not received any reply from him.  Perhaps if he would complete that form we could see the way the story is before going any further.  If there is a hope of getting some type of evidence that he applied earlier we would consider it, but there is no question of attempting to prevent him from getting it.  The regulations preclude me from making an exception unless I get some evidence.</P>

      <P>I sent the application form, which was torn, in a letter in July, 1975.  As regards the second letter, the Minister says no application was received in December last. My information is that an application form was applied for in early December but the form was not received until January of this year.

There is not very much I can do.  The Deputy might ask him to complete the form he has and send it back anyway.  We have not heard from him since 4th February last.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why he granted planning permission for a petrol service station to a person (name supplied) in County Galway; and if he is aware that Galway County Council refused permission for the proposed station and that there are two petrol service stations, one on each side of the road, a very short distance away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this appeal against the decision of Galway County Council to refuse permission <Col N="1313" /> for the proposed petrol service station, regard was had to the evidence given at the oral hearing and the report of the person who conducted the oral hearing of the appeal.  As the erection of a petrol service station on this site was not considered to be in conflict with the proper planning and development of the area, it was decided to grant permission for the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two petrol stations less than 100 yards from the site, one on either side of the road.  Is this not contrary to the restrictive trade practice regulations of 1975, which prohibit further motor spirit stations being erected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the regulations the Deputy refers to. Restrictive practices legislation usually refers to the very opposite, to prevent somebody from trying to corner a market.  Having taken the advice of my experts and having given a decision, the decision is being challenged by somebody; if I had not taken the advice I would have been challenged by somebody else.  The situation in 1970, when the original refusal was given, has been radically altered through the grant of permission by the planning authority to the ESB for a depot on a site which surrounds the appeal site from the west and to the rear.  The depot is between the appeal site and the town.  The position has changed very much and in the changed circumstances the inspector said it would be unreasonable to regard the proposed use of the site as being injurious to residential amenities.  I know that traders, once in, do not like somebody else to start trading in the same commodity nearby. This, however, is not a good reason for refusing planning permission.  As the recommendation was that permission should be granted, I granted it and unless the local authority reverse it there is nothing I can do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the serious problem that exists in County Dublin, particularly in the Rathfarnham area, where large houses <Col N="1316" /> are being deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair prior to planning application for their conversion into or rebuilding as flats; and if he will indicate the steps he intends to take to prevent this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  Any problem of the nature described by the Deputy would, however, be for the local authority who have powers under the Housing Act, 1966, to secure the repair of houses which have become unfit for human habitation.  They also have the power under the Housing Act, 1969, to require the owner or any person having an interest in a house which has been deliberately allowed to become uninhabitable to make it habitable within a specified period regardless of its condition or the cost of repair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is difficult for the Minister or anybody else to be fully aware of problems such as these.  I should like to remind the Minister that there are a number of appeals in his Department at present for this area which apply very much to this position, where houses have been deliberately let run into disrepair for the purpose of planning applications being submitted for flat development in a residential area.  I would ask the Minister to take that point into account.  At present there are one or two planning appeals with him.  I would also remind the Minister that only recently he made a very controversial decision to grant planning permission for flat development in this area but that this decision was revoked at the meeting of Dublin County Council last Monday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>If the Deputy wishes a recent decision to be revoked, surely the obvious thing to do, if he feels so strongly, is (a) to make recommendation to me about the ones he feels are before me now and which require special attention and (b) if he is not satisfied, to ask to have them revoked. Again, it is a question of taking advice.  There are experts in the <Col N="1317" /> Department who advise me on those matters.

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture submitted an exactly similar scheme to that now being submitted by the IFA when that directive was first introduced?  Nobody seemed to listen to them but it is exactly the same plan.  Of course, I am glad to hear that the Minister will give this one serious consideration but it is exactly similar to that submitted by the elected representatives of that general council and, so far, they have heard nothing about it.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Callanan is correct in his assertion that nobody was prepared to listen to a recommendation from the general council of committees of agriculture.  That is not correct.  All recommendations received by the Department are considered on their merits, particularly ones from a body such as the general council of committees of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations from the general council of committees of agriculture and the IFA, of course, are helpful.  But the Department, of their own accord, were dealing with this matter also because they were aware that a review was needed, that it required some amendment.  As I have already mentioned, the recommendations from the IFA and the general council of committees of agriculture will be considered in conjunction with reports from Departmental advisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he has noted a report that chemicals produced by a reaction between wild clover and a fungus on a silage heap were responsible for the death of some cattle in County Leitrim; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report to which the Deputy refers. The research officer at my Department's regional veterinary laboratory at Sligo who carried out a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of one of the dead cattle and conducted other tests on the surviving animals, is satisfied that death was caused by internal haemorrhage due to the ingestion of some substance with anti-coagulent properties.  Whilst such a substance could be produced by the interaction of a certain strain of clover with silage fungus it cannot be confirmed, pending further investigation, that this was the source of the anti-coagulent in the present instance. I am advised that cases in which an anti-coagulent has developed in silage through the interaction of a clover and fungus are extremely rare and need not be a cause of alarm to stockholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any such reports but the Department's research officer visited this herd.  Of course, it was also inspected by the local veterinary officer who has submitted an interim report.  As I stated in the reply the Department have not reached positive conclusions. We are awaiting further reports.  However, it is pleasing to note that this is a very rare occurrence.  In actual fact, it is deemed, according to our advisers, a million to one chance <Col N="1322" /> happening.  The herd owner in question has got the benefit of the advice of one of the senior research officers of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries together, of course, with the advice of his own local veterinary adviser.  We will give him any advice that we possibly can.</P>

      <P>In relation to the assurances given by the British Government and the British Army that troops would not operate in civilian attire, has the Minister made any specific protest to the British Government in relation to this particular matter?  In relation to troops operating in uniform they are clearly identifiable but in relation to the question of the SAS operating in civilian attire, has the Minister made any particular reference to this aspect?  Could he state if the members of the SAS, who were recently apprehended, were in possession of pump type shotguns?

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I answer the question asked?  It is a serious one and deserves an answer.  This is a matter which has been of concern to the Government since they came into office and I believe it was one which arose and was of concern also to the previous Government.  There are obvious problems because of the nature of the Border.  I suppose it is inevitable that some unintended crossings should occur but the number of such crossings, however, certainly give rise to concern and we have had a series of assurances on a number of occasions when we raised the issue, not merely in relation to individual cases but generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16th April, 1973, we were assured that all UK security forces were given strict instructions not to violate the Border at any point; on 19th June, 1973, we were told that units on the Border had been reminded of the importance of strictly adhering to their orders and instructions; on 6th May, 1974, we were told instructions had been given to helicopter pilots when patrolling not to infringe on the Border; on 23rd April, 1975, we were told the British authorities regretted these incursions occurred and had taken further steps to try to ensure that all troops on the ground took the greatest personal care in respecting the Border with the Republic; on 6th June, 1975, we were told the British authorities were considering what new methods, for example, pending marks on roads, could be introduced to prevent Border incursions and all ranks were fully briefed to avoid incursions; on 3rd October, 1975, we were told that further instructions were being issued to the British Army about avoiding incursions; on 22nd March, 1976, in relation to a helicopter incursion, <Col N="1331" /> the Embassy expressed the unreserved regret of the British authorities and their desire to avoid any repetition; on 29th April, 1976, we were told everything was being done to prevent a repetition of incidents such as that which was then under discussion involving an incursion by two officers on 22nd February; on 7th May, 1976, we were assured everything possible was being done to prevent a recurrence and today I understand an official statement has been received from the British authorities saying that, while it is impossible for any Government to guarantee that human errors will not occur in future or that the Border will never be crossed inadvertently, the most clear instructions have been given and very recently reaffirmed by the GOC to prevent any recurrence.</P>
    <P>There has never been any question of any members of the British army conducting operations of any kind on the ground across the Border. Overflights take place with the knowledge and consent of the Irish authorities.  Deputies can see, therefore, quite apart from all the individual cases that have been raised, the number of occasions on which assurances of a more general kind have been sought and received.  The number of incursions, however, remains high and contrasts markedly with the number of incursions on our side.  We accept the inevitability of mistakes being made sometimes.  Our own Army make mistakes sometimes but the number of such mistakes are small.  The number of cases which have been reported to us by the British Government in relation to inadvertent crossings by our forces are six in 1973, ten in 1974, two in 1975 and four in 1976.  The contrast in the numbers of cases on our side and the other side does give rise to legitimate concern.  I think, and I can understand the feelings Deputies have in this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the debate I was adverting to an aspect of section 23 other than the matters on which Deputy Brugha and I have expressed considerable misgivings, namely, the provision in section 119 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  It seems <Col N="1334" /> to provide that a benefit in kind shall not arise under Chapter 3 of that Act in any case where the emoluments of an employee do not exceed £1,500 per annum.  I understand that limit was set in 1958 and that to up-date it to current money terms it would have to rise to a figure of approximately £5,000 per annum.  Will the Minister indicate if he has given any thought to the question of increasing that limit and, if so, with what result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that a benefit in kind is a benefit in kind irrespective of the level of salary of the recipient.  It should be measured according to its value to the person in receipt of it.  The figure of £1,500 was discussed in the seventh report of the Commission on Income Taxation which was published in 1962. If we are to apply provisions in an even-handed manner to all taxpayers there should be no specific limit.  We should not say that we will not look at benefits in kind if they are under a certain figure.  Benefits in kind could be so inflated as to be of far greater value than the nominal income received by people.  The proper thing to do is to look at the benefits in kind, to see what value they have and, putting all those things together, to see if a person is within a certain tax bracket and to tax him accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, logically should the Minister not propose the deletion of section 119 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to ensure that anyone in receipt of a benefit in kind is assessed with it whatever his income? Is that not the logic of the Minister's position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being asked to comment on a matter of logic and I saw that recently commentators spoke of me as being a logician.  One does not want to burden the administration with small cases, <i>de minimis non curat lex</i>.  That is the only argument in favour of a cut-off point.  As has been argued here, there is the danger if arbitrary limits are fixed that difficulties may be created.  At the moment the system is not overburdened with trivia and we have no reason to adjust the level at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we can take it from what the Minister has said that not alone has he no intention of increasing the £1,500 limit but that to the extent that the abolition or reduction of the figure would not create administrative problems he would favour the abolition or the reduction of that figure.  Is that a fair summary of the Minister's attitude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission recommended that the £1,500 limit be abolished.  The provision should apply even-handedly to all taxpayers and that is what I have urged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the operation of the section as drafted, I think the Minister received some submissions suggesting that where an inspector of taxes has come to an agreement with a person in relation to the benefit arising from the private use of a car supplied by the employer that such an agreement should be allowed to run its course, at least for the duration of the period of possession of the car in question. May I ask what view the Minister takes of this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once this Bill is passed the new provisions will apply, not anything that might have been arranged beforehand.  It is true that many compromises were reached in the past that were not to the entire satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners. They were reached because the burden of proof of the actual position did not justify any further labour in that direction but once the Bill is passed these new provisions will be applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any existing agreement would relate to accounts that were previously furnished.  Each one would come up for reconsideration when new accounts were furnished and new rules would apply.  It would be wrong to assume that because <Col N="1336" /> £X was allowed in 1974 that that would be the appropriate figure for 1975-76.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be arrangements in terms other than £X.  There might be arrangements in terms of a certain percentage being agreed as attributable to private use. Are we to take it that all such agreements and understandings are to be regarded as gone by the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The new rules will apply.  It would be wrong to assume that because a certain mileage was allowed in a previous year that it would be the appropriate figure for future years.  I know that it was a not uncommon practice to accept certain rules of thumb and to leave them unchanged for a long time but they were always open to challenge. From time to time they were challenged and when this happened there tended to be a certain amount of disputation.  We will be avoiding all of this by applying these formulae.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see that if the existing arrangements are to go by the board and if new rules are to be applied it reinforces the case we were making earlier that there is no administrative advantage in this section, that the demands that will be made on the staff of the Revenue Commissioners will almost certainly be increased if, in fact, all existing rules are gone by the board and new ones will now have to be worked out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that this is going to end all controversy or all debate.  It will not and of that there is no doubt.  All we are doing is laying down certain minima which must apply.  There may still be arguments as to the percentage use attributable to company use and that attributable to private use.  I anticipate that there would be less disputation once the minima are fixed in this Bill than operating a system which had no rules at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see that it is the introduction of minima that is, perhaps, the most questionable aspect of the entire section both in <Col N="1337" /> theory and in practice?  It is impossible, in theory certainly, to justify the introduction of minima in a case like this irrespective of the circumstances of an individual taxpayer's position. The only possible justification for doing so, and I do not regard it as a justification, is that there would be considerable benefit administratively but the Minister has just confirmed that, in fact, there cannot be an administrative benefit, certainly in the short term.  Therefore, we are thrown back on the theoretical basis for the introduction of minima which would apply irrespective of the circumstances of a particular taxpayer.  Does the Minister not see that in those circumstances the most objectionable feature of the section is being introduced without justification?  The only justification the Minister has claimed for it is that it will ease the burden and get rid of prolonged and protracted correspondence but it is now clear from what the Minister has told us that that will not happen.  What is the justification for applying to any taxpayer, no matter what the circumstances, the statutory minima laid down in this section?</P>

      <P>I was saying that the figures that have often been arrived at in the past are unrealistic in relation to the present day costs of motoring, including the cost of the capital acquisition of a car, its depreciation, insurance and tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but, in practice, the figures have kept well behind what would be the true value of the private use of a car.  Having regard to the fact that, by and large, the maximum use of a car on business purposes seldom exceeds ten hours per day&mdash;perhaps that is even too much in many cases&mdash; the small portion which we are attributing to private use is well below what I believe is the normal private use, even of a company car.  When one compares that with the colossal cost which is borne by people who have not a company car in relation to the provision of what they now have come to accept as a necessary facility for themselves and their families, <Col N="1338" /> it will be seen that this benefit in kind which we are charging in relation to company cars is comparatively small.  The person who has not a company car has to provide the total cost of motoring out of his post-tax income.  His income has to bear tax and it is only the residue which is available for these colossal costs.  The figure we have arrived at when one considers the cost of motoring today is considerably less than one-third of the average cost of motoring.</P>

      <P>We have pointed out <i>ad nauseam</i> that the circumstances differ with different taxpayers.  In some cases the position may be as the Minister outlined but in other cases the usage would be less while in other cases it would be more.  If one reasonable request can be made in regard to taxation of this kind, it is that the taxation being imposed should be related to the actual benefit in kind that is being obtained.  By definition, this section cannot achieve that because it applies minima.  To that extent it is a defective section. We have made the point as clearly as possible to the Minister and he seems determined to go ahead with the provision.  He should certainly not regard this section as adding to the achievement of equity in taxation because it is doing the direct opposite.</P>

      <P>In Britain, for instance, the figure for what I would regard as the normal company car here, this would be in the lower bracket, is £480 and not the £300 which we are suggesting.  That is on the basis of the cylinder capacity of the car and in relation to price it is something like £575.  Therefore, we are well below what has been fixed across the water.</P>

      <P>With due deference to the Minister, and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, that is totally irrelevant.  What is relevant is, should the taxpayer be taxed in relation to what he is receiving or should he not? Under this he cannot be taxed on the basis of what he is receiving and that is the whole point we have been making.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to bring into the tax charge credits applicable to British dividends which are now payable under the agreement between this country and the United Kingdom which was signed on 3rd June, 1975, and which extended for a further year the arrangements concerning dividends provided by the earlier agreement of 2nd May, 1973.  The credits will be those in respect of dividends payable on or after 6th April, 1975, and before 5th April, 1976.  As Deputies are aware, our double taxation arrangements with the United Kingdom required to be renegotiated following the introduction of the system of corporation tax here.  It is expected that the new convention will be signed shortly on behalf of both Governments.  The necessary draft order, for statutory confirmation of the convention, will be laid before this House for approval in due course.  Because the convention has not yet been signed it would be inappropriate to include the necessary consequential amending provisions in this year's Finance Bill although the revised arrangements will, in general, have effect as and from the current year.  The necessary amending legislation arising from the introduction of the new convention will be included in next year's Finance Bill to have effect as from 6th April, 1976, except in relation to remuneration where the operative date will be 6th April, 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I know it would vary, depending on the rates being paid, but in general the Minister might be able to give some idea.

      <P>My financial statement of 26th June, 1975, when I announced the employment premium scheme.  It is very hard to put a figure on all these.  To take the case of companies, the value would be double that as stated in the scheme itself.</P>

      <P>That should have been made known as widely as possible because the Minister would acknowledge that the scheme has not been as successful as anybody would like it to be.  If it is worth to many companies £24 a week per employee employed under the scheme as against £12 a week it might be more attractive. To that extent, anyway, it is worthwhile drawing attention to the value of the tax-free nature of the premium.  Whether this is the right way to do it is another matter as is whether the premium ought not to be fixed at £24 a week and then tax charged.  It could be argued, certainly on the basis of the arguments <Col N="1342" /> frequently put forward by the Minister, that it is better that the cost of all these things be seen and that people should pay tax on the basis of what they receive, and that one should get rid as far as possible of tax-free arrangements.  On that basis the correct approach should be to pay the gross and to charge tax.  However, I am not quarrelling with it.  I merely point out a certain inconsistency on the part of the Minister in approaching the treatment of these employment premiums in the way envisaged in this amendment which is to provide them tax-free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy said.  We might have got a better return from it if we had given payments of £24 and subjected them to tax.  The £24 might have looked more attractive than £12, but I would say most employers would be sensible enough to appreciate that after tax is taken into account these contributions are worth £24.  If we had given £24 and taken back £12 it would have led to a certain amount of irritation. However, the Deputy is right to draw attention to it and I am grateful to him for doing so if it helps to make more people interested in the operation of the scheme.</P>

    <P>and the said definition of `accounting period', as so amended by subsection (1) (a) (i), is set out in the Table to this subsection.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE.</P>
    <P>`accounting period', in relation to a company, means an accounting period determined in accordance with the provisions of section 54 of the Finance Act, 1920, which ends on a date in the period from the 6th day of April, 1973, to the 5th day of April, 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> (2)  A company shall not be entitled to a deduction by virtue of subsection (1) (a) in respect of an assessment unless it makes a claim before&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the date on which the assessment becomes final and conclusive, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the expiry of the period of six months beginning with the date of the passing of this Act,</P>
    <P>whichever is the later.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is obviously rather long and technical, but its purpose is quite simple.  It is to extend for an additional year the relief for companies in respect of increases in stock value which was provided by section 31 of the Finance Act, 1975.  Relief was given for corporation profits tax purposes in respect of accounting periods ended on a date in the period from 6th April, 1973 to 5th April, 1975 and for income tax purposes in respect of the years 1974-75 and 1975-76.</P>
    <P>The extension of the relief for another year means that it will apply for the accounting periods ending in the year from 6th April, 1975, to 5th April, 1976, and it is necessary therefore to apply the relief for purposes of corporation tax.  This is what makes the section so complex.</P>
    <P>Relief has also been extended for income tax and for corporation profits tax purposes so as to cater for new cases in which the commencement provisions would apply.  For example, a company commencing business on, say, 1st June, 1975, which would be chargeable to income tax on the actual basis for 1975-76 and which is entitled to stock relief would so claim for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the new subsection (8) provides in effect that the relief granted for the additional year represents a deferral of tax and not a forthright remission.  This is achieved by providing that the opening stock for the following period of account or year of assessment would be the closing stock as reduced for the purposes of relief for the previous <Col N="1354" /> accounting period or year of assessment. The effect of this would be that if the stock relief were discontinued as from 1977-78 and no further provision made, the relief granted in 1976-77 would be recovered in 1977-78.</P>
    <P>I am not at this stage anticipating what the policy decision may be next year, but I considered that as it is possible that we may be in a different position by then from what we are now and have been in the last few years, it would be proper to, as it were, put down a marker as to the possibility that there might be a variation.  Indeed, this is in keeping with advice which has already been extended to the business community by their own tax advisers.  It is the prudent thing to do in present circumstances pending consideration of the situation later on.</P>

      <P>Can I take it that the effect of subsection (8) is that if the relief were to be terminated next year a company concerned would receive the relief for two years in the form of remission of tax and for the final year in the form of a deferral, so that in effect there would be two years' remission?  Is that the correct interpretation?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. I am somewhat mystified, and I think other people are too, as to what exactly is going on in regard to this relief.  I would like to recall to the Minister that when it was introduced first I drew attention to the fact that the explanatory memorandum issued with the then Finance Bill referred to the relief as a deferral, whereas the Bill itself did not and dealt with it as an actual remission.  We now find that the Minister is providing for this third year as a possible deferral, leaving the option open as to whether it will be treated in that way. Presumably the options open to the Minister would be to treat the third year as a further remission, to treat it as a deferral or to continue the scheme so that, in effect, the third year would be a remission and give a <Col N="1355" /> fourth year as a deferral, or keep the deferral option still open with the third and fourth years ranking as deferrals for the moment.  There are a number of possibilities as to what might happen in this regard.  Deputy de Valera referred to this and adverted to the difficulties being created in accounts as to how exactly the provision in this regard should be treated in the accounts.</P>
      <P>There were some companies whose accounts were produced before it was announced that this would be a deferral provision and who treated it, in fact, as a remission as they were entitled to do until this was announced. Other companies whose accounts have been prepared since and are being prepared now have to treat it differently. This is to say the least an unsatisfactory situation.  It would be appreciated not only in this House but by many people outside if the Minister could throw any light on why there is this apparent confusion about this.  It occurred in the beginning when the explanatory memorandum referred to it as a deferral and the Bill treated it as a remission.  Now that it has been established as a remission we are told that it is being treated as a deferral for the third year but no decision has been made as to whether it will be treated as a deferral in due course.  Deputy de Valera adverted to a rumour where it was suggested that the reason for the latter confusion was that some exploitation or misuse of the relief had come to light and that the Minister was trying to cover that situation.  The Minister assured us that to his knowledge no such thing had occurred. That makes the matter even more difficult to understand.  I invite the Minister to throw some light on the reasons for this confusion attending the introduction of this relief and now its continuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why the word &ldquo;confusion&rdquo; is applied to it.  It is not really a confused situation.  When it was introduced in 1975 we were dealing with a totally new situation and we responded to a plea that was made in relation to the pecuniary <Col N="1356" /> difficulties of 1974-75.  Pending further and better consideration, it was decided to treat it as a deferral.  The circumstances at that time were such that one could not seriously contemplate obtaining a refund of this deferred tax in the immediately following years.  As of now we consider that the time has come to take a new look at this whole question of stock relief.  The accountancy profession are concerned with devising some different way of dealing with it, and I would consider, in that fluid situation it would be wrong to continue present arrangements without looking forward to the possibility of changes in them.  Because there may be a change I am not making a decision at this stage.  I want to hear what the accountancy profession have to say and I want to study the position now and throughout this year.  I thought the best thing to do was to indicate that we would treat this relief as a deferral.  The effect of that could be that firms may not distribute the money arising out of this relief pending clarification of the position. Having regard to present circumstances that is a desirable thing.</P>
      <P>I hope that my explanation has indicated why we had not got finality in relation to our attitude when I first announced it and considered it desirable to announce it in the budget of 1975 in order to give assurances to businesses so that they would know where they stood.  The Finance Bill made it clear that the relief was even better than what was announced in the budget.  I consider that the time has now come to give an indication that this position needs to be reconsidered. This may lead to a quickening of thought on the issue, not merely by the official side but also by the accountancy bodies and firms that have benefited from the relief that has already been given.  We will have enough time to consider the most appropriate way to deal with it in the next Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the implication of what I said about some firms having prepared their accounts before the announcement of treating this as a deferral and in their accounts treating it as a remission and, therefore, an addition to their profits, whereas other firms, in the same line of business, perhaps competing, prepared their accounts after the announcement and so cannot treat the amount involved as part of their profits?  Consequently there can be a serious difference, say, in the case of quoted companies regarding the appearance of their balance sheet <Col N="1358" /> and the effect on the price of their shares, all arising out of the way the accounts were prepared and prepared correctly in the light of the information available at the time but each being subject, presumably, to the same provisions ultimately of the Finance Bill.  One gets a different result with a possible difference in the price of shares in the companies concerned as a direct consequence of the confusion to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>There are implications in this which ought to concern the Minister.  If the Minister decided that the relief should be given for a further year it would be possible to give that relief and if at the end of that year he thought sufficient had been given he could then either discontinue the relief or treat it as a deferral for another year.  At that stage what was happening would be clear but now it would appear that remission has been given for two years.  For the third year it may be deferral or it may be remission.  In other words it is not necessary for the Minister to treat the matter as he is treating it in subsection (8) in order simply to keep open his options unless he is trying to keep open the option of charging the tax and not giving the relief for the present income tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is one of the options he is keeping open, I would suggest that it is both unrealistic and unwise.  It is unrealistic because if one has regard to the present economic situation and to the level of inflation, the need for this relief, if it ever existed, and it existed very much, will exist clearly during the present year.  That is why I say it is unrealistic to think in terms of the relief not being given in this year but it is also unwise to keep open the possibility of recovering the tax for this year which, so far as I can see, is what the Minister is doing.  That is unwise when he knows that there will be no such recovery but what he is doing is having an effect on the accounts of various companies apart from the effect it will have on individual traders who are being brought in by the provision. I applaud their being brought in.  It is something that I urged strongly when the relief was proposed but the situation that arises now is very unsatisfactory <Col N="1359" /> because of the uncertainty it generates.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he was keeping open his options because one did not know how things would progress but I suggest that in the light of the performance of our economy this year and the level of inflation that we are enduring, an inflation rate which, as has been shown in the recent OECD report, is the highest so far this year for any developed country in the world, it does not make sense to say it is possible that the situation will change so much that for this year we might not give this relief and treat it simply as a deferral.  It is not realistic to talk in those terms so why create this confusion and this problem in regard to how the sum involved is to be treated in accounts?  If at the end of this year the situation had so improved that the Minister would consider seriously abolishing the relief in respect of next year, there is nothing to prevent him from doing so either by simply terminating it or by treating it as a deferral for next year.  It is not realistic to contemplate either termination or deferral for the present year so that all that is being achieved is confusion and difficulty in some cases without any real basis for it.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances that obtain I urge the Minister to amend the Bill, in particular subsection (8), in order to make it crystal clear that the relief will operate for this year as a remission and nothing else.  The Minister will not lose anything by doing that because he will be committed to it anyway.  There is nothing to be gained by his approach but there is a considerable amount to be gained generally if the position is clarified and if this question mark is not left hanging over this relief preventing the real benefit of it from being obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that the benefit was intended for companies and not to enable companies to distribute larger dividends.  In many cases the moneys have resulted in bigger profits and the distribution of larger dividends. Were I to accept the Deputy's suggestion, it would lead to a situation of a <Col N="1360" /> sudden cut-off next year without any forewarning.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At all times commentators have said that since this provision might not last it could be treated as a deferral.  It would be good for companies that moneys would be kept within them pending clarification of this issue.  Far from being against profits I am anxious that profits be stimulated because the more profit there is the more investors we have and since investment involves postponement of current expenditure and, therefore, sacrifice it deserves to be rewarded adequately. This relief is provided for companies with peculiar difficulties of having very high stocks at a time of recession when they were unable to dispose of them so that inflation had changed their value and caused problems relating to their replacement.  Those circumstances are not quite those which operate today but by and large the situation can rectify itself during the next year and so enable a proper decision to be made in relation to the the Finance Bill of 1977.  Interestingly enough, as far as I can recall, we have not received significant representations in relation to this section which seems to indicate that the business community has more or less accepted it.  Of course, silence cannot be presumed to be consent, as lawyers know.  I am not saying that that means that everybody is entirely happy with it but I think we are taking a reasonable course and we have given a fair indication that the situation may call to be reviewed next year.</P>

      <P>Sorry, Sir, there is one other matter about which I want to ask the Minister.  It is difficult to find the reference in the amendment.  Perhaps I might put it this way, the portion of the amendment appearing at the bottom of page 6 and the top of page 7 sets out the categories of business entitled to reap the benefit of this relief.  Might I ask the Minister the nature of representations he may have received for the inclusion of certain categories of business not included in this and what attitude he has taken to them?  My recollection is that there were some sectors which had a very strong case for inclusion but, up to now, they were not included and do not appear, from the wording of this portion of the amendment, to be included now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I have not to hand any of those representations. As far as I can recollect, there was no great volume of them.  I think we have not omitted any really significant sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one sector which sought it was the garage industry, as distinct from the motor assembly industry, on the basis that they carried, and do carry, very heavy stocks, heavy in the sense of the financial cost which they must pay as they draw stocks from the assemblers. Those stocks have increased very considerably in price, perhaps more so than the average increase in prices. The effect of their operations, while not exactly manufacturing in many cases, is very close to it and certainly is very much tied-up with manufacturing operations.  I know they are <Col N="1362" /> one group who sought to be included in the relief.  I know also, as indeed does the Minister, that due to the actions of the Minister himself, under the headings of tax on petrol, increases in VAT, road tax and other activities of his, they have been subjected to very severe pressure.  I know they are one sector which would certainly wish to be included in this relief but who are not so included.  I do not know whether the Minister recalls receiving any representations in that regard.</P>

      <P>They had indeed and I should have recollected it.  But, of course, car manufacturers have already received this relief.  I am not making any assertion now.  I am saying there is a possibility that a number of traders had cars in stock in the last year or so for which they were not required to pay cash at the time of receiving them into stock because it was a matter of convenience for the assemblers and importers of cars to have the cars distributed and held on the premises of others, as opposed to being on their own premises.  Of course, they may well have been reflected in the stock of the manufacturers themselves.  Here I am just making a general comment and not presuming to pass judgment.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will recall, we deliberately tuned this relief to the categories mentioned in the new section, which were the productive sectors of the manufacturing industry, the construction industry, the farming industry and the sale of plant or machinery.</P>

      <P>Of course, there is no budgetary taxation proposal that is not looked at in relation to its cost by way of revenue foregone.  Revenue may be foregone if it achieves a worthwhile economic objective which is more beneficial than the cost of revenue foregone.  A number of areas were omitted because of the speed of turnover which, therefore, did not generate any great difficulty.  We related it to these areas because they were areas in which we wanted to maintain production so as to avoid the possibility of bottle-necks once recession ended.  We wanted industry to keep ticking over to build up stocks which could respond to demand when demand itself picked up.  Of course, like any other tax relief, we would not have been in a position to extend it to all.  I think we were right to choose those where it seemed to be most advantageous and necessary and not to extend it to those who were not suffering the cash flow problems to the same extent being experienced at the production end.  The distributive end could, and did indeed, adjust their purchases in relation to demand, which is often more immediately and conveniently ascertained than the demand of manufacturers who have to anticipate much further ahead.  They have to buy in their stocks far ahead in anticipation of demand and then produce, all of which would take much longer than the actual process of bringing finished articles into stock, and then selling them.  That is the only reason.  I do not say it was a perfect division.  I think the areas we selected were the right ones and the others did not need relief to the same extent.</P>

The point the Minister made about distributors where it relates to internal trade is of concern and I urge him <Col N="1364" /> to keep an eye on that during the coming period because the cycle of inflation is still with us and the effect of lower orders from distributors can have a cyclical effect on manufacturers.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I had hoped the Minister would bring some type of equality into the tax code.  He said that if manufacturers are allowed this concession it should not be carried into the distributive trade.  They are two separate things and to my mind they would both be entitled to be put on the same basis.  It is given to manufacturers because there is a build up of stock.  This all came about due to massive inflation.  We know there is an enormous amount of stock and this can also apply to the distributive trade.  It is now worth more than 25 per cent above what it was purchased for.  If there is justification for granting it to manufacturers I do not see why it should not be given to the motor trade and other distributors. We know this type of profit is fictitious.  There are very large retailers in this town carrying stocks worth as much as £1 million.  It is that £1 million that goes into their audit.  In that kind of business there is no large cash inflow as there is in the licensed trade and in hotels where there is a turnover of goods every two months.  Certain large retailers would have stock lying for 12 to 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree this concession is of great help to the people to whom it has been <Col N="1365" /> extended but I suggest it should be extended further.  Deputies Colley and Brugha made points about the motor traders and such people who do not have a quick turnover.  It is unfair to try to pick out a few as the Minister has done.  I am not suggesting they should not be given the concession, but it should be extended to all.  It is not their fault that inflation has reached its present level&mdash;it is the fault of the Minister and the Government.  That is why the Minister had to come in and do something about it and what he is doing will create havoc among certain traders.  Cash inflow is very important today and with inflation expected to run at 18 to 20 per cent this type of section will have to stay in the legislation for some time and it should not be confined as the Minister has done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 25, before section 27, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;27.&mdash;Section 54 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>`(4) (a) &ldquo;Goods&rdquo; in this section shall not include goods sold to the agency whether or not the goods are exported out of the State.</P>
      <P>(b)  &ldquo;The agency&rdquo; in paragraph (a) means the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries when exercising or performing any power or function conferred on him by Regulation 3 of the European Communities (Common Agricultural Policy) (Market Intervention) Regulations, 1973, and any other person when exercising or performing any corresponding power or function in any member state of the European Economic Community.'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment disallows export sales for relief in respect of all sales into intervention.  At present sales into intervention, where the goods are sold here, do not qualify for the relief since the goods are not exported out of the State by the selling company.  However, some Deputies have pointed out that there can be an anomaly in relation to such <Col N="1368" /> sales depending on whether they are delivered into intervention here or, at the request of the intervention agencies, sent to the United Kingdom into an intervention store there.  In the latter case they would fortuitously qualify as export sales.  Apart from the anomaly, it would be contrary to EEC policy. The State provides an incentive for sales into intervention and such sales should, and will now, be totally excluded from the relief.</P>
    <P>The export sales relief provisions, as now incorporated in Part IV of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, provide for relief from tax in respect of the profits from the export sale of goods manufactured in the State.  Section 58, which is the relieving section, requires the company claiming the relief to prove <i>inter alia</i> that goods were in the course of trade exported out of the State.  Of course, the purpose of giving the relief is to provide the stimulus for effort to promote genuine exports.</P>
    <P>Under the common agricultural policy of the European Communities provision is made by way of regulations whereby in relation to certain products the European Economic Community will purchase their products at a fixed price as and when the products are offered to the Community by the producer.  In each member state an agency of the Community exists, known as the intervention agency, which purchases and stores products on behalf of the Community.  In Ireland the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is the Community's agency for intervention purposes.</P>
    <P>In the case of sales by companies of Irish manufactured products into intervention in the State the commissioners have ruled that the export sales relief provisions do not apply.  If, however, such firms have sold into intervention to be stored abroad and if the sale is made on the footing that title to the products does not pass to the intervention agency until they have been exported out of the State, the commissioners consider that as the products would have been exported out of the State in the course of trade albeit with the intention of going into intervention elsewhere a claim to export sales relief could not be resisted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> This is clearly an anomaly.  It was referred to during the course of the debate on the Corporation Tax Bill by Deputy O'Malley.  In order to rectify the anomaly the law is being amended to provide that export sales relief will not apply to such sales.  I think the case rests on the purpose for which the export sales relief was provided in the first instance, that is, to promote genuine sales, to encourage people to find markets abroad for Irish products. It would be quite contrary to the purpose for which relief is provided were the relief to be provided irrespective of whether or not an effort was being made to genuinely promote sales from Irish to foreign markets, hence the need for the change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What is happening is that a person selling the goods may arrange for an agent in Britain <Col N="1370" /> to accept title to the goods and then immediately put them into intervention. As the materials left this country, it was known by all concerned that they were going into intervention.  The only reason they were going into store elsewhere was that they had not enough storage accommodation here but by putting in an intermediary they were able to claim export sales relief although it was not genuine export to a market which would be available to this country.  It was simply abusing the convenience of intervention.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> If it was genuinely put into intervention with a view to exporting it in the next six or eight months?  I think much of it was put into intervention because there was no proper storage space on the Continent.  The Minister is talking about finding markets for such things as dairy products which is a different thing.  You cannot go into the open market in Europe and look for intervention. This is an EEC regulation.  The Minister is talking of encouraging people in this line to sell agricultural produce such as beef on the open market which is a most difficult thing to do. If there is a glut of cattle on the market, they cannot be sold and we cannot find retail outlets in Europe. Will it not then be necessary to put it into intervention?  Otherwise, the price would drop completely unless there is some provision here&mdash;perhaps I am wrong.

      <P>The purpose of export sales relief is to encourage people to find markets.  That is its function and from Arabia to China there are markets to be found and the reward should be given to those who find markets, not to those who put goods into intervention which is not an export market.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> If you put goods into intervention in England or Belgium or France, would that qualify?  The case Deputy O'Malley was making was that it should because it is an export in that sense.</P>

      <P>No.  Technically it is not.  The export agent is the Irish Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. He may have stores somewhere or other but the intervention agency of the EEC as far as these goods are concerned is the Irish Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <P>What about Deputy Brugha's question as to how you know what will happen in the case of goods like these being sold to some agent in Britain?  At least, the ownership transfers to somebody in Britain and the goods eventually go into intervention.  How do you know when you look at the transaction between the exporter here and the agent in <Col N="1374" /> Britain that ultimately the goods will end up in intervention so that the relief should not apply?</P>

      <P>In order to get relief the applicant has to produce an auditor's certificate as to the destination of the goods and on that the Revenue Commissioners make their determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has an agent in Britain, can he not then produce a certificate that the destination of the goods is a certain address in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I agree, may be difficult to trace but the Revenue Commissioners have their own ways of ascertaining the actual exporter and the ultimate destination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us what was intended but looking at the amendment I am not sure that it is being achieved.  It appears that the effect of the amendment is to define that goods to which the relief will attach will not include goods sold to the intervention agency whether or not they are exported outside the State, but if the kind of situation arises that the Minister has described, where there is an agent in Britain to whom ownership of the goods is transferred, it seems that this amendment will not prevent that person operating in that way and the relief being obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We look at the destination of the goods leaving Ireland.  The relief goes to the exporter of goods.  If he is exporting them to what <i>prima facie</i> is a foreign market he gets relief.  If he is exporting to intervention he does not.  There may be a weakness in the chain of events in that he uses some intermediary elsewhere but, as of now, once the exporter is sending them physically out of the country even though into intervention, a claim is made that he is entitled to relief simply because they are physically going out of the country.  That was never intended and that is why we are moving the amendment.</P>
