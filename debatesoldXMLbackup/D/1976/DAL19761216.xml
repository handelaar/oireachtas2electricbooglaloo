    <Title>Protection of Employment Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will apply to all persons in employment in firms normally employing more than 20 persons. The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that employees faced with job loss as a result of impending redundancies receive prior notification as well as being consulted by their employer. The employer contemplating collective redundancies must enter into prior consultation with the representatives of the employees concerned. These consultations must be commenced at the earliest opportunity but at least 30 days before the first <Col N="902" /> dismissal.  It is envisaged that the consultation which must take place would be on the basis of information which the employer will supply in regard to</P>
    <P> (1)  the reasons for the proposed redundancies,</P>
    <P>(2)  the number of employees proposed to be made redundant,</P>
    <P>(3)  the number of employees normally employed, and</P>
    <P>(4)  the period during which it is proposed to effect the proposed redundancies.  </P>
    <P>A further obligation devolves on the employer to notify me so that opportunity is given to arrive at solutions with assistance of existing agencies like the National Manpower Service either to find alternative jobs or, indeed, redeployment within the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I would like to say at this point that the requirements specified in the Bill will assure the employee of forward information and consultation in circumstances of impending redundancies which are no more than most good employers accept voluntarily now.</P>
    <P>Employers with good relations with their employees accept that a structural change in their enterprise which may lead to job loss for certain categories should be the subject of prior consultation with representatives of employees.  Regrettably there have been exceptions to this majority practice of employers.  Employees with many years of service in a particular firm have found themselves at the receiving end of a 48 hour notice that their jobs were gone.  Admittedly, in these circumstances individual employees may have legal redress under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 which we passed here in 1973 and which provides that an employee is entitled after 13 weeks of employment to a week's notice of impending dismissal.  His entitlement to notice rises progressively to eight weeks after 15 years of employment.  The point remains that as a body employees were in a minority of instances admittedly treated in the harsh manner I have mentioned.  By means of this Bill I hope to see consultative <Col N="903" /> practices which exist in most employments extended throughout our industry.</P>
    <P>Redundancies will continue to occur in periods when unemployment is a less acute social problem than it is now in all EEC countries.  Collective redundancies occur for many reasons and will happen in times of prosperity as well as recession.  In some cases, firms which have to reduce or discontinue their activities because of reduced demand for their products are compelled to make a corresponding reduction in their work force.  In other cases, dismissals may arise from technical progress in techniques of production or following mergers or concentrations of businesses.  The point is that our industry must evolve procedures for dealing with redundancies which are humane, which respect the employee and which minimise hardship to him.</P>
    <P>The best redundancy procedures involve a fully articulated scheme, worked out long before the event, between management and the unions concerned.  Such procedures would oblige management to give early warning of forthcoming redundancy based on an adequate company manpower planning programme and to enter at the same time into consultation with the employees' representatives concerning details.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposals of this Bill by laying down compulsory guidelines for management, will contribute towards the spread of good practices. Essentially the current proposals aim at reconciling the employers' freedom of management and the employees' stability of employment by respecting the interests of both parties, and introducing into the management's right of dismissal in the work situation where redundancy is inevitable the concept of prior notification and consultation. Hopefully this will reduce the adverse social consequences for the employees and their families.  The legislation will in no way hamper the ability of an enterprise to adapt speedily to economic, structural, technical and market changes.  If this were otherwise, the very existence of the <Col N="904" /> enterprise and the continued employment of all who remain in it would be endangered.  I have already provided in previous legislation protection for legal rights of the individual employee in the Redundancy Payments Acts and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.  These individual rights of the employee will be further buttressed when the Anti-Discrimination (Unfair Dismissals) Bill, which is at Committee Stage in the House, becomes law.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the entitlements under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.  Under the Redundancy Payments Acts, an employee is entitled to two weeks' notice in writing before being made redundant. These Acts, however, apply only to employees between the ages of 16 and 70 who have been in continuous employment for two years with the same employer and who are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  However, under the Protection of Employment Bill all employees, irrespective of length of service or of age are included in the proposed consultation procedures.</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Payments Acts already referred to do not provide for consultation prior to redundancy. Neither do they decide who shall be selected for redundancy or when they shall be dismissed or how the redundancies shall be phased.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, sections 8 and 9 provide that in future an employer who is contemplating collective redundancies must consult beforehand with the representatives of the employees concerned with a view to reaching agreement.  These prior consultations should be based on prescribed information supplied by the employer and must cover the possibilities of avoiding redundancies proposed.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated on consultations between employers and employees. I have also provided in sections 11 and 12 that an employer must give me advance notice in writing of the proposed collective redundancies. I am taking power to prescribe by regulation the particulars to be included in this notification of the employer. Within 21 days of the first <Col N="905" /> notification to my Department, I will require a written report stating whether or not agreement has been reached in the consultations with employee representatives.</P>
    <P>Collective redundancies shall not take effect earlier than 30 days after notification to my Department.  During that time, the employer will be expected to co-operate as far as possible with officials of the Department in trying to alleviate the adverse effects of the proposed collective redundancies.</P>
    <P>I should clarify what is meant by a collective redundancy.  For the purposes of the Act a collective redundancy would be taken as occurring where during any period of 30 consecutive days, the number of proposed redundancies is:</P>
    <P> (a)  at least five in establishments normally employing more than 20 but less than 50 persons,</P>
    <P>(b)  at least ten in establishments normally employing between 50 and 100 persons,</P>
    <P>(c)  at least 10 per cent of the number of employees in establishments normally employing between 100 and 300 persons, and</P>
    <P>(d)  at least 30 in establishments normally employing 300 or more persons. </P>
    <P>Under the enforcement provisions of the Act, it will be an offence for an employer not to advise employee representatives and my Department of impending collective redundancies, not to supply all relevant information or not to hold the necessary consultations. It will also be an offence to effect the collective redundancies within the prescribed delay period of 30 days.  Substantial fines can be imposed on conviction by the courts for any of these offences.  The employer will also be obliged to keep for at least three years records showing that the provisions of the Act are being complied with in relation to his employees.  Authorised officers of my Department will have powers of inspection and investigation for the purposes of enforcement of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill conforms to views put forward on behalf of the Irish delegation <Col N="906" /> at the Council of Ministers meeting in December, 1974, which adopted the EEC directive on harmonisation of the legislation of member states relating to collective redundancies.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view on that occasion to my colleagues of the other EEC countries that the directive to be adopted should apply to five dismissals in firms employing between 20 and 50 employees.  I did not succeed on that occasion in obtaining a majority agreement for that proposal and, therefore, the final agreed EEC directive applied only where there are ten dismissals. I consider that a minimum of five dismissals in a firm with between 20 and 50 employees relates more to our conditions in contrast to the terms of the directive.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill, when enacted, will be brought into operation by ministerial order.  It is my wish that the Bill should pass through the House as quickly as possible and become law very soon.  I believe that this legislation will be welcomed by all Deputies and I accordingly commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again we are here on our weekly sprint.  In recent weeks we have been getting for one hour or one and a half hours part of one of the many Bills before the House.  I will not criticise that operation again this morning but I believe it would be better for the Minister, his Department and the House if these Bills were taken in ordered procedure where one's thoughts could be directed to each Bill in turn and see it through to a proper conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; has unfortunately become a household word in recent years.  It causes fear, concern and apprehension to many workers at a vulnerable time of their lives.  We have all experienced among our friends and relations the body blow which mass redundancies can deal to a community. The smaller the community the bigger the blow and that applies to redundancies in cities, towns or villages.  In my constituency I have seen many redundancies under this Government.  Why has it taken so long for this Bill to be introduced?  In my <Col N="907" /> opinion the Department of Labour are becoming a fire brigade service, they introduce these measures in the nick of time.  They have still not introduced the most important measure, the extension of the premium employment programme which will provide more jobs after 8th January.  We were told this morning by the Taoiseach that the Dáil will not resume until 25th January.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to understand why it has taken 22 months for this Bill to reach Second Stage.  A directive on which this Bill is based was signed in February, 1975.  May I say how proud we are as a party that it was Commissioner Hillery who initiated this programme?  It is to his credit that at last the benefits to be derived from that directive are being introduced. Why has it taken so long to introduce this Bill implementing that directive which was signed by the Minister for Finance in his capacity as President of the council?  It was to have been circulated before last weekend and to have been taken on Tuesday.  However, it has taken 22 months since the issuing of the directive to bring it to the House and it has to be passed by both Houses before some date in February.</P>
    <P>We on this side will co-operate in the passage of the Bill, but we regard it as unfair and blooming bad management on the part of the Government that it has come before us so late.  Look at the serious consequences of the long delay.  In December 1974 the unemployment figure stood at 81,000.  Today the figure is more than 110,000&mdash;30,000 fewer jobs.  I submit that even under this dreadful Coalition Government there has not been a worse situation in any two-year period, and if there were to have been benefits gained from this measure they could have been given to workers during that two-year period if this Bill had been enacted when it should have been.</P>
    <P>Now, in typical Coalition style, it has been brought before us on the last day before the Christmas recess in order to provide the Government with propaganda, just as Aire na Gaeltachta, <Col N="908" /> in introducing two Bills this morning, provided himself with a talking point over the Christmas.  Now we have the Minister for Labour introducing legislation to protect workers' rights.  It is part of the Government method of bringing legislation before us.  We were supposed to have this Bill yesterday but it comes before us this morning.  The Government have been bringing legislation to the House in bits and pieces instead of producing an organised ordered procedure by which we could sit down and take these measures one by one and tease them through to finality.  But of course there would not be any publicity in that.</P>
    <P>This directive was introduced by Commissioner Hillery and the draft was signed in February, 1975.  This Bill is mainly in line with the terms of the directive but it has some questionable sections in regard to which one would have fears, particularly in the hands of a Government who have proved themselves to be the nearest approach to fascists since the Government of the 1930s.  We have seen them recall the Dáil for emergency legislation, we have seen Bills jackbooted through the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be hurtful, but I will point to the section which will provide the Minister with the jackboot.  It will come down harder and harder on the decent people of the country.  Already, the Government have exasperated and hurt the workers and the self-employed of the country by over-taxation.  Of course the provision here in regard to collective redundancies is a step forward in that it refers to firms employing more than 20 people but I will try here to persuade a reluctant Minister of what is necessary in this as in other legislation. He refused to take my amendments on the Unfair Dismissals Bill. My main concern is that the small people are not covered by the Bill. This Government seem to be interested only in creating big employment. I submit that two, four or six jobs in a small country crossroads village <Col N="909" /> or town are equally important, to be maintained and extended.  In that section we are talking about what is meant numerically by collective redundancies.  Then we refer to what is covered when an employer intends to cease to carry on business.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the bankruptcy situation as it is spelt out here. Our bankruptcy laws must be reexamined. Most of our redundancies came as a result of a business drop and financial shortcomings.  This problem must be overcome and it can be overcome with the assistance of this Bill, linked up with Fóir Teoranta as an agency.  Early warning of redundancies is necessary.  We should use that early warning for more than one thing.  In this Bill we are using the early warning system for negotiations between the negotiating bodies and the employers, with the Department keeping a watchful eye on things.  We are using it as a means to try to avoid redundancies if possible.  This is welcome but we must go a stage further. Neither the Department of Labour, the negotiating body, nor the employer, if he is experiencing financial difficulty, or is trying to avoid future bankruptcy, has the necessary resources to hold those jobs.  That is why we must have a link with the Departments of Finance or Industry and Commerce, or possibly both, and that an agency such as Fóir Teoranta, or the IDA or the ICC must have the opportunity to assist both technically and financially if the need is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was confused by the Minister's Second Reading speech in relation to the 30 days.  Am I right in assuming that the 30 days is prior to notice of dismissal being served on any employee? In other words, from the end of the 30 day period the minimum terms and conditions of employment take over.  Would the Minister clear that point, so that we can establish that that is the case?  In relation to the 30 day period there is an omission of one change from the directive.  I would like the Minister to explain why this change was not included, as I think it would be of benefit.  The Minister could have taken power to extend the initial period of 30 days, <Col N="910" /> which could in many instances be too short, and it might be desirable to have a period of 60 days instead.  The early notice of mass redundancies is very important if it is used fruitfully. As the Minister knows, if there is a financial void or a financial need in a company and discussions take place and one of the finance houses are approached, these people will go into a lot of detail and time will elapse before an answer is given, so that the 30 day period could be devoured all too quickly.  The Minister holds a lot of power under this Bill.  It will be introduced by ministerial order.  I would like the Minister to explain what is meant by that.  The Minister can also limit the powers of this Bill. It says in section 7 (3) (a)</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order declare that this Act shall not apply to a class of employees specified in the order and from the commencement of the order this Act shall not apply to that class.</P>
    <P>I reserve the right to query this on Committee Stage.  Why is it necessary to include a clause of this nature? The powers of the Bill are already limited.  There are certain exclusions and I do not see why the Minister must include such a section to give himself powers that are not necessary under the terms of this Bill.  There are quite a number of exclusions under the Bill, the civil service&mdash;it looks as if the Ministers are getting power in this House to hire and fire and do what they like&mdash;the officers of a local authority and people employed under the Merchant Shipping Act.</P>
    <P>In the future the Minister for Labour will have a duty to try to have the bankruptcy and winding up proceedings tidied up.  Legislation will be necessary.  There have been redundancy situations in the past but they were in the minority.  Employers, mainly suffering from the bad management of this Government, saw the situation deteriorating, and tried every means to continue their operation, some of them sensible, others far from sensible, even to the extent that social welfare stamps and PAYE contributions were being delayed in order to keep the firm going, and finally there <Col N="911" /> was a crash and neither were the cards stamped nor were the PAYE contributions paid and employees became redundant in substantial numbers.  Because of that the men and women concerned experienced considerable difficulties in getting their entitlements under the social welfare Acts and their pay-related benefits.  This is why I say the 30-day period must be used beneficially.  There must be a more efficient approach adopted with regard to our bankruptcy laws and windingup procedures to assist employers. Most of the employers who have been involved in such matters were honest hard-working people who did not deliberately set out to deprive anyone but because of economic circumstances they were forced into such a situation.  In very many instances it was not a case of deliberate intent on the part of the employers.  Most of the redundancies that have occurred have been caused by a financial shortfall, the economic situation generally and a scarcity of funds to enable firms to remain operational.</P>
    <P>There are some interesting sections in the Bill and I should like to bring them to the notice of the House.  I think the Minister is going mad or, alternatively, he is deliberately carrying on the tough tactics adopted by this Government where there is a network of tax inspectors pursuing people throughout the country, bleeding every penny from them in a last-minute effort to collect a few pounds to keep the Government going.  Now the Minister is adding another group of people who will have considerable power.</P>
    <P>Under sections 17 and 21 new powers may be given to authorised officers to do almost anything.  They may go into an employer's home on production of a warrant issued by the Minister or by an officer on his behalf if any suspicion exists that the employer is concealing something.  That in itself is fine but, assuming that an officer for some reason decides that he has such a suspicion, he can do something that is completely against our Constitution and against the accepted practice of law and justice here.  If these sections are to remain, <Col N="912" /> some safeguards must be written in whereby the District Court may be used to obtain such warrants.  There is no point in the Minister saying that such powers will not be abused, that they will only be used in certain circumstances.  That is not enough. Section 17 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The powers conferred on an authorised officer by subsection (1) (a) shall not be exercisable in respect of a private dwelling-house unless the Minister (or an officer of the Minister appointed by the Minister for the purpose) certifies that he has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence under this section in relation to an employee employed in the house has been committed by the employers, and the authorised officer in applying for admission to the house produces the certificate. </P>
    <P>The provision contained in that subsection is very far-reaching.  I shall deal later with section 21 which also refers to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  At the moment we have a considerable number of measures before the House.  I have said that they were introduced for political reasons but that is not the most important thing now.  The important thing is that all those Bills which contain many different sections &mdash;some of them with provisions similar to those contained in section 17 or section 21 of this Bill&mdash;will instil fear in prospective employers because of the sheer volume of all the sections together.  I accept that the legislation is necessary but I am pointing out the grave concern small employers may experience.  These people are probably more afraid of legislation than the larger companies who have the necessary experience to study legislation and to examine how it may affect them.  The smaller companies do not have that facility.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that the Minister should allow section 17 to be included in the Bill.  It hits at the fundamental rights of a person, at the privacy of the home, and it can be abused to a dangerous extent.  On Committee Stage I intend to oppose such powers being given.  There must be safeguards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> When in Opposition the Minister gave the impression that he regarded every employer, big and small, as his enemy and now in Government he continues to give that impression.  It could be contended that he is going to attack people even in the privacy of their homes if this section is allowed to remain as it is.  We will have a lot more to say on this matter unless the Minister sees the light.  Quite often I am not complimentary to the Minister but I think we have made some ground on this Bill and I am egotist enough to claim that it is because of my constant pressure from these benches.  The terminology used in this Bill is far simpler and will be understood more easily by the group of people covered by this legislation.  If, as a result of my promptings here, we achieve something in this direction I shall be very happy.  I believe this Bill will be more readily understood by the ordinary person.  The others I regard as a reaping ground for lawyers and others who will clean up at the expense of the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (3) contains the same type of attack on people in companies:</P>
    <P>Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. </P>
    <P>In other words, if a young clerk in an office, perhaps because of a late night, perhaps for some other reason, makes some slight mistake then he or she can be charged with an offence.  This outright attack on persons must be resisted, and I will continue to resist it and so will my colleagues in addition to the other sections to which we take objection, but sections 17 and 21 in their present form will be strongly opposed by us unless they are amended on Committee Stage.  This is <Col N="914" /> an interference with fundamental rights and entitlements.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to assist the Minister in trying to control a massive redundancy situation.  Redundancy is a hated word.  It has disrupted homes, towns and townlands.  Anything we can do to prevent it will be work well done.  If the commitment were really there I believe we could achieve this. This Bill can fill a void.  It can be a worth-while step in the right direction. Involvement and expertise will be vital, and if we extend the period for a further 30 days that might result in the prevention of redundancies.</P>
    <P>When we legislate here we legislate for the most part for the vast majority of employers, employers who are decent, hard-working honest people, but there is always the employer who may seek a way out.  There is always the employer who will try to drive a coach and four through legislation if he thinks he can get away with it.  By mass redundancy we mean five persons in a 30 consecutive day period.  Is there a danger that the employer to whom I referred could find a way out? If he takes three at the end of one month he can take three again 31 days later and, as far as I can see, he can continue that process <i>ad infinitum.</i> Perhaps there is some provision which will prevent him doing that and, if there is, I shall be happy to be advised of it.  If there is not, then I would ask the Minister to close the loophole on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out, we have had a number of Bills here dealing with employment. The impression created is one of patchwork legislation.  This is unfortunate, and I think the Minister is doing his Department and himself an injustice.  There should be codification of industrial legislation.  Over 40 years ago the late Seán Lemass introduced the Conditions of Employment Act, 1935, and that became the charter for workers.  It is still regarded by many as such.  However, we have come a long way since then.  The Department of Labour has been established. There is more sophistication in the Civil Service, and I am confident that the officials of the Minister's Department with the proper legal assistance could codify all the laws relating to industrial employment, thereby providing us with one instrument to which to refer.</P>
      <P>There are some good things in this Bill and some that are not so good. The Minister has asked us to give the Bill a speedy passage, and he will find us co-operative, but there are two sections that I could not support in their present form and I would ask the Minister to have a look at these.  The Bill has a heavy European influence, coming as it does from the Commission, but in excluding the very small firms means we are doing an injustice. We are not like Germany, France, Italy or these other European countries. They have huge companies employing thousands upon thousands of workers.  We have many companies that employ only three to five workers, and we should not deprive these people of the protection of the Bill.</P>
      <P>One good point is that there is no age limit under the Bill.  People are living longer now and living more useful lives.  We have enough work for them to do in order to build the economy further.  I am not one to suggest that people should be thrown out of employment even at 70 years of age.  However, while this Bill covers a person over 70.  I think he still will not be covered by the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Redundancy has become, if not a dirty word, at least a suspect one.  Is it because of the policy of the Government <Col N="916" /> in imposing heavy taxation that we are inducing redundancy?  A worker may find he is so heavily taxed that there is no incentive for him to go on working, or an employer, equally heavily taxed, may well decide it is best for him to opt out.  I would rather see in the legislation a different attitude, that is, one for creating employment rather than merely preventing redundancy.  We must, of course, maintain our present job content, but we should have an outward look, and should be trying hard&mdash;I know some efforts are being made&mdash;to create more job opportunities. I agree with the Minister that there will probably always be redundancies and therefore we must cater for them.</P>
    <P>However, there are omissions from the Bill.  The public sector is not covered, nor are people who work on ships.  A more recent development is that women are being employed on the ferry service.  These workers will not be covered by the Bill.  Our mercantile fleet is not all that big but it is growing; there may be some technical reason for the exclusions, but we should look more broadly.</P>
    <P>The sections which will give us the most cause for worry are, as Deputy Fitzgerald points out, sections 17 and 21.  I read at an early age George Orwell's book &ldquo;1984&rdquo;, which is very frightening.  He tells about Big Brother coming and watching all of us.  Big Brother appears in section 17 (1) in a very formidable form indeed.  The provision reads:</P>
    <P>An authorised officer may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  enter at all reasonable times any premises or place where he has reasonable grounds for supposing that any employee is employed. </P>
    <P>It gives a picture of an inspector slipping through the back window or getting in by snooping round.  The provision goes even further than that. This kind of thing breeds suspicion. We should be trying to create a spirit of co-operation between the State, the employers, the unions and individuals. These sections here will destroy any attempt at goodwill.  The Minister may <Col N="917" /> well find that this will create unity which is not planned in the Bill, where workers and employers come together to oppose this, because if the bell of Big Brother tolls today for the employer, the man on the factory floor knows it will toll for him tomorrow by having an inspector calling to his house to see if he has been doing anything wrong as regards redundancy.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald points out we shall have a lot more to say on this matter on the next stage of the Bill. While we certainly will co-operate fully on this side of the House in not delaying this Bill, we have a duty to offer criticism and suggestions so that this Bill may be an instrument for the betterment of people who are so unfortunate as to be affected by redundancy.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill whereby the Minister must be notified of possible redundancy.  It is a very good thing that we cannot have a big redundancy threat that the Minister would not know about, and I am sure employers will co-operate with the Minister in notifying him in time. However, I do not think the Minister should go ahead to act &ldquo;the heavy&rdquo; on the employers then after they have fulfilled their obligations under the legislation when it is enacted.  I believe that, even allowing for the good parts in the Bill, it will not be conducive to better human relations in industry.</P>
    <P>This Bill suffers from the same defect as other legislation here, in that we always seem to be stopping gaps, always papering over the cracks in the social and industrial structure.  We never touch the structure to make sure it is sufficiently strong to carry all the new legislation which is proposed and adopted.  The Minister has the opportunity now of looking at the whole scene, starting with the 1935 Act, giving us a new industrial charter in conditions of employment legislation, and providing, in simple terms, protection for people in industry.  I believe the employers' organisations and the trade union congress will be only too willing to join with the Minister's Department in forging this new weapon for industrial peace.  We suffer a great deal from industrial disruption, <Col N="918" /> and anything we can do to reduce the irritants which exist in industry and which bring about a certain amount of upheaval must be removed in the best possible way, that is, by creating the proper conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>A man who is suffering any form of disability in a job should have the proper channels to go through and if, eventually, redundancy is threatened we should have the best means of communication so that everything possible is done to help the individual involved.  Like an illness everything possible must be done to prevent it occurring, but if it occurs we must have the cure ready so that the person involved would suffer as little as possible.  I appeal to the Minister to look again at sections 17 and 21 before next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is important in many respects.  We have had a substantial number of Bills before the House from this Department and their quality is in doubt.  There is little use producing Bills if they are not required and if they have not the effectiveness necessary.  It is necessary to update our legislation in relation to worker problems, conditions of employment and the protection of workers.  It is not possible to legislate industrial peace into industry today. There must be a climate of common sense and understanding between employer and employee.  It is important that rights and opportunities are clearly understood.  Not alone have employers responsibility but employees and trade unions also have responsibilities. They cannot be one sided; we must have an across the board understanding between workers, trade unions and employers.  We cannot legislate on a lopsided basis; there must be a degree of understanding of all the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential services of our country must be maintained in a climate of understanding between trade unions, workers and employers, but that does not prevail at present. We must have collective responsibility in that area.  We all know of the disruption in industry at present because of the lack of understanding.  I hope there will be a development of <Col N="919" /> this understanding in order to ensure that we can maintain the essential services, whether they are bus services, water supply or other essential services.  It appears that there are some sections in trade unions, employers and workers who are not responding to the cries of the Minister and the Department of Labour and, indeed, common sense, in relation to the maintenance of essential services. Essential services must be treated as separate from the general stream of employment.  I hope common sense and understanding will be injected into this area in time to come so that we can look forward to a period of calm.</P>
    <P>I welcome all legislation that assists any section of the community, but it cannot be lopsided in any respect.  We have a duty to ensure that our legislation is in line with that existing in other countries.  It appears from the legislation that has been enacted here that workers were the victims of vicious employers.  While some employers take every loophole in legislation and utilise every system to deprive their workers of their due rights, the great bulk of employers are responsible and yield and respond to the suggestions for the benefit of their employees. They know that the contentment of their employees is a big factor in the development of their industry.  I believe common sense prevails with the employer who believes that with a contented work force he can get a much better response in the line of production.  I am all in favour of any legislation that is necessary to ensure more protection against the vicious employer, but we have had a number of ineffective measures debated here. Many of them are whitewashing a dreadful situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that redundancies will continue to occur in periods when employment is high, but that is not so here.  The reverse situation exists.  We have large-scale unemployment and continuing redundancies. This is a sad situation.  On occasions industrialists are forced into creating redundancies, and no amount of whitewashing will alter the situation. We want the creation of confidence <Col N="920" /> so that industrialists can expand and take people into employment rather than putting them on the redundancy market.  We are all aware of the upward spiral in unemployment figures and that employers are forced to create redundancies in order to maintain viability.  The Government should take effective steps to ensure that jobs will be available.  The Government stand condemned for not creating the necessary opportunities. This Bill, like others that have been discussed here, is introduced to divert the minds of employers and workers from the crucial situation that exists, the lack of opportunities in jobs. There is no employment or opportunities at present and people can only look forward to more redundancies. We have in the Bill the battering-ram mentality of the Minister.  I hope we will no longer have the battering-ram mentality injected into our legislation. Consideration of the problems of workers and employers and a commonsense approach to those problems would help the situation.  Industrialists are people of common sense and understanding who ensure that workers are kept in employment as long as possible, as long as there is viability. But the responsibility must rest on the Government.  The Minister is doing a good job of camouflaging and covering up the defects of the Government by diverting attention with the legislation he introduces.  In some cases it has worked but in other cases it is sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>To go back to the Equal Pay Bill, we find it has defects as a result of which people can be dismissed while seeking to have rights which are enshrined in legislation implemented, and they cannot get back their employment because we are told by the Minister that the Constitution gives the employer certain rights.  There is no use in having legislation that does not fully protect the rights of workers for whom we are told it is introduced. This is what has happened. Camouflage is no use.  We want something constructive and positive, something that will seal the loopholes and ensure that workers' problems in seeking their rights will be fully resolved.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> The Minister has given certain assurances that defects in some Bills will be rectified by other Bills.  That represents a sorry state of affairs. Legislation should be comprehensive, and it should fully protect workers if it is a workers' protection measure. Bills will not be effective unless we develop a greater understanding between the industrial partners and create a climate in which both sides can factually assess their own situations and the overall situation as to what is best for the common good. The Minister may get satisfaction in bringing Bills to the House, but in some cases this can be a greater disservice than it is a protection to the worker.  If this Bill gives an iota of protection it deserves some support, but the Minister should not mislead workers by presenting a great volume of legislation which purports to give workers greater protection unless this is in fact the case.  How effective is the large amount of legislation we have seen in recent times?  What contribution has it made to the benefit of the workers?  It is very limited.</P>
    <P>The Minister should introduce a comprehensive Bill to protect workers if that is what he wants to do.  Why waste the time of the House introducing Bill after Bill and yet leaving loophole after loophole for the employers to crawl through?  In an atmosphere of declining employment I believe workers and employers will wish to co-operate in their common interest, and I think we are moving in this direction.  There are areas where they want to come together and where the Minister should tell the unions to put their house in order so that there would be industrial peace, which is what is needed for the general good. The unions cannot do their work effectively if the Minister has to bring in Bill after Bill in order to do somebody else's work.  We must ensure that the employers and the unions get together, thrash out their problems and reach an understanding that they will work for the common good and that essential services will be fully protected. We should take the battering ram out of legislation whether it is aimed at the worker's door or the <Col N="922" /> employer's door.  We want to see that type of legislation replaced by common sense so that there will be a general understanding of all the problems.  The real problem at present is that the Government have failed in their responsibility and in their promises to produce the jobs necessary to avoid redundancies so that if redundancies did occur they would be absorbed in alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Workers' rights must be protected and they must have work opportunities, but there are other factors creating confusion in the minds of the workers&mdash;and sometimes in the Minister's mind.  I hope the sentiments that the Minister has expressed in the Bill in relation to dismissals and unscrupulous employers who disregard workers' rights and take unfair advantage of them are sincerely held and provision will be made to deal with them.  Otherwise, the time will come when workers will refuse to work for employers who do not fully meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister again comes to the House he will have something comprehensive to offer of which it can be said: &ldquo;This is a comprehensive Bill that takes account of all aspects of workers' protection, and is not a piecemeal or patchwork effort such as that which is now being pushed in on every occasion when the Government seem to be sagging or running into difficulties.&rdquo;  Efforts are made to divert the workers' attention to something that has really nothing to offer.  We shall not tolerate that kind of situation in which the Minister tries to create an atmosphere in which he may fool workers into believing that something expensive and comprehensive is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has gone to Brussels for an EEC Council meeting and I am replying on his behalf.  This Supplementary Estimate relates to CIE. There were a number of points made during the course of the debate to which I would like to take this opportunity of replying.</P>
      <P>First, a number of Deputies referred to the question of the termination of rail services.  The present policy relating to railways is based on the Government decision of March, 1974, following the investigation by the consultants, McKinsey and Company, which showed that CIE's increasing losses were due mainly to inflation and growing competition from private transport.  The consultants recommended that the best course of action was to retain the railways but selectively to modify them and develop the types of freight and passenger traffic for which the railways were best suited.  The Government decided that the rail system should continue to be preserved, subject to further concentration and reorganisation in accordance with the general concepts outlined in the McKinsey reports, and developed in further studies made by CIE.  Additional capital investment for the railways has been approved for the purpose of modernising operations with a view to providing faster, more efficient and more reliable services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that resources must, however, be concentrated on the development of those traffics for which the railways are best <Col N="924" /> suited.  In the context of a situation where railway losses increased from £4 million approximately in 1970 to an estimated £24 million in 1976&mdash;that is just for the railways, the total CIE loss is greater than that&mdash;it is obvious that CIE must examine the question of grossly under-utilised services.  Increased losses of this magnitude could not continue to be met by the Exchequer. Unless the losses are contained, the future existence of the railway system as a whole will be placed in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>This came about in the context of the speculation in newspapers as to the future of the Rosslare-Waterford line. The House will appreciate that this is just speculation because the consequences, the machinery and the amount of consultation necessary to close that line would take quite a time. It would be very hard to put an exact time limit when you think of the number of local authorities involved, the necessity to realign roadways, planning permissions for bridges, and if there were to be a toll bridges, there is a possibility that this might even require legislation.  We are not talking about something that will happen within the next two or three months.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of CIE's social contribution. In 1975 almost 30 per cent of the total revenue&mdash;£26.5 million&mdash;was provided by the State and other sources provided £63 million.  As I said when I had responsibility for this Department, I want to see the railways held and, at the same time, I also want to see the taxpayers' contribution kept at as low a level as possible.  The types of freight, their method of handling, the use of modern equipment for handling smaller freight, the service and the quality of the service provided for the ordinary passengers, are things that can make the railways attractive to both passengers and people moving freight, but this necessitates quite sizeable capital investment.  It also necessitates a very high degree of morale and pride by the employees in their company, and it involves a commitment by whatever Government is in power to see that this capital is made available to CIE.  The House <Col N="925" /> will agree that this Government have, by their willingness to make available capital to CIE, possibly achieved all three objectives.  By providing capital we have raised the morale of the employees and helped to provide better, more efficient, faster and, hopefully in the future, less loss-making, if not profit-making, operations by the railways.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barrett said, railways all over the world are losing money.  The loss to CIE, as I said, has increased from £4 million to £24 million in 1976. Even though these are very significant sums, the country can feel they get value, provided people employed by CIE understand that the subsidy provided by the State is not in any sense a mark of no confidence in that undertaking. At the same time, it is incumbent on the board and CIE to see that the taxpayer gets value for money. Every citizen who pays taxes, directly or indirectly, is contributing towards that money, and the management and board must see that money is spent wisely to the benefit of the country as a whole.  When one compares the losses in CIE, and the very scattered and less-dense pockets of population they have to serve, with other railway undertakings in Europe, the management of CIE are as efficient.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the productivity and the cost production schemes of CIE.  It is right that CIE should look at every aspect of their operations to see where savings can be made and increased productivity achieved.  I would like to refute a suggestion by one Deputy that the jobs being closed off under the nonrecruitment ban applied only to the lower levels.  That is not true.  In the last 18 months posts at management level became vacant and were not filled.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of Rosslare Harbour and the study being undertaken at the hydraulic research station about an extra berthing facility at Rosslare.  This study will be available in the new year.  It will then be a matter for CIE, in consultation with the officials of the Department of Transport and Power and the Office of Public Works, to decide first <Col N="926" /> whether the extension to the harbour should be gone ahead with and, second, how it will be financed.  We must be careful that any expansion in Rosslare Harbour does not interfere with the very attractive beaches and strands around Rosslare, and it must not interfere with the tourism potential of the area.  It is not possible to say if we will go ahead until the results of the study are made available in the new year.</P>
    <P>Plans for Cork Harbour were also mentioned.  The £500,000 grant was made available this year, but for technical and financial reasons it was not availed of.  The Minister is assured by the Cork Harbour Commissioners that the £2½ million being made available to them next year by way of a grant will be used in the calendar year 1977.  I have no doubt that this investment by the State will be of benefit not just to the Cork region but to the State as a whole.  It is an imaginative and very well thought out plan which has been brought about by the work of the Cork Harbour Commissioners and the local authorities there.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to thank the various Deputies in the House, particularly the two who were opposite me when I was Minister for Transport and Power, and to thank the House generally for the courtesy kindness and co-operation showed to me during my almost four years in that Ministry. I would like to think that I gave courtesy and co-operation to all Members of the House and I am sure the next Minister will give the same courtesy and co-operation.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,639,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain services administered by that Office and for <Col N="927" /> payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid. </P>

      <P>The main Estimate for Agriculture for 1976, amounting to £114,361,000 net was passed on 17th June.  The net amount of this Supplementary Estimate added to the original Estimate for 1976 represents a total net provision of £116,000,000.  This figure shows an increase of £25,464,000 on the final total net Estimate for Agriculture, including the Supplementary Estimates, for 1975.  The £1.6 million now sought takes into account various savings amounting to £19.8 million to which I shall be referring in the course of my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to announce, with reference to the sum of £1 million provided under subhead C.5, that the Government have given approval to a proposal for the allocation of this amount to provide special assistance for defined cases of hardship arising from the discovery of tuberculosis and brucellosis reactors.  The £1 million will be paid into a special hardship fund from which assistance would be paid and would continue to be paid until the fund is exhausted. It is envisaged that the £1 million would be sufficient to cover all hardship cases during the current round of testing which should be completed later next year.  When the £1 million is spent&mdash;at whatever time this should occur&mdash;there would be no further contribution from the Exchequer to the fund.  Continuation of the fund beyond that time would, therefore, be dependent solely on an arrangement under which the fund would be financed by the agricultural industry through some form of levy or other contributions.  Unfortunately the farming organisations do not favour farmer contributions and so the fund will terminate when the present injection of Exchequer grant of £1 million is exhausted.  I have asked the Advisory Council on Animal Health and Disease Eradication to recommend to me the criteria which should be <Col N="928" /> applied in defining hardship cases and the level of assistance to be given.</P>
    <P>The next item I should like to refer to is the additional expenditure provided for various capital grant schemes. This reflects the exceptional level of investment by farmers in the development of farms during the past year. The extra provision of £2 million under subhead D.2 relates to land reclamation work completed under the former land project.  Grants for this sort of work are now available under the farm modernisation scheme and the old scheme has, therefore, been effectively wound up since 30th September last.  The announcement last year of the date for winding up the project prompted a great many farmers to push ahead and complete works on hands or to finish jobs which had been partially completed.  This coupled with the general buoyancy in the level of investment by farmers during the year has led to the extra expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should say as a general observation that there has recently been a noticeable revival of interest in land drainage.  The exceptionally dry winters of the last two years seemed to have lulled many farmers into the false notion that lands would never again become waterlogged.  It would be a pity if this notion were to continue.  I am quite satisfied that there are still vast areas of lands which can be improved and brought to full productivity by drainage or clearance.  It is in the national interest that these improvements should continue and I therefore welcome the revival of interest in this work which has become more evident in recent months.</P>
    <P>Subhead D.3 relates to grants for farm buildings and installation of water supplies on farms under the former schemes.  Again, consequent on the unexpected upsurge in demand in the context of the winding up of these schemes the expenditure arising in the present year will be in excess of that originally estimated to the extent of £620,000.</P>
    <P>The main subhead providing for capital grants to farmers is now, and will be in future, subhead M.1 covering the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> As I have mentioned already, the level of investment by farmers, has been consistently high throughout this year. This clearly reflects the very favourable returns from all sectors of farming. Apart from this, however, it also clearly illustrates that whatever else may be deficient in the farm modernisation scheme it does not in any way inhibit investments by farmers. Indeed, the contrary is the case.  There are very generous grants for all types of capital investment but particularly for buildings and land drainage.  I am very glad that farmers now recognise this and that they have responded to it.  I might add that this expenditure on capital works is clearly beneficial also outside the farming industry in so far as it generates a great deal of employment in the building and other allied industries and, of course, its effect is dispersed throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would like to repeat just one word of caution which I think I have uttered here before. The cost of capital investment on farms can now run into substantial sums.  There is a risk that farmers may be lured into overspending or spending unwisely.  Careful consideration of investment proposals and careful planning are called for.  I hope that both farmers and their advisers are availing of the chance which the farm modernisation scheme gives them to work closely together on the planning of developments on the farm and that between them they weigh all the pros and cons of the expenditure that may be necessary.  In this way wasteful investment will be avoided and the greatest possible returns will be gained from the money that is spent.  Given this careful and prudent approach by both farmers and advisers, I am confident that the industry will quickly make up for the lean years when the resources were not available to be ploughed back into the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>On the horticulture side we require an additional £127,000 to meet capital grant commitments under the old horticultural schemes which have also been wound up and incorporated into the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> As regard the provision for an additional £15,800 for the Farm Apprenticeship Board, Deputies will recall that, earlier in the year there was considerable publicity surrounding the financial difficulties of the board. In response to the board's representations, an additional grant of £15,800 over and above the £27,500 provided in the original Estimate was made available by my Department to the board to enable them to meet their commitments to the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>Incidental expenses of market intervention in beef and skim milk powder are now estimated to amount to £24.4 million of which £17.5 million will be eligible for recoupment from FEOGA.  This leaves a net cost of £6.9 million to be met from the Vote as compared with the £2.6 originally provided, an increase of £4.3 million. In the main this increase is due to higher interest charges on the capital tied up in the stocks of beef and powder held in intervention.  I should explain here that the capital funds for intervention purchases of beef and skim milk powder have to be provided by us and that the rate allowed by FEOGA to member states generally in respect of interest is appreciably less than what the Exchequer has to pay on borrowings.</P>
    <P>Although the slaughter premium arrangement terminated at the end of February, 1976, delayed claims for payment have continued to come to hand.  It has been found necessary to provide a sum of £38,000 as the Exchequer contribution towards meeting those claims.</P>
    <P>The special premium on exports of beef to the UK is a self-balancing arrangement whereby such sums as are received from the UK Government are passed on to our beef exporters. The proposed increase from £1.5 million to £1.7 million does not involve the Irish exchequer in any additional outlay, being matched by a corresponding increase in appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The shortfall of £340,000 in receipts from slaughter fees arises from the fact that it has not yet been possible to make statutory provision for monthly, instead of half-yearly, collection <Col N="931" /> of these fees.  Accordingly, fees in respect of animals slaughtered in the second half of 1976, which it had been hoped would largely be collected before the end of the year, will not now fall due until next year.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to certain items where savings accrued, beginning with the disease eradication schemes. There will be a substantial saving on the sum provided for bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication.  This saving arose from the veterinary dispute during which the normal round of testing was not in operation.  When the dispute was resolved testing recommenced in October.  Most of the expenditure incurred under these subheads this year related to the retesting of reactor herds identified in previous rounds and the removal of reactors for slaughter.</P>
    <P>The estimate shows a saving of £800,000 on the fertiliser subsidies. This reflects the trend in fertiliser sales and usage in the early months of the year.  I was most concerned at the reduced usage, and I have repeatedly called on farmers not to indulge in the false economy of reducing ultimate yields and profit for a short-term apparent saving of a few pounds.  I am glad to say that recently sales of fertiliser have increased greatly and farmers are again increasing fertiliser usage.</P>
    <P>While on this subject I would like to stress once again the desirability of expanding the tillage acreage.  This is essential if we are to provide more winter feed for cattle, and also from the point of view of reducing our dependence on imported feed which is costing the country over £30 million a year.  Furthermore, a tillage break, apart from being profitable in itself, is the most effective means of improving old unproductive grasslands.</P>
    <P>The saving of £1.1 million on subhead D.4, beef cattle incentive scheme, derives from the fact that this scheme was withdrawn in the less disadvantaged areas on the introduction of the EEC beef cow scheme for which provision is made under subhead M.3&mdash; aids to farmers in certain lessfavoured areas.  Similarly, the saving <Col N="932" /> of £460,000 on sheep headage grants results mainly from the substitution of an EEC sponsored scheme in the less disadvantaged areas for our own sheep headage grants scheme.  Total expenditure this year under subhead M.3 on the EEC cattle and sheep schemes will amount to £13.5 million &mdash;the sum provided&mdash;of which 35 per cent will fall to be recouped from EEC funds.</P>
    <P>Finally, the saving under subhead E.2 is mainly accounted for by an increase in the level of FEOGA contribution to our consumer subsidy on butter.  I have now dealt with the main items in the Supplementary Estimate and I look forward to any comments Deputies may wish to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have liked very much to be present at the debate today but he is unavoidably absent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity we have not more time to deal with this important Supplementary Estimate. The Parliamentary Secretary has dealt with a number of items on which many Deputies from this side would like to speak.</P>
      <P>The provision of £1 million for hardship cases with regard to the sale of brucellosis and TB reactors is totally inadequate.  In my opinion at least £2 million should have been provided.  We have told the Minister repeatedly that the scheme is a bad one, and it is the farmer with the small cattle who will suffer particularly. If a small beast fails the TB or brucellosis test the farmer could lose up to £80.  The indications regarding the number of cattle who will fail the tests in my area are not very good.  The Animal Health Advisory Council have said also that the provision made will not be adequate, and perhaps the Minister would reconsider the matter even if it means introducing another Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to changing the scheme.  The present procedure will not help in the eradication of disease. Under the old scheme the buyer from the Department came out to the land and bought the beast.  The beast was <Col N="933" /> brought to a collection point and collected in a lorry engaged by the Department.  After the beast was brought to the factory the lorry was disinfected.  Under the present scheme the farmer must deliver the beast to the factory and get his grant.  The scheme has not been worked out completely as yet.  It is a question of what these hardship cases will get out of this £1 million.</P>
    <P>Apart from the loss to the farmer the greatest drawback is the danger that the eradication of disease will be affected.  Every farmer will not disinfect the lorry or trailer in which he brings his beast to the factory and that is bound to spread disease.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that efforts are being made by certain co-operatives to organise collection centres but farmers living in isolated areas will not benefit and they cannot afford to hire a lorry.  Of course, there may not be a full lorry load available.  I am surprised no effort is made to have these vehicles disinfected.  I believe the old scheme was superior.  Some will lose a great deal of money.  If a farmer has a heavy beast he will be all right but if he has a light beast or a very good milking cow he will lose money.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the first Minister to state that the Department would not accept responsibility for the eradication of diseases, diseases which are harmful not only to livestock but to human beings.  The whole community should be involved in the eradication of these two very dangerous diseases in particular.  Now, according to the Minister, he will accept only partial responsibility for eradication.  It was always accepted that the State had a responsibility and I am sorry the Minister is not now prepared to accept that responsibility.  It was suggested that, if funds were not available, there could be a levy put on farmers to pay the cost of eradication.  This would be grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I cannot emphasise strongly enough how totally I disagree with the present system of buying cattle under the eradication scheme and I wonder how bad things will become.  Let us hope they will not be <Col N="934" /> too bad.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to a saving as a result of the dispute with the vets.  To me the cost of disease eradication, whoever will pay it, is the cost of that dispute which went on for two years.  Had that dispute not continued good work would have been done and the cost of eradication would have been nothing like what it will be now.  It is nonsense to talk of a saving because of a dispute which should have been settled six months after it started. No money has been saved because the price of cattle has gone up.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to land drainage and to people not being aware of the need to do land drainage.  Of course they are aware but the great problem is that farmers cannot carry out drainage while the rivers which act as outlets remain undone.  I understand drainage is not a priority in the EEC.  In my area the Duncannon and the Suck have not been drained and so the farmers are unable to do any drainage work themselves.  Every farmer in the west knows he must drain his land.  It is no use putting fertilisers on waterlogged land.  We have a very serious drainage problem.  The Minister should impress on the EEC that drainage here should be a top priority to enable us to reclaim land capable of producing good crops.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme was mentioned.  That scheme is irrelevant so far as this country is concerned, as everybody knows, because of the small number of farmers who come within its ambit.  That was pointed out long ago and we were then accused of throwing cold water on this scheme. I understand the Minister has made certain submissions now in regard to the directive.  I know county committees of agriculture have submitted a scheme.  So have the IDA and the agricultural advisers.  Some of these schemes contradict each other.  I was astonished to hear the Minister say yesterday that these schemes had been forwarded to Brussels.  The schemes should have been processed in the Department and the result of that processing should have been forwarded to Brussels.  My complaint with the present regime is that too many are <Col N="935" /> inclined to pass the buck.  The Minister has responsibility and it was he who should have made a decision and forwarded the most appropriate scheme for this country.  Sending two or three different schemes to Brussels is not the right way to proceed.  I am very critical of this.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the further payments that had been made towards the Farm Apprenticeship Board.  I am one of the people who brought that board into existence.  I was chairman of the committee which obtained the grants from the Department and set up the board.  I am delighted the Minister came to the assistance of the board.  Some suggested the board may not be run as economically as it should be.  That can be examined.  This was one of the best schemes ever introduced. I have known young people who have come through it and gone back to their farms or got reasonably good jobs.  It is a hard course and it would be a retrograde step if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries refused to subsidise this excellent scheme and keep it going.  I have criticised many directives from the EEC, but one for which I have the utmost praise is No. 161, the educational directive.  We are making the most of it in my county and the short and reasonably long courses which are being run are of great benefit to both big and small farmers.  The farm apprenticeship scheme is another scheme giving excellent value.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also mentioned the headage payments in disadvantaged areas.  The old scheme was dropped and a new scheme was adopted for the disadvantaged areas.  I cannot understand why the 12 western counties that are recognised in Brussels as disadvantaged areas are not designated as severely disadvantaged for the headage payments.  Recently, under pressure, the Minister brought in&mdash;and probably rightly so&mdash;two other areas.  Knowing one of them, I think he was justified in doing so. However, we approached him in respect even of pockets of areas in my county.  Although the 12 western counties are recognised by the EEC <Col N="936" /> as disadvantaged, they are only disadvantaged theoretically as far as the people there are concerned.  The people do not get any benefit from this designation unless they are development farmers, and the percentage of development farmers is so small that it is irrelevant.  Therefore, I cannot understand why they are not designated areas for the headage payments.  People will say there are portions of these counties where there is good land that are not in.  We all know the Lagan valley which has about the best land in the county.  I could point out other areas which are completely designated as disadvantaged although they have pockets of good land.  As I say, while the 12 counties were always recognised as being worthy of special treatment, there is no advantage for them in the designation.  I cannot understand why the Minister would not look into that matter.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to tillage.  Tillage brings to my mind the idea I have been pressing over the years, particularly since we joined the EEC, that of a balancing fund.  I was a small farmer and happened to be in tillage fairly extensively, and I remember a time not so many years ago when we could not sell our potatoes.  We were selling them for £8 to the sugar factory in Tuam.  This was the time when the man in tillage was being laughed at by anybody engaged in any other system of farming.  A farmer will go into whatever system of farming pays him best and therefore practically every farmer who was in tillage got out of it.  The result is that now they have not got the necessary machinery.  It is not so hard to switch from milk to beef; from beef to milk costs money, but from livestock to tillage costs a huge amount of money because the machinery required is so expensive.</P>
    <P>I would like this balancing fund to be considered so that what happened a few years ago in regard to pigs will not occur.  I would like to warn the Parliamentary Secretary, incidentally, that there is a danger in regard to pigs at present, but there is nothing there to subsidise them.  We do not <Col N="937" /> want the same thing to happen as happened in 1974 when the farmers had to sell the sow and the cow, instead of selling the bonham and the calf, because they could get nothing for them.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting there should be a fund provided by the taxpayer but a fund that could be created from the produce that is going well in Europe.  In this way when a commodity would fall below the price at which it is profitable for the farmer to produce it he would get assistance from this European fund.  I have been pressing this for a long time but it is falling on deaf ears.  The Minister sticks out his chest and tells us we are all right for two years with the cattle trade.  That is a very short term.  I am not saying that things are not reasonably good at the moment, but we have to consider the years ahead. However, because a farmer might get £80 on cattle going out people will say the farmer should not get it.  Is the beast not the farmer's?  If the farmers are not paying the right amount of tax by all means tax them.  I am not objecting to that.  However, if an industrialist exports goods and, because levies were imposed on him, a certain sum of money is returned, it is not to the revenue it would come but back to the industrialist.  The same thing goes for the farmers.  They should get back their money.  This sort of thing causes lack of confidence among farmers.  This balancing fund I am suggesting would cushion them over a period when they would be producing a commodity which would be completely uneconomic to produce at that time.  It happened in relation to tillage and, in 1974, in relation to pigs.  There is a danger of us getting another pig cycle which would mean that it would be uneconomic to produce pigs.  What happens in that case is that producers who are in the pig business in a small way go out of production.  That occurred after the last flop in that industry.  The same thing happened with small cattle.  For those reasons it is essential to have a fund on the lines I have suggested established.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to delay the <Col N="938" /> House any longer on this matter.  In my view it is a shame the way business is allocated here.  This Estimate is for the most important Department which caters for the country's biggest industry and yet we must wait until the end of a session before we can discuss it in a limited way.  Only once since I became a Member have we had a full debate on agriculture.  If we did not have the huge agricultural exports we had over the last three years what would we have done?  We depend on agricultural exports to get in the money.  It is a shame that only a few hours is allocated for debate on this Estimate.  It is wrong that important Estimates are bundled together at the end of a session and that they must be passed after a limited debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to advise the House that what is before us is a supplementary estimate and debate should, strictly speaking, be confined to the items contained in that supplementary estimate.  It is not an appropriate occasion for a wide-ranging debate over agricultural matters generally.  Matters of detail should be left to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries proper which will come before the House in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that we are always restricted when we rise to speak on agriculture.  That is most unfair because this Estimate requires in-depth study.  We must have a farm plan because since we entered the EEC agriculture has taken on a new role.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the Government intended to provide £1 million for hardship cases in brucellosis testing but he hoped no further contribution would have to be made.  I do not think the Department should state that no further contributions would be made, because it is vitally important that we tackle the problem of eradicating disease.  We all complained bitterly about the handling of the vets' dispute, and the damage caused by that dispute could have serious repercussions on the agricultural industry over the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an extra provision of £2 <Col N="939" /> million relating to land reclamation work completed under the former land project.  I hope the grants will be paid and the scheme completed as soon as possible, because it is holding up examination of FMS applications.  I appreciate the difficulty involved in processing applications, but something should be done to improve the situation. The Parliamentary Secretary also told us about the fall-off in fertiliser usage, and I should like to remind him that we pressed the Government to take action in this regard on many occasions.  In relation to the farm modernisation scheme additional staff should be employed to deal with applications.  There is a big hold-up between the time applications are received and the time they are approved.  It should be remembered that that scheme could make a great contribution to the building and construction industry, because the farming community realise that they will have to provide many more buildings. Any employment created in the building and construction industry, where there is serious unemployment at present, would be welcome.  An improvement in the processing of applications under this scheme would also mean that farmers could develop their holdings faster.</P>
    <P>In relation to buildings I should also like to mention that an application has been lodged for an increase of 20 per cent in the price of cement. This will have a serious effect on farm development programmes.  The Parliamentary Secretary also told us that careful consideration of investment proposals and careful planning were called for.  Those interested in farming will agree that this is a top priority.  It is important that farmers avail of the advisory service, that they would draw up farm plans and that there would be careful consideration of this investment proposal.  This is really important at present because most farmers are curtailed by insufficient acreage and non-availability of land.  Formerly, land was available on conacre but because of spiralling prices and the purchase of farms by people not entirely dependent on <Col N="940" /> farming a really serious problem has been created for the farming community. Previously, even though conacre was costly they were able to get land but they now have to compete with investors in the purchase of farms. It is most important that very careful consideration be given to the purchase of a farm, and future investment in it and programmes for such farms should be designed to produce the maximum return.</P>
    <P>It is stated that on the horticultural side we need an additional £127,000 to meet capital grant commitments under old horticultural schemes.  This scheme should be rapidly developed by the Department because, from replies to Parliamentary Questions we have learned that a colossal amount of money&mdash;last year it was £26 million &mdash;was spent on fruit and vegetables which could have been produced here where we had massive unemployment. This type of production would involve labour-intensive projects in a climate and a country very well suited for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to one applicant in my area who went into horticulture fairly extensively.  He applied in 1975 under the Farm Organisation Scheme in respect of erection of mushroom houses.  He received approval from the Department and an estimate of the cost, but due to increases in building materials and other materials generally he found by the end of the year that the percentage of the estimate cost which he was getting was completely unrealistic in relation to the actual cost of the project.  I asked the Department to re-examine the matter because I felt that when a time limit was not imposed within which he had to complete the scheme, the Department officials should have been able to re-examine the scheme.  He had a very well documented case which would bear the strictest examination as regards prices and costs of the items involved.  The Department should re-examine cases such as that and applicants should be allowed the percentage to which they are entitled under the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> I welcome the provision of the additional money we sought during the year for the farm apprenticeship scheme, which is an important project and is being availed of, largely due to so many farm apprentices being unable to secure jobs or places in colleges.  I have seen a number of boys who served their apprenticeships with farmers and they are now in a position to make a worthwhile contribution to farming in the future. Therefore, I think this scheme is very important.</P>
    <P>The estimate shows a saving of £800,000 on fertiliser subsidies. Further on the Minister stated: &ldquo;I am glad to say that recently sales of fertilisers have increased greatly and farmers are again increasing fertiliser usage&rdquo;.  I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that at this time of year fertiliser sales increase because of manufacturers' and merchants' sales promotion schemes.  They offer special terms at such times, and more so this year because there is very muddled thinking in regard to the future price of fertilisers.  This is a pity.  One day you see in the papers that there will be high increases and another day you see it stated that this is not expected to happen.  The farmers are left between two minds.  It is very important that at the end of a year, in November or December, farm organisations should be notified in advance of the expected price structure in the coming spring.  If farmers avail of these price reductions in most instances they must obtain credit and pay a high rate of interest.  They must consider whether it will pay them to seek this credit.  The fertiliser industry should at present be able to forecast fairly accurately the price trend for the coming year, and they should be pressed to do so.  We realise there are imports, but this does not seem to have much effect on the actual fertiliser price.</P>
    <P>We must realise that when the fertiliser subsidy was introduced we had 8 per cent phosphate at about £8 to £10 per ton and slag at probably £6 or £7.  In many instances the increase now is five-fold or six-fold.  It is a pity to see a reduction in the use <Col N="942" /> of fertilisers at a time when we need an increase.  Farmers who have studied this matter realise that the future for increased production lies in increased fertiliser usage and the use of the farm advisory service, getting soil tests done and ensuring proper application of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Later the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>This is essential if we are to provide more winter feed for cattle and also from the point of view of reducing our dependence on imported feed which is costing the country over £30 million a year. Furthermore, a tillage break, apart from being profitable in itself, is the most effective means of improving old unproductive grasslands.</P>
    <P>We all agree that this is the most effective way but with the restrictions on mixed small farmers it is just not on.  They have not the acreage, the equipment or the storage facilities. Year after year people feeding their livestock and users of feed, be it compound, barley, oats or maize, are the victims of colossal price increases.  At present most merchants are charging in the region of £107 a ton for barley without additives.  Most of that barley was purchased at prices around £65 to £75 a ton last year.  Because of the exceptionally good weather grain growers and merchants did not need to have the barley dried, although in some cases the moisture content was high because cuttings were done early in the day or at night.  This caused a problem for the grain merchants and compounders and that eventually filtered down to the users and the product was not as good as it could have been.</P>
    <P>It is a real tragedy that in areas similar to those I represent, small farmers, whether for dairy cattle or pigs, have to pay £107 a ton for barley.  This means somebody is making a profit of £25 to £30 a ton.  Also, grain merchants from the north come here and inflate the price of barley. The people who suffer as a result of this are the small stock producers.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the pig industry briefly. We spent a good deal of time discussing that industry here.  It is a pity <Col N="943" /> remedial action was not taken and that the pig industry passed from the hands of the traditional small producer whose main income was the family farm and who needed the pigs to supplement his income.  That industry is now declining and it is a pity more attention was not given to it before this.</P>
    <P>If the farm modernisation scheme is to be effective a farmer working to a plan in conjunction with the agricultural adviser, and whose income is only from the farm, should qualify for maximum grants.  Once again I ask the Department to have another look at fertiliser usage and barley prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss our most important industry, agriculture.  Like previous speakers I think it is a pity we did not have a full discussion on the main Agriculture Estimate.  This is something the Government should look into when making time available for discussions.  I want to pass a few remarks now on the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.</P>
      <P>He made reference in the first part of his speech to a sum of £1 million provided under subhead C.5 for special assistance for defined cases of hardship arising from the discovery of tuberculosis and brucellosis reactors. This £1 million is inadequate to meet the hardships that will be encountered by the farming community in the eradication of these diseases.  I do not agree with the suggestion that the farming organisations and the farmers themselves should make contributions, because the eradication of these diseases will benefit the country and the economy as a whole.  When we consider that our total agricultural exports are in the region of 65 per cent of our total exports, we can readily see the importance of the cattle industry to our economy and, most important, the importance of the agricultural industry to our economy.</P>
      <P>We must not look at this from a narrow point of view but from the benefits of the agricultural industry to the economy.  In that respect this fund must be provided fully by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have omitted to mention time and time again the vast cost to the agricultural industry of the eradication of these diseases.  The Parliamentary Secretary never refers to the cost of replacing a brucellosis or tuberculosis reactor animal.  He says that the Department are now providing £80 or £60 as the case may be, plus the amount that the farmer will get when this animal is sent to the factory.  Even adding these two prices together it falls far behind the cost of replacement of this animal, particularly if it is a young breeding heifer.  That is my argument as to why the Exchequer should meet the total cost of this special assistance.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary indicate in his reply how this fund will be allocated? Will it be confined to certain areas?  What criteria will be used in the allocation of this fund?  The farming community should know about this.  Disease eradication has been suspended because of the silly dispute which the Minister had with the veterinary profession over the past 18 months.  I will not go any further into it, because enough has been said.  In relation to the estimate provided for the eradication of disease for 1976, there must have been a vast saving in that estimate due to the fact that eradication of disease did not go ahead.  Instead of paying £1 million to this special hardship fund, it should be doubled for the reasons I have outlined.  The Parliamentary Secretary has also stated that it is his intention to ask the advisory council on animal health and disease eradication to recommend some criteria to meet the situation and perhaps that is the Parliamentary Secretary's answer, but the farming community want to know at this stage how the special limited fund will be allocated with regard to hardship cases.</P>
    <P>The Farm Apprenticeship Board has been mentioned in the supplementary estimate.  That board got a great amount of publicity in a campaign promoted by the Department of Agriculture, when a mere £15,000 was provided for the board in order, as the Minister said, to take them out of difficulty.  The Minister also said at <Col N="945" /> that time that there was no guarantee that this amount would be provided in the following year or years.  In other words they should have better housekeeping, a better idea of saving, and a better approach to their expenses. The Farm Apprenticeship Board got a very short paragraph in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief.  Since this board was inaugurated way back in the mid-1960s it has done a tremendous amount of work under great financial difficulties.  It provided young farmers and farm managers trained in all aspects of agriculture and farm management.  I commend very highly the board, its previous chairman, and the chairman before him.  I hope that the present chairman will carry on the good work of his predecessors. The training of young farmers to take their places in agriculture is of the utmost importance.  Vast amounts of money have been spent by the Department of Labour and AnCO in industrial training.  That should be compared with the measly small amount provided by the Department of Agriculture towards the Farm Apprenticeship Board.  You can readily see the lack of interest by the Department of Agriculture and by the Minister in the training of agricultural apprentices. The Parliamentary Secretary and the Department should consider very carefully their future approach to this board, which is providing a worthwhile service for our greatest industry. A greater injection of finance must be provided for this board so that it can provide the services that are required for the development of agriculture and farming at present.  The potential of Irish agriculture is vast, but unless people, particularly young farmers, are sufficiently trained in the rudiments of agriculture I am afraid we cannot reach that potential which is so necessary for the economy of this nation.  The Department should put this board on a sound financial footing in order that it can achieve its targets. I also suggest to the board and indeed to the Department that means must be provided whereby land would be available for these young farmers when their apprenticeship is completed. I am not saying that land should be provided by simply handing <Col N="946" /> over farms to them.  I suggest a system similar to that operating in Holland and in the Scandinavian countries whereby farms are rented or leased to the young farmers when their apprenticeship is completed. Something on that line would be worthwhile here.  The greatest frustration of our young farmers and trained apprentices is the lack of employment opportunities and the absence of a land bank so that their training may be put into operation.  I commend this to the Minister and to the Department. The country would benefit enormously if all the training of these young people were put into use and I would ask the Minister to consider the prospect of providing land on the basis I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme has been in operation for some years, and it has been of assistance to the agricultural community.  Nevertheless there are some shortcomings in the scheme, the major one being the lack of incentive for farmers to attain the targets set out in the scheme.  In the scheme relating to small farms which was in operation some years ago there was a payment each year provided the farmer attained the target set for that year.  In this scheme the plan is drawn up initially by the agricultural adviser and the farmer but the payment of grants is not dependent on the farmer attaining the target set.  I should like to see in the farm modernisation scheme the attainment of a particular plan which would be drawn up at the commencement of the scheme.</P>
    <P>When the farm modernisation scheme is examined again by the Department, by the Commissioner for Agriculture and by the Council of Ministers, I hope a scheme more suited to the interests of Irish farmers will be drawn up.  The present scheme has many shortcomings, but nevertheless it is one that can be recommended highly to our farmers.</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme is to give preferential aid to farmers who are willing to follow a certain development plan, thereby increasing their income.  In that way Irish farmers and agriculture generally will benefit. Unfortunately the scheme is confined to a small group.  The vast majority <Col N="947" /> of our farmers in what is termed &ldquo;the other category&rdquo; are not included on economic grounds.  This a major loss to Irish agriculture.  The national interest can best be served by increasing agricultural output, and we must give as many incentives as possible to farmers to attain the targets set.  The category of farmers who are not included have enormous potential, and they should be included as development farmers.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of off-farm employment.  Small farmers who have another income or another mode of livelihood are debarred from participating in the scheme.  Off-farm employment should be encouraged and farmers engaged in this work should be helped to participate in the farm modernisation scheme.  The opportunities are there for them to develop their farms, and in the future they may be able to take up farming on a full-time basis.  The aim of the reformed modernisation scheme should be to increase agricultural production and assist as many farmers as possible to obtain a reasonable income from agriculture.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into details of how the scheme could be improved to bring into operation the suggestions I have made but it is important that &ldquo;the other category&rdquo; I have mentioned should be included in as full a development as possible for the reasons I have outlined.  It is vitally important that farm accounts are kept because they can be the yardstick whereby development and improvement can be assured.  They will also measure the capacity of the farmer. I have suggested that a grant or portion of a grant should be paid each year depending on the development that has taken place.  That would provide an incentive towards future development.  I trust these suggestions will be carefully considered when the time comes to make further rules and regulations in relation to the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of many other EEC schemes.  Mention was made of Directive 161 with regard to agricultural training in its widest <Col N="948" /> sense.  This is something which should be encouraged.  Farmers who did not have an opportunity of a proper training in agriculture and who may wish to be brought abreast of modern developments in agriculture should participate in this scheme.  It is being operated very well by the county committees.  There are courses for both men and women.  I hope the Minister will provide all the necessary personnel to ensure these courses are continued while, at the same time, bearing in mind that the other duties of the advisers are not neglected. Adequate personnel is vital to the full utilisation of resources and the full organisation of these courses.</P>
    <P>There is provision to meet certain expenses with regard to agricultural colleges and agricultural training.  I would commend very highly indeed the personnel of these colleges, both those operated by the State and those privately owned, because of the very fine work they are doing in training and educating our young farmers.  The demand far outstrips the number of places available.  Perhaps it may be possible to make more facilities available by extending these colleges so that the demand for places will be met.</P>
    <P>This debate is limited and there are many things one would like to say which one cannot say because of restrictions. I hope, as the Ceann Comhairle said earlier, that a further opportunity will be provided for a full debate on agriculture.  It is unfortunate that each year so many Estimates have to be passed without discussion.</P>

In regard to agricultural training, very shortly a new Bill on the advisory services and on the agricultural and educational needs of the farming community will be introduced.  I hope the Minister will consider very carefully the role that the county committees of agriculture have played in the development of agriculture down through the years, and that their powers will not be diminished but rather increased, because we want the powers and decisions at local level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  It is very encouraging to see from this document that so much is being done for agriculture. There is a total net provision for 1976 of £116 million, which is a staggering sum being poured into agriculture.  That is the place to put the money.  In 1974 we ran into two difficulties.  Our export trade was not good at the time.  We had an exceptionally poor harvest and under the beef incentive scheme several years previously, which we thought was a good scheme, our cattle population increased considerably.  Many farmers, particularly in the west, allowed their stock to get too large so that when something unexpected happened they were not able to maintain them. The result was panic and we had to go round to the factories begging them to take the cattle at any price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture at that time proved to the people what it was worth. Because our agricultural industry was in trouble the whole population was in trouble.  People in cities, towns and villages were adversely affected. <Col N="950" /> People were brought to realise that agriculture was the one industry that had to be protected.  Agriculture and industry are interdependent but agriculture leads the way.</P>
    <P>I note from this document that there has been a substantial increase in the amount of drainage work being carried out by our farmers.  That is due not only to the prices we are getting for our livestock but also to the fact that modern machinery is moving into the most backward areas where people are prepared to hire out plant. Heretofore, this had been done by manpower and was badly done.  I welcome this development because up until now a very large amount of land was neglected.  It was good for nothing, growing rushes, water-logged and no return coming from it.  We hope the problem will be tackled in a big way because there are years of work to be done under that scheme.</P>
    <P>When speaking on drainage I have always referred to the small rivers which were doing so much damage and needed to be attended to.  Under this modernisation scheme a small group of local farmers will get a 50 per cent grant to drain the small rivers that were doing enormous damage.  Heretofore, there was only the local improvements scheme to deal with that type of drainage or the arterial drainage scheme, and neither one nor the other could grapple with this big problem.</P>
    <P>Water supplies are also being provided by means of well bores and otherwise.  However, in respect of well bores, one thing which has been brought to my notice is that the ESB estimate is extremely high.  Many people would provide a water supply for their farmyard, their home or their farm maybe two miles away, but the demand made by the ESB is excessive and on a small scheme could amount to as much as £1,000 plus rent.  I would ask the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to try to come to some understanding with the ESB about meeting such demands and easing the problem for those people who find themselves in this position.</P>
    <P>Again cattle prices reflect themselves <Col N="951" /> in the distribution of lime to farms.  In my own area one or two farmers tackled this problem of getting lime for their farms.  It will finish up with something like 3,000 tons of lime being spread over a six- to ten-mile radius because one farmer got it and they all saw the modern way of putting it out on the land.  The day for struggling with it and getting it to the hilltops has gone.  There is the 20ton truck to bring it from the lime kiln to the farm and the contractor will, for the sum of 75p per ton, spread as much lime as any farmer requires.  That is the charge in the part of the country from which I come. This is a sure sign that we are progressing and that the people are becoming more interested in the land, due to the fact that cattle prices are very tempting.  They have fallen a little over the last few weeks but we hope to see them moving again after Christmas.  Over the last two years they have put money in people's pockets and the money is being spent. Those people are not afraid to say to the contractors: &ldquo;Get me 50 or 100 tons and spread it for me.&rdquo;  They have nothing more to do except pay for it. Farmers living in isolated areas or with mountainous land can get such contractors to spread the manure.  We are making progress when we can say that and it is all due to the fact that farmers have money and are not afraid to spend it.</P>
    <P>Quite an amount of money was in circulation in my area during the summer and it came from sheep subsidies and the high prices paid for sheep.  Practically every sheep farmer in my area got his £4 for his one-year-old ewe and £3 for every lamb together with a good price for wool. That will give great encouragement to farmers to improve their fencing and increase their sheep stock so that they can have this steady revenue.  A damper was put on that in 1974 when weather conditions upset everybody's plans.  I should like to remind the Minister that there is a need to get on to the question of headage grants.  The Department informed me that the matter would be tackled as soon as <Col N="952" /> possible, but that to date they have 70,000 applications to deal with.  We all accept that that is a big problem.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that farmers were happy with the price paid for milk in the last few years and that has meant more money for them.  As long as that prevails we can rest assured that the farming community will continue to improve their holdings.  If they do not have the money, they become depressed and find it hard to get a proper return from their holdings. The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of the need to increase tillage.  That is of vital importance.  Farmers have had to pay out a substantial amount of money for cattle feed, from £5 to £6 per cwt, that if more oats and barley was grown, particularly in the west, it would be a big help towards relieving the pressure.  I was asked to suggest to the Minister that something should be done to have inspection for the headage scheme carried out earlier or have it based on the cow alone.  Like the beef incentive scheme, inspection for many farmers comes too late.  Something should be done to have this inspection carried out earlier so that when there is a demand farmers can dispose of their calves and not lose, as they will now, in the region of £25 per calf.</P>
    <P>I have been approached by people engaged in the export of cattle in a small way concerning the issuing of licences.  Apparently, licences are only granted to those who are engaged in this business in a big way.  Those engaged in a small way have been told that for the present they cannot be considered.  I believe we are approaching the stage when the people engaged in the business in a small way will be permitted to export.  I had correspondence from the Department in relation to this matter and I was pleased to learn that the matter was being investigated.  It is disappointing for an exporter engaged in the business for up to 30 years to be told that because he was not engaged in it in a big way he was not being considered for a licence.  Most of those people have a good record.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that a number of business people have not been paid <Col N="953" /> yet on the feed vouchers given out in 1974.  I accept that that is not the fault of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I understand that the matter lies with the factories.  I would ask the Department to contact factory owners and seek to have the payments made as soon as possible. Those business people made great sacrifices to purchase the feed and it is wrong that they should have to wait two years for payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my contribution I should like to deal with the farm modernisation scheme.  The big fault with it is that it is applied uniformly throughout the Community. No consideration was given to the needs of different areas.  There is no reason why every farmer should not be working towards a plan and that is the big fault I find with the scheme. Various proposals concerning the scheme were sent by different bodies, instructors and so on, but if different proposals which are contradictory are sent to Brussels what will the Commission make of these proposals?  It is important that the Department give the lead in this matter.  The situation in relation to the processing of applications in my county is appalling because of the shortage of staff.  In fact, instructors are doing a lot of the paper work instead of giving advice to the farmer.  Recently six young people applied for permanent posts in Galway but not one of them was appointed.  They were excellent young men but they were turned down.  One of the big holdups in the scheme is the lack of extra clerical staff to deal with applications.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the disadvantaged areas.  Galway County Committee of Agriculture have asked that the 12 western counties be included. It is of concern to me that very few areas in Galway are in the scheme, particularly in north Galway.  I advise the Parliamentary Secretary of our intention in Galway to press to have all 12 western counties included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to drainage, a problem of concern to most Deputies.  It is obvious the EEC do not regard drainage as a <Col N="954" /> matter of priority.  I hope they will change their minds because there is not any great value from the point of view of drainage in the local improvement schemes&mdash;the money is too little. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in money given to the Farm Apprenticeship Board.  They are doing great work in the training of young farmers.  At this point I should like to draw attention to the lack of co-operation in regard to Directives 159 and 160, in particular, in the context of making land available for restructuring.  The farm retirement scheme has failed and in cases where land has been made available under the scheme it is reserved for potential development farmers as distinct from smaller farmers.  The scheme has not been a success in the west.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about animal disease eradication.  In this matter the Minister must accept total responsibility.  Deputy Callanan pointed out that he is accepting only partial responsibility.  This is a matter of vital importance to the entire agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>It is important also that incentives be given to individual farmers as well as groups of farmers.  I am glad, of course, that farming groups will be given further grants for equipment and so forth.</P>
    <P>It was not very welcome to hear the Minister for Finance talking about the possibility of a withdrawal of agricultural grants.  On top of that we had delegates at the Labour Party Conference advocating more taxation of farmers.  This has become the basis for a lot of fear&mdash;that the Government may kill the golden goose.  I hope the Government will think again and that they will not stifle agriculture by taxation as they did to the industrial sector.  I press on the Parliamentary Secretary the need to introduce an overall policy for agriculture instead of the day-to-day system we have at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I will be brief because of the limited nature of the debate.  I hope I do not <Col N="955" /> ruffle the Parliamentary Secretary's feathers when I say that agriculture is such an important concern&mdash;the main concern in our economy&mdash;that much more time should be available to Deputies to debate the subject.</P>
      <P>The Government do not seem to have any set plan for agriculture. Farmers are not being given the leadership they need from the Minister or from the Government and this means that our overall economy is suffering.  In the industrial sector, in health and education, there are plans, and I cannot see why the Government have not got a definite plan through which they could tell farmers what their incomes are likely to be in a fiveyear period&mdash;what the price of cattle, beet, beef and corn crops will be. When one considers some of the measures introduced in the past year one could not be blamed for thinking that the Government are trying to stymie development in agriculture rather than improve it.  One of the main causes of concern&mdash;and I speak especially for County Galway&mdash;has been taxation of co-operatives.  Not only has it affected the incomes of individual members but it has retarded co-operative development.  Taxation on co-operatives, in effect, is a tax on our primary producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said about the farm modernisation scheme, one of the talking points in agriculture at the moment.  One of the principal objections I have is that we have not enough staff to implement the scheme. There is an unacceptable shortage of agricultural instructors and of clerical staff and consequently a lot of time is taken up by our agricultural officers having to fill in application forms as well as to advise farmers.  It is absolutely essential if the Minister cannot give committees of agriculture additional agricultural officers that at least he should give them clerical officers who would help in filling up forms and answering farmers' queries. In the long run it is the farmers who will lose in this matter.  If they are to wait six or nine months before their applications are processed, with the way prices are spiralling at <Col N="956" /> present, prices of cement, building materials and other commodities which they need to develop their plans, will be increased which, in effect, reduces the value of grants paid to them.  Therefore, it is essential to make more staff available for this purpose.  We have had the case of the Galway committee cited.  That is only one committee.  We have a shortage of staff there and we have tried on several occasions to get additional staff and have been refused.  I cannot see how the Minister is anxious to develop agriculture in County Galway if he does not give us the staff we need to implement this scheme.</P>
    <P>Disease eradication is very important and we see a saving in the Estimate because of the fact that we had a prolonged strike last year.  This is to be regretted.  There is nothing we can do about it now but we should proceed as quickly as possible with the elimination of brucellosis and TB because it is important to get our herds cleared as quickly as possible. We had hoped to have our herds cleared by 1978 but we all agree now that this will be impossible because of the prolonged strike and unless the farmers themselves get their cattle tested I see no hope of the Government getting our herds clear by that date.  It is strange that the Minister should not accept full responsibility for the eradication of animal disease. It should be the responsibility of the Government to achieve this aim as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Estimate for educational research and advisory services.  Modern farming demands a degree of forward planning, vocational know-how and technical skills. This makes it a most demanding way of life.  A farmer must have such a variety of knowledge and technical skills that the training and education of a young farmer requires top priority.  Any money we can provide under this heading is well spent.  An additional sum of £60,000 is being provided here today&mdash;I wonder if it is enough.  Figures I saw quoted some time ago indicated that we are still very much behind our European partners in this respect.  Every effort <Col N="957" /> should be made to educate our young farmers.</P>
    <P>In Galway we are fortunate in having excellent colleges doing a wonderful job and we are more fortunate still in that they are now being fully utilised.  No other field offers so much scope for working our way out of our economic difficulties as agriculture and no other facet of it needs to be expanded as much as education does.  I would, therefore, like to see a greater bias towards what may be called rural science.  This has been introduced in the curriculum of our post primary schools and has been fairly successful.  For some years back the universities have given extramural courses eventually leading to a diploma.  Many adults have availed of them.  University courses appeal greatly to many people and I do not see why agriculture could not be treated likewise so that our young people could be offered a diploma or some attraction to a course such as this which is very, very useful.</P>
    <P>As regard the brucellosis eradication scheme and the price paid for reactor cattle, there is great dissatisfaction. It should not be left to the factory owner.  The farmers should have somebody in the factories to check their cattle because if farmers are left to the mercy of factory owners there may be abuses under this scheme and the farmers will be the losers.  I see no reason why farmers could not have a representative at the factories, just as the beet growers have, to watch the farmers' interests and ensure that they get the benefit of anything going.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Finance mentioned the possible withdrawal of agricultural grants to western counties. This aroused much speculation particularly in the west because farmers whose valuation is £20 or less are completely derated.  The Minister's recent statement caused consternation and we would like to hear an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary when replying that this grant will not be abolished.  It is a matter that calls for immediate clarification because it has caused such concern.</P>

      <P>The most surprising feature of the debate was the assertion made, commencing with Deputy Callanan and continuing down through the line of Fianna Fáil speakers, that we have had insufficient time to debate agricultural matters in this House and that, in fact, we had no agricultural debate this year.  The records show that the main agricultural Estimate was introduced on June 2nd.  The debate was continued on 3rd and 17th June.  It was an open-ended discussion and all Members were entitled to contribute to it if they so wished.  I want to make clear that ample time was given for the annual Esimate debate on agriculture and if Fianna Fáil were anxious to have additional debates on this important industry, they could have done so in Private Members' time instead of wasting time on a number of Private Members' motions of little or no consequence to the country but supposedly of some political advantage to the Fianna Fáil Party.  The assertions made generally by the Opposition regarding limitations imposed by the Government on debates on agriculture in the House are without foundation.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is correct.  As far as possible every Minister includes in his Estimate amounts to cover the expenses for the following financial year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will make a statement on a recent report which stressed the incidence of mental handicap in juvenile offenders; and the steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the report referred to is that presented recently by the Committee of Management of the Children's Centre which is operated on behalf of my Department at Finglas, County Dublin.  The report draws attention to a number of risk factors to which the children referred to the centre have been subject, including the fact that a significant number of them are in the mild mental handicap range or bordering on it.  It is a feature of the usual pattern of delinquency to find a higher incidence of mental handicap among young offenders than in the child population generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report suggested that there appeared to be need for an expansion of the special education facilities for mildly mentally handicapped children, especially in the Dublin area.  The 1965 Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap recommended that, as an immediate target, special education suited to the needs of mildly mentally handicapped pupils should be provided for 1 per cent of the school-going population by 1975.  On this basis, the commission estimated that 1,100 pupils would have to be provided for in the Dublin/Dún Laoghaire area.  This target has, in fact, been exceeded&mdash;a total of 1,314 places has been provided in the area for children technically classified <Col N="964" /> as mildly mentally handicapped, plus a further 480 who would be borderline cases</P>
    <P>Experience shows, however, that it is only as facilities are made available that pupils needing them are discovered. In association with the school management authorities, further places will be provided for the mildly mentally handicapped according as the needs are determined by the appropriate diagnostic procedures.  However, because of the many other factors associated with delinquency the provision of special school places alone cannot, in itself, be effective in tackling the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any guard against the possibility of a youngster being sent away, not because he is a delinquent but because he is mentally handicapped?  Could a boy be sentenced for committing an offence even though he is mentally handicapped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that the approach of the assessment centre in Finglas is not one of sanctioning the offence which may technically have been committed by the youngster.  The purpose of this centre is to diagnose a treatment which is suitable to the needs of the young person.  Among the recommendations which might be made by the centre would be that the child be allowed to stay in its own home but would be admitted to a special school catering for the needs of children with mild mental handicap.  If it happens that it is decided that the child should be admitted to one of the special schools for children who have been in trouble with the law, it is worth noting that the pupil-teacher ratio in these schools is very much more favourable than it would be in ordinary schools, 12:1 as against an approximately 32:1 in the normal national school.  Children with special difficulties can be dealt with very effectively from an educational point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The major proportion of imports of agricultural machinery consists of high technology products such as tractors, combine harvesters and other heavy agricultural machinery which are not manufactured in this country.  The output of Irish manufacturers meets only a comparatively small share of the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The agricultural machinery industry in Ireland needs to develop out of a low technology base into higher technology areas.  The IDA is assisting in this process both by encouraging existing Irish producers and endeavouring to locate suitable overseas projects.</P>
      <P>A number of projects in the middle technology areas have been assisted by the authority.  In addition under its project identification programme the IDA is currently studying the potential for setting up industries to produce products in the medium value range.  Any projects identified will be brought to the attention of Irish industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that there is a wide range of products being imported which could be produced here as is evidenced by the success of the Armour beet harvester made by the Sugar Company?  Many other pieces of equipment have been manufactured in my own county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is definitely scope for development in farm machinery.  One of the problems is the lack of adequate foundry facilities in this country for producing the components which are necessary to go into the making up of agricultural machinery.  As the Deputy may be aware there are developments in the IVI Foundry in Athy, which should enable more sophisticated components to be made available to people interested in agricultural machinery and other forms of machinery.  The IDA have been particularly active in promoting agricultural machinery industries, <Col N="966" /> and since January, 1975, have approved grants totalling £486,700 to 26 firms to create 229 extra jobs in the agricultural machinery industry. In addition small industry grants have been given to 15 firms to create 127 extra jobs, and re-equipment grants have been granted to three firms to create 102 extra jobs.  There is fair evidence of significant activity by the IDA in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While some insurance companies are reluctant to give cover to drivers under 25 years of age, no company refuses cover on the sole grounds of the applicant being under 25 years.  All companies apply loadings in all such cases, but some companies apply a higher loading to drivers in the 17-21 years' category than in the 21-25 years' category.  This loading is applied because all companies have experienced that this category of drivers has a higher than average number of accidents involving also a higher than average cost per claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the companies were granted an increase of 24 and 25 per cent on the basic rates, on the understanding that they would open up insurance, particularly for the younger driver, and that this has not been honoured by the insurance companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am investigating the general question of the companies adopting a more actively competitive approach to the insurance market, particularly catering for risks such as these.  For this purpose I have asked the examiner of procedure and practices to investigate the motor insurance market.  I have also asked the Motor Premiums Advisory Council to do a detailed statistical analysis to find out the actual incidences of risk in the case of the different categories of driver.  It is hoped that this hard statistical information might indicate to <Col N="968" /> some companies that perhaps the loadings that they are applying to young drivers do not reflect the real risk of insuring such drivers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen Press reports of the statement to which the Deputy refers.  The case-volumes in the various courts are the subject of continuous review in my Department.  One of the objects <Col N="969" /> of this exercise is to ensure that the ratio of judges to case-volumes is maintained at an adequate level.</P>
      <P>The recent unprecedented and rapid development of arrears in the disposal of court cases, especially in the Dublin Circuit Court, has been the subject of a special study in my Department.  As a result, I have already initiated discussions with the various interests involved in the processing of court cases with a view to seeing whether certain proposals that have emerged from the study can be implemented so as to eliminate the arrears as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The problem in Dublin cannot be solved quickly by simply increasing the number of judges.  Additional courtroom accommodation must first be made available, and while the study revealed that more intensive utilisation of existing courtrooms in Dublin could enable more judicial time to be devoted to the disposal of the arrears in the Dublin Circuit Court, what is really needed is additional courtroom accommodation suitable for jury trials. The problem of providing such additional accommodation is far more complex than it may appear to be. It is not just simply a question of finding large rooms in which cases can be heard; it also involves the provision of essential ancillary accommodation such as retiring rooms for juries and so on.  It is also desirable for the convenience of legal practitioners and, hence, for the convenience of people appearing before the courts, that such accommodation be located fairly close to the Four Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee on Court Accommodation, set up some time ago, have found that there is no suitable and suitably located premises available that would serve as a temporary solution to the problem.  However, on the committee's recommendation, the hotel site which adjoins the Four Courts complex is in the process of being acquired and the necessary legal steps to complete the acquisition are now being taken.  The purpose of acquiring this site is to erect on it an office block which will form an integral part of the Four Courts complex and will <Col N="970" /> permit the redevelopment of the existing accommodation within the Four Courts so as to provide a number of additional courtrooms.</P>
    <P>The provision of at least one additional jury courtroom for the Dublin Circuit Court cannot await the redevelopment of the hotel site. Accordingly, a lease of office accommodation close to the Four Courts is in the final stages of being negotiated and plans are well advanced for the transfer of some courts' staffs to this accommodation and the redevelopment of their present quarters as a jury court complex.</P>
    <P>I do not know precisely what was intended by the suggestion that, apart from the excellent work done by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, there has been no specific investigation or inquiry into the overall organisation of the courts but it seems to me that, if the Law Society have any proposals to make in that regard, the most appropriate thing for them to do is to submit their proposals to that committee which, of course, is still in existence and to whose excellent work I join with the society in paying a well-deserved tribute.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his most comprehensive reply.  What worries a layman is the possibility that a person could be remanded in custody for a lengthy period just because the courts cannot reach his case.  Is that the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible but unlikely because one of the factors the court takes into account in deciding whether to grant bail is the possible length of remand.  It is my understanding that if there is a likelihood of a long remand bail is given by the courts.  However, it is a matter for the courts and I am not saying that what I have indicated is an absolute rule.</P>

      <P>The promotions referred to were made in accordance with the relevant Defence Force Regulations.  These Regulations provide that the Minister may, having considered such recommendations as may be made by the Chief of Staff, promote an officer from one rank to the next higher rank.</P>
      <P>The higher ranks involved, which are supernumerary to Establishments, derive from a restructuring, at present in progress, of the Army Equitation School while at the same time giving tangible recognition of the successes of the School in recent times.</P>

As the Deputy is probably aware, the Equitation School is under the Supply and Transport Corps and the officers promoted in two cases completed the Command and Staff course and in the other case the officer promoted had completed the normal course for platoon commander appropriate to his rank.  The position at the moment is that for some years the Equitation School has had a civilian instructor.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to make such a comparison.  The county councils (and the special joint health authorities) operated health services which were essentially within the local government system and financed in considerable part from the rates.  The reasons for introducing a new system were partly based on recognition that there would have to be increasing financial participation by the State and that the county was too small a unit, mainly for hospital services. These reasons are elaborated on in the White Paper on the Health Services of 1966, which formed the basis of the proposals adopted by the Health Act, 1970, for the establishment of these boards.</P>
      <P>Since the boards were established, there have been considerable developments in the health services and, of course, a considerable rise in expenditure. The developments were based on Government policies and the rise in expenditure was mainly due to these developments and to increases in pay and prices.  I have no reason to believe that the county councils could have arranged the developments more efficiently or at less cost or met the increases in pay and prices with lesser funds.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the legislation administered by my Department for regulating the transfer of pension rights acquired by employees from one pension fund to another.  The absence of statutory provisions for such transfers in the private sector so as to ensure that pension rights are protected in all circumstances was one of the major shortcomings of the present system identified in the recently published Green paper on a national incomerelated pension scheme.  I would expect that adequate provision to protect acquired pension rights will be an essential element of whatever new pensions system is finally adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I already have power under existing legislation to deal with the eventuality envisaged by the Deputy.  The relevant statutory regulations allow me, where I am satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, to appoint a person other than the claimant to receive and to deal with on behalf of the claimant, the portion of any social welfare payment which is payable in respect of adult and child dependants.  In many cases this can represent more than 50 per cent of the total entitlement.  Representations from a social worker or other suitably qualified person would, of course, be of considerable value in enabling me to decide whether I should exercise this power in any particular case.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware some of the wide range of social welfare services administered by my Department are available only to women, others are available to men and women on equal terms and in a few women are treated less favourably than men.  Generally speaking married women are paid unemployment benefit, disability benefit and invalidity pension at a rate lower than that payable to a single man or a single woman.  In addition, the duration of payment of unemployment benefit is limited to 156 days as compared with the 390 days for which it is ordinarily payable.  In the case of unemployment assistance a single woman or a widow is required to have either a dependant or 52 employment contributions in the preceding four contribution years before she can qualify for unemployment assistance.  A married woman applicant must not be dependent on her husband and must have at least one dependant.</P>
      <P>Finally, single women and widows cannot qualify for the housekeeping allowance payable with disability benefit, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and invalidity pension to single men and widowers with dependant children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is also no doubt aware very considerable progress has been made in the elimination of discrimination against women in the social welfare code since the present Government came into office and it is my hope to be able to eliminate all discrimination in this field in due course, but I regret that I am unable to commit myself to a specific timetable in regard to the elimination of <Col N="981" /> all or any of the remaining instances of discrimination.  In case there should be any misunderstanding in the matter I want to state here, quite unequivocally, that I do not regard discrimination in the social welfare code as in any way acceptable or defensible.  I believe that all such discrimination should be removed and that everything possible should be done to make the social welfare system just and equitable in its application.</P>
    <P>It was in that spirit that the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women were welcomed and accepted and that work was commenced on their implementation. Everything that has been done over the past three-and-a-half years points to the Government's determination to make real progress in these matters.</P>
    <P>I want to see the progress that has been made continued until all elements of discrimination disappear from our social welfare code but in saying so I have to be realistic and responsible in my approach and point out that efforts to make further progress in this field must have regard to the economic circumstances of the country.  In other words, the pace of progress in this area is quite simply dependent on the availability of the necessary resources.  Unless there is a clear acceptance by the whole community of the cost implications of these most desirable advances in our social welfare provisions it will not be possible to make them.</P>

      <P>I thank the parliamentary Secretary for the comprehensive reply.

      <P>I accept that unemployment difficulties exist at the moment.  I think it is necessary to remind the Deputy that unfortunately unemployment is not a new feature of <Col N="982" /> our national life.  Unemployment has been in existence here since the foundation of the State, and, in fact, at the time that these provisions that discriminated against women were introduced by Fianna Fáil, there was a very large number of unemployed.  Those circumstances have not changed. What has changed is that out of 15 recommendations in the field of social welfare made by the Commission on the Status of Women, 11 have been acted upon over the last three-and-a-half years by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the circumstances have changed in the context of unemployment when one considers that the Government have been in power now for almost four years and the present figures are 110,000 officially unemployed and 40,000 unofficially unemployed.  The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that this serious discrimination against women should be ended as a matter of urgency.  Can he give any hope in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my original reply to the Deputy, I find it neither defensible nor acceptable, and so I am not trying to defend it.  However, the Deputy has mentioned 110,000 unemployed at the moment, but we must recognise the fact that at the time this element of discrimination against women was introduced by Fianna Fáil there were approximately 80,000 unemployed and 30,000 emigrating per year because they could not find employment here.  That is approximately equivalent to the 110,000 that the Deputy spoke about a few months ago.  I have responsibility for trying to end discrimination against women.  This Government have shown their earnestness on this commitment by the fact that they have dealt with 11 out of the 15 points that were identified by the Commission on the Status of Women. I think it is fair to say that what we have been trying to do over the last three-and-a-half years is to eliminate discrimination in all aspects of our national life, and in social welfare in this instance in particular that was introduced by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I think the fact is that emigration did stop some time in the middle sixties, but as far as unemployment is concerned the figure on the live register in January, 1973, was 76,000.  The most important feature of that was that, after such a long period of Fianna Fáil rule, that was an acceptable level of unemployment. Seven per cent was acceptable and the people, unfortunately, under Fianna Fáil had been conditioned to accept it at that level.</P>

      <P>I was not being selective. Deputy Andrews had quoted the figure of 110,000 unemployed and used this as an extra reason why discrimination in the area of unemployment assistance should be used.  I only pointed out that at the time that this discrimination was introduced, deliberately introduced and passed in this House by Fianna Fáil, the figure for unemployed people was approximately 80,000 and at the time they passed this legislation 30,000 to 40,000 people were emigrating.  Therefore, I was only pointing out that his argument in that respect did not bear much scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the selective use of figures by the Parliamentary Secretary, he will agree that when that legislation was introduced, the social attitudes did not encourage women to go to work and in those circumstances it was reasonable to introduce the legislation then.  However, such attitudes have changed <Col N="984" /> now.  It now appears that since the National Coalition's advent to office the figures the Parliamentary Secretary quoted of 76,000 on the live register when Fianna Fáil left office have now jumped to 110,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be proud of the fact that the National Coalition have now placed an additional 40,000 people on the unemployment list, officially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Undoubtedly, everybody on this side of the House is seriously concerned about the issue of unemployment.  We had a general election in 1973 and in January of that year the number of people on the live register was 76,000 but at that time there was practically full employment in the rest of Europe and we had what was then an acceptable figure of 7 per cent unemployed.  Our people were so accustomed to unemployment that they were conditioned into finding that figure of 7 per cent as an acceptable one when the rest of Europe was enjoying full employment.</P>

      <P>At least I am achieving results, which is more than Deputies on that side of the House would have been able to do.  At that stage, no local authority houses were under construction in the borough, only 154 were in planning, and the total of all additional sites available to the corporation was stated to be 300.  Of this total, 120 sites were later used by the corporation as local authority housing sites, the others would not suit.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the development of an adequate housing programme takes time, particularly the acquisition of land.  I am happy, however, that the unsatisfactory situation has now been rectified, with 383 local authority houses under construction, with work on a further 175 houses expected to be commenced shortly, 85 houses at tender stage, plans being prepared for 317 houses, and a further reserve of about 660 housing sites already acquired.</P>
      <P>The corporation have therefore a current construction programme totalling 960 houses&mdash;apart from reserve sites&mdash;a figure well above the total requirements of families presently approved by them for rehousing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is further evidence of Coalition mythology.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the preparation of plans was well in hand when he took over responsibility for housing.  Can the Minister tell the House why only 57 houses have been completed in the last four years?  Is he aware that there are more than 600 families in urgent need of immediate housing in the area?  Can the Minister hold out any hope for the rehousing of these 600 applicant families?  When I speak of &ldquo;applicant families&rdquo; I am referring to about 3,500 people who are in urgent need of rehousing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Andrews has given me the opportunity of again putting on record the disastrous way the previous Government treated Dún Laoghaire.  Deputy <Col N="986" /> Andrews said that the planning had been proceeded with, but I should like to tell him that there were no local authority houses under construction and only 154 were in planning when I took over.  The idea that a lot of houses were being planned is wrong. All those statistics showed 300 sites available in March, 1973, and as has since transpired only 120 local authority houses could be put on the available area.  I have already stated that 64 of these have been built and 56 are nearing completion.  Deputy Andrews only looked at one figure before he put down the question, but if he had gone to the trouble of checking locally what the score was I do not think he would have bothered putting down the question.  There are 383 local authority houses under construction in Dún Laoghaire and work on a further 175 houses is expected to commence early in the year and 85 are at tender stage.  Plans are being prepared for 317 more houses and work should start on them some time next year.  A further reserve of about 660 housing sites are being acquired.  Under these circumstances for Deputy Andrews, or anybody else, to suggest that the people in Dún Laoghaire were being housed by Fianna Fáil and are not being housed because of a change to a National Coalition Government is a lot of tommy-rot.  But for the fact that there was a change of Government God knows what would have happened to the unfortunate people of Dún Laoghaire who were looking for houses, because Fianna Fáil had no interest in them.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister said in relation to the housing situation in Dún Laoghaire in 1973 it is important to remind him that almost since the foundation of Dún Laoghaire Corporation the Coalition have dominated it.  The Minister is wrong in relation to the figures he has given.  The number of people approaching local representatives in relation to local authority houses is getting out of hand.  I ask the Minister to agree that effectively only 56 houses were built in that area in the last four years and these houses have not yet come to hand.  In those circumstances I am sure the Minister will agree that his record has been disastrous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not go into local politics at that level, and I was not aware that Dún Laoghaire Corporation was dominated by the Coalition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving facts, and if they are incorrect I will have to do as I did with some of the Deputy's colleagues, repeat them outside the House and see what Deputy Andrews will do about them.  When I took over only 154 houses were in planning and 300 sites available.  On 15th December, 1976, 383 local authority houses were under construction; 175 houses about to start; 85 houses at tender stage and plans being prepared for 317 and a further 660 sites available.  Applications received for rehousing number 705&mdash;87 old persons and 618 others. Of these approximately 670 have been approved for rehousing, 87 plus 583. The corporation are at present carrying out a general survey of their housing applicants and expect that as many as 100 may be found to be no longer in need of housing, and this will reduce the need to under 600 <Col N="988" /> houses.  In spite of that we have a situation where before the end of 1977 we will have more houses built in Dún Laoghaire than were built in the previous 20 years.  In spite of that Deputy Andrews has said that Dún Laoghaire is not getting enough.  This is the story of Fianna Fáil; they are always complaining that enough has not been given but when the figures are issued they find they are talking through their hats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this limited debate we do not cover the whole agricultural field, but in its restricted form the debate covers important sectors of the industry.  I agree with Deputies who suggested that as our most important industry agriculture deserves the best consideration we can give it, and that has been the aim of the Government since they took office.  That has been the aim of the Minister and, naturally, I personally agree that agriculture must be given priority.  It is vitally important that the Government's watchfulness and carefulness should bring about a healthy agricultural sector, and that is what has been happening.  We are all grateful for that.  Many farmers who were in the low income group, comparatively, are now moving upwards, and that is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> One of the main matters adverted to in the debate was animal disease eradication, which I regard as of exceptional importance.  One of the main aims of the Department is to eliminate, or at least to reduce drastically, bovine TB and brucellosis. Evidence of that is available in the fact that since we took office the taxpayers have contributed more than £97 million for this purpose, and there is little doubt inside or outside the House that value has been received for this money.</P>
    <P>It is mandatory on any Government to ensure that money voted for a particular purpose will be gainfully employed, and as far as this Department are concerned, and the Government generally, we have been endeavouring to ensure that value will be received for the money we make available, and we appreciate fully the gravity of our situation if marked progress is not made in the disease eradication programme. Under the new payments scheme in regard to reactor brucellosis cattle, it was represented to the Minister that because of the numbers of cattle reacting in particular herds, grave hardship was being inflicted on the owners of such herds and that it would be a great help if the Department could relieve the financial problems of such herd owners.  Our answer was the sale of cattle to the factories and direct subventions to the owners.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister and the Department felt that because of the numbers of cattle reacting the owners were entitled to extra consideration, and this is being done in this Supplementary Estimate by way of a direct contribution at the expense of the Irish taxpayers of £1 million.  This does not come from Brussels or Luxembourg.  The Government accept the need for this direct contribution from the Irish taxpayers.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the opening stage, the Minister asked the Advisory Council on Animal Health and Disease Eradication to recommend the criteria which should be applied in defining hardship cases and the level of assistance to be given.  I think that was a very fair gesture.  Neither the <Col N="1002" /> Minister nor the Department took it on themselves to establish the criteria for the payment of this hardship money.  Their report is awaited.</P>
    <P>In making this fund available and having regard to the case made by farming organisations that this hardship was widespread and that some of their members would be affected, one would think that those who were not affected would put their hands in their pockets to help their less fortunate neighbours in the same industry.  This fund was open to that kind of supplementary contribution.  Deputy Callanan mentioned today a balancing fund, as he termed it.  He mentioned it on the question of pigs some months ago.  There is nothing to preclude any organisation from supplementing that fund.  If there are, as has been represented, greater numbers of people affected than we are aware of, then the fund could help.  Now of course, we will be getting reports from all around the country of all herds which are seriously affected.</P>
    <P>The system of paying compensation for affected herds or reactors was mentioned by almost all the Deputies on the Opposition side.  They contended that the Department should provide the replacement value of infected cattle.  Never since the scheme was initiated has the replacement value of reactors been paid.  Every Deputy in this House knows that. There was never a question of paying the replacement value of a reactor. How could it be done?  On the assumption that a farmer has a cow, at present day prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How can Fianna Fáil realistically make such an assertion?  That would be tantamount to saying that if I had a cow worth £150 reacting today in my herd I can <Col N="1003" /> go along to the Department and say, &ldquo;Look here, it will take me £250, £275, £300 to replace that cow and I expect you to give me that money.&rdquo; That was never the case.  It could not be the case.  This was the point that was brought out because all the emphasis was on replacement value.</P>
      <P>The State has helped the farming community generously to eradicate this disease by removing the reactors, whether TB or brucellosis reactors.  It is not many years back since I was agitating here for help for owners of brucellosis reactors without getting much satisfaction until recently.  We ignored the brucellosis question for too long a period with the exception of some counties in a particular part of the country.  This was a great disadvantage, but the point I am making to Deputy Leonard and others is that the Department of Agriculture generally down through the years were mindful of the desirability of eradicating TB and in later times brucellosis, as indicated by the payments they make towards that objective.  Ninetyseven million pounds is the net cost to the Department for veterinary expenses and the difference between the prices of reactor animals and the prices obtained from the factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer again to this £1 million.  It must be admitted that it is a generous gesture, generous as can be in the circumstances.  Many people in their business have difficult periods no matter what walk of life they are engaged in, be it farming, any other type of business or even as a worker.  Problems will arise, illness can strike a person, other difficulties can bring about hardship.  It is not too easy in other sectors to get special aids to overcome such hardship.  In the case of the farming community when sections or individual members of them have the misfortune of having reactors on their lands it is difficult and a tremendous disadvantage.  I refer to the small farmer with 15, 16 or 17 cows and the difficulty he has when he calls out the vet, has his animals tested and gets the report back in a few days' time that half that herd reacted. This may happen at this time of year, November, December or January, <Col N="1004" /> and the reacting cows may be due to calve in February, March or April and he would be then looking forward to a big intake of money from the milk of such cattle. There is a great hardship when a farmer's cattle, particularly incalf cows, are stricken with this aliment.  The £1 million is there to help and Deputies opposite and the farmers should be grateful.  I have no doubt that if the boot was on the other foot, so to speak, and if we had a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, from my experience of different Fianna Fáil Ministers down through the years this £1 million would not be there.</P>

We have clean hands so far as this strike is concerned.  £17.8 million was set down in the Book of Estimates for 1976 to be utilised towards the eradication of TB and brucellosis and that all of it was not used was not the fault of the Department, but as Deputy O'Kennedy said, let sleeping dogs lie. Deputy Leonard is anxious to awaken them.</P>

      <P>The Farm Modernisation Scheme was mentioned and people expressed dissatisfaction with the scheme, but this dissatisfaction is not embodied in this Supplementary Estimate.  The House is being asked to pass £2,340,000 in addition to the amount in the original Estimate under the Farm Modernisation Scheme and I know the reason why.  The <Col N="1005" /> favourable prospects in farming over the last year encouraged farmers to invest at a greater scale than was originally envisaged.  As a consequence expenditure on this scheme is running at a higher level than was anticipated when the Estimates were being framed. The farmers have confidence in their future and have invested well over and above what the Department people had anticipated they would in the current year.  We find ourselves in this House on the 16th December passing a Supplementary Estimate of £2.5 million extra under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  That is something we all welcome. I am delighted, and so I am sure are Deputy Leonard and every Member of this House, that the position is thus, that we have so many applications under the scheme that we have to find this money.  We all are aware of the advantages that will accrue to our nation generally and to our farming community and those dependant on them by virtue of this increased injection of public funds and work in development of our farmland.</P>
      <P>The scheme is a relatively new one. All schemes are likely to be amended. The Minister, in reply to questions some time ago, said that the farm modernisation scheme was under constant review by the Department and that the views of farming organisations and others were always welcome.  The interpretation I got from Deputy Callanan's remarks was that we were spending too much time talking to other organisations.  The Minister is quite justified in asking farming organisations and other interested bodies, such as committees of agriculture and so on, for their views on this important question.  It is our job then to try to make the best scheme possible, see what is wrong, see what our committees of agriculture and our farmers say is wrong in the existing scheme and to try to adjust it to our particular standards.  When we have done that we must take it to our European partners and try to get them to agree with suggestions we make for amending the scheme.  That is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as some areas are concerned there might be shortcomings <Col N="1006" /> in the scheme.  Agriculture varies so much all over Ireland that it is very hard to set down a national scheme that will apply to all districts.  The position is far different in Deputy O'Kennedy's constituency than it is in Deputy Leonard's or my constituency. There is a great deal of indifferent land in my area of south-west Cork with low productivity content.  When I travel up to Dublin or when Deputy Leonard travels down from Monaghan we are envious while passing through fertile land having left hand that is not nearly as productive.  I hope Deputy Leonard will excuse me if I made any reflection on the farming activities of Monaghan.</P>

      <P>I am well aware that there are other Supplementary Estimates to be taken.  I was about to conclude my remarks when Deputy Leonard made a comment about the disadvantaged areas and then the Deputy from Laois/Offaly interrupted.  If he had not done so I would have completed my remarks. We have the 12 western counties set down as disadvantaged areas.  That is a great advantage to them.  We have the entire western counties and parts of other counties which are deemed to be severely handicapped areas where the headage grant payments are made.  That is the main crux in this question.  There must be a border somewhere.  One man lives on one side of the border and gets a headage grant of up to £348 and the man who lives on the other side of the border does not get anything.  There may not be much difference between the circumstances of both.  That fact is accepted by me because I can see it in my areas of south-west Cork.</P>
      <P>In south-west Cork the area which is deemed to be severely handicapped benefits very well.  They get their headage payments and they also qualify for unemployment assistance.  The area is divided in west Cork.  The man at the other side of the fence does not get either of those payments.  Deputy Callanan's constituency is quite different.  Those who are deprived of the headage grant because they are outside a severely handicapped area qualify for unemployment assistance under the Department of Social Welfare schemes.  That is not a handicapped area to the same extent as the areas contiguous to centres which qualify for both unemployment assistance and the headage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies who contributed were quite sincere in their remarks and were quite anxious to help.  Their comments will be taken into consideration by the departmental <Col N="1008" /> officers and by the Minister later when making further assessments of our agricultural industry and what should be done for its further improvement.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid. </P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet additional expenditure arising on two existing subheads in the Vote&mdash;for salaries and repatriation of Irish nationals who find themselves in distressed circumstances abroad.  The Supplementary Estimate is also necessary to provide for two new subheads to finance the expenses on the cross-border study of communications and also to pay compensation in respect of death, personal injuries and loss of property arising out of the landmine explosion at Sandyford, County Dublin, in July, 1976, which resulted in the deaths of the British ambassador and the personal secretary to the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Northern Ireland office.  Because of savings which can be effected under other subheads of the Vote in 1976 and of an increase in the anticipated receipts under appropriations-in-aid the Supplementary Estimate will not involve the allocation of any additional grant to the Vote for Foreign Affairs for 1976 other than a token sum of £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase required for the salaries and allowances subhead arises because of devaluation of the £.  Much of this subhead is required to pay the salaries and allowances of officers serving abroad and the decline in <Col N="1009" /> value of the £ during 1976 has resulted in an unavoidable extra cost.</P>
    <P>On the basis of expenditure incurred on repatriation of distressed Irish citizens abroad it is anticipated that the total charge to the subhead will reach £29,000 in 1976.  Approximately 80 per cent of sums advanced for this purpose is recouped in the same financial year so that a proportionate increase is reflected in appropriations-in-aid.  As travel to other countries increases it must be expected that the number of persons applying to our missions abroad for assistance will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>The supplementary provision of £10,000 required for the cross-border study of communications is in respect of consultancy fees due this year for the joint study of cross-border communications in the Derry and Donegal area.</P>
    <P>The Irish and British Governments made a joint approach to the European Commission in November, 1975, to secure a financial contribution by the Community to this study whose terms of reference are &ldquo;to examine communications, including transportation &mdash;for example, roads, railways, ports, airports, telecommunications&mdash;in the Derry and Donegal area in the light of existing projects and plans in order to determine their adequacy and to make recommendations for future development, having regard to financial constraints&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In May, 1976, after consultation between the Governments concerned and the EEC Commission two firms of consultants&mdash;one Irish and one British &mdash;were commissioned to carry out the study.  The consultants, who work under the guidance of a steering group comprising officials of the two Governments and of the EEC Commission, began work in September, 1976.  The study will last about six months and will cost about £70,000.  Fifty per cent of the cost will be borne by Community funds; the remaining 50 per cent will be shared equally between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>The north-west region suffers a twofold disadvantage&mdash;its remoteness on the periphery of north-west Europe and <Col N="1010" /> a political border which has tended to disrupt certain economic relationships between the city of Derry and its natural hinterland in Donegal.  The need for co-operation in overcoming these disadvantages is apparent, particularly in sectors such as communications and transport. The Minister feels that it is appropriate that the European Commission should be associated with this project, which he hopes will make an important contribution to coherent planning for the region as a whole and to the best possible utilisation of the resources of the area.</P>
    <P>The amount of £65,000 required for compensation arises from the landmine explosion at Sandyford, County Dublin, in July, 1976, in which, as I have just said, two persons were killed.  In addition, three persons were injured or severely shocked in the explosion.  The compensation is intended to cover payments to all five families.  The British Government must also be compensated for loss of property in accordance with normal international practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the items in this Supplementary Estimate relates specifically to the tragic event which took place culminating in the death of the British ambassador and his secretary some time ago.  This affords us another occasion on which again to express our regret for that very tragic event and, I may also say, to welcome the arrival of the new ambassador and to express the hope that both countries will continue to work positively and effectively towards eradicating the causes of the terrible problems which in some respects at least were associated however unjustifiably with the death of the late ambassador.  It is appropriate that compensation should be paid and voted by this House in so far as money can ever compensate for such terrible events.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary indicate how the figure of £65,000 was arrived at, how the compensation sums both for those injured and the relatives of those killed were determined and also to what extent this represents the full amount of compensation?  I take it compensation will be payable at some appropriate level to the British Government <Col N="1011" /> but that is not something that concerns us this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I take it I speak the mind of all our people, with the exception of those misdirected and mindless ones, in expressing our sincere regret and in taking note of the fact that money, no matter how much&mdash;even if it were ten times the amount we are voting&mdash;can never compensate the relatives of the people who were killed in that tragic event.  I am sure it further impresses on all of us and on the Government which the late ambassador represented here and on our own Government the need to take and continue to implement positive initiatives so that there will be fully effective harmonious relations between the two countries. This can never be fully realised until such time as the political obligations which rest on both of us can be properly discharged and in that particular connection these obligations obviously point most directly in the first instance to the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To review generally matters covered by this Supplementary Estimate, I see that a considerable amount of it is in respect of salaries, wages and allowances for our representatives abroad and I presume our representatives at various international organisations&mdash; the European Community, the United Nations.  Also, it is in part due to the falling value of sterling, as the Parliamentary Secretary indicated.  To that extent I should like to mention some aspects of the work being undertaken by those representatives and some of the serious issues with which they have been concerned and will no doubt be concerned with in the future.  If there is one issue more than another concerning us in the European Community at present&mdash;though it is not by any means the exclusively important issue&mdash;it is the whole question of the fishery negotiations and the question of our right within the Community to an exclusive zone.  To reiterate what I said in the course of a motion which we had some time ago, far from suggesting that the Minister or his advisers in this area are not properly discharging their responsibilities, I acknowledge the work which his advisers in <Col N="1012" /> Foreign Affairs have done in providing briefs, reports and recommendations to the Minister in the course of the rather protracted negotiations that have being going on.  At the same time, because of the limitations of the staff in that Department, like many others&mdash;I think the personnel of that Department have had to bear the consequences of our expanding involvement in international affairs&mdash;it is unreasonable to expect that those who are there would be able to devote sufficient time, research and study to some of the very serious issues that present themselves to us in specialist areas at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention particularly the legal aspect of the fisheries question.  First, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary will be aware that there has been a very definite change in the attitude of the Commission of the Community over the past few weeks, a change which we note with great concern and with some degree of apprehension.  The change arises from the fact that now that the Commission have got their mandate from the Council on which our Minister represented us they are ignoring the legal obligations on them, our legal rights, and are presenting a much bolder and much less concerned face to us and I am sure to our Minister than they would have presented some three weeks ago before our Minister on our behalf agreed at the Council of Ministers to give them a negotiating mandate with third countries without a guarantee about the internal regime within the Community.</P>
    <P>The spokesman for fisheries from our party and I myself have just returned from discussions with the Commission in Brussels and both of us noted very clearly that even since our last visits the Commission, to say the least of it, are certainly now adopting a much more entrenched attitude than they did before our Minister agreed with the rest of the Council to give that Commission a negotiating mandate with third countries.  They have reached the point when they talk to us now not in terms of the legal rights which we argued with them on this occasion as previously, but in terms of the political realities, the <Col N="1013" /> reality of the support which we could expect at Council level, the reality of the political considerations which the Commission must take into account, in other words, the reality of the political muscle of the major countries within the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to spoil the Christmas spirit by appearing churlish towards the Deputy, whose concern about this matter is well known, but I cannot see that it is in order to introduce the topic of fishery negotiations under the ostensible umbrella of a limited Supplementary Estimate which does not refer to this at all, particularly since this House have very adequately debated this matter this week and last week, apart from any other occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Chair and the Parliamentary Secretary that there will not be a full scale debate on this today because I hope there will be another occasion to do that later.  The Parliamentary Secretary will recognise that because of the importance of this matter and the reply from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who covered a wide range indeed, it is not unreasonable that I should refer to matters which are uppermost in the minds of our people at the moment.</P>
      <P>We are determined that the legal issues involved in the whole question will be fully and properly argued before any action is taken by any commission or council.  We are not satisfied that the Minister has done that adequately or effectively.  We are strongly of the opinion that the Minister has thrown away his trump card in his legal rights and is now relying on the political goodwill of the members of the Community who are naturally looking more to their own political interest than they are to the legal rights and obligations involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to make these points now because it may be some time before our Private Members' Bill will be discussed here.  I will go into further detail on the legal issues involved then. It is important that the personnel in the Department of Foreign Affairs <Col N="1014" /> will research totally and fully all the legal aspects of this in international law.  I am not satisfied the Minister took such a legal approach.  Neither am I satisfied that our rights under the Treaty of Accession and the limitations on the actions now being proposed by the Community under that Treaty have been properly understood either by our Minister or by the Community.  If the Minister had accepted the advice of his Department he would have made this the base of Ireland's case.</P>

I have made my point, and I want to give notice to the Government that the legal issues involved in this question, even though late in the day, will now have to be fully and adequately researched.  Fianna Fáil are undertaking such a detailed research, and I am satisfied we have done more on this than the Government even up to this moment.  When our Private <Col N="1015" /> Members' Bill is resumed in January we will be approaching this very important question strictly on that basis, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, who has some experience in this area, will be here to take note of these legal arguments and we will have the benefit of his views on the issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the vote for £10,000 towards the cost of a study on cross-border communications. If one looks back on the records of this House at the questions to Foreign Affairs, one will see that for the past three years I have been impressing on the Government the need to take effective action to show positive concern to eradicate the basic causes of some of the terrible discontent and violence we have seen in the North.  For one or two years we got no urgent response from the Minister. He indicated that there were negotiations under way with the British Government.  When those negotiations concluded we found that what had been unsatisfactory two years previously, namely, the limited form of studies proposed by the British Government, had to be accepted as satisfactory by our Government.  There were some slight changes: the British Government were proposing studies which were concentrating on the north-east and our Government were concentrating on the north-west.  It is the north-western area with which we are most urgently concerned.</P>
      <P>It did not cover the range of study which we all felt was necessary to get at this problem in any serious and consistent way.  We are dealing only with communications in a limited way and in a limited area.  A lot more will be required, and both Governments must recognise this if we are to take effective steps to get to even some of the root causes of the continuing violence there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace women could set both <Col N="1016" /> Governments an example by showing their concern for youth and community welfare.  Both Governments have sat back from this for a number of years, not because they did not care but because they lacked the conviction and confidence and because they had no consistent programme in this policy area.  When these ladies got their prize in Norway they told us that they were going to devote the proceeds of that and other prizes to developing suitable projects for young people in the troubled areas and even for projects for young people throughout Ireland, to help them understand each other better, to become more tolerant of each other's backgrounds and to fulfil the purposes of the voluntary youth activities we all support.</P>
    <P>If a voluntary group can take that kind of initiative, surely it is not too much to expect the Government to be seen to support that kind of issue.  I go much further than that: I would say that both Governments have a much bigger obligation, and they should have been creating economic conditions and programmes for industrial development and co-operation in many ways&mdash;tourist development, energy co-operation, exploration, fisheries and so on, which are there to be exploited to our mutual economic advantage.  As a consequence of the mutual economic advantage, goodwill and understanding could be developed between both parts of this island.  We are now voting an extra £10,000 towards the studies of the communications in the Derry/ Donegal area.  That sum is inadequate to deal with the root causes of this terrible problem.  We all know that for some time the European Community took the initiative in this area. They said they would make funds available for cross-Border studies in various areas and they waited for both Governments to undertake the necessary studies.  I can recall discussions with the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Commissioner Thomson, three or four years ago in which he indicated that funds were available in the regional affairs commission of the European Community which would finance studies and programmes of this nature, provided both Governments <Col N="1017" /> took the necessary action in making the applications and showed that they had programmes available for which such funds could be allocated.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's Minister stonewalled here on many occasions and gave me the impression that there was no response from the British Government. Six or 12 months later when I was on a deputation to Westminster I found that that was far from being the case and that the British Government had responded and had made proposals which are more on the lines of those we are now acting upon, except that there was a change from the north-west to the north-east.  The Minister conveyed to this House the impression that the British Government were not prepared to act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember answering a number of those questions to the Minister and if I remember rightly the difference was that the British conception of a joint project was an extremely limited one.  I do not remember any difficulty about the north-west or the north-east.  Their projects were very limited and for that reason were of no interest to us, and our very big ones were of no interest to them.  This is a kind of compromise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case why did our Government not publicly state this?  Why did they allow this matter to lie under the carpet for about two years?  Why did we not hear them imploring and demanding of the British Government that they should discharge their responsibilities so that we could discharge ours?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been achieved so far is very limited.  I do not advocate that we should always adopt a high profile, attacking role, but we cannot overlook our responsibilities. County councils, community organisations, peace groups and other groups are showing both Governments concerned just how inadequate, belated and ineffective the steps which the Governments are taking to deal with cross-Border projects are, even by comparison with the limited resources which these bodies have.  Our obligations in this area have not been discharged.</P>
      <P>In relation to the European Community's responsibility in this area it is significant to note that the purpose of the European Community originally was above all else to create conditions of peace within the states of that community.  Whatever their other shortcomings the community has at least been eminently successful, with the terrible exception of our country, in ensuring that wars such as we saw in 1914, 1918, 1939, 1945 and for generations before that will not recur in the community.</P>
      <P>Since we joined the European Community they have made funds available to us for studies so as to eradicate the causes of violence in the last area where violence is occurring, the North of Ireland.  The Community recognised that this obligation rested upon them and it is consistent with the purpose of the European Community, and consistent with their obligations to both Governments provided both Governments recognised their own obligations and acted upon them.  Had we taken the necessary steps to promote proper studies on a wider range, and obliged the British Government to agree to whatever we thought necessary, we would not now be talking in terms of an extra £10,000 for a study in the Donegal/ Derry area; we would probably be talking in terms of voting perhaps an extra £2 million to match what the British Government and the European Community were providing, not just for studies but for projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> Three or four years later we find ourselves still at that very limited stage, as if we did not even have an awareness of how real this problem was.  From now on I hope the Government will show a greater degree of determination in this, and in other areas.  If the case is made that the British Government are not responding significantly, our Government have the obligation publicly to state this position, so that the British Government can be seen to be reneging on their obligations.</P>
    <P>These are fundamental obligations which both Governments can discharge in harmony.  The non-cooperation of the British Government could be seen as a rejection of their obligations.  Funds coming from the regional fund allocation of the European Parliament will back the sums which we are now making available for cross-Border projects.  There are some suggestions within the European Community to the effect that in the reallocation of commission portfolios, the regional portfolio as we have known it, may be amalgamated with some other portfolio that is conveniently called &ldquo;some other spending portfolio&rdquo;.  That would be of very great concern to this country.</P>
    <P>We want to put on the record that up to now the regional policy has not been anything like what we expected it would be.  Although it is not in our power to ensure it does not happen, we would oppose any steps that would mean that the regional portfolio would be downgraded by being associated in a lesser way with another portfolio.  I realise that what we say is not a guarantee that our wishes will be met, but at least we want to say in advance before the decisions are taken regarding any allocations that we oppose absolutely and without any qualification any move that will mean that the regional policy will be downgraded. We all know it has not been implemented to the extent consistent with the Community's aims or with the promises made at various summit meetings.  We want to see further progress, not a diminution of that responsibility.</P>

      <P>As we are voting here for studies for cross-Border co-operation in the communications area, I presume it is appropriate to refer to co-operation between both Governments in many other areas and I want to make a brief reference to one aspect.  If we think the purpose for which this Estimate is intended, namely, communications in cross-Border areas, can be looked at in isolation we are being unrealistic.  I was concerned this morning to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> a report regarding the treatment of Irish prisoners in English jails.  A solicitor said that there would seem to be &ldquo;serious cause for concern&rdquo;.  The article was written by a Scottish solicitor in the <i>Law Guardian,</i> the journal of the Law Society in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to have harmonious relationships between the Governments, activities of the kind alleged to have taken place must be fully examined to ensure that fundamental rights and justice which all of us want in the North and elsewhere will be guaranteed and implemented.  If we want to ensure that we work together towards progress, we must insist that <Col N="1021" /> activities of the kind mentioned in the newspapers&mdash;if the report is accurate; certainly it is set out in great detail&mdash; will be stopped immediately.  Our Government should be seen to act immediately to have the fullest possible inquiries directed against the inhuman treatment of Irish prisoners, whether it concerns those who were convicted or who are awaiting trial.  It is totally pointless for us to vote for cross-Border co-operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply saying that we are trying to bring about a reconciliation between both islands and between North and South. That is the purpose of this cross-Border co-operation and the Parliamentary Secretary has acknowledged that.  We will be closing our eyes if we do not realise that such a report, if it is well-founded, does great damage to any form of reconciliation.  It is important that we be consistent in our approach in this area.  I hope that when we return after the Christmas recess the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to report to the House on the responses to the inquiries which I am now requesting the Government to make in connection with what has been reported.  I was informed this morning that I could not put down a Special Notice Question in relation to the matter in view of the fact that the matters referred to have taken place, although it appears from the report that they may be continuing.</P>
      <P>I want to make a reference in relation to the proceedings in the European Parliament in the last few days where a number of our officers and servants are engaged effectively.  It is regrettable in the extreme that representatives of the British Government party should have responded yesterday as they did to ordinary positive criticisms of the attitude of the British Government towards monetary compensatory amounts.

I do not think it appropriate to say more at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, after listening to Deputy O'Kennedy I have to say I agree with a great deal of what he said.  He always makes his statements very temperately and with the minimum of excuse for anyone to take offence at his words.  I agree specifically with what he last said, which the Chair ruled out of order, in regard to the report in today's papers. I accept unreservedly the implications he drew from such a situation, if true, being allowed to remain undealt with. When the Minister returns in a few days from the Soviet Union, I will make sure that this matter is brought to his attention so that he can consider what appropriate action, if any, he may take about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy expressed his welcome, a courtesy which I am sure will not go unremarked, to the new ambassador from Britain who has replaced Mr. <Col N="1023" /> Ewart Biggs who was so tragically murdered.  He asked specific questions about this matter.  First, he asked how the figure of £65,000 was arrived at. I should like to ask the Deputy's indulgence in this regard.  I have actually got the approximate individual heads of the figure but I would rather not disclose them to the House. They are not earth-shaking in any way and there is nothing embarrassing to the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I do not necessarily want a public reply from the Parliamentary Secretary. I simply want to be assured the figure was arrived at after some decisive calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The five different parties involved in the compensation accepted a compensation informally arrived at.  Four of them had originally indicated their intention of asking for their statutory entitlement under our law.  The Ewart Biggs family were not involved in that.  All five ultimately agreed to accept compensation informally calculated and I can assure the Deputy the very best and most experienced advice was obtained to arrive at the figures.  The informal mode of concluding our compensation has the additional advantage that it will not result in any abatement of the claims they may have on the British Government, whereas, on the advice we got, it was possible that compensation arrived at by arbitration might have resulted in such abatement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the underlying cause and problem and the initiatives which might be necessary, the Deputy has repeatedly here, on behalf of his party, urged what he calls positive initiatives.  I do not want to impute anything except a sincere interest to that suggestion but positive initiatives when one is dealing with a large population many of whom, if not most of whom, would fight rather than meet us have to be a little different from positive initiatives when dealing with people who will fight one rather than do business with one. There is also a strong doubt in my <Col N="1024" /> mind as to whether any sort of positive initiatives which would bring a democratic, peaceful solution would result in the sort of solution which would satisfy the type of people who murder people like Mr. Ewart Biggs. I cannot think of any solution in the North of Ireland which will put to rest such savage hearts as those.  I am sorry to put it so bluntly.  I can well imagine that a peaceful initiative and a peaceful solution will, please God, one day soon mean that the populations now alienated from one another in the North will live in peace but there will remain a section which believes, as far as I can see, in violence for its own sake, a section which exists and gets its delight and satisfaction out of applying violence, a violence which has disclosed in the history of Europe new dimensions of horror.  I do not turn my back on initiatives towards peaceful solutions but I cannot see that those people will be switched off overnight.  I wish I shared the Deputy's optimism in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not suggest it would happen overnight but, even if it is a long process, it should be started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recognise that in the history of all countries, including this, when a peaceful solution is arrived at there is always a minority which says it is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very defeatist approach.  If that were true, there would be no peace in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not defeatist.  I would not have mentioned this were it not that the Deputy attached his argument to the tail end of his very creditable remarks about the late British ambassador.  It would be a mistake to suppose that any sort of peaceful solution will rid us immediately of people like that because these people never get to the stage where their characters will change overnight or even over a longer period and the very fact that their neighbours were satisfied would almost guarantee that they would not be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> The Deputy managed to slip in, under cover of the Chair's benevolence, some remarks on the fishery matter which has been very carefully thrashed out in both Houses in the last couple of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>And there is more to come, I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that his remarks represent an <i>ex parte</i> statement as he returns hotfoot from Brussels and all I am willing to do at the moment is to assure him that the Minister is absolutely satisfied about the correctness of his legal advice and it would be counter-productive to make bogus legal arguments of the kind I have heard rattled in my ears over the last few days here and in the Seanad.  However, if the Deputy is able when the House resumes to produce his own legal arguments showing ours are not good enough and can be improved on, we will certainly take them up.  If the Deputy and his party are able to do better in the national interest than the Minister's advisers, we will not begrudge them credit for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has very frequently raised here questions of North-South joint projects.  It fell to me on two or three occasions to answer questions from the Deputy on this when the Minister was away and the line the Deputy used to take in the past was to ask why we were not seeking to exploit EEC sources which were willing, as the Deputy rightly says, to put money into these joint projects.  The answer I have to give him is that the European Community has in mind projects about which there is agreement between the two parties on each side of the Border.  There is no country in Europe in quite the same position as Ireland where the Border is concerned and the Deputy knows that quite well.  There is no boundary in Europe that is so embittered.  It is easy to say rhetorically that any bitterness in the North does not approach the bitterness felt between the French and the Germans or the Germans and the Dutch.  That was so in the past but it is not so now and the fact that the <Col N="1026" /> Germans and the French have come to live easily with one another cannot be attributed solely to cross-Border projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am on record, for what it is worth, as having urged for years before the trouble started in the North the development of cross-Border projects; that was as far back as 1967 and 1968.  I published various articles, while there was still time, on the development of cross-Border projects and the intensification under official approval of town twinning projects and so on, all of which went by the board when the shots started to reverberate.  I do not depart one inch from the Deputy in his anxiety that these things should happen, but I do not think he is giving enough attention to the fact that if we press too publicly and stridently for the implementation of cross-Border projects it will be misunderstood and misrepresented by large numbers in the North who are only looking for an opportunity to misrepresent and misunderstand whatever we do.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £8,700,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants. </P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet increased expenditure on all three sections of the Social Welfare Vote for the current year.  Under the section for administration&mdash;subheads A to D&mdash;the additional expenditure amounts to £878,000.  For social insurance&mdash;subheads E and F&mdash; the supplementary provision is £1,109,000, while the extra amount required for social assistance&mdash;subheads G to L&mdash;is £7,181,000, making a gross total of £9,168,000.  There is, however, an increase of £468,000 in receipts from appropriations-in-aid&mdash; subhead M&mdash;which falls to be deducted from the gross total thus reducing the additional requirement on the Vote to £8,700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional £878,000 required to meet the increased cost of administration includes arrears of £1,000,000 due to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of payment for postal services provided for my Department in 1974 and 1975, and £250,000 to <Col N="1028" /> meet increases under the 17th round wage agreement.  These increases are offset by savings on staff costs generally and on overtime, medical certification and computer services.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1,109,000 required for social insurance is the additional amount payable by the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund to meet the deficit on the workings of the fund. The cost of the general increases in the rates of benefit granted in April last and increases in long-term benefits and pensions in October, together with other improvements in social insurance schemes during the past year is £21,427,000.  In addition, however, an increase in the number of claims to benefit resulted in additional expenditure of £3,637,000 bringing the total additional expenditure out of the fund to £25,064,000.  The main items of increased expenditure due to improved rates of benefit and other improvements in social insurance schemes are £6,845,000 for unemployment benefit, £3,755,000 for old age contributory pensions, £3,400,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions and £1,730,000 for retirement pensions.  In this connection Deputies will recollect that the duration of unemployment benefit was extended by three months to 15 months as from April last while at the same time the duration of pay-related benefit was similarly extended by three months.  The cost of these extensions this year is estimated at £3,500,000 for unemployment benefit and £1,000,000 for pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>On the income side there has been an increase of £22,200,000 in receipts from contributions payable by employers and employees while increased income from investments, and by way of transfers from other countries under reciprocal agreements, amount to £87,000, making a total of £22,287,000.  After making allowance for the sum of £1,668,000 which was overdrawn from the Exchequer at the 31st December, 1975, the additional amount payable by the Exchequer this year to the Social Insurance Fund is £1,109,000.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the additional expenditure required in the Supplementary <Col N="1029" /> Estimate relates to social assistance and amounts to £7,181,000.  This additional expenditure has arisen mainly from the increases in assistance payments, including non-contributory pensions, granted in April and October, 1976, at a total cost of £9,247,000.  This amount is, however, offset by savings of £365,000 on old age non-contributory pensions, £500,000 on children's allowances, £238,000 on widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions, £759,000 on miscellaneous grants and £204,000 on social assistance allowances, totalling £2,066,000.</P>
    <P>The increase of £468,000 in appropriations-in-aid, arises mainly from increased administration costs on the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes which have to be refunded from the Social Insurance and Occupational Injuries Funds.</P>

      <P>On the basis that I have only two minutes to reply on this Supplementary Estimate for a sum of £8,700,000, it would be somewhat of a charade for me to engage in a disputation&mdash;of course I reserve my right to speak of these additional expenses on another occasion: There is also the consideration that there is an additional Estimate to be introduced.  I have just one question to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I notice that under the heading of social assistance he is seeking approximately £9,500,000 extra.  The Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Act was passed by this House in an unseemly hurry in the middle of this year and can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us when that Act will become effective? As we know, this Act was brought in to abandon the social assistance scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The order I made directed the Revenue Commissioners to restrict deliveries for home use of spirits to the quantities which appeared to them to be reasonable having regard to the circumstances.  This was a precautionary measure and in accordance with well established practice in the period running up to a budget.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the order may in certain cases create some difficulties for traders insomuch as they in turn may be obliged to restrict their customers to quantities normal for this season of the year, but I am satisfied that in their application of my direction the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to consider the position of any manufacturer or trader in whose case special treatment appears to be warranted.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are not discriminating in any way as between Irish-made and imported spirits.  The order came into force on 6th December, 1976, and prior to that date there was no limit on clearances from bond either of Irish-made or imported spirits.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, we deplore violations of human rights wherever they occur.  The breaking-off of diplomatic relations is not among the measures we would propose to undertake as a general rule in cases of this nature.  Apart from any other considerations, it has to be borne in mind that such drastic action would not be <Col N="993" /> in the interests of the very people whom we wish to protect.</P>
    <P>As to the particular case of Argentina, I understand that a team from Amnesty International recently visited that country and I await their report with interest.  Judging from previous experience, it is likely that this report will be submitted to the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, who may propose that a full UN investigation into allegations of violations of human rights, on the lines of a similar one at present working on the human rights situation in Chile, be carried out.  We would, of course, support the establishment of such an investigation if the evidence adduced by the Amnesty team and the conclusions of the UN Commission on Human Rights point to its necessity.  In general, we would consider action at international level, whether in the framework of the United Nations or through applicable regional arrangements for protection of human rights, the most appropriate way for dealing with any systematic violation of these rights.</P>
