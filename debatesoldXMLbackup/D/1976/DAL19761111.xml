    <Title>Building Societies Bill, 1975 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I said we should put the full emphasis on house building when discussing building societies because the reason for their establishment was to help house purchasers.  Having regard to the modern concept of the building societies and to the fact that housing is a very pressing problem, we should try to establish a bill of rights for people, particularly young couples, who wish to build their own houses. In this connection the building societies would have an important part to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways this Bill will help the societies to play a more vital and important part.  Although the Bill has been described as a technical one, nevertheless there are safeguards written into it for all those involved, whether borrowers or people who invest their money.  At the same time I am not suggesting it is a perfect Bill and I should like to see some changes made.  We want the emphasis to be put on house building and we want to ensure that the best possible terms are made available to the borrowers of loans.  The building societies must be efficient and well run, and if this Bill helps them in that way we will <Col N="1502" /> be doing a good day's work in discussing and debating it.</P>
    <P>The role of the registrar and his possible removal by the Government makes me rather uneasy.  The registrar will be the kingpin in the whole operation of the building societies and it is essential that he be given confidence and that his possible removal from office should be protected by legislation. That person should have confidence that he is in his position with some degree of permanence so that he may be fearless in his handling of this legislation and of the powers the Oireachtas will confer on him.</P>
    <P>I realise a Bill cannot set out interest rates, that outside events will influence the rates charged, but there is an opportunity for the Government to control or at least alleviate in some way the high interest rates.  If a person finds that the interest rates are too high for him, obviously he cannot afford to borrow.  This will have a depressing effect on the house construction industry because the demand for houses or flats will fall.  The state of depression that exists in the industry will continue.  One reason for the present sorry state of the industry is that people cannot afford to take up the loans offered in many cases.  Those who can borrow are usually earning rather high salaries.</P>
    <P>Under section 77 the Minister can regulate to a great extent where the money goes and how much of it is spent.  He can order the maximum loan a society may make, the purposes for which loans may or may not be made by a society and the maximum amount that a society may lend to a body corporate and the total amount of such loans.  The Bill is attempting to emphasise that control over where the money is spent is essential.  The building societies are a business enterprise and they may want to spend money in a way some of us would not consider desirable.  Most people are of the opinion that the emphasis should be put on house building.</P>
    <P>The house building industry is regarded as a kind of national barometer of prosperity or otherwise.  If we inject more money into that industry we will have a better society because people <Col N="1503" /> will be housed decently and there will be a high employment content.  We must ask ourselves if we have done something to improve the housing scene.  Are we making it easier for young people to obtain loans?</P>
    <P>We have got rid of most of the slum housing but we must face the fact that there is a great problem of overcrowding.  In many cases young couples are forced to live with their families or to have to share flats at exorbitant rents in the &ldquo;flatland&rdquo; areas of this and other cities.  This is one of the biggest problems facing the community.  There should be an effort by the Government, local authorities and commercial interests to direct all their energies and all the money they can into a greater housing drive.</P>
    <P>This Bill will improve some aspects of the housing problem.  On Committee Stage we will state more fully where we want to see specific changes made.  Many people, both inside and outside the House, would like to regard this Bill as a catalyst for further progress. At times we talk glibly about solving the housing problem but I do not think it can ever be solved completely. However, the building societies solve the problem for some people. While it may be a headache to meet the repayments, at least people have got a dwelling and can look forward to as happy a life as can anybody. Therefore, I welcome section 77 and some of its provisions.</P>
    <P>With regard to advertising, perhaps the Minister would let us know if advertising can be controlled.  Some advertising control is necessary.  However, when a society commences business how can they attract members unless they advertise?  I appreciate the Minister's concern that advertising cannot be allowed to go wildly ahead. But I would suggest that there be, as most reputable firms have now, an ethical code under which they would not falsely advertise, under which also there would be a very high standard, as obtains in most of the advertising agencies.  I would urge the implementation of such a code of ethics with emphasis being placed on the fact that <Col N="1504" /> what the societies say they will do, they will do for borrowers.  That is why also I speak continually about a fixed interest rate.  Perhaps this is a very elusive star we are chasing.  It is very difficult to control interest rates because there are so many external factors affecting money values.  We know very well that if UK interest rates rise and we lag behind, then there will be an outflow of money from here.  Therefore, we have got to be competent and competitive in these matters.  But I see an opportunity for central Government to influence such matters to the extent they can, perhaps by offering some subsidy to borrowers.  In that way repayments could be kept under some control and there would not be the worry hanging over many people that they cannot afford to continue meeting the repayments when the family comes along.</P>
    <P>The Government, in considering the next budget and when they speak of children's allowances, as they did recently, might endeavour to give some relief to those people with young families in regard to their housing loans.  The best investment one can make in any country or society is in the family.  In the future if the Government cannot see their way to granting a general subsidy to borrowers they might consider giving some additional children's allowances in the case of people who would not qualify for a Small Dwellings Act loan and who must go to commercial interests to borrow.  There might well be written into the Bill the suggestion that, for each child, some State aid be given.  This might appear to be contrary thinking to statements made last week about children's allowances, about which, I was glad to see, the Tánaiste spoke.  Far from cutting back on children's allowances I would suggest that, in the case of borrowers of building society or insurance company loans, the State would say: &ldquo;You have got two, three or four children; we recognise you have got added burdens in meeting your repayments; the State will ensure that you will not have to default on your repayments because of the added expense with regard to your children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would <Col N="1505" /> examine the points I have made.  He might examine in particular the set of rules which surround the appointment and maintenance of the registrar. I am sure the Minister realises how important it is that we have the best possible person as registrar, that he be given every encouragement to perform that task well because on him will evolve to a great extent the success or otherwise of this Bill. Politicians in their calling are never given that sense of security.  We have got to report to the people every couple of years and they deal with us as they see fit.  I do not think we should apply that principle to a person such as the registrar because he has to plan ahead, to ensure that the legislation at his disposal is utilised.  He will realise the great part he plays in ensuring that the wishes of the Oireachtas, as stated in this Bill, are applied to the purposes for which they were meant, that is, the betterment of finances for housing purposes.</P>
    <P>I know that building societies have been criticised for having engaged in too much advertising and for having too many premises.  I cannot speak on either criticism because I do not know the true position in this respect.  However, there seems to be general concern about those matters.  The building societies can answer that criticism.</P>
    <P>In view of the ever changing housing scene, when this Bill has been in practice for a few years we might review it again.  Building societies have been a long time in existence.  The Minister said he hoped this Bill would stand us as well as Acts passed a hundred years ago. Certainly in that period we have seen tremendous changes.  We shall probably see a lot more in the next century.  But our immediate concern is for the thousands of people who still have not got proper homes. Our concern also is that the building societies will be enabled to play a greater part in the overall building scene.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider the suggestions I have made this morning.  They were made in the hope that they might improve the Bill and in that way be of aid to the people <Col N="1506" /> we all want to help: those still seeking proper housing conditions by ways of loans from building societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House more than five or ten minutes because there have already been a large number of contributors to this debate.  If it seems to the Ministers that Members on this side of the House are getting up <i>ad nauseam</i> speaking about high mortgage rates, that will merely serve to emphasise what I believe the Minister knows already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually they have not.  There has only been one contribution about the high mortgage rates because it is not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle agrees, I have no objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow the Deputy to develop his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible for young people today to buy a house because of the high mortgage rates. It would be a great help to them if building societies could be encouraged to even have a lower rate at the outset and gradually build the rate up. Mortgage rates are at the highest when people first get married and have a young family.  I understand from many of my colleagues that their concern is the high interest rates. Deputy Moore seemed to me to be talking about this point.  We are not making any great contribution towards encouraging building societies to lower those rates at the outset when people first purchase their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people buy their houses today they think they are buying them over 25 years.  They have an extension of, perhaps, five years to accommodate them for the higher rate and possibly a further extension so that their payments do not go up. It seems as if the grandchildren of many of those householders will be paying for those houses.  Those people <Col N="1507" /> will never own them in their lifetime. The Minister should maintain subsidies to the building societies to enable them to have their rates a little lower because of the high competition there is for funds.  We know how essential it is that the building societies keep receiving a vast proportion of private moneys which are available for investment. They have to compete with other institutions.  Every encouragement must be given to building societies because of the importance of the building industry in relation to employment and also providing the basic necessity for our people, a roof over their heads.</P>
    <P>One of the fears we have in relation to this Bill is the number of Ministers involved and, in particular, the work of the registrar of building societies. This creates a certain element of Parkinson's Law where we have an increase all the time in the number of people in the various departments working on this aspect of the public service.  We should try to keep our public service expenditure down as low as possible.  We should try to ensure that the existing staff can cope with the extra work involved and not go out of our way to increase the public service, which has shown a vast increase in the past three years. It is very important to have a registrar where the people's money is invested so that the Central Bank can keep an eye on building societies.</P>
    <P>We have a very good record in this country in relation to the way building societies look after people's money. We have to watch very carefully that we do not build up another department of State where a large number of people will be involved in the administration aspect of building societies. It is important that the Central Bank take this under its wing just like they do with the banks at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister on Second Reading said that the deposits of building societies lodged with the Central Bank would get current interest rates.  It is important that they receive a rate of interest which is equivalent to an investment from the State towards housing.  Building societies should be <Col N="1508" /> encouraged to put their money into housing.  In the past they have had to invest in other ventures in order to get money in because very often property development encourages outside money to come in.  Property development in the past has been most profitable for investment.  It will not be necessary for building societies to invest in very large enterprises if there is a continuous subsidisation of mortgage rates.  When we were in Government we listened to a constant barrage of criticism of the building societies by the people who are now in Government.  Since they came into power they have probably learned a lot about the difficulties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe on the Bill before us.  General housing does not arise.  The Deputy should await the Minister's Estimate to deal in detail with housing.  On this occasion we must confine our remarks to what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister raised this and you should direct your remarks <Col N="1509" /> to him and not to me.  The Minister made a point.  I would expect that three years from now&mdash;we will be back in Government by then&mdash;there will be a different story.  A lot of work goes into planning, the time applications are made for sites, builders tenders are sent in and the houses are actually built.  We talk about 90,000 houses built over a period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting back into an area I advised him to keep away from, general housing. It is not relevant to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is well made and I look forward, in three years time, to checking back the record in housing from 1975 to 1978.  We know that the building industry is in dire straits since this Government took office.  I want to see greater encouragement to young people to buy their houses by way of lower interest rates where possible provided by the building societies through Government subsidisation and some scheme where the scales are lower at the beginning and possibly rising later on towards the end of payments when most families are grown up and educated and are on their own feet.</P>
      <P>Every day I meet people who have this terrible problem of trying to buy their houses and I do not know how they can do it.  It seems to be a frightening prospect.  God only knows what it is going to be like if the present trend continues.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, we welcome this Bill, as the Minister knows, but there are certain improvements we feel can be made which our spokesman, Deputy Faulkner, has outlined.  On Committee Stage we will go into greater detail and I hope the Minister will be in a receptive mood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and the Minister was talking about the clawback.  It would be a 66p to 71p increase; he was talking about how reasonable a man he was.  If he called himself a modest man I would agree with him because he has a lot to be modest about, but he does not call himself a modest man, he calls himself a reasonable man.  That I cannot agree with.  Other than that, I would like the subsidy to continue to the building societies so that they would be able to give loans at a lower rate of interest. The young people should be borne in mind very much in their present difficulties.</P>

      <P>Some city Deputies may wonder what interest a rural Deputy would have in building societies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now.  I welcome the Bill and I want to state why I am so interested in it.  It is applicable to rural Ireland as well as to urban Ireland.  Unfortunately, anyone looking for a loan now to build a house must go to the building societies because he cannot get a local authority loan unless he has a very low income.  I welcome the Bill if it is going to improve the situation as regards the building societies.  One thing that worries people in the country who want to build their houses and who may have a suspicion of building societies is that the Minister refuses to raise the income qualification and to raise the local authority loan.  If you get a loan from the local authority you pay it over 35 years, you pay principal and interest together and the interest is always the same.  If you get a loan from a building society, as stated by Deputy Briscoe, the interest is likely to go up from time to time and therefore the length of time for repayment has to be extended.  If you get a loan from a building society <Col N="1511" /> you do not know who is going to finish up paying it; it may be your son or your grandson.  I am lucky to have a local authority loan over a number of years and this can be paid in certain types of instalments, quarterly or half-yearly and the interest rate on that is not going to change.  This facility is excellent for the ordinary person in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is another type of control which I would like to see under this Bill.  Up to very recently if a person applied for a building society loan unless he had some investment in the building society he would be refused, as happened time and time again. These are the reasons that I am so interested in this Bill which goes a long way to control building societies. As I have said, I regret that we have to depend entirely on building societies now.  The interest rates being charged by the building societies probably have to be high to cover expenses.  The most important point in the Minister's statement is in regard to the control of costs, about which there may be suspicion. For instance, every newspaper here carries advertising by building societies.  I suppose that in order to get the required money from investors advertising is essential.  But I know of people who have loans from building societies or are trying to get them and they see building society advertisements on television every night and they say: &ldquo;Where the hell is the cost of all these advertisements to come from?  We could get a cheaper loan if they were cut down&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing in the Minister's statement is this question of directors' interest and loans.  I welcome this because a lot of people are suspicious today that there is a certain amount of low standards in high places and people want to get rich quickly because they are members of companies or societies connected with money. This is something we must get out of people's minds once and for all.  I welcome the clause which controls the directors' salaries, interest and the bigger type of loans which they may get from the building societies.  This will give the public confidence that <Col N="1512" /> loans are issued as cheaply as is possible. The principal concern of the ordinary person looking for a loan from a building society is the rate of interest.  We are doing our best to get people who should be able to build their own houses to do so.</P>
    <P>I have stated in this House time and time again that the policy of local authorities is to bring people into villages and towns and this is something I am totally against.  As I said yesterday when speaking on the ESB Bill, people should be encouraged to build their houses out in the country. To be fair to the local authorities, they have built a lot of rural houses but the housing estate seems to be the general trend.  As the Minister knows, the building of houses out in the country helps to eliminate the pollution problem.  Therefore money should be available for people to build their own houses.  I am surprised at the Minister because I think he should be interested in the type of people I am talking about and he should be helping them to build their own houses.  He is pushing them over to building societies instead of allowing the local authority to give larger loans and to raise the income qualification for local authority loans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Callanan should remember that we are discussing SDA loans.  Farmers of a suitable valuation still have the right to get SDA loans.  That applies in a big way and he should know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will bear with me for a moment&mdash;if a person's income exceeds £2,350 it does not matter a damn from what source he gets the loan.  He is debarred from a local authority loan and the Minister knows that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about a farmer's son who gets a site from the farmer to live in the country where he was born and reared.  This young man now has to go to a building society.  If his salary is over £2,350 <Col N="1513" /> he does not get a loan from the local authority.  As the Minister knows, the majority of home places on farms have either been reconstructed or a new house built.  There are very few thatched houses where farmers live nowadays.  Farmers' sons are leaving Galway city and Ballinasloe and getting a site from their fathers to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, probably working in Galway city or Ballinasloe but they want to live in the environment where they were reared.  If they look for a local authority loan but their incomes are over £2,350 they cannot get it.  At the present rate of inflation the Minister knows that that amount is a miserable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is not coming out of this argument very well.  I know a lot about this subject because I have been around a long time, although I have not been in this House too long.</P>
      <P>I welcome anything in this Bill that will help keep down the expenses of building societies, to control them and to give people confidence in them. If people apply to building societies for loans they should know that this money will be given to them as cheaply as possible, taking inflation into account. The parts of the Bill to which I referred, the interest of directors and getting interest on larger loans, were mentioned in the Minister's brief. They would not be mentioned there if something had not been happening.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that a man who is not in business in a big way gets the same fair play as the big businessman. I want to see that happening in building societies.  It happened all the time in local authorities.  I assume this Bill will ensure that we all get a fair deal from building societies.  I have heard of people being refused a loan because they did not have an investment in the building societies.  Will that be done away with in this Bill or must a person have an investment in the society before he gets a loan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a shortage of money and there are more applicants than there is money available, then those who have investments will get preference and rightly so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not expect an unfortunate young person, in an ordinary job, who has got a large loan from the building society and will have to put up a certain amount himself, say for the ESB, to have saved a few thousand pounds to invest in a building society.</P>

The most they could save would be £1,000 and to them that would be equivalent to £1 million.  They get married and borrow on the strength of their jobs.  They cannot invest in building societies.  Of course, I see the Minister's point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to push too many people back on the local authorities who are doing a very good job.  They are housing all they possibly can but people must be encouraged to build their own homes.  If this Bill helps make building societies better and gives people confidence to borrow, I welcome it.  It is only fair when you welcome a Bill that you also point out the snags.  I have always done that.  It does not matter who is sitting on the Government benches, let it be <Col N="1516" /> one of my own Ministers, I would still do the very same thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the activities of building societies have greatly expanded in recent years and as more and more money is invested in them, it is only right that the State should tighten up legislation on building societies who are the caretakers of this money.  The Minister referred to the expansion of building societies in recent years but he did not mention the number of societies that might have collapsed.  He did not mention the number of societies that have collapsed in recent years.  There were, I believe, at least two.  This is another reason why we need legislation tightened up.  Building societies use money in many ways and some of the ways tend to be a little questionable. It is good to see building societies grow.  It is good to see them expanding into growth areas because that gives investors confidence in these societies but we must have a balance and I welcome anything that will ensure that balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to advertising, people tell me they invest in these building societies because of the return they get.  They also feel they are helping in the provision of houses.  A balance with regard to advertising would be a good thing because advertising is very costly indeed.  Some advertising is essential but, more important, is continued <Col N="1517" /> confidence on the part of the people in the building societies.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make investments in building societies more secure.  I think the State must do a little more here. It must help borrowers so that building societies will have more money to generate housing demand and create more industry.  How can the State help borrowers?  It can do it by helping people to provide their own homes. That could be done by way of grants. Regrettably, instead of making more grants available, the very opposite has happened.  For the first time ever, since January we have had a means test.  The supplementary grant is completely out of date.  Costs have jumped and one would imagine the Minister would be concerned to update the grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling.  In recent years the demands on building societies for the provision of houses have increased but there does not seem to be sufficient capital available to meet those demands.  This is regrettable.  I believe the State should play a bigger part and building societies should not play too big a part. There should be a proper State scheme of loans and grants operated in conjunction with the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mortgages are a heavy burden. Mortgagees are finding it increasingly difficult to meet the burden of repayments, the more so when those repayments are continually rising.  Subsidies must be introduced to reduce the interest rates.  This would be beneficial to the societies, to the investors and to the whole country.  At the moment there never seems to be an end to increases in interest rates and having to <Col N="1518" /> meet these increases reduces the quality of life for mortgagees and that in turn means they lose drive and initiative. That may not be altogether the fault of the building societies, but something will have to be done to help these people to meet these constantly rising repayments.  Interest rates will have to be subsidised.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for people on low incomes to obtain mortgages because they would not be able to meet the repayments demanded of them.  Here the SDA loan scheme should come in. It is difficult to discuss this measure because of all the factors involved without sailing a little close to the wind and that inevitably leads to one being ruled out of order.  I would like to see the Minister involved in subsidies designed to reduce interest rates.  I would like to see a proper system of grants.  A grant towards the initial deposit would be invaluable because a larger initial deposit would help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Deputies for the way in which they have received the Bill. Naturally I am glad to hear so many compliments paid to the work that has gone into the preparation of this measure.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what I have heard that we are all in agreement about the need for this Bill.  This is not a political measure.  It is a measure which affects everybody involved in a building society, as it affects all Members and their constituents.  It is the aim and object of the Dáil, as it was of the Seanad to make the Bill as good as it possibly can be made.  I accept the criticisms as the points of view of Members.  They made these criticisms in the hope that they would improve the Bill in the way in which they thought it should be improved.  While I cannot agree with a number of the criticisms made I appreciate that most of them were aimed at improving the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Member, Deputy Ray Burke, made a sweeping and, in my opinion, quite unwarranted attack on the societies. I shall deal later with the points raised by him, but I would like to <Col N="1519" /> point out now the danger that unjustified and unjustifiable attacks of the kind made by him might damage confidence in the building society movement, the success of which is completely dependent upon public confidence.  Such damage could have very serious consequences affecting the inflow of funds and the amount available to finance the housing programme.</P>
    <P>I shall, I hope, deal with most of the points raised.  I have picked out what I think are the most important points but, if I miss out any, I would be grateful if Members would draw my attention to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Fitzpatrick referred critically to the various controls proposed in the Bill. The Bill proposes to give four different authorities specific areas of control over the activities of the societies&mdash;the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government, the Central Bank and the Registrar of Building Societies. When the Bill was discussed in the Seanad considerable pressure was brought to bear on me to delete all forms of ministerial control and to place the responsibility of overseeing the societies on the Central Bank and the registrar, who would then be an independent almost judical, functionary. This proposition could not be accepted in the Seanad and it cannot be accepted in the Dáil.  Responsibility for questions of policy and for subordinate legislation, in the form of statutory rules and regulations, must be vested in a Minister responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas and able to explain, and defend, if necessary, all his policies and regulations in the Dáil and the Seanad.  The executive functions of day-to-day supervision of societies properly rests with the registrar who will be given no less independence in the discharge of these functions than his counterpart in the United Kingdom who was held up in the Seanad as an example to be copied here.  To the limited extent that the societies are part of the second level banking system and custodians of more than £350 million of our people's savings, it is proper that the Central <Col N="1520" /> Bank should have directive and sanctioning powers over certain of their financial arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner felt the Bill should expand the range of operations of building societies.  There are a number of fields of commercial activity which are incidental to building society operations.  These would include, for instance, bridging loans, fire insurance and life assurance.  Arguments have also been put forward that societies' close involvement with the property market places them in a good position to become more directly involved in that market.  Much consideration has been given to these questions but, on balance, it is felt that the interests of the building society movement as a whole and, in particular, the security and confidence enjoyed by investors, are best served by allowing societies to operate only within their traditional limits of accepting funds and making loans to members on the security of freehold or leasehold estate.</P>
    <P>When I took over I found that this was not strictly administered.  I found that some building societies were investing outside the building field in a big way.  I considered that a serious position.  As a result of steps taken this has ceased.  It was only being done by a small number of societies. Deputy Ciaran Murphy asked how many societies had gone out of existence and I should like to tell him that two went out of existence and, to the credit of the remaining societies, they took over completely the assets and liabilities of those companies.  They saved not only the good name of building societies but also the investments of the people who had put money into them and the loans of those who had borrowed from those societies.  That shows how useful the societies are when they are combining together like that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner said a greater variety of loan options was desirable and mentioned index-linked loan basic interest rates; fixed repayment rate loans and equity sharing mortgages. There is nothing in the Bill which would prevent such developments.  It is up to the societies to operate all or <Col N="1521" /> any of them if they wish to do so.  The Deputy asked about the position of people in other countries anxious to come here to operate as building socities. There is nothing in the Bill which affects the position of building societies based in the United Kingdom, or other EEC countries, who might wish to open branches in Ireland.  Provided any such institution complies with the provisions of the law governing building societies and, in due course, this Bill, there is nothing to prevent them from operating here.  The Deputy also asked about the form of annual accounts of societies.  The Bill provides in section 62 that the form of accounts will be prescribed by the registrar who can decide what information should be incorporated in them.  I am sure they will be properly attended to.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin Central)</i> suggested that a saturation situation may have arisen in the case of building societies where they have massive amounts of funds invested with them, but cannot get enough suitable borrowers to take up all available loans, because house prices are too high and incomes too low.  I suggest that Deputy Callanan, for whom I have a higher regard than any Member of this House, should contact Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Deputy Callanan was complaining about the fact that it was not possible to get loans while Deputy Fitzpatrick took an opposite point of view.  He felt that the money was there but could not be loaned.  Deputy Callanan referred to the fact that people who had not an investment with a society were refused.  I explained to him that if people have not invested money with the societies and there is a temporary shortage of funds for lending, those who have invested with the society have first claim.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I also suggested to Deputy Callanan, and to the House, that there is not a better way for young people who have money&mdash;a number of them have a considerable amount of loose money on hands&mdash;to save than to invest with a building society.  Should they decide later to build a house they at least can borrow from the building society. <Col N="1522" /> Those who borrow from a building society, a bank or any other institution, for the purpose of building a house are in the main people who have a reasonable income.  If they have a reasonable income and are paying income tax, they get an income tax remission which makes the rate of interest payable by them very reasonable indeed.  I should like to repeat that young people can do no better than acquire a house if they can afford it, and many of them can, by investing and borrowing or by borrowing when the money is available and repaying it over a number of years. When they decide to get married they at least have a house.  Even if they do not get married, they have a fine investment, the value of which is growing annually.</P>
    <P>The demand for loans from the societies to date exceeds their available funds to such an extent that applicants have to wait for some time before a loan can be allocated to them.  The building societies are very reasonable and we should remember that a little more than two years ago the entire amount available from building societies was £43 million but last year it was £65 million and this year it will be between £90 million and £95 million. In addition, approximately £40 million is available from the banks.  Anybody who suggests that money is not available for housing does not know the facts.  A few years ago if one mentioned a building society loan one was talking about Dublin and, in fact, building societies in most cases were not prepared to consider applications for loans outside Dublin or some of the big cities.  However, we now have a situation where many towns have building society offices.  They take in a lot of money there and in the main endeavour to loan the money they collect in that area to people living there. It is a great idea.  While I would not like to see a building society having two or three offices in one street in a city or town I do not think it is happening. In my view a very reasonable approach is being made towards the whole question of building societies.</P>
    <P>With regard to advertising it has been proved that the societies who advertise are those which have grown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> The societies which have expanded their office are those which are taking in most money.  If that is so, we must assume that what they are doing is correct.  If the amount of money spent on advertising was stopped it would only represent about one-third of 1 per cent on interest rates but it would eventually result in no money being made available because if money is not invested it cannot be loaned. Taking all in all the building societies are dealing in a reasonable way with this matter.  They are non-profit making and whatever money is involved is ploughed back into the business.  At one time because of the way in which some societies which are no longer operating were doing business it could be assumed that somebody was making profit but, apart from the employees who are paid a salary, there is no question of profit being made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned something I could not understand, that he was aware of a person who was paying 50 per cent of his income on loan repayments.  I should like to know what building society or financial institution would loan to somebody an amount of money which would require in repayments 50 per cent of his income because most of the complaints that have been made is the fact that building societies are careful about the people they have been loaning money to.  They want to ensure that people who are borrowing money can repay it.  If somebody borrowed money which would require a repayment of 50 per cent of his income then somebody slipped up somewhere.  Maybe somebody told the Deputy something which did not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke criticised my opening speech for not looking at the overall housing picture and made much play of the wood and the trees.  I am afraid it is Deputy Burke who cannot see the trees for the wood.  This is a Bill to consolidate and up-date building society legislation.  I have already commented on its complexity and that it is a Committee Stage Bill.  Most of the speakers who took part in the debate <Col N="1524" /> recognised that this was so.  It deals in a comprehensive way with the operation of building societies, their establishment, founders' shares, control of advertising, investigation of misdemeanours, unions and transfers of engagements, procedures as to the lodgment of deposits at the Central Bank and so on.</P>
    <P>To complicate the position by dragging in the overall housing situation, which redounds so much to our credit, would be misleading and not conducive to a proper examination of the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke wants &ldquo;long-term low, fixed interest rate loans&rdquo;.  I was astonished and disappointed with his apparent lack of understanding of the whole basis of operation of the building societies movement which his demand that building societies should somehow provide long-term loans at low and fixed interest rates reveals.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that has been written and said about the way in which this outstandingly successful movement has operated over the years, he still endeavours to give the impression that he does not know that building societies obtain their money by offering attractive rates to investors and depositors with the guarantee of repayment at short notice.  These rates must not only be attractive enough to raise the funds to make new loans but to retain existing investments and deposits.  This effectively means that the rates of interest in the money they lend must vary with variations in the deposit and investment rates they offer.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that we all, particularly the societies, would like to find a way to raise money which could be issued in long-term loans at low rates of interest.  But the societies have to face reality.  Their investors and depositors are not philanthropists. They want an attractive return on their investment or deposit.  Any society administration will tell Deputy Burke that their depositors and investors are quite sensitive to changes in the market rate and are not slow to withdraw their funds if they find a more attractive way of investing them. Not only that, but I am quite sure <Col N="1525" /> they would quickly see the danger to their investment if any society were to pursue a policy of issuing long-term, low interest rate loans while offering attractive rates of interest, and get out fast from that society.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to borrow money at a rate of interest which not alone will attract new business but will keep in the societies money already invested.  This is an important matter which many people seem to ignore completely.  In the main, it is the small investor who puts his money into a building society.  People who invested money ten years ago were getting an interest rate of only 4 or 5 per cent.  If the rate of interest had remained at that figure, does anyone imagine that those investors would now be prepared to accept such a rate when they can invest their money elsewhere at double or treble the rate of interest?</P>
    <P>Let us be quite fair about this.  The building societies are in the business of getting money and lending money. As far as I am concerned, nobody has been tougher than me on the activities of the societies and in insisting that they walk a straight line, but I will give credit where credit is due.  To suggest that a person can simply borrow money at the going interest rate and to say that this rate could be guaranteed to be acceptable to the investor over the years is just little short of tommyrot. The Deputy who made the suggestion, knowing as he does so much about housing, must be aware that it is not reasonable.  I am afraid it appeared very like rather petty political comment.  I am sorry to have to make these comments here but it is very necessary at this stage that we should nail down fast what the facts are.  If we do not, we may give people the impression that it is quite simple to borrow money at any interest rate, even if that interest rate is half or one-third of the going rate.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that it should be subsidised.  Though there has been a difference of opinion between the Minister for Finance and the building societies over what should be allowed, a substantial income tax concession is being given.  Anybody who suggests that a substantial subsidy could be <Col N="1526" /> given by the State to the building societies with the object of allowing them to pay a higher rate of interest to investors and to charge a lower rate to borrowers must know that such a subsidy would have to come out of capital.  Some people said that this should be done but at the same time they call for a cut in State spending. It is difficult to follow their argument. This is a matter on which political points should not be scored because, in my opinion, this is a purely non-political Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke's suggestion that the Bill should be amended in some undisclosed way which would force societies to issue low interest long term loans is to recommend that this movement, which has done so much to channel the savings of our people into the purchase of houses for so many families, be killed off.  Building societies simply could not continue.  Investors would withdraw their money and the movement would die overnight.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to waste of funds in establishing branches.  This is basically a criticism of management expenses which I consider unfair and unjustified.  I regret Deputy Burke should have taken pains to give the impression that societies are grossly extravagant and mismanaged.  In so far as the future is concerned the Bill provides adequate powers to enable the registrar to deal with complaints of this nature.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise for the record, however, that I had the general complaint of too high a proportion of income being spent on management expenses investigated and did not obtain any evidence to justify it. Management expenses for the societies for the periods concerned were found to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>On the question of branch developments I do not consider it reasonable to imply as the Deputy did that there is a proliferation of branches all over this country.  The movement in my opinion has up to recent times been far too much concentrated in the Dublin area.  Part of phenomenal growth in recent years can be attributed to the fact that branches have <Col N="1527" /> been established around the country where they never were before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan made the point that there are no branches in some of the towns in his area.  I should like the building societies to look at these areas and perhaps move to them, and I am quite sure they will do so.  They have expanded into many areas during the past few years.  Since agriculture is now doing so well, I am sure they would get an extraordinarily high amount of money invested in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of the societies to plough back into the branch areas in which funds are raised a considerable proportion of their proceeds in house mortgage loans.  As I see it, branch development makes house purchase finance more readily available through the country as a whole.  While there must obviously be a saturation point, I am sure the powers in the Bill will enable the registrar to keep the matter under review.</P>
    <P>Deputies Faulkner and Burke criticised advertising by societies.  Deputy Burke was very strong in his criticism. Societies are seeking for a share of investment funds and they must advertise. It should be noted that the three Societies which adopted fairly vigorous advertising campaigns since the 1960s show the highest rate of growth in assets, while the societies which neglected to advertise showed a very slow rate of growth.</P>
    <P>It could be argued, therefore, that if societies do not engage in fairly vigorous advertising they simply will not attract funds from the public.  Collective advertising would not appear to be a satisfactory substitute since it was the individual societies which advertised extensively that expanded, while those which neglected to advertise remained almost static.  There has been a suggestion that since they are organised in a group they should advertise together.</P>
    <P>I am sure this question has been discussed on a number of occasions and, possibly, there will be further discussions on it.  The rate of interest is the same and the loan terms are <Col N="1528" /> usually the same but the societies run their business in the way they consider best.  So far as the borrower is concerned the amount involved would be one third of 1 per cent at present rates. In those circumstances it is not worth while creating a fuss.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke asked me to include in the Bill a provision whereby building societies could be granted trustee status.  Obviously, the Deputy is not aware that the granting of trustee status is a matter for the Minister for Finance under the Trustee Acts of 1893 and 1958.  In order to be quite clear as to what trustee status consists of, the Trustee Acts enable the Minister for Finance to make an order granting this status to invesments that satisfy fairly rigid criteria so that they can be used as investment media by persons holding funds in trust.  When there is in existence Acts which deal fully with the matter it would be absurd to repeat the powers in this Bill.  The provisions of this Bill will remove obstacles which have been in the way of the granting of this status to societies.  I should imagine that within a relatively short time of the passing of the Bill and when certain technicalities have been deal with, trustee status will be extended to the building societies.  I should welcome very much such an extension although it is recognised, as was proved by the action of the existing societies when two societies went to the wall, that funds are safe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke, too, referred to a statement of demands by ACRA. Clearly, he is not aware that I received from ACRA a copy of a document which contained the demands in connection with building society operations which the association considered necessary and which were similar to those which the Deputy quoted.  I had long discussions with the association in this regard.  In drafting the Bill careful consideration was given to this submission and to all other such submissions. While I was not prepared to agree that all societies should be required to amalgamate or that the Government should take over building societies, it is fair to say that some of the association's demands <Col N="1529" /> were found to be reasonable.  The Bill contains provisions which go a considerable way towards enabling their demands to be met.  The Deputy admitted that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke complained also that there was no power in the Bill requiring building societies to lend money only for house purchase.  If the Deputy had read the Bill, he would have been aware that section 77 gives the Minister for Local Government the power to make regulations relating to the amounts and purposes of loans by societies.  If the situation rendered it desirable to do so, this power could be used to reserve loans for house purchase.  Such a situation does not exist.  Since March, 1973, administrative controls have been exercised by the Departments of Finance and Local Governments to which the societies have responded responsibly. From time to time these controls have limited maximum loans per house or the proportion of mortgage funds which should be lent for new and previously occupied houses respectively.  This matter is being looked after very well and no further arrangement is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore asked if there is any control to curb a society which wished, as a speculative venture, to build an office block thus depriving housing of mortgage funds.  As an afterthought the Deputy added that, perhaps, this development could improve mortgage funds because the society would only need portion of the building for their own purposes and, therefore, could let the remainder.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that a society may purchase, build, hire or take on lease a building for conducting its business.  A multi-storey block of offices of which a society used directly only a limited part and let the remainder would conflict with the section. The purposes for which a society may advance money are indicated in the definition section and it is most improbable that the registrar would regard the building of an office block as a speculative venture as coming within the terms of that definition.</P>
    <P>Some questions were asked about <Col N="1530" /> the functions of the registrar.  Provisions relating to this office are included in the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill which is before the House.  Questions regarding the registrar's status and the power to remove him from office are proper to that Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Moore's reference to advertising, he may rest assured that there is provision in the Bill to enable the registrar to control advertising should he consider that the amount of money being spent in this way is too great.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan referred to the situation whereby people who are not investors with the building societies are not facilitated when they seek loans.  I see nothing wrong with that. If there is a shortage of funds, those who are investors should be entitled to first preference.  It has been my experience that an enormous amount of money has been lent to people who were not investors.  I have a high regard for Deputy Callanan but I was not able to follow him very well when he spoke of people whose plans were to marry, to start a business and to build a house, apparently at the same time.  He referred to such people having saved £1,000 with a society.  If they have that amount invested in this way, they would be in a position to borrow much more money than if their investment was elsewhere.  Perhaps the Deputy missed the point but I am sure that when he reads the report of the debate he will realise that even in that area people will be looked after.  Young people should be encouraged to save regularly with a building society because in this way they will be in a good position to negotiate a loan.  In this regard it is pleasing to know that so many young people from various walks of life&mdash; professional people, gardaí, civil servants and many others&mdash;decide soon after starting work to invest some of their income with the building societies and that within a fairly short time they purchase houses.  Some of these people have said to me that in this way they can at least ensure a cut in their income tax.  No doubt whatever the State losses by way of this concession is gained in another way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> Deputy Burke complained about the proliferation of building societies.  As far as I am aware there are no such societies in places like east Galway or north Clare, for instance but, perhaps, the societies might consider going into new areas where they would have a good field for investment.  Although it might not have been strictly relevant, the question of the £60 valuation in relation to farmers was raised by Deputy Callanan.  Even with a holding of this valuation which would represent an income of about £6,000 a year a farmer would be entitled to an SDA loan.  No doubt quite a number of farmers are availing of that facility.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of subsidising the building societies&mdash;a situation that is not likely to happen at present &mdash;this Bill would not be the instrument for this purpose since there already exists powers in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke of 12 people who, although on low incomes, had succeeded in borrowing money from building societies but who subsequently had to leave the areas in which they had gone to live because of their inability to meet the repayments.  I asked the Deputy to let me have the names and addresses of the people concerned so I trust he has not forgotten his promise to furnish me with these particulars. I expect he was talking of people who borrowed from the societies because at the time Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation qualified them for SDA loans but had not the money to make the loans available and in some peculiar way guaranteed the societies that money could be lent to these people.  The fluctuating rate of interest made it difficult for the people concerned to meet their repayments.  I have much sympathy for people who find that their rate of interest on loans is higher than that which they had expected to pay.  But it should be remembered that if people borrowed money at 6 per cent, 7 per cent or 8 per cent some years ago the rate of interest they are paying now is not so high in relation to their present incomes. People tend to exaggerate this.  If someone comes along to them and tells them <Col N="1532" /> that they are being badly treated, naturally they are encouraged to believe they are being badly treated.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are a number of amendments the Opposition wish to put down on this Bill.  I would ask Deputy Faulkner if there is any possibility of having them put down so that we might resume discussions on Committee Stage some day next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking yesterday I was about to make the point that people in rural areas who do not come within the scope of this <Col N="1533" /> Bill&mdash;people who are now or are about to build new houses&mdash;will be very disappointed that the Minister has not made any provision for them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might refer to a statement of the Minister in reply to a supplementary question by me in the Dáil on the 14th May, 1975, at column 1865, when he said:</P>
      <P>There is another category that must be considered also, namely, the houses being built in closed areas.  I am engaged in this study at the moment and I hope to complete it very shortly.  It is my wish to formulate some plan to cater for these people.</P>
      <P>While the Minister might argue that he has, in his brief, referred to those people by stating that a scheme of deferred payments will be introduced, that is hardly sufficient.  Deputies on each side of the House have quoted the enormous figures being quoted by the ESB to people building houses in rural areas.  The Minister's brief more or less invites people to keep away from rural areas.  He suggests consultation with the ESB and says:</P>
      <P>As Deputies no doubt readily appreciate the cost of connection of any new house to the electricity supply is largely determined by its location in relation to the nearest electricity distribution centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, he invites people to come into built-up areas which, in my opinion, shows a rural bias.  We are all delighted to note the lovely new houses being built all around the country; visitors and others often remark on this fact.  It is indeed worth while and has added considerably to the countryside. Some people make the point that a person building a house in a rural area does not have to meet the expenses one might have to meet in a town, that one can get a house built more cheaply in a town.  From experience I know well that the development of a site in country areas can be very costly.  There are other extras and overheads that have to be met, such as water connection and the building of septic tanks. All of that costs a considerable amount in contrast to a person going into a town getting a developed site, when he <Col N="1534" /> will have all of those amenities laid on. Perhaps the Minister would examine further the question of subsidisation of people who have to build houses in rural areas.  In most instances they do not have a choice.</P>
    <P>We all know the position in relation to land.  Agricultural land is going at a very high price and land for development purposes, even in rural areas, is fetching a very high price also. I know of a young man recently who bought a site for £2,000.  That would not be any more than he would have to pay in a built-up area.</P>
    <P>Another thing that disappoints me about this Bill is that the Minister has forgotten completely the few inhabited islands left around our coast.  I mentioned the plight of such islanders on a number of occasions here.  The Minister states that this is a once-and-for-all scheme and that no grants in aid will be available in the future for any further development of electrification. As has been said by myself and others here, we are proud of the progress made by the ESB.  But I think that the small portion of people still awaiting supply, such as those I have mentioned, should not be left out in the cold.  The cost involved will probably be fairly high.  But when one notes that the Department of the Gaeltacht are in a position to provide funds for the Gaeltacht islands in respect of this kind of development, I do not think it unreasonable to ask that people living on the few islands off the west coast who do not speak Irish and who have lost the language through no fault of theirs should be catered for.  Perhaps the Minister would see if he can prevail on the Government to make some funds available for these few islands, Clare Island, Inishturk and Inishbofin, those with which I am familiar.  They are entitled to this service.  Tourism is playing a large part in the life of the people on these islands also.  More people are getting to know about them.  If the people living there want to take full advantage of tourism it will be necessary that they have electricity provided.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to put to the Minister is this: the Bill caters only for applicants up to the end of <Col N="1535" /> March, 1975.  This is unfair.  Would the Minister consider ensuring that people who applied recently and who are anxious to avail of this subsidy could get it?  Would he tell us when it is proposed to have the Bill in operation? When will the money be provided to allow the ESB to go ahead with the scheme?  During the last two or three years we have had several Bills introduced and have found ourselves without money to implement them.  One of those is the supplementary Social Welfare Bill, which was welcomed in the House and which all Deputies agreed was necessary. Although that Bill was passed a year ago it has not been implemented because presumably the money has not been made available by the Government.  I would like to get a guarantee from the Minister in regard to when money will be provided to implement this Bill because there are many people waiting to get the ESB power supply.  I hope there will be no delay in implementing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill which provides the last opportunity to people residing in rural areas who are not connected to the ESB supply, to connect at subsidised rates which are very attractive. It applies to people residing in old houses and £300,000 is considered adequate to give a generous subsidy to those applicants.  It is well to encourage any person who is not connected to the ESB supply to get connected on those subsidised terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 900 houses still unconnected to the ESB supply.  We must also remember that we have 98.4 per cent of residents in rural areas connected to the ESB supply.  This is very high when it is related to connections in the USA and many European countries.  This is due to the foresight of our predecessors in Government, the then Cumann na nGaedheal Government who initiated what was known as the Shannon Scheme in 1927.  The inauguration of the Shannon Scheme at Ardnacrusha, County Clare, provided the first water power in the country.  If it was not for the forward <Col N="1536" /> thinking at that time we would not have had adequate current when industrialisation came.</P>
    <P>The people who for one reason or another were not in a financial position to be connected with the ESB will now be able to avail of the subsidies provided.  Those are, particularly, the people in the congested districts of every county on the west coast.  I saw a particularly worrying example of a person in Mayo who had not this electrification.  This person was provided with a kidney machine but, because there was no ESB connection this facility could not be availed of and he had to attend hospital twice weekly.  This was a great hardship. When the Minister visited those areas in Mayo he was brought face to face with the urgency of making provision for people in pockets very remote from the services enjoyed by other people.</P>
    <P>I would like to see young people building houses being able to receive subsidised terms.  At the moment, because of financial restrictions, this cannot be done.  I hope, when extra finance can be provided, that the Minister will be able to give some incentive to those young people building their own homes.  We should all encourage the 900 odd people in the country, who now have a chance to be connected with the ESB supply, to avail of it.  As it is the final opportunity they would be well advised, when such generous subsidies are being made available, to avail of them.  The Minister will pick up the Bill and reduce the demand by the ESB in a very substantial way, and that is an encouragement to any late applicant.  I support the allocation of this £300,000 and hope that people will now make use of the opportunities given to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene very briefly in this debate and I do so because the Bill will be of the utmost disappointment to very many people in my constituency of Wexford.  There are quite a number of people there with very large estimates for the installation of electricity who have been waiting for quite some time, some of them almost two years, in the hope that when this Bill would be passed <Col N="1537" /> here it would bring some relief to them.  They will be sorely disappointed when they find out what the Bill contains. Many of those people have very high estimates for the installation of electricity in their homes too, and the hope was strong that this measure, when it would be passed by Dáil Éireann, would have brought them some assistance by way of grant or otherwise towards those very high estimates.  As a result of waiting, the estimates have increased.  As everybody is aware, the estimates from the ESB increase from month to month. The estimate may be for two or three poles for installation.  If a new generator is needed that shoots up the Bill very high indeed.</P>
      <P>This measure will bring no relief whatsoever to any person waiting for electricity in my constituency.  I doubt if anyone will benefit.  I had a case during the week where a person had been quoted a very high figure for the installation of electricity in his farmhouse. He bought the holding a couple of years back.  The person who was in it prior to him did not apply for the installation of electricity when that area was being finally redeveloped.  He waited in the hope that this Bill would cover him, and it does not.  He has no hope and he has now to pay out £700 or £800 for the installation of electricity. Everybody is aware that one of the major requirements in any homestead is electricity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister tells me it does not matter if the previous occupant of the house did not for one reason or another apply for electricity, this subsidy will now apply to him, that is OK.  This is something we can check.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should have gone much further.  I know the difficulties of the financial situation at present, but I feel that in the interests of the nation this Bill should have gone very much further.  As has been said in this debate, a very large number of people building their own houses are applying for electricity.  When they apply they find that the estimate is so high that it is almost impossible and in many cases quite impossible for them to instal it.  This Bill does nothing whatever to meet that case.  It should.  The Minister should go back to the Cabinet and ask for further money and amend the Bill to deal with that type of case. People with excellent sites for building houses cannot build on those sites. The cost of the installation of electricity is one of the things that would <Col N="1539" /> prevent them doing so.  When people wish to build a house the first question they will have to ask themselves is: what will it cost?  Whether they qualified for grants or not, and a large number of them will not qualify any more, the big question is the cost of installation of electricity.  The Minister should take steps to remedy that position. Were it possible to introduce some system of HP for electricity, were it possible that the cost of the installation of electricity could be spread over a few years, it might help.</P>
    <P>The last word I will say on this is that I strongly appeal to the Minister to have another look at this Bill and to include something in it to cover cases of the type I have mentioned.  The amount of money mentioned in this is very limited indeed.  The amount of work it will do will certainly be very limited.  We could approach this in a different way.  We should at this stage, in view of the prohibitive cost in many cases of the installation of electricity, introduce some system of grants or subsidies or, failing those, some system whereby the cost of the initial installation of electricity can be spread over a period of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill because we, TDs, Parliamentary Secretaries, Ministers and local representatives, are continually being approached about this special service charge and this big sum of money which is mentioned in the notification.  I thank the Minister for having allocated the sum of £300,000 for the purpose of subsidising the many homes that have yet to get a supply of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are very disappointed when they get notification from the Department or from the local ESB office.  I knew one progressive young farmer in my constituency who got a demand for £1,150.  Electricity was necessary in order to develop his farm and to provide an adequate water supply. When details of this scheme were published recently this young man phoned me to see if he could avail of the scheme.  He had waited for two <Col N="1540" /> years to see if something would be done but finally he had to pay £1,150 so that he might carry out the necessary improvements. He is very anxious to find out if he would benefit from the provisions of this Bill and I hope the Minister will be able to help him.</P>
    <P>Recently a young man who is married for only the last six months contacted me with regard to the amount of money demanded from him.  He is not three miles from the town of Sligo but he was quoted a sum of £750 for ESB supply.  I told him that I had yet to see any change made in ESB figures once they were quoted to the people concerned.  I hope this man will benefit from this Bill.  Otherwise, he and his family will not be able to get a supply of electricity.  Another category who suffer are old people because quite often they have to do without heating or light.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will find himself scarce of money by the time all the allocations are made.  Very many people are faced with demands ranging from £750 to £1,150 and they need all the assistance they can get.  I accept that it is expensive to connect homes in outlying areas having regard to the cost of wages, materials and clerical assistance.  Formerly the owners of such houses had no option but to defer applying for a supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>On a few occasions the Minister was asked to consider the provision of a second power station at Arigna.  If that could be done it would not be too expensive to have an electricity supply over a wide area&mdash;by this I mean a rural area.  The proposed station would be in the centre of a rural area convenient to Arigna.  Not alone would it cut the expense of providing a supply to many homes, it would also create substantial employment in the Arigna coalmines.  This would be of great help to that part of Leitrim and Roscommon that is served by coal supplies from the Arigna colliery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to people who are obliged to use a kidney machine in their homes.  If it should happen that a person needed a kidney machine in a home that had not a supply of electricity, such a person <Col N="1541" /> would have no option but to go to hospital and his relatives might be obliged to travel up to 20 miles to visit him.  People who need this service should receive special priority when the applications are sent in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money involved here is about the smallest amount that the House has been asked to sanction for many years.  A sum of £300,000 is very small when one considers that we borrow up to £675 million and that our national debt is £3,000 million.  Yet we say to a certain section that we will only provide £300,000 to ensure that they get their normal rights.</P>
      <P>I have never understood why a certain section of the people have been discriminated against.  The Minister in his statement said that there are approximately 420,000 in rural Ireland receiving electricity under the rural electrification scheme and that there are 800 or 900 left out.  Personally, I believe the number is much more, but let us assume for the sake of argument the number is correct.</P>
      <P>Is that not completely wrong?  Is not the whole idea that everyone should get a fair crack of the whip and be treated equally?  That is what we should aim for, whether we are legislators at ministerial level or are Members of either House of the Oireachtas.  Those unfortunate people have been discriminated against for a long time and it is obvious they will not be fully helped now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advent of rural electrification was the greatest thing that happened in rural Ireland.  It gave the chance of a better and easier life to those people, whether they were county council tenants or had their own private houses, whether they were farming or working for the local authority.  We must remember that they have cost the State very little money during the years.  These people have not got running water or sewerage schemes provided out of public funds.  They have not got public lights outside their homes or at the crossroads.  We are not able to help those people in any way because they live off the beaten track.  Some of them may live in places <Col N="1542" /> like the Black Valley, or the side of a hill or even very far inland.  They are doing a great job in their own right and that has never been appreciated.</P>
    <P>Today we are being asked to pass a Bill for £300,000.  If it cost twice or three times that amount, it is the duty of Dáil Éireann to provide the money to give those people a fair crack of the whip.  We are talking here about the drop in population in the rural countryside which is the result of the attraction of the bright lights.  We should be falling backwards trying to keep people in the countryside.  These people may not have their own land; they might be living in a council house or in a private house.  There will always be people who want to farm or work for the council but there is no hope of attracting even a small factory to these areas unless there is electricity.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about this £300,000.  The State will get back a big portion of that within the next five years.  Once electricity is installed in a house the man sets about providing the electrical gadgets of the day, a cooker, television, radio, blanket and different equipment in the yard, lights, milking machines and so on.  The State gets VAT on all those items.  In other words, from the time that house is connected, the State gets revenue from current used and the new customer who buys these gadgets.  Therefore, this is a very sound investment and the Minister should look for more money.  We are borrowing very large sums and it is very hard to see where the money is going.  It would be hard to find a more productive project than providing electricity in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have already spoken about what is needed in the country.  This £300,000 can only be regarded as a little sop.  I cannot recall any Bill being brought into this House to provide for such a small amount. We should not hesitate to double or treble that amount which would provide subsidies for those people who want to build new homes in the countyside.  When planning to buy a house one must also take into account the enormous cost of installing electricity. If this costs a great deal, what happens?  The would-be builder, the <Col N="1543" /> man who applies for planning permission, will move nearer a town, creating further congestion and becomes another user of an already over-loaded water and sewerage system.  If he built in the rural area he would be a much happier man and the State would be better off.  We talk about the high price of building land but how will we keep these costs down when the ESB ask would-be builders for from £600, to a few thousand pounds to instal electricity?</P>
    <P>Nobody can expect any newly-wed young girl to go into a farm unless there is electricity.  Those are the facts of life.  Many people have brought up the subject of building a new house. The ESB consider this a new case although the new house is only 200 yards from the old one and the people have been living there for 20 years. The ESB are charging exorbitant amounts to install electricity there. These people should not be charged £200 or £300 for moving 100 or 150 yards further down a field.</P>
    <P>What will the Minister do about rural electrification?  What have the Government in mind about the people who will want to build in rural areas? Will we go further than this Bill and say that there will be no further subsidies for people who build in the rural areas?  That would be a tragedy. People living in rural areas find it very hard to compete with people living in the built up areas.  They will find it hard to educate their children if they are not provided with a transport service. If they want an evening out they have to travel seven or eight miles to the nearest town.  That takes petrol. Very few of the people we are helping here today send their children to ballet classes.  Have they not the same right as anybody else to do that?  It is our duty to provide the necessary funds so that their children can avail of all the good things of today.</P>
    <P>The Minister should go back to the Minister for Finance and persuade him, gently or otherwise, and come back here with a Bill that would provide more money so that an applicant who is being charged a very high sum for rural electricification will not be <Col N="1544" /> stopped, because of shortage of money, from building a house in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>There are some people who wait for somebody else in an area to have electricity installed.  Once the poles are laid and the lines are there, it should not be very expensive to install electricity in nearby houses.  If a person living a mile or one-and-a-half miles from the nearest transformer applies for electricity, he must pay a very large sum, but if an individual closer to the transformer then asks for electricity, the charge cannot be very high.  In my opinion the subsidy being given to the original purchaser is no more than adequate.</P>
    <P>If we are to tackle this problem properly the money being provided in this Bill is very small.  Perhaps the Minister was lucky to get that amount; perhaps it is only a start.  When replying he will probably tell us what he has in mind for the future and what he has in mind for the person who intends to build in rural areas.</P>
    <P>A farmer and his wife rear their family and their son or daughter comes back to take up a position perhaps ten miles from the old home.  It could be handy for parents to give their children a site at the end of the field and it would be very sad if the ESB charged them a very large sum of money.  Perhaps they would not charge very much if the new home was built near the old home, but even if it is only 200 or 300 yards from the old home, they are charged a very high price.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make a supreme effort to get more money for rural electrification.  I realise he may have a hard job but every Member of the House is behind him because if that money is invested along the lines suggested here, it will be a very sound investment for the future.</P>

      <P>This legislation is welcome. Deputy Meaney drew attention to the fact that this is a special Bill making provision for a maximum of £300,000 for what the Minister generally described as &ldquo;finishing off&rdquo; the old idea of rural electrification.  The previous speaker said it is rather unusual <Col N="1545" /> for us to be dealing here with a Bill covering a provision of a mere £300,000.  Normally, in matters like this, we talk in terms of a much higher money level.  This is an important Bill, despite the small figure involved. What is really remarkable about it is the fact that this is a Bill to redeem one of the promises made by the Coalition in the West-Mayo by-election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  The Minister pointed out that the people in the Black Valley and Ballycroy area do not have available to them a service which is now regarded as a basic amenity.  It is not just a basic amenity; it is a basic necessity.  In other areas of the country, such as Wexford, Clare and several other counties, there are people who are deprived of this basic necessity.  Questions were asked about these last week and in a bulk reply the Minister said the ESB were still studying the situation.  When I left my room Deputy Seán Browne was telephoning the ESB in an effort to get that body to clear up the matter and the ESB confirmed that these cases are not covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we will find very little evidence of availability of this service to people other than in the two areas mentioned specifically.  The Minister is, of necessity I believe, being too careful. He says that trying to eliminate anomalies in rural electrification over the whole country would be a virtually impossible task.  It is a downright impossible task in view of the ceiling of £300,000 he has set.  I believe widening the scope of this measure would be a worth-while exercise in providing potential applicants with what the Minister has described as a basic <Col N="1546" /> amenity.  Other basic amenities are water supply and sanitation.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments provided grants to encourage people to avail of these amenities and basic requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister spells out here the finalisation of the rural electrification scheme with a paltry provision of £300,000 and he says there will be no more State assistance.  I welcome the compliment the Minister paid to successive Fianna Fáil Governments for their continuous recognition and support of this basic requirement of electricity in the home and on the farm. We are ahead now of Britain and the USA and just a short head behind Germany and possibly Switzerland and Sweden.  Fair dues to the Minister that he accepts the fact that the rural electrification scheme sponsored by successive Fianna F£il Governments has put this country in this enviable position. We are rather proud of the achievement.  Around 98 to 99 per cent of our houses in rural areas now have electricity.  This provision of £300,000 is a rather poor contribution from this socialist group towards the finalisation of the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister offered a sop to those who will henceforth have to pay the full cost of providing themselves with electricity.  He paid tribute to the ESB for their assistance in providing this sop.  Supply to new applicants will be on the never-never system.  The ESB have agreed to deferred payments where subsidised terms are not available. I take it he had discussions with the board about this over a period of time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the message does not seem to have got around to the divisional inspectors.  I had occasion recently to write to the divisional inspector in Portlaoise in connection with an application for electricity by two entrepreneurs who were endeavouring to get a small industrial project off the ground.  They erected a suitable building a short distance from a local village but the ESB asked for almost £900 to install electricity.  Because they had spent their own resources and the accommodation obtained from banking <Col N="1547" /> institutions to purchase a site and erect a building, I decided to ask the ESB if it would be possible to pay this amount on an instalment basis.  The ESB had indicated that it would be possible in three or four years' time, if they used a sufficient amount of electricity, to refund some of the capital contribution, as is the normal practice. I was informed by the company that they were not allowed to accept the cost of installation on an instalment basis.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that discussions were in progress between the Minister and the ESB in relation to the question of deferred payments&mdash;the Minister has already paid tribute to the company for accepting this arrangement&mdash;one would have expected that the message would have filtered down to divisional inspector level.  The official I had contact with should have been in a position to tell me that while it would not be possible to accommodate my constituents then that the proposition I put was under consideration between the Department and the company.  I hope the Minister will develop more on his statement, that full details of the scheme will be available shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the Bill; it has nothing to do with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I presume I am in order talking about this because the Minister dealt with it in his speech.  I will make my constituents aware of the position this afternoon. I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Department of Local Government can help people who need essential amenities such as water and sewerage.  The Minister told us that electricity is now a basic amenity of life and for that reason I was disappointed that there is no provision in the Bill to help out those who live in rural areas and who are anxious to instal electricity.  Such people could benefit under the former rural electrification scheme but now if of necessity they must erect a new house they must pay the full capital cost of installing electricity.  The Minister has suggested that such people <Col N="1548" /> should consult with the officials at the local ESB office about possible relocation of the site of a house.  In most cases the people involved, small farmers, have put a lot of money into improving their holdings and would not be in a position to pay up to £2,000 for the installation of electricity. There is not much point in officials of the ESB telling such a farmer that he would be supplied with power if he built his new house some distance away from his farm buildings and the charge then would only be £100.  I hope the ESB can be prevailed upon to be a little more reasonable in their demands and in meeting the requirements of existing consumers in rural areas.</P>
      <P>While this measure is not very wide-sweeping, it is the end of the sugar stick as far as electricity is concerned, the remaining ½p lollypop of the £300,000 election promises made in West Mayo, it has afforded Government Deputies an opportunity of highlighting the problems of rural areas.  I do not think any Minister in recent years has got as much credit from his own backbenchers as this Minister has. Some extraordinary measures have gone through the House and we did not hear a contribution from Government backbenchers, but everybody has trotted in since this Bill was introduced to get a lick of this lollypop.  Government Deputies are anxious to show the people in the west that the Government are doing something for them but if they look for extra money for areas other than the two specified they will find it difficult to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of Laois County Council and unfortunately in recent times, from the official point of view it has become the policy to build houses in groups instead of building isolated cottages for farm labourers.  Not so long ago a farmer whose son was getting married decided to give him a site on which to build a new house.  The ideal site was decided on but it has ESB wires overhead strung between pylons, so they had to decide on an alternative site.  They discovered, however, that the ESB charge for connection would be about £1,100. Nowadays the county council realise that before they build houses in outlying <Col N="1549" /> areas they have to contact the ESB to find out what the connection costs will be.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of credit given to the Minister when he announced his intention to introduce this Bill which would help to subsidise electricity supply to new houses.  He lost all his credit, however, when we read the Bill and discovered it does not mean a thing in the matter of new ESB connections. In the case of the farmer's son I mentioned, I found it was useless to appeal to the local ESB office to try to get special treatment for him. He had chosen the alternative site because of ESB pylons on the site he would have used.  The ESB's reply was that it was just too bad, that under their regulations they could not do anything.</P>
    <P>I accept from the Minister that some of the anomalies will be removed by this Bill but I suggest that he should provide more money for this essential service.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has to come back to us for more money for the IDA and the ICC and I do not see anything wrong with the Minister for Transport and Power coming back to us occasionally looking for more money to provide this necessary amenity for rural households.  We do not oppose this Bill in principle because it will do a little of the work required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this Bill because I have a particular case before me from an area which could not be called rural in the sense in which Deputies have been speaking. The case I mention is in Enniskerry, a fairly well built-up district.  Recently a young friend of mine, aged 27 or 28, newly married, returned from England.  He decided to build a house in Enniskerry and he was asked by the ESB to pay a sum in excess of £1,100 for connection.  The distance from the site to the supply is about half a mile. I went to the accountant in the ESB. He was extremely helpful and agreed to get in touch with the local office. The young man had said that even if £200 could be knocked off the quotation it would be of some help, but £1,100 was prohibitive.  The man in the ESB said that if the applicant would <Col N="1550" /> dig some of the drains and trenches the amount could be reduced.  The young man was happy at the possibility of reducing the cost.  About ten days afterwards he received a letter from the ESB, which I will quote. Enclosing that letter, the young man wrote to me:</P>
      <P>Please find enclosed a copy of a letter which I received from the ESB.  I find it surprising and disturbing. Hopefully Mr. &mdash;&mdash; of the ESB will use some of his influence to clarify the problem.</P>
      <P>Here is the letter he had received from the ESB:</P>
      <P>Following representations made by Alderman Briscoe concerning the capital contribution required towards the cost of supplying electricity to this site, I am writing to tell you that the charge cannot be reduced.  The new line to supply the site has been designed in the most economical way possible and the contribution calculated accordingly. The terms originally issued to you on the 11th May, 1976, have now expired and I regret that inflation has increased the contribution now required to £1,209.  As before, this quotation will remain valid for three months.</P>
      <P>The last paragraph of the Minister's Second Stage speech is excellent but I was not aware that before embarking on the building of a house a person should ascertain the cost of having power supplied.  I fail to understand why it should cost £1,200 to bring electricity a distance of about half a mile.  This begs the question of who is being subsidised by the person paying the bill.  We are told that in the event of another person building a house nearby a refund in part is made to the person who originally paid the bill in full.  Consequently, if a number of people build houses in the area there would be a fairly good refund but we are talking of a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  In any case it would appear to be a rather peculiar way of operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that in order to ameliorate this type of burden he intends having introduced a scheme of deferred payments.  What period of <Col N="1551" /> time has he in mind in this regard or what would be the approximate amount of the instalment?  I realise the special problems of areas such as the Black Valley.  Such areas are remote, but the case I am talking about is not a remote area.  The gentleman in question received a reply which indicated that should he make further representations, the quotation would be likely to be greater.  Although the price quoted would apply if taken up within a three-month period, the pressure on people to act so quickly is great.</P>
    <P>In the case I am talking of I could understand the exorbitant estimate if the area concerned were, say somewhere high up in the Dublin mountains although even there there should be some electricity supply not too far away, but I am talking of Enniskerry. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about cases such as these and to tell us whether such persons can expect some kind of assistance.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the £300,000 being voted here represents a mere pittance in relation to the amount required to deal with this situation.  It is all very well to talk about this Bill marking the final stage of the rural electrification scheme, but in the case I am talking of the person concerned came back from England unaware of the special subsidy scheme that existed up to May, 1975.  There is no longer such a scheme, so perhaps the Minister has some advice for those people who may wish to come back here in the future and build houses.  There are not many coming back now but we can expect some to return when things are better.  By that time will these people be asked to pay £2,000 each for a connection?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is too restrictive in its application.  It is aimed at a very small number of people only. I have a strong suspicion that the measure has been brought in as a result of pressure applied in the early days of the bye-election campaign in Mayo.  At that time I was told by people in that area of Mayo referred to in the explanatory memorandum <Col N="1552" /> that the Minister had given them an undertaking to have them supplied. The Bill is merely adding insult to injury when one thinks in terms of the exorbitant charges demanded from those who do not come within the terms of this Bill.  I am not in favour of referring here to specific cases but I consider it germane to the debate at this stage to refer to a letter I received from the ESB following an appeal to them to reduce their estimate for a connection for a man living in a cottage in a Gaeltacht area of Donegal.  The estimate was for £3,790. I have had photostatic copies of the letter made for future reference. While it may not be in order to refer to the committee that is to be set up to look into the affairs of State-sponsored bodies, I take the opportunity of this Bill to offer some criticism of the ESB.  However, I must record first the tremendous success of this body. Rural electrification has been a revolutionary force in the lives of our people.  It has become an integral part of our whole economy and social life. Must we be penalised, though, for the great benefits that this scheme has conferred on us?  We might say that we are now experiencing stage two of the ESB's operations because we are dealing with a board that has become immense but which also has become arrogant and dictatorial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies can relate the problems of people being asked to pay too much for connections.  In some cases the amount required is greater than the value of the house concerned. When one asks the reason for an estimate being so high, he merely is told that it has been arrived at by the board's method of calculation.  One will not be told that it takes, say, six men working for three days and using so much material to make power available. My suggestion is that as much as possible of the work being done by the ESB in this sphere should be removed from them and given to private enterprise.  Should not a person seeking a supply have the right to seek estimates from a number of local electricians?  Another case I have in mind is that concerning a man in the village of Ardara who built a new bakery beside his old premises and <Col N="1553" /> who was told that he would have to pay £700 to have his electricity line transferred.  The only explanation was that a new transformer was needed because the one that was there was loaded.  He pays for a transformer that will serve several other people, and that is already serving a number of them.</P>
    <P>Those are the things that have damaged the image of the ESB throughout the country.  It is not sufficient merely to say: &ldquo;We are a great body.  Look at what we did in spite of what people thought.  We brought light to the tops of mountains&rdquo;.  Give me plenty of money and qualified people and I would do the same thing; anybody would.  They must now recognise that they have become an indispensible part of our economy.  They have got to behave accordingly.  Some agency of State has got to be set up to ensure that they do because they constitute far too important a link in our whole economic set-up and they should not be allowed to go unbridled.</P>
    <P>This might sound rather paradoxical, but I object to the profits made by the ESB this year.  They have changed a deficit into a surplus, if I remember details of their annual report correctly. That is not a commendable exercise at a time when our people were on their knees in an economic recession and paying mounting prices for everything.  Why should they have chosen the worst period in our economic history to convert a deficit into a profit?  For the life of me I cannot understand why.</P>
    <P>Though I shall not go into the details of it here, I question the wisdom of their foreign borrowing.  The interest rates imposed are merely adding to the stupid borrowing the Government have done and aggravate an already very serious position.</P>
    <P>The huge rise in ESB costs hit all consumers, the poor in particular.  A lot of that has been blamed on the increase in the price of oil.  The ESB can rightly pass part of that blame onto the Government, because every time the Arabs did something the Government matched them with another increase.  A quarter of the total consumption of oil in this <Col N="1554" /> country is accounted for by the ESB. That is colossal.  While they may maintain that their old system of purchasing oil was a good one, we are paying for it now.  I question the wisdom of the system they had of purchasing oil, under which they dealt with three main companies and bought spot cargoes at breakdown prices, if you like.</P>

This is very much germane to what is in the Bill because it is an attempt to reduce installation charges for certain people.  I am trying to deal with overall costings and their causes in relation to ESB charges. For example, when oil prices rocketed and scarcity was reported, we discovered that the ESB had no storage, no contract; they were, day to day, playing one company against another &mdash;this worked fairly well for a time&mdash; and picking up spot cargoes.  For a time that did give the consumer a certain advantage.  I should like to have seen a long-term contract, a huge storage and less dependence on oil for the generation of current.  At one time it was very difficult even for the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making the point that, if things in the ESB were as they should be, huge installation costs would not be necessary.  I do not think they are warranted anyhow.  I want to say in relation to installations &mdash;if the Chair will confine me to that only&mdash;that in the method of calculating installations two slide rules are used.  The board use one method of giving an estimate to a customer but use another method within for the actual carrying out of the job which works out cheaper.  They have two methods of costing.  That is something that may not be known to the Minister, but it is a fact.  The first method of calculation is one that is over and above covering everything that would be foreseeable in relation to the cost. For the actual measuring up of the <Col N="1556" /> job before it is carried out a totally different method is applied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They use two methods of calculating the cost of installation. They use one method for giving a customer an estimate and, when it comes down to the job, they have detailed costings carried out measuring every inch of material and every hour of work that goes into it.  These are two separate things and the end result of the actual work carried out is that the cost is much below what was the figure given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies frequently ask&mdash;I get many questions&mdash;why the <Col N="1557" /> cost of connecting Mrs. So-and-So was £1,100.  In my reply I give the cost of the cable, the man hours, the number of transformers and whatever else is involved.  I have done so a number of times in this House and I presume previous Ministers did the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see it given to the customer in relation to the cost and to what he is charged in relation to installation.  We do know that if the work was permitted to be done by a local engineer, to standards specified by the ESB, it would work out much cheaper.</P>
      <P>In relation to costing the ESB are spending too much under the heading of training.  They are over-staffed. They deny that they are but they have shown a reduction in staff this year without impairing output in any way which, in itself, is an admission that there was over-staffing.  Neither are they wise to be competing in the retail business for the sale of products.  They resent the intervention of the Prices Commission.  They do not think the Prices Commission should interfere with them.  I am inclined to agree with them.  The National Prices Commission can only look at the surface of anything.  If we are to have an effective Prices Commission we have now reached the stage where it should be a commission which can examine efficiency, production methods, how costs are arrived at, not the across the counter profit.  The ESB have a right to resent the National Prices Commission looking at their charges and stating if the consumer is paying enough, too much or too little.  The ESB ask the Prices Commission to give them a free hand to charge what they like and they will do a tremendous job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB have to take into account that they have much more effect on our economy than any State Department. Their behaviour in relation to the economy generally is very much bound up with production, production costs, consumer charges and even with the social life of the people.  They are using a tremendous amount of consumers' money.  Now that the ESB have reached the stage that they have <Col N="1558" /> proved they have done a great job and have brought power to the remotest parts of Ireland they should sit down to examine how it can be done in the most economical way and how it can best be applied to improve the economy.  That applies to manufacturing industry, agriculture, farmyards and the thousand and one ways in which it can be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is so restrictive in its applications and deals with so few cases that it tends to aggravate those who will not benefit.  In the beginning everybody benefited and although many people were doubtful of the ESB once it became part of their lives people wanted it.  People now feel they must have an ESB connection and some people are straining to use it when they cannot afford it.</P>
      <P>The deferred payment system announced by the Minister could be helpful provided it is not made an easy way of getting the big cost accepted.  My remarks are possibly more relevant on the measure to set up the committee that will have an opportunity of looking behind the scenes in relation to the ESB and several other bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting and, I must admit, a somewhat more lengthy debate than I thought it would be.  I should have realised that with the best intentions in the world the Chair would not be able to confine the debate as rigidly as he would hope to do and that people, as Deputy Brennan has just done, would tend to talk generally about the ESB, their place in the <Col N="1559" /> economy of the country and in rural Ireland and their contribution to the development of our economy.  I am sure every Deputy will agree with what Deputy Taylor said this morning, that the ESB have been a greater influence in rural Ireland than practically any other thing.  Rural electrification&mdash;Deputy Lalor referred to it and I do not begrudge him his pride in the fact that it was a Government, of which he was a supporter, that brought in this measure&mdash;has been of tremendous benefit to Ireland.  In the last few years, not directly because of electricity, although it was one of the contributory causes, there has been a great desire by people not to leave the countryside and not to come into cities and large towns.  A lot of the amenities in towns are now available in the countryside as a result of electricity, plus the motor car, which has a social effect in this regard.  This has stemmed the flow of people to cities and towns.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor, Deputy Leonard and Deputy Barrett said that this was a chicken of the West Mayo by-election coming home to roost.  That is not true.  If it was I would not object to having that label hung around my neck or having to suffer the odium of the politician keeping his promises. I would be quite willing to accept this odium but this goes very much farther.  It goes back ten years to another by-election in another part of the country, the South Kerry by-election, as a result of which Deputy John O'Leary came into the House and Deputy Michael Begley was the defeated Fine Gael candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first place I was interested in was the Black Valley, not Ballycroy. Even though those are the two places mentioned in my opening statement it does not necessarily mean that the beneficiaries under this Bill are confined to those two areas.  Practically every rural electrification area, of which there are 792, can benefit under this but those are the two big concentrations of power.  Those are the areas where the bills for the connection of electricity were largest.  That is the reason why I picked them out.  There <Col N="1560" /> are also other areas such as Woodford, which Deputy Callanan and Deputy Hogan-O'Higgins mentioned, which will benefit.</P>
    <P>This as I said, goes back ten years to the halcyon days when the people who are now in Opposition campaigned in South Kerry.  Their campaign was conducted by Deputy Blaney, who now sits on the Independent benches, waiting for a chance to give his ex-colleagues a kick in the behind every chance he gets.  His co-director was Mr. Boland, of glorious and almost immortal memory.  When Queen Victoria came here the criticism of Yeats in a poem was: &ldquo;He is parading me crimes, says she, in <i>The Irish Times</i>, says she.&rdquo;  Mr. Boland's contribution to politics seems to be parading in <i>The Irish Times</i> the crimes of his former colleagues.  That was an extraordinary by-election, when many promises were made.  It was a critical one for the Government of the time, in 1967, which they were determined to win.  Another one was held in Waterford at the same time. Every weekend the mighty cars of the mighty men in Taca swished down, splashing mud on the peasants as they passed by to South Kerry to ensure the election of the Government candidate. I was not even in public life at the time.  I was not even a county councillor but I was a supporter and member of the Fine Gael Party.  I was stationed in Killarney.  One of my duties on two Sundays was to go up to the little church in the Black Valley and advise the people there that the best thing they could do was to vote for Michael Begley and get rid of the Government then in power.</P>
    <P>Of course not being a public representative I would have taken my turn in the queue.  The first speaker on each occasion was a Fianna Fáil Deputy or Minister, whoever was there.  In fact Ministers did not go into the Black Valley.  It is pretty hard to get at.  Each Sunday up on the box with a microphone in his hand was the Fianna Fáil Deputy or councillor of the area and he would say, &ldquo;You vote No. 1 John O'Leary and you will have electricity in the Black Valley in another three months&rdquo;.  The people <Col N="1561" /> voted No. 1 John O'Leary but they did not get electricity in the Black Valley in three months.  A general election came around again and I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Begley, that up at the church in Black Valley was the Fianna Fáil speaker saying, &ldquo;You vote for the Fianna Fáil candidate and you will have electricity within three months.&rdquo;  They did not get electricity in three months.</P>
    <P>Between those two elections, the by-elections of 1969 and the general election, I was in Kerry on my holidays a few times and Deputy Begley told me of this problem in the Black Valley and I went to see for myself. The church of which he had spoken is at the very head of the valley and below that, stretching for a distance of six or seven miles, is the gorgeous valley with a river running through it and it comes out at the other end on the road to Sneem.  There are very nice people there.  Deputy Begley told me that the people in that area could not really enjoy life as everybody else in Kerry and most parts of Ireland because they had no electricity.  I made inquiries and I found that the cost of connecting them, because of the remoteness of the valley, was enormous and they were being asked to make this capital contribution. They accepted in my conversations with them the fixed charge because everybody in the country pays this, and I will explain in a minute how these charges are built up.  It is confusing and difficult to understand and I will make it as simple as I can.  The electricity was a thing they would welcome but they were asked to pay the fixed charge and the special service charge, and after that the capital contribution, which can range from £10 to £3,000.  Of course in an area as remote as that, even seven years ago up to £600, £700 and £800 was being asked from individuals living in the Black Valley for connection of electricity.</P>
    <P>That election went and they did not get the electricity, even though they voted as they were advised to do.  At the last general election the worm turned and people in the Black <Col N="1562" /> Valley did not vote at all.  They protested against a Government and a system that, because they were living in a remote area, deprived them of what they considered an essential amenity, and they went on strike.</P>
    <P>That is the background of it.  When I was given my present responsibilities I discussed that matter with Deputy Begley again and said I would see what was involved and what I could do to help solve the problem.  Not long after that, certainly during my first 12 months in office, Deputy Staunton, as he admitted here yesterday, and the late Deputy Henry Kenny came to me.  They did not know I was interested in the Black Valley, but they made representations on behalf of an area called Ballycroy in Mayo where the same situation exists. Prior or subsequent to that Deputy Callanan, Deputy Hogan-O'Higgins and Galway Deputies came in and told me about the third area in Woodford where the same position existed. I set about doing what I could for this quite small number of people in remote areas, for whom the very remoteness made life different if not difficult for them, in regard to the absence of what is now considered a basic amenity, even though our fathers and our grandfathers would not have thought so.  I decided to get what information I could.  Deputies have criticised the small amount of money and the few people being catered for in this regard.  The people who have the lists are the ESB, and I must accept when they say it is 80 to 900 people and it can be done for this amount of money.  That is the money I am providing here for the purpose of connecting these places to electricity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enda Kenny, by a strange coincidence son of Henry Kenny who, as I said, was one of the people who approached me about this, made a very good point in a very good maiden speech yesterday.  Generally speaking, I think the new younger Deputies who came into the House in 1973 are of a higher calibre and have made better contributions to debates on both sides of the House that I have listened to from those who came in with me in 1969.  I do not know whether Deputy Barrett or Deputy Briscoe would agree <Col N="1563" /> with that.  The contributions from the younger Deputies in this House now are thoughtful, significant and well researched.  I am very pleased about that, because politics has come to be debased, and they perhaps can bring some idealism and vision back into their contributions here and from here out to the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>No matter how much critics outside this House, or indeed we ourselves, decry our role, in this country the alternative to politics and to politicians does not bear thinking about.  We are elected here for a very short time in the history of the free Parliaments of this country.  Any one of our contributions, be it from Minister, front bench spokesman, backbench Opposition or Government Deputies is pretty insignificant; but we have responsibilities and duties.  One of the responsibilities is that when we take public money from taxpayers&mdash; and that is all that is spent in this House; nobody ever puts a £10 note from his own pocket up on the benches and says we should discuss what we are going to do with that&mdash; we have the responsibility to spend that money with the interests of the taxpayers in mind.  We also have a duty to see as far as possible that the quality of life and the standard of living enjoyed by people, whether they are rural or urban, is as much in balance as possible.  One of the ways that can be done is to see that what material benefits are available are available to all the community, though we may have at some stage to spend the taxpayers' money and to spend it in a responsible way to fulfil our duties.</P>
    <P>The money we are providing here has been criticised as being too small, £300,000.  In my speech introducing this Bill I pointed out that £80 million or so has been spent on rural electrification since it was introduced in 1946, just after the war.  Of this the taxpayer has provided about £27 million.  Regarding the cost of connecting these last 2 per cent of houses in remote, scattered areas throughout the country, the relationship between what has been spent, <Col N="1564" /> what has been voted in this House and what will be spent is the same relationship.  When we vote here £300,000 we are talking about a figure of around a million pounds which will be spent, because all the rural electrification schemes have had a contribution from the ESB.  Of the £80 million so far spent they have contributed £53 million and the taxpayer £27 million.  The same relationship will apply to the money we are voting today and that should be sufficient.  That is what the ESB have asked for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor pointed out a minute ago that, when the question was answered last week by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I said this information was not yet available from the various counties.  I think some people were surprised.  They thought it would be an easy thing to ring up the ESB and ask how many people in a certain county were looking for electricity under the scheme.  As most Deputies know, the ESB have divided the country into 792 rural electrification areas.  They are not necessarily grouped countywise but are under regional offices.  In addition the information they have may not be asolutely accurate because there were cases between 1971 and 1975 when people refused to take electricity under the subsidised scheme and they may be still on the ESB books.  It could also happen that some of the houses have been knocked down in the meantime.  Until the whole scheme is finished I think it would be nearly impossile to say how many houses are connected and the cost.  The best estimate the ESB can give is that between 800 and 900 houses are involved.  The amount the ESB looked for from the Exchequer was less than the £300,000 I am looking for now, but I put in a little extra because I thought the estimate might not be correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I shall try as best I can to explain how the figures were arrived at.  I referred to this <Col N="1565" /> matter in my opening statement. Under the rural electrification scheme a subsidised price is given for the connection of electricity to houses in rural areas.  If that charge is £700 or less then the ESB will foot the bill and look for a return of 5.2 per cent on their investment.  If the cost exceeds £700 they will look for £36.40 annual return.  Everyone in the country, whether they live in the heart of Dublin or in a rural area, has to pay a fixed charge and this varies from house to house.  In the urban areas it is the number of rooms in a house that determines the fixed charge level and in rural areas it is the square footage of the area to be connected. There is no blueprint that can be used; it is a variation for each connection.</P>
      <P>I have given an example of a house where the charge was £700 and where the ESB look for 5.2 per cent in that case.  If the fixed charge for a rural house is £15 per annum the ESB will take that as a contribution towards the cost of providing the £700.  The special charge is £36.40 minus the £15; in other words the amount is £21.40. If the charge is £1,000&mdash;£300 more than the £700 I mentioned&mdash;the £700 is taken care of in the way I have stated but the individual householder has to pay over the £700 to whatever it costs in the form of a capital contribution. This Bill will be paying the capital contribution for those people who wish to have connections.  They will still have to pay the fixed and the special service charges but in respect of any capital contribution that had been sought in the period 1971 to 1975 and which they turned down because they could not afford it the State will pay that for them.  That is what is involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they would not qualify under the Regional Fund. However, before I finish I will give the Deputy an explanation.  To revert to the point made by Deputy Briscoe, as Deputy Brennan said we should not deal with individual cases here because there is no law governing connections. Different rules apply to each case.</P>
      <P>With regard to county councils and local authorities, this is a problem that has only come to light in the last three or four years when people started to build very fine houses considerable distances outside towns or in remote rural areas.  The procedure was that they applied to the local planning authority for permission to build.  Up to a few years ago the local planning authority considered this matter from the point of view of access roads and the provision of sewerage and water services.  I have had frequent representations about this matter myself. Frequently the reason the applications were refused was that the county council considered there were not adequate roads to take the traffic, that there was no water or sewerage services and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was becoming equally significant and a greater cost was the availability of electricity but the planning authorities never took this into account in advising people.  Since I came to office I have been instrumental in getting the Minister for Local Government, his Department and the planning authorities to advise people that in addition to the ordinary permission given to build a physical structure they will have the further cost of connecting the house to the electricity supply.  Depending on the area, the proximity to the nearest supply <Col N="1567" /> and the level of voltage required, the cost can be quite significant.  They will be able to advise people before they finally commit themselves to go to the local ESB office and find out how much they will have to pay.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately that does not happen in many cases.  It has been said that perhaps people have not a great choice with regard to sites but I think they have a certain degree of choice. Somebody gave an example of a farmer who gives some land to his son but the cost of providing electricity is enormous.  However, that might be in respect of a certain site. If the farm is of any reasonable size there may be a number of sites that might be considered for a second house.  If the young person building that house went with a map of his father's farm with the sites marked on it to the ESB offices, they would tell him where from their point of view it would be cheapest to connect electricity.  That could be quite significant if the house was on the wrong side of the road, if they were further from the transformer, or if they moved into a different transmission network feeding another group of houses.  Because they would be lowering the voltage in the other houses, a new transformer would have to be supplied which would increase the cost.  All these things should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There should be much more consultation between the planning authorities, the ESB and prospective builders in rural areas to ensure that the people building the houses could pick sites and be connected with electricity as quickly and as cheaply as possible.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy knows any of these authorities, I will be glad of their names so that I can pass them on to the Minister for Local Government.  If there is any gap in this communication between me and the Minister for Local Government and the planning authorities at lower level, I will again bring it to the attention of the Minister and ask him to make sure that the planning authorities advise people of these facts.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies raised a number of points, but the problems do not vary very much from Donegal to Cork or from Galway to Wicklow.  One Deputy made the point that there should be no charge for transferring electricity from one house to another.  If a person moves house he must pay for the transfer of his phone and furniture. The ESB must operate in a commercial manner.  I am sure Deputies would not like that company to be susidised and having to come back here looking for money every year to keep them afloat.  If it costs them so much to do a job, they have to charge the customer that amount. Therefore if the customer wants his electricity supply shifted to another house they must charge for that.  If somebody is moving close by the charge is nominal, but every case is different.  You cannot say that the same rule applies all over the country. Every house is different and has to be treated differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett made a point yesterday. <Col N="1569" /> Perhaps I did not hear him properly but it was repeated on the radio this morning.  He said that 25 per cent of the cost of electricity was attributable to the fall in value of currency.  I heard the British Prime Minister use a very old saying recently that a lie is half way around the world before the truth has its boots on.  I am afraid this 25 per cent may become part of the mythology or folklore of the ESB. The cost of providing money to build power stations to generate electricity has a bearing on the price of electricity. It is not 25 per cent; the adjustment of the currency is less than 2 per cent.  The total cost for capital is much less than 10 per cent.  I do not know where Deputy Barrett got the figure of 25 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My figures were based on the fact that the previous year the ESB owed £100 million non-sterling, and between interest and readjustment payments at the end of the next year they owed £149 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the significance of what the Deputy says, because it is not the difference between the two but the total borrowed capital, its use and interest rates that count.  To deduce a figure of the percentage of a consumer's bill that is attributable to the fluctuations in currency would need many more figures than Deputy Barrett is using now and more study than I could give it here.  If the Deputy wishes I will send him letters showing how I arrived at the figure of 2 per cent in the fluctuation in currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I arrived at my figures from the annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy White, Deputy J. O'Leary and Deputy Leonard suggested that some of the work for the connection of electricity should be done by farmers digging their own trenches to put the cables underground. I agree these trailing lines across the countryside are offensive to the eye and are a visual pollutant, but the cost of putting them underground at this stage would be prohibitive, about ten times the cost of doing it by poles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> Deputy White's point was that farmers have so much machinery that they could help in this way.  There are a number of housing estates throughout the country, for example the village of Tyrrellspass, where the cables have been put underground. This makes the place extremely attractive visually.  Since yesterday I have found out that in certain parts of the country the ESB are conducting experiments to see if rural people will do some of their own work by digging trenches.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan termed the ESB as dictatorial and autocratic.  They certainly are careful about people handling electricity and we would all wish them to be careful.  We want them to ensure that, when connections are made, houses wired, trenches dug and cables laid, the highest possible standard of safety would apply.  We all hope that the ESB would adopt safety standards because electricity can and does kill and is a dangerous commodity.  It should be carefully handled by professionals and not just by somebody who decides he is going to become an electrician overnight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would go a little further than that.  I am not sure but I understood him to mean they would wire their own houses and bring a cable from their own houses down to the main point of supply and this would save a lot of money.  I do not think we could accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact that is what the ESB are experimenting with at the moment.  If it works out and if they can get co-operation between neighbours, they will probably continue this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would encourage them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would. I think Deputy Briscoe had better give <Col N="1571" /> me details of his particular case because it seems to me a unique case needing special consideration.  I may have some news for the Deputy after Question Time.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary made a point about low voltage in farming areas.  There was a breakdown in communication to some extent.  One Department was encouraging farmers by way of grants and credit facilities to go into new machinery while another State agency, the ESB, not knowing there would be a sudden and very dramatic increase in demand in certain areas, were more or less caught short.  What was involved was going back over the area and reviewing it to meet the increased demand.  Of course, there were complaints about low voltage and the ESB are getting around as quickly as possible, particularly in dairying areas, to improving the voltage as much as possible.  Some 18 months ago I used have quite a lot of complaints&mdash;I still get some&mdash;but the number has dropped considerably now.  The ESB must be catching up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher and I think some other speakers expressed the hope that we would write into the Bill a specific date so that the ESB would be compelled to complete the work in a given period, say up to December, 1977.  It is desirable that the work should be completed as quickly as possible and I have been pushing them in that regard but it would not be wise to write a specific time limit into legislation because, if they were unable for any reason to complete the operation in that time, they might be inclined to take people off in other areas to enable them to comply with the law and people suffering from low voltage as a result of that would start complaining.  That is something we must guard against while ensuring the objectives of this Bill are achieved as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main divisions in the Bill: there is the Ballycroy, Woodford and Black Valley areas, the deferred payments system and the need for more co-operation between local authorities and the ESB and the <Col N="1572" /> additional cost to someone connecting a house to electricity.  With regard to the deferred payments system, Deputy Gallagher said I had made a promise&mdash;rather, what he look to be a promise&mdash;in a reply I gave that new houses would be included in this Bill.  In fact, I said quite the reverse on a number of occasions here. I spelled out very clearly, despite pressure from both sides to extend the scope of the Bill, exactly the people who would be covered by this Bill. Even on the famous occasion on which I spoke in Ballycroy I made it very clear who would be covered by this Bill.  I did not intentionally pull the wool over anybody's eyes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deferred payments system, I can see that it would be very difficult for people to meet lump sum requirements of £800 or £1,000.  At the same time, I can see it would be unfair to ask the taxpayer to pay for someone who can afford to build his own house when we have to provide houses for a great many people who cannot afford to build houses for themselves.  There is this conflict of interest.  There is this stretching of one's wing in two diametrically opposed ways.  I have been speaking to the ESB for a number of months now trying to devise a method of deferred payment.  It was only on Tuesday of this week that the board agreed they would introduce a deferred payment system. The details have not yet been worked out.  I hope the scheme will be in operation in five or six weeks' time. Now I do not want anyone to go away from here under the illusion that the Government will meet a proportion of the cost or anything like that. The total cost will have to be paid by instalments by the consumer.  The details have not yet been worked out but, as soon as I get them, I will make a statement and the ESB will probably issue a statement giving the details.</P>

Deputy Lalor complained that the people in his local ESB office did not know there was a possibility of this scheme being introduced. As I said, the board did not take the decision until Tuesday of this week and prior to Tuesday no one could know there was a possibility of this scheme being introduced.  As a result of all the publicity now people will be more aware that something is going to be done very quickly and I am sure that even those people who may have got quotations will be catered for under the terms of the scheme.</P>

Under the present system the skipper is brought to a district court and if the justice finds the case proved he imposes a penalty and orders the forfeiture of the gear and catch.  The trawler owner or skipper are entitled to appeal.  I do not know how that procedure could be overcome because we must allow the right of appeal.  I do not think that can be done away with.  An appellant must set down a bond equal to the value of the fish and gear before an appeal.</P>

      <P>I was, and I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to consider other ways whereby in court the guilt of the poaching vessel can be established.  At the moment the ship must be arrested by another ship and the ship's captain brought to court, but other countries are now employing other methods of instituting proceeding against poaching trawlers, such as the taking of photographs from aeroplanes or helicopters which can be produced as evidence in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries his projections in relation to (a) boat-building (b) development of harbours and (c) processing for the years 1977, 1978 and 1979; the estimated cost of these projects; and the sum being provided by the Government for this development in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Targets have been set which envisage the addition of an average of 76 boats of all sizes <Col N="1579" /> to the Irish fishing fleet in each of the years 1977, 1978 and 1979.  These targets will be monitored and if necessary up-dated each year.</P>
      <P>The development of major fishery harbours and other landing places will continue on the basis of national priorities and local needs.  Detailed programmes of work under this heading are settled from year to year.</P>
      <P>The expansion of fish processing is a matter for private enterprise in the first instance and the scale of such expansion in the years ahead will, of course, depend to a large extent on the supplies of fish available.  Financial assistance for this work is available from a number of agencies including the Industrial Development Authority, Gaeltarra Éireann, and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Suitable projects also qualify for FEOGA grants.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of new boats in the three years in question will amount to about £30 million at current prices.  Because of the factors which I have mentioned, it would be extremely difficult to frame realistic estimates for this period in respect of harbour development and fish processing. The sum to be provided in 1977 for fishery development generally is still under consideration.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that fisheries development, boat building, and so on, is something that must be done over a period of years, is it not strange that the Parliamentary Secretary cannot give me a figure for 1977 as to what he has in mind for boat building, harbour development and processing?  We are nearly into 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary then explain to me, if this plan is in existence, whether it has been published?  Is there any documentary evidence of it?  Where can that be found?  Does it indicate the amount to be spent on harbour development and the amount to be provided by the Government even for 1977, never mind the years thereafter? Is there on paper any such development plan?  To that extent is not what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said on his way home from The Hague&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be thinking that Fianna Fáil are still in office.  Our first job when we came to office in 1973 was to set down a development plan on the basis of conditions then existing.  It is working reasonably well by virtue of the additional sums made available by the Exchequer towards fishery development generally and these far exceed the inflationary trend that has obtained in the past few years.  What is happening is that we are updating our plan in accordance with the agreement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the month with the European Commission.</P>

      <P>We have certain targets to achieve and we are trying to achieve them by this plan which envisages an additional 300 boats up to the end of 1979.  We are to have 72 additional boats this year and 76 in each of the years 1977, 1978 and 1979.  Our objective, and I hope it will be realised&mdash;I am not a prophet&mdash;is to double our fish catch from 75,000 tons to 150,000 tons, excluding salmon which, as everybody knows, is a very important species at the moment as far as money returns are concerned.</P>

I accept that Deputy Gallagher posed his questions in a businesslike way and that he is entitled to get the fullest possible information.  That I have given him.  There is no further information at my disposal.  We hope our targets will be attainable and realised.  I am quite optimistic that we will measure up to the requirements set out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Optimism is no substitute for realistic planning.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that after a protest by fishermen he asked them to submit a development plan for our sea fishing industry?  If there had been in existence a plan, such as he has told us about today, was it not odd that he should ask the fishermen to submit a plan?  Would he agree that a fine detailed plan was submitted by the fishing industry to him and will he now indicate if any of the proposals in that plan have been adopted by him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked everybody concerned with the industry, certain organisations and individuals <Col N="1582" /> to submit proposals.  I made it clear that any suggestions coming from the fishermen's organisations, from individual fishermen, from the Department's staff or from the processing or boat building side would be welcomed. All these would be assessed and, possibly, some of the more useful suggestions could be implemented as policy.  Therefore, not only did I invite recommendations from the various organisations but I sought suggestions from individuals associated with the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having received the recommendations and suggestions it was our job to make an assessment and we have done that in accordance with our negotiated agreement last month with our EEC partners. I would remind Deputy Haughey again that there was no plan for fisheries during Fianna Fáil's time in office and that the main difficulty now stems from the fact that Fianna Fáil overlooked fisheries completely in the negotiations for accession to the EEC. This has made our task more difficult.</P>

      <P>There are no restrictions imposed on skippers regarding where they might have their vessels built but we have indicated that where possible boats should be built in Ireland.  I am satisfied that the Irish boatyards are capable of meeting requirements in full except for steel boats. In the not-too-distant future, perhaps next year, they shall be able to meet steel boat requirements.  I do not know whether we have been pursuing the correct policy in not stipulating where skippers should have their boats built.  Because the number of boats built abroad for Irish skippers is relatively small we have not imposed a clampdown so far as grants or other aids are concerned. However, this is something that might be reviewed particularly when we reach the stage of building steel boats here.  As I said earlier, the demand for steel boats is a relatively new concept.</P>

In fact at the end of 1974 the organisation had accumulated substantial reserves and it was not, therefore, necessary to make any grant to them.

As time went <Col N="1591" /> on it was apparent that it would require Government grants in addition to its membership subscriptions.  Those grants were forthcoming, as I have outlined and, as I have said, by the end of 1974 the organisation had accumulated substantial funds in the neighbourhood of £50,000.  Therefore it was not necessary for a further State grant to be made in 1975 or 1976. Again, as I have said, when these grants are required they will be forthcoming.</P>

For the nine months of 1974, £13,000 were granted.

      <P>Dr. Donal Lamont, Bishop of Umtali, is at present at liberty pending the outcome of his appeal against the ten-year sentence imposed on him on 1st October last when he pleaded guilty to charges arising out of the failure to report the presence of terrorists at a mission to the illegal Rhodesian authorities.  It is expected that his appeal will be heard early next year.</P>
      <P>As to what action the Government might take on the matter, we of course abide by the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Rhodesia and therefore do not recognise or have diplomatic relations with the present Rhodesian regime.  It is not, therefore, possible for us to raise the matter directly with that regime.</P>
      <P>As the Minister indicated on 1st October however, the Government have made representations on Dr. Lamont's behalf to the Governments involved in the current negotiations on Rhodesia's future and we hope that every effort will be made to ensure that he will not have to serve a prison sentence but will be free to carry on the good work which he has long carried out for all the people of his diocese.</P>

      <P>Yes. I am not sure if I have the exact date.  I have some information here.  The Minister issued a statement on the 1st October, the date <Col N="1598" /> on which the Bishop was sentenced and he said in that statement that representations would be made on Dr. Lamont's behalf.  I have information here that appeals were made to the Governments of Britain, the USA, Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia and Tanzania.  We were then informed that Britain had raised the matter of Dr. Lamont with Salisbury in Rhodesia and had got a noncommittal reply.  A tentative approach was made also to the Angola delegation to the United Nations in New York but it was not possible to contact them.  I am sorry I cannot tell the Deputy the date that this happened. If it is important to him, I will try to find out.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the consequences of a boycott policy on Rhodesia.  Some of the consequences must be borne by the countries that impose it.  One of the consequences for us is that we have no formal contact and may not under the Security Council resolutions take up any formal contact with the very authorities who are in a position to be able to let Dr. Lamont out.  This is the same kind of problem as I handled here last week in regard to Argentina. It has been dealt with expeditiously there, I hope.  Certainly in that case formal approaches can be made through an established diplomatic mission.  That cannot be done with Rhodesia.  The Minister's judgment of the best way to do it was to indicate concern and make representations to the countries that are involved in the negotiations about Rhodesia's future. I will mention the Deputy's idea to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will propose to the Council of Ministers of the European Community the establishment of a fund to aid joint programmes of co-operation between voluntary youth organisations in Northern Ireland and the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister would welcome co-operation between voluntary youth organisations on either side of the Border, his Department have not received any approach about a programme of such co-operation.</P>
      <P>With regard to assistance from the European Community there are no existing budgetary provisions which could be availed of to assist projects of the type suggested by the Deputy and none of the present programmes relating to youth activities provides a basis for a special fund as envisaged in the question.</P>
      <P>He would not regard it as realistic to ask the Community, in the present stage of its evolution, to set up a special fund outside of existing programmes directed towards a particular politico-social problem in one area of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will recognise that the politico-social problem in that area of the country is especially acute.  Having regard to the fundamental aims of the Community to bring about peace and understanding, he will recognise that there is an urgency to look to the special needs of that area.  Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in view of all of that, if the Government would not consider activating the Community or even the European youth forum of that Community to launching a campaign whereby these dedicated youth organisations can get together to work to eradicate the causes of disorder and violence for which object organisations on both sides have been established?  Can I tell the Parliamentary Secretary that there was a scheme of co-operation between these organisations during the term of office of the previous Administration? I do <Col N="1601" /> not know what has happened to it in the meantime.</P>

      <P>The information I have comes from early last year.  The information on the European youth forum is probably what the Deputy is talking about.  It would involve delegates from representative youth organisations and the discussion of community measures with respect to their effect on youth, and it was proposed to set up a committee for youth questions.  The Commission envisaged that in the long term this committee would consider securing co-operation of youth affairs such as the promotion of youth exchanges between member states, and the mobility of youth workers and youth service administrators through exchange schemes.</P>
      <P>These Commission proposals for a youth forum met with some opposition and the Commission then proposed the creation of a temporary youth secretariat.  The secretariat was the subject of agreement and it got a grant of 50 thousand units on account from the Commission, but was working independently of it.  It would function as a liaison organisation between EEC institutions and youth groups in the community.  I think an existing youth group here or in the North of Ireland which has a programme for a project which was relevant to the aims of this secretariat ought to approach it.  Certainly the Government would be sympathetic to the general ideas expressed by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a suggestion that the Government's responsibility would not be sufficiently discharged by reacting to what these youth organisations would be doing but that the Government would take the initiative themselves in this area and propose, as I have asked, to the Community through its various agencies that they would launch such a campaign to ensure co-ordination of youth activity and to bring these young people closer together and thereby eradicate causes of some of the most terrible violence we have had.</P>

      <P>Arising out of my reply to Question No. 2 on yesterday's Order Paper regarding educational facilities for members of the Permanent Defence Force, Deputy Dowling inquired whether non-commissioned officers and privates would have an opportunity of attending the university in Galway.  In reply I stated that they would provided they had the same educational qualifications.  I regret <Col N="1613" /> that my reply to the supplementary question may have created the impression that the scheme under which cadets are sent to attend degree courses in University College, Galway, was being extended to enable non-commissioned officers and privates to attend such courses.  In replying to Deputy Dowling I had in mind the continuance of the arrangement whereby in each year's competition for Army cadetships one-third of the vacancies are reserved for certain members of the Defence Forces and any such member who is awarded a cadetship and is educationally qualified to attend university is required to attend University College, Galway, as part of the second year of his cadet course.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Dáil question, there is also an arrangement whereby non-commissioned officers and privates who attend certain third-level courses of education in their own time may, subject to certain conditions, be refunded the tuition and examination fees involved.</P>

I have not got all the necessary information to say whether a particular applicant would come under the terms of this Bill.  However, if any Deputy has any case he would like me to consider I shall gladly do so. Deputy Briscoe has already drawn one case to my attention and if Deputy Callanan or any other Deputy has a case they wish to be considered I shall take it up with the ESB and find out the position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Herbert, I am afraid I may not have enough information to satisfy him but I will tell him the position as I understand it.  The Deputy asked if the EEC Regional Fund could be used as a contribution towards this scheme.  I understand it could not.  The fund will not contribute towards the cost of non-farm installations. The regional fund could contribute assistance towards the cost of infrastructural development but this scheme is intended to cater for people who apply for a domestic supply of current and not for infrastructure as that is generally meant.  For that reason I understand the scheme would not qualify under the regional fund for a grant from the EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett and practically every Deputy who spoke in the debate mentioned the confusion with regard to the charges.  They said that many people who could participate in the scheme did not appreciate what was in the Bill.  Deputy Callanan was under a misapprehension regarding the figure of £700.</P>
      <P>With regard to people who refused connection in the period 1971 to 1975 because they were unable to pay the contribution asked, they will now have paid for them the capital contribution necessary to allow their houses to be connected.  The method of assessment is involved and complicated.  The £700 is made up of a special service charge and a fixed charge and the amount in excess of that of the capital contribution will be refunded to the ESB by my Department.  So far as concerns the 800 or 900 people involved, the scheme will be most welcome.  I do not pretend it is an earth-shattering piece of legislation and that it will change the face of rural Ireland.  It is a Bill designed for a specific purpose, to relieve a specific hardship for people in very remote parts of the country.  When the electricity is connected to their houses I hope they will feel in some small measure that the imbalance with regard to their quality of life and that of their neighbours in more advanced economic regions will be somewhat redressed. I also hope they will continue to play a vital and most significant role in the development of this country by remaining in rural areas and contributing to the advancement of the economy of their region and the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because all charges exceeded £700 for the people catered for here that the Bill has been brought in.  A sum up to £700 would be paid by the consumer by way of a 5.2 per cent interest rate on £700.  This would be divided into a fixed charge and a special service charge.  Over £700 the consumer was asked to pay a capital contribution of from £200 to £600 and that is the proportion being paid under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to increase to £75 million the aggregate of borrowings by Aer Lingus and Aerlínte which the Minister for Finance may guarantee at any one time.  Under the Air Companies (Amendment) <Col N="1619" /> Act, 1969, the limit was raised from £24 million to the present level of £50 million.  This was done in anticipation of the major fleet re-equipment programme which the air companies were then embarking on and which involved the acquisition of the two Boeing 747s and eight Boeing 737 aircraft.</P>
    <P>The net result is that the total amount of borrowings guaranteed by the Minister for Finance as at the 31st October last stood at £35 million and two other loan facilities for £6 million and $12.5 million which are now in course of finalisation will bring this figure to just under £50 million.  Government guarantee is a normal requirement in obtaining loan facilities so that it is now necessary to raise the limit to enable the air companies to make continuing provisions for future capital requirements.  The increased borrowing facility provided by this Bill is not required by the air companies immediately.  Because of the unsettled state of the world capital market at present the air companies must be in a position to negotiate loan facilities as they become available, to be drawn on as required.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is a suitable occasion to say something on the difficulties confronting the national airline and the future outlook.  I need not recount the factors which have made recent years such a difficult period for the industry world wide nor the additional factors, particularly the violence in the North and inflation, which made the period such a critical one for the Irish airline.  Over the past two years the air companies suffered net losses of over £5 million in each year before taking account of extraordinary items such as the unrealised loss of £4.6 million in 1975-76 which arises on the repayment of foreign loans due to the devaluation of sterling and the extra £3.8 million received from a US court settlement in 1974-75.  These enormous losses are almost exclusively attributable to the Atlantic service.  The very depressed state of the industry on the Atlantic is due in the main to a fall in traffic over a number of <Col N="1620" /> years, intensive charter competition and uneconomic fares.  This depressed state continues and there is little sign as yet of an early improvement. It is of little consolation that foreign airlines have fared no better on the Atlantic, but they have the cushion of much wider networks with sectors more profitable than the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>These losses threaten the very survival of our Atlantic service.  If the loss situation cannot be quickly remedied we would have little option but to terminate or very seriously curtail the service.  This would be a very severe blow and costly in terms of jobs, tourism, national development and morale.  Government subsidy would be no solution.  We could not afford to pay subsidy of anything like the magnitude of present losses.  A subsidised airline, with the deliberation that subsidy brings with it, would have far less chance of survival on the Atlantic in its present exacting and depressed state than an airline standing on its own feet fighting for survival.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that our airline is fighting back.  It is pursuing a strategy based on the retention of the present fleet, increased marketing and charter activity, rigid control of costs and the maximum development of profits from related and ancillary activities.  For the current year ending on the 31st March next the air companies have set a target of an operating profit of £1.5 million which represents an improvement of about £3.5 million at operating level, over 1975-76.  Latest indications are that this target will be realised and possibly exceeded.</P>
    <P>This is quite encouraging but there are difficult years ahead.  Traffic on the North Atlantic is unlikely to resume the strong sustained growth rates of former years.  Future growth cannot be relied upon to solve our difficulties.  Containment of costs, efficient operation and vigorous marketing will continue to be the main key to the solution.  In the national context the importance of pay restraint is being stressed over and over again but I can see no area in which pay restraint is of more vital importance at this juncture than in our struggle to preserve <Col N="1621" /> the fabric of our airline.  Given the required containment of costs, I have every confidence that with a renewal of growth in air travel our airline can survive the difficult years immediately ahead and continue to serve the community as effectively as it did in the past.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity in the Bill of providing for control of the remuneration of the chief officer of the air companies.  This arises from the general policy of taking the remuneration of chief executives of semi-State bodies under control as and when the opportunity arises.  The intention here is to allow the boards to fix the total remuneration of the chief executives within the range approved by me with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill is consolidating all the provisions in the existing legislation relating to borrowing.  The advantages of having all the relevant provisions contained in a single piece of legislation are self evident.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We recognise and we appreciate the reasons why this Bill has to be introduced.  It is designed to permit our national airline to continue to maintain itself by raising the level of borrowing from £50 million to £75 million.  We are all very conscious of its record and what it has achieved.  Likewise, we are conscious that it has fallen on hard times in recent years.  We know the reasons for that.  We know it has made a supreme effort to overcome the difficulties and we know it has been successful to some extent.  It is not, of course, alone in being in a loss situation and, comparatively speaking, its losses are nothing like the losses sustained by airlines like Alitalia and the American networks.  Our airline has made a big effort to extricate itself from this loss situation and we hope the projected improvement adumbrated will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This airline has been involved to a great extent in promotional activities and the promotional budget in North America, is, I understand, more than the combined budgets of Bord Fáilte <Col N="1622" /> and other bodies involved there.  In no small way Aer Lingus has been responsible for the growth in tourism from North America over the past ten or 15 years.  Its role has been a major one.  Unfortunately it is the North Atlantic route which is causing most of the trouble now.</P>
    <P>In the past other hazards, such as the landing rights issue, have had to be overcome.  There appear to be no ill effects as a result of that major issue. I believe the airline would admit this. European traffic has increased by 7 per cent and cross-channel traffic by 14 per cent.  Atlantic traffic has gone down by 18 per cent.  I am talking now about passenger traffic, not cargo traffic.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the introduction of this legislation is the need for currency readjustment as a result of borrowings outside the sterling area. Having indulged in this kind of borrowing the airline is in big trouble now because of the readjustment that has to be made.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus operate out of Britain and from the Continent as well as out of Ireland.  They also operate out of North America.  A big percentage of the revenue from this traffic must be in hard currencies, like the dollar, the franc, the mark and so on.  This must put them in a much more favourable position from the point of view of non-sterling borrowings as compared with the ESB, Bord na Móna and the other bodies under the control of the Minister for Transport and Power.  Aer Lingus must be in a slightly privileged position and I should like the Minister to elaborate on this.  They have dollars available to them and they have hard continental currencies available to them.  Those who book passage in North America pay in dollars.  The percentage booking in Ireland would be much lower.</P>
    <P>There must be a good dollar return from North Atlantic operations.  The number of continentals coming here would likewise be greater than the number of our people visiting the Continent.  There should be francs and marks and other European currencies available to Aer Lingus and <Col N="1623" /> these should be helpful in currency readjustments.  They are in a strong position as compared with those who utilise sterling only.  They are in a more favourable position than the ESB and so on because these have to import oil and pay for it in dollars. Most of the employees undoubtedly work in Ireland.  They are paid in sterling and deal in sterling all the time.  The number of employees who would have to be paid in the hard currency of other countries would not be many in comparison with the total number of the employees of the company.  This needs to be explained by the Minister. He should tell us what it means to the company to have access to the hard currencies in order to deal with their borrowings in hard currencies.  It seems that they have the currency required to repay the non-sterling loans at their disposal without having to have a readjustment because the pound keeps falling.  I should like to know how much more the company would be in the red if they did not have access to that currency.</P>
    <P>On the question of currencies I should like to refer to an article in <i>The Irish Press</i> of today, under the heading: &ldquo;Aer Lingus may drop sterling link&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is planning to drop sterling as the currency for calculating fares and is working towards a special negotiating unit called the IATA unit of value, a company spokesman confirmed yesterday.</P>
    <P>The IATA unit would be based on the system of special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund and would overcome severe complications in fair calculations caused by the steady decline in sterling in recent years.</P>
    <P>I understood that the conference in question is in progress in Singapore. It seems that air companies are ready to switch from sterling to dollars.  The article further states:</P>
    <P>The world's airlines believe that it would be better to drop sterling and to use the dollar alone as the <Col N="1624" /> base currency in calculating fares, pending the establishment of the air transport association's own unit of value.</P>
    <P>If this is adopted what will it mean to travellers from Ireland and those using Aer Lingus from Britain?  On the recent record of the drop in sterling if this change comes about the people here and in Britain will have to find a further 20 per cent for their fares if they wish to travel by Aer Lingus.  This should be explained before Aer Lingus adopt it.  We would need a definite assurance about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote a further passage from that article:</P>
    <P>Asked if this would result in any increase in fares to enable airlines to compensate themselves fully for differences in value between sterling and the dollar, the spokesman said this was doubtful.</P>
    <P>That statement does not explain very much.  The spokesman should have elaborated.  There is an obligation on Aer Lingus, and on the Minister, to be specific and spell out what a change such as this would mean to travellers from the sterling area in increased fares.  It is important that we are told that before the company is committed to a change.  We are all aware of the criticism by Irish people living in Britain when a rise in fares is sanctioned. Irish organisations in Britain continually harp at the cost of flying home and to suddenly hit these people with such an increase is a liberty that should not be permitted.  I appreciate that such a system would mean something to the viability of the airline but if it will cost those using the airline within the sterling area dearly that is another matter.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are involved in many ancillary activities.  We have heard a lot of criticism from different bodies about Aer Lingus being permitted to get involved in those activities.  They give us to understand that their involvement in those activities is a drag on the air operations of the company. As far as I can ascertain that is not so.  The activities of the company vary a lot.  The company is very much involved in hotel accommodation, <Col N="1625" /> recreational facilities and other investments. With the principle exception of the Tara Hotel in London it appears that these ancillary activities are proving profitable in the main.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>So is the Tara Hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said profitable but has not reached its full expectation of projection.  They are involving themselves 33? per cent in ancillary activities.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism of this but I think it is only right we should express appreciation of their involvement in outside interests.  Aer Lingus have interested themselves in the hotel industry.  So have TWA, Pan-Am and other airlines.  They have a 50 per cent interest in the Dunfey Corporation of America.  The profits from these involvements will supplement their ordinary airline operations on the North Atlantic route and will show in their balance sheets.  They have the Tara Hotel in London, into which their flying activities are very large. They have acquired an interest in Tenerife and this is only right because many people from Ireland these days go on winter holidays there and it is logical that Aer Lingus would have an interest in the hotel side of it. Their ancillary involvements in the US will help to pay some of their promotional costs there and will be beneficial to the entire operation of the airline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our national airline for years have been known as the friendly airline but recently there have been criticism that they can no longer be known by that term.  Of course, there are all sorts of hazards and annoyances at airports these days and people tend to get nettled more quickly than they do at railway stations or other such transport termini.  However, Aer Lingus should be very careful to try to preserve their tag of &ldquo;the friendly airline&rdquo;.  We hope they will do so even if it means an extra smile from their lovely hostesses.  I do not travel by air very frequently and I do not think that my being the Opposition spokesman on Transport and Power has anything to do with it, but I have had no cause for <Col N="1626" /> complaint against the service of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have been the target of criticism many times in the past in regard to charter flights.  We appreciate they are in a very difficult position in regard to the charter business and we must remember that the North Atlantic charter service went completely astray.  If there was a proliferation of that service our regular flights would come to a standstill.  However, a lot of the flak in regard to the charter business blew over on Aer Lingus. They were not the only airline involved in trying to clear up the abuses.  I think the Greek airline were also responsible.</P>
    <P>People have said that if it were not for Aer Lingus this country would have had more tourists who would have come in by charter.  We in the House have a big commitment to our national airline and we on this side have always supported them and will continue to do so.  I wonder if it would be beneficial to our tourist industry and to the national airline if Aer Lingus were to repossess and use the Jumbos they have chartered on the North Atlantic route.  They have spent a lot of money on promotional work on the other side of the Atlantic.  The supplemental air services, who have done nothing for Ireland, seem to be getting a large share of the charter work, particularly into Shannon.  Perhaps Aer Lingus should give more attention to this growing market, particularly on the North Atlantic route and, perhaps, here there is room for more co-operation with Bord Fáilte so that the tourist traffic from North America would be maximised.</P>
    <P>We support the Bill.  It would be wrong to say we welcome it because we do not welcome the necessity for it but we support the airline in their hour of need.  Their losses of £5 million odd are not very great.  We look forward in the near future to the airline getting back into the black out of the red.  In their past history the companies have proved themselves.  They are a good commercial operation. Nobody can deny that.  Like any good commercial operation they have met a bad patch, but we feel they will prove themselves again and pull out of it in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> The fact that their record has been so good in the past does not put them above criticism from any side of the House.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister explain what the effect will be of the fact that they have access to dollars, deutschemarks and hard currency by way of revenue. I would say a big proportion of their revenue comes from hard currency each year.  I will be interested to hear what effect this has on repayments of non-sterling loans and how a currency readjustment can occur when they have dollars, deutschemarks and francs available to them by way of revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to raise the borrowing power to Aerlínte and Aer Lingus to £75 million.  The companies made good use of the money they borrowed previously when the limit was raised from £24 million to £50 million.  They purchased two Boeing 747s and eight Boeing 737s. On this occasion, although the money is not required by the companies, the Minister is giving authority to raise money for future planning.</P>
      <P>There is a loss in both companies at present.  This is easily understood in one of the most difficult periods of our history.  I will not go over the ground again because it has been worn threadbare.  Until we have a normal, peaceful climate we cannot expect to return to a period of buoyancy in incomes earned from our overseas travel commitments.  We in the Shannon area are very concerned that both companies should be buoyant.  The whole economy of that region is tied up with the success of the companies because of the employment they create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another indication of the Government's faith in our semi-State companies, for which they have a certain responsibility, and of their faith in our future.  If the losses are allowed to continue, they will threaten the very survival of our Atlantic service.  It is alarming to think that, if we cannot correct these losses and turn them into a profit, it may be necessary in a very short time to terminate this service or curtail it. Either would be a disaster for us in <Col N="1628" /> the Shannon area in particular.  I have great faith in our tourism potential. Last year we had an increase in the number of tourists coming into the airport at Shannon.  There is growing evidence that that will continue in the coming year.  We should boost morale in the tourism area and show confidence in the expanding potential which could be described as a national development.</P>
    <P>This is a right step at the right time.  I congratulate the Minister on making provision in good time to allow the companies to re-equip if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we debated the introduction of a joint committee to investigate the affairs of the semi-State bodies.  Speaking as a Deputy for North County Dublin I am proud to say I represent a constituency which has had very close ties with Aer Lingus since the company's formation. If all the other State companies had operated in the same manner as Aer Lingus there would be no need for the setting up of this committee.  Down through the years Aer Lingus have maintained one principle above all others&mdash;they shunned the word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; and operated on a commercial basis.  They did not operate on the basis that would seem to be the norm of other semi-State bodies, that is, spending money for the sake of spending it and working on the theory that no Government could allow them go to the wall, in other words, that whichever Government happened to be in power would pay the required subsidy at the end of the year, regardless of what were the losses.  As a Deputy for North County Dublin, I am very proud that our national airline has operated on a commercial basis.  The need for this Bill confirms the basic principle held by the management and staff of Aer Lingus, that is, that they have no wish to become involved in a situation of going to the Government each year cap-in-hand asking for the subsidisation of losses.  It was the airline's wish to operate on a commercial basis that has brought about the necessity for this Bill.  However, I regret that the Bill is necessary but I am pleased to support it.  No other semi-State body <Col N="1629" /> has done more than Aer Lingus either on a national or an international level, for the good name of Ireland.  This organisation have done more than any other to preserve the pride of the Irish people in something specifically Irish.  I say this because of the wonderful reputation of the airline in relation to courtesy, friendliness, efficiency and so on both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>At a time when the airline is facing difficulties we should be failing in our duty if we did not support them fully. I am glad, however, that they are overcoming the problems but that is something I shall refer to again later. In any case, we have a duty to assist them at this time in their evolution.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to the importance of the success of our national airline to his constituency of Clare but in my area of North County Dublin there is hardly a family without a member or a relative working at or near the airport.  Indeed, the airline's success can be attributed in large measure to the enthusiasm and the dedication of the people of this area.  In saying that I am not in any way belittling people from other areas who have come to work with the airline but the airport was located from the beginning at Collinstown and down through the years the employees have given of their best.  In the case of air hostesses, for instance, there was always a readiness to operate a check-in if that was necessary or to assist a passenger after he had left the aircraft if that was considered necessary.  It was this spirit that has built up the airline to what it is.  That is the spirit that has brought Aer Lingus through the difficult times of the forties and fifties, through the successes of the sixties and which will bring them through the difficulties of today and into the successes of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past couple of years Aer Lingus have been experiencing problems.  These are attributable to such factors as the economic downturn in the US, the Northern Ireland situation and the high rate of hotel charges and other services.  All of these factors have combined to result in a downturn in tourism generally. <Col N="1630" /> Here, I must emphasise that these problems were created for Aer Lingus and not by them.  There is a peculiarly Irish characteristic of knocking anything Irish, of not giving credit where credit is due.  In this context there has been some criticism of Aer Lingus and their operations during the past couple of years.  It was said that they prevented charter planes from bringing thousands of tourists from the US.  There was much bleating from some hotels to the effect that Aer Lingus were preventing tourists coming into the country.  All of this criticism was ill-informed and misdirected. Had it not been for the airline's operations in the first place and for the massive amount of advertising carried out by them down through the years in the US and on the Continent in their efforts to sell the idea of holidays in Ireland, many of these hotels would not have come into existence in the first place.  These are the hotels that speak now of mythical thousands of tourists that, according to them, have been prevented from coming here.  Instead, these <i>hoteliers</i> and others who offer such criticism should be loud in their praise of Aer Lingus for what they have done to create an interest abroad in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are co-operating with other IATA lines to provide sufficient seats across the Atlantic for those tourists anxious to make that journey. It has been said that if Aer Lingus had allowed the principal charters to come in our tourist figures would have been much greater.  There are plenty of charters coming in here.  All Aer Lingus were trying to do was to regulate for the benefit of the Irish tourist trade and for the country generally and to put some order into the charter industry as it was operating across the Atlantic.  If the situation had been allowed to continue at its level of a few years ago, the whole scheduled service across the Atlantic would have been abolished because they could not have remained in competition with the charters.  What does the scheduled service mean?  It means that we as a nation have access to the American continent for business on a regular basis.  Surely it is important for our industrialists and salesmen to <Col N="1631" /> know that they have such a service available and <i>vice versa</i> for the industrialists coming in here.  Without this scheduled service this country, which is trying to build up its industrial base would have been in a serious situation. I hope the Minister will nail once and for all this lie that Aer Lingus, by their restrictions on the illegal charter operators across the Atlantic, are in some way damaging the Irish national interest.</P>
    <P>Again, when the battle over landing rights for the American airlines was being fought here, we heard the story that if only TWA and Pan-Am could come in here they would spend millions of pounds in America and around the world advertising the attractions of Ireland, that there would be full flights, and if only they could have one landing a day, after a couple of years they would be bringing in two or three planes every day due to the amount of advertising they intended to do in America.  What are the facts?  They have spent nothing like the sums of money they were talking about spending on advertising Ireland.  TWA eventually got the landing rights.  All they are doing is creaming off business which Aer Lingus themselves have already generated through their own advertising campaigns in the States.  I am not saying that TWA have not done some advertising, but they have done very little compared with the wild promises made by the American operators when they were making their case for landing rights here.  They have merely exacerbated an already difficult situation and created great problems for Aer Lingus.  Therefore, I would ask that the message should go out loud and clear from this House&mdash;and I hope the Minister will re-echo it&mdash;that TWA should fulfil the promises they made on advertising, that they should generate extra traffic and not be taking the traffic that is already on the Atlantic away from our national carrier.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, in their usual manner, are fighting back.  This year we have seen significant if not dramatic improvements in the number of tourists travelling with Aer Lingus across the Atlantic.  The very success they <Col N="1632" /> achieved this year brought certain criticism with it because, anticipating a certain number of tourists, they had leased out their Jumbo to another airline. Due to their advertising campaign and the promotion work they did during the year, they attracted extra tourists.  Unfortunately, they had to charter a Jumbo from Alitalia.  As I say, through their own efforts, the goodwill they built up, the excellent service they were providing for the tourists coming across the Atlantic, they increased business beyond reasonable expectations, and there was no justification for the carping criticism from certain sections of the tourist trade.  Aer Lingus will survive to fight these knockers, and through the spirit that exists among the staff they will once again, in spite of their critics, prove that they are capable of holding their own across the Atlantic and in Europe.</P>
    <P>The scheduled services provided by Aer Lingus to Europe are equally important to our industrialists, crossing to Brussels, to the centre of the political and industrial areas in the mainland of Europe.  Without Aer Lingus we would be depending on somebody else to provide this vital link with Europe.  I think it is only right I mention also the attitude of the British airline and airport authorities.  Aer Lingus built up a service, Dublin-Manchester-Amsterdam, Dublin-Manchester-Brussels. The very success of their efforts resulted in their losing landing and pick-up rights in Manchester. When Aer Lingus build up a market Big Brother across the Irish Sea looks for that market.  The envy with which the British airways and others looked at the success of the Irish airline is a tribute in itself to the service being given by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus also, in the last few years, recognising the problems they were facing and about to face, engaged in ancillary activities such as training.  This is again a tribute to the service the staff have given at international level down through the years. Aer Lingus have one of the finest training services of any airline in the world.  Every year they bring in for training as pilots, hostesses and <Col N="1633" /> mechanics, people from Siam, Singapore, the Bahamas and many other places.  This is a substantial source of revenue not only directly to Aer Lingus but also to this country, because the people who come in have to stay in hotels or are living with families.  If Aer Lingus were not providing such a high standard of service other airlines would not have their personnel trained by them.  The greatest tribute that can be paid to any company is to have their services recognised by their competitors to the extent that they send their staff to that company to be trained.  Aer Lingus have also diversified by entering the hotel business and leasing planes, and have done very well in both.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to pay restraint.  I can understand his reason for doing this.  If the workers of a company are working hard and, as a result, generating profits, they are entitled to a fair share of the profit. My view is that the staff of Aer Lingus are entitled to a fair share of the profit.  As this is a sensitive subject, which is under ballot by the staff of Aer Lingus at present, I do not wish to go into it in any great detail, but any group of workers who generate wealth are entitled to a fair percentage of it.</P>

New runways are planned for Dublin Airport and there are compulsory purchase orders for land around the airport.  In his reply I should like the Minister to refer to the timetable for the new facilities which will allow the new runways to be built.  It was anticipated that they would be built by the end of the decade but this does not appear to be the situation at present because the forward planning has come to a halt. In his reply I should like the Minister to refer to the provision of new runways for what I hope will be a dramatically increased fleet of aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> I should like to pay a tribute to the staff and management of Aer Lingus for the pride which they have given us and the manner in which they have carried on the work of this semi-State body.  They have avoided the word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo;.  If other semi-State bodies had the same record our finances would not be in a mess today.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. I am glad to note that the increased borrowing facility is not required immediately, which must be some consolation to the public in view of the gloomy economic news from all parts of the world.  Aer Lingus have done a good job in difficult circumstances. Their greatest difficulty is the present devaluation of the £ sterling.  The devaluation of the £ is unreal and over-pessimistic and is not justified by the facts.  This affects Aer Lingus because most of their equipment is bought outside the sterling area, often in hard currency areas.  At a recent meeting of the International Monetary Fund one spokesman voiced his concern for the weaker currency countries and said it was about time different language was used by the many critics from the stronger currency countries in cajoling, advising and telling the poorer countries how to handle their affairs.  Countries with strong currencies and many natural resources have an international obligation and should make concessions. Recently I had discussions with some foreign businessmen and was pleased to learn that many countries are prepared to take payment in sterling, even at this time.  Obtaining foreign currency is a technical matter and it has to be done through certain channels. However, I just mentioned that <i>en passant.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the new IATA unit.  He gave his version of the meaning of its publication in <i>The Irish Press</i>.  His explanation is too simple, and would be open to an unduly pessimistic interpretation.  It is necessary to have an international unit of account in dealing with the tourist industry, particularly in regard to airlines. There are enough complications without having to translate different <Col N="1635" /> currencies.  If international transport calculations have to be made in a hurry as journeys are often last-minute decisions.  An international unit of account would help to reduce the running costs of international airlines such as Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>When a piece of what I describe as permissive legislation is introduced to enable some of our State-sponsored companies to raise additional money, or when further capital is being allocated to them, it provides an opportunity of discussing the performance of the company concerned. Under the Air Companies (Amendment) Bill we are provided with this opportunity in relation to Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and Aerlínte. Deputies Burke and Barrett represent constituencies that are closely associated with Aer Lingus.  There is no doubt that the constituency of Clare which is Deputy Barrett's constituency, has gained tremendous advantages as a result of the activities of Aer Lingus and the other companies referred to in this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is unusual for a Deputy who has not raised the question to seek the permission of the Chair to raise the subject matter of that question on the Adjournment.  Following consultation with Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, I sought permission this morning to raise this question on the Adjournment.  I am not questioning information contained in the reply but, as the Chief Whip of the Opposition party, I am rather worried about the business of this House.  I am raising this question specifically because of the fact that the information which was purported to be supplied by way of a tabular statement to Deputy Fitzgerald <Col N="1636" /> was not supplied and I am concerned at this development.  There have been a number of occasions when Deputies did not feel that the reply from a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary was as comprehensive as it might be, and Deputies have appealed to the Ceann Comhairle arising from the contents of some replies.  The reply that a Ceann Comhairle must give to a Deputy is that he is not responsible for a Minister's reply.  In Question No. 35 of the 3rd November Deputy Fitzgerald asked the Minister for Labour:</P>
      <P>the number of persons at present seeking employment under the National Manpower Service in the following areas: Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and the rest of the country; and the number of person who were seeking employment on the same date last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour in his verbal reply said:</P>
      <P>Mr. M. O'Leary: The reply to the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement and I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have this circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I assumed and Deputy Fitzgerald assumed that, having got formal permission to circulate the information, that information would be circulated by the Minister.  The Official Report reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Table showing number of persons (males and females) registered for employment* with the National Manpower Service, on 1st October, 1976 and 3rd October, 1975, at the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway National Manpower Service offices and at National Manpower Service offices in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Official Report then outlined the offices and the numbers that were registered on 3rd October, 1975, with no reference whatsoever to the numbers that were registered on 1st October, 1976.  I am not saying that the Minister deliberately <Col N="1637" /> misled the House, but I am saying that the Minister could not possibly have issued that circulation without knowing that the information that was alleged to be contained in it was not in it.  Despite the fact that it was a circulated reply and we do not normally have discussions on circulated replies, Deputy Fitzgerald asked the Minister what the total figures for the entire country were&mdash;it was quite obvious that Deputy Fitzgerald was looking for comparative figures&mdash;and the Minister replied that they were in the statement. As I see it, the Minister compounded the misdirection of the House.  Deputy Fitzgerald felt at the time that the Minister was shielding behind the circulated reply, and in the light of the subsequent information I feel he was quite right in that.  Deputy Fitzgerald suggested that the Minister might be embarrassed, and Deputy O'Malley logically came to the conclusion that nothing would embarrass the Minister.</P>
    <P>Arising from this Deputy Fitzgerald asked me what he should do and whether it was a matter that could be raised with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in so far as the Minister had misled the House and the Ceann Comhairle.  Deputy Fitzgerald also told me that, following the reply to his question, he again took the opportunity to raise that matter in the House later that same evening in the course of his contribution to the debate on the social and economic policies. Deputy Fitzgerald had sought that information in relation to the contribution he proposed to make in the debate that evening.  In column 1208 of the Official Report for Wednesday, 3rd November, Volume 293, Deputy Fitzgerald again drew attention to this question, he announced that he had asked the question, he gave the Minister's reply and went on to say:</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question I asked the Minister to give me the total figures.  All I got was this tabular statement which I can place on the record of the House if necessary. The table shows the number of persons registered on 3rd October, 1975.  There was no reference in it to the first part of the question.  I beg your pardon.  There is a reference <Col N="1638" /> in it to the number of persons registered for employment with the National Manpower Service on 1st October, 1976, and 3rd October, 1975.  There is no reference in it to 1st October, 1976.  The cities and towns and the figure for October, 1975, are quoted.</P>
    <P>Is this not misleading a Deputy in the House and the House in general? Last Tuesday Deputy Fitzgerald rang the Department of Labour in order to get the information from the official in the section dealing with this.  The official referred him to the Minister's office.  Subsequently the Minister's office, having obviously been contacted by the section, rang Deputy Fitzgerald to inquire as to what the problem was.  Deputy Fitzgerald outlined the problem and indicated that he was anxious to have this information before he contributed on Tuesday evening of this week on our motion on the non-availability of work for young people and school leavers.  The Minister's private secretary assured him that he would have that information that evening in time for the debate. Deputy Fitzgerald heard nothing about the matter since.  This morning about 11.30 a.m. I gave notice of my intention to raise this matter and when Deputy Fitzgerald called to his pigeon hole in the information office about an hour ago he found a letter from the Minister for Labour saying that it had come to his attention that the circulated reply to Deputy Fitzgerald's question had inadvertently omitted to include the figures for the 1st October, 1976, that the Minister regretted the omission and had forwarded the relevant figures and that the Minister had also made arrangements to have those figures included in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The Minister regretted the omission of the figures but there is no question of an apology in the letter.  I suppose present-day Ministers do not apologise even when they are wrong.  Here is a situation whereby the Minister for Labour did not get around to writing that letter until his Department had been notified by the Dáil office that the Minister was due to appear here at 5 o'clock this evening to deal with <Col N="1639" /> this letter on the Adjournment.  The Minister must have been aware of it, if he had bothered to look at his reply. I have some experience of answering parliamentary questions in this House and if a Minister is interested he will normally study the background to a reply.  Perhaps we have a Minister here who is not interested.</P>
    <P>For the record it might be as well to mention that the figures Deputy Fitzgerald was seeking when he raised this question on Wednesday week were in respect of the comparison between the number of persons registered with the National Manpower Service, the total number, on the 1st October, 1976 as against 1st October, 1975.  The total number on 1st October, 1976 was 69,935 in comparison with 47,060, an increase of 50 per cent over the figure for 12 months ago. Those were the figures Deputy Fitzgerald sought.  He sought them in relation to his contribution to the debate on Wednesday evening of last week and to his contribution to the debate on Tuesday evening of this week. Those figures were denied him despite the fact that he used the one legitimate method any Deputy has always had afforded him.  I am not saying that one Deputy should have any greater privilege in this House than any other. There has been a traditional type of relationship here, which is that the front-bench spokesman on behalf of the Opposition has a line to the Minister.  I presume the line here is that the Minister, instead of getting his private secretary to write to a Deputy, himself writes to Deputy Fitzgerald.  Here we have this letter which was issued this evening because the question was being raised.</P>
    <P>I do not know what explanation the Minister may have for this misleading of the House.  We can put it down as having been overlooked or inadvertently left out.  But this inadvertence is certainly less excusable in view of the fact that attention was drawn to it on Wednesday evening in this House, that the Deputy himself made contact with the Minister's office on Tuesday last seeking this information and was promised he would have it by that evening.  The <Col N="1640" /> Deputy came to me this morning to ask: &ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; My first reaction was to write to you, a Cheann Comhairle, and ask that the matter be put down for consideration at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Then I decided that that was not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Here we have a development which should be discouraged.  You yourself, a Cheann Comhairle, must have some responsibility in this regard.  The situation is that, although it was indicated to you that the information was being supplied by way of tabular statement, only half the information was given.  It cannot be accepted that we had to wait until the afternoon of November 11th from the afternoon of November 3rd for the Minister and his Department to become aware of this inadvertence, to use one term; misleading is the term I use.  I am using this format for raising it and I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to do so, but I think you should take cognisance of whatever reply the Minister gives.  Having heard from the Minister, I would ask if you could give a further ruling as to what is the appropriate way to prevent a misleading reply of this nature being given to us again in this House.</P>

      <P>Of course, as I have stated to the Deputy concerned, there was this inadvertent omission in that the tabular statement for 1976 was omitted.  The draft reply, which I saw, included the tabular statement for 1976.  I regret the fact that, in its final typed form, as presented to the Dáil, that column was omitted.  I regret that omission.  But, as is quite apparent from my reply, in which I indicated that the totals for the entire country were given, it is quite clear that I did not, a Cheann Comhairle, deliberately mislead the Dáil.  I had seen a copy of the reply which included both columns and I regret the fact that, due to clerical error, both columns were not included in the final form given to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, no secret on my part, no attempt&mdash;and there never was&mdash;to disguise the figures given for <Col N="1641" /> the year 1976.  In fact, I think it was on the 4th October I made a speech on the subject in relation to the figures for the Dublin area, which include almost half the figures for the entire country for 1976.  So we can immediately dismiss the idea that there was any intention on my part, for any particular advantage whatever, to suppress the column for 1976.  As I have said, it was an inadvertant omission due to clerical error.  The whole matter, such as it is, could have been cleared up if the Deputy who received the reply on the afternoon it was given&mdash;I think on Wednesday a week ago; he had a copy of the reply in his hand immediately&mdash;had contacted my office on that week or immediately he had the reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and saw that it was incorrect in terms of the question put, and presumably he would have had the information requested in time for the debate which concerned him.  My own office, when contacted on the matter late on Tuesday afternoon were informed of the matter for the first time and undertook to supply the information, and the information was supplied today to the Deputy concerned, together with my regrets. Therefore, we can lay any scenario that a rather lurid Opposition imagination might try to paint of the matter and look on the facts as I have presented them here.</P>
      <P>In regard to the actual material of the question, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash; and this is as good an occasion as any on which to right the record in that the column as requested was missing&mdash;the question asked was:</P>
      <P>...the number of persons at present seeking employment under the National Manpower Service in the following areas: Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and the rest of the country; and the number of person who were seeking employment on the same date last year.</P>
      <P>We neglected to supply the column for 1976, inadvertently, and here are the figures now:</P>
      <P>Dublin &mdash; 31,373</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> That figure which accounts for half the increase I had already given in a public speech of mine at the opening of the Training Centre in Beresford Place.</P>

    <P>That was the column that was inadvertently omitted.  No disparagement was intended of the rights of the House to hear accurate replies, in that that material was not supplied to the House on the day in question and that, as I have said, I regret.</P>
    <P>However, we should understand that these figures provided under the National Manpower Service include all those because the National Manpower Service is available to all persons, not just those who are unemployed. It is not possible to say how many of the total on the books of the National Manpower Service at any time are job changers, this is, people with jobs seeking a change of job, people who are interested in seeking alternative employment, and who register with the service for that purpose.  The Dublin Office&mdash;and this was the reason for my speech in October on the matter, referring to the problem of unemployment in Dublin when I remarked on the serious position that exists in the Dublin region in terms of unemployment&mdash; for which I have already given figures in public, accounts for just over 11 per cent or almost half of the increase between October, 1975, and October, 1976.  Of course, the regional director for the eastern region has commented that the major part of this increase has occurred since April, 1976.  It appears that the increase is accounted for mainly by persons who lost their jobs some time ago, possibly during 1975, who did not register with the National Manpower Service until their redundancy and/or pay-related benefits had run out.  Of course, seasonally adjusted, the <Col N="1643" /> number of unemployed is in fact declining.  The level of unemployment is not increasing, as one might expect on past trends.  As I remarked, during the unemployment debate earlier this week, between the end of September and the end of October the actual figure for unemployment declined.  That is surprising for this time of year.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I have to say on this matter.  One has to consider that those whose names are on the books in the various offices of the National Manpower Service include those seeking a change in jobs as well as those out of work.  The column which I have given and which should have been supplied on the last day, as the question requested, makes it clear that of the increase which occurred almost half of it is in the Dublin area.  I gave the figure for the Dublin area almost a month ago at a public venue.</P>
    <P>I regret the inconvenience caused to the Deputy concerned.  I am surprised he did not raise the matter of the inadequate material given in the question before last Tuesday.  Once my office were informed of the inadequacy of the reply they set about remedying the defect immediately.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a landholder and when he made his claim to unemployment benefit a question arose as to whether he was, in fact, unemployed.  Statutory regulations provide that where an insured person has another occupation from <Col N="1609" /> which the remuneration or profit is more than £1 per day, he cannot be paid unemployment benefit unless at least 78 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him in a given period of three years prior to his claim.  As the person concerned did not satisfy the contribution requirement his case had to be referred to a social welfare officer for a report as to whether his income from the holding exceeded £1 per day.  Completion of the officer's report awaits certain information which he requested the claimant's solicitor to furnish.  Every effort is being made to have the report completed and a decision given on the claim for unemployment benefit as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, arrangements have been made for revision of the rate of means showns on his qualification certificate with effect from 31st March, 1976, in the light of the information available and for payment of all arrears of unemployment assistance due to him on this basis during the course of the present week.</P>

      <P>Payment of unemployment assistance to the person concerned was suspended with effect from 18th August, 1976, following a reinvestigation of his means which indicated that they had increased since previously investigated.  On the basis of the information which the reinvestigation brought to light a deciding officer reassessed the means of the person concerned for unemployment assistance purposes with effect from 12th June, 1973.  Payment of all arrears due to him, less the amount of the overpayment resulting from the deciding officer's decision, will be made in the course of the present week.  Further payments at the reduced rate to which he is now entitled will continue as they fall due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sick leave with pay is reckonable for pension purposes in the case of both established and industrial staff.  Sick leave without pay does not reckon in either case.  The maximum amount of sick leave with pay which an established officer can receive is 12 months in aggregate in any period of four years.  He could, in theory, therefore, over a period of 40 years have a maximum of ten years' sick leave with pay.</P>
      <P>Under the sick pay scheme for industrial staff an industrial civil servant can receive full pay for up to 13 weeks' sick leave in any period of 12 months' service.  He could, theoretically, therefore, if the current scheme for industrial staff had applied during his full 40 years' service have received in all a maximum of ten years' sick leave with pay.  The pensionable service reckoned in each case would be the same.</P>
      <P>The amount of reckonable service could vary very considerably depending upon the actual pattern of sick leave.  For example, the greatest disparity would occur where the two officers each had a continuous period of 12 months' sick leave.  In such a case an established officer, provided he had no sick leave in the previous years, would get sick leave with pay for the full period and thus that period would be reckonable for superannuation purposes.  The industrial employee would be paid for only 13 weeks and the balance of 39 weeks would not, therefore, be reckonable.</P>
      <P>The question postulates the same retiring pay in each case and, accordingly, the pension and gratuity ultimately payable would be directly proportionate to the reckonable service at retirement.</P>
