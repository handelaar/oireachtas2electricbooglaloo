    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total number of persons, including smallholders, registered at employment offices at 21st April, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons registered at employment offices on 23rd April was 145,663.  This is a larger figure than the live register total of 116,373 for the same date because it includes, in addition (i) smallholders who are applicants for unemployment assistance&mdash;numbering 29,135; (ii) applicants for credited social welfare contributions due to trade disputes and persons signing to obtain seasonal work&mdash;numbering 155.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present composition of the live register was decided in 1965 and the figures have been compiled in their present form since January, 1966.  The live register total for 23rd April consisted of:&mdash; (i) claimants for unemployment benefit&mdash;numbering 63,501; (ii) applicants for unemployment assistance, other than smallholders&mdash; numbering 47,478; (iii) others&mdash;comprising mainly applicants for credited <Col N="480" /> Social Welfare contributions other than those affected by trade disputes &mdash;numbering 5,394.</P>
    <P>In reply to the second question put down by the Deputy the total number of persons, including smallholders, in receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance on 23rd April was 128,333.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me approximately how many smallholders have been precluded from assistance because of the recent decision of the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be correct in saying that there are approximately 3,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would only be speculating. It is a separate question of which I would need notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it represent 2,000 to 3,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will offer a comment on it tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say if school leavers are included in those figures and, if so, could he give the number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A very small number of school leavers are included in the total&mdash;83.  The reason for that is that the conditions which would attract school leavers onto the register apply to a very small fraction of them only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary got the figures for school leavers unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not.  I would be merely guessing at them but it is not the case&mdash;as the Deputy has alleged&mdash;that every single school leaver in the country from last year has not got a job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health his Department's plans for the provision of a new health centre in Swords, County Dublin, to cater for the present and projected population in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry) Richard Barry">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a new health centre in Swords is initially a matter for the Eastern Health Board and that board have not submitted proposals regarding the provision of such a centre to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognising the fact that it is primarily a problem for the Eastern Health Board, surely the Parliamentary Secretary would have some comment to make on the fact that a new health centre is needed in view of the massive increase in population that has taken place in that area over the past few years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The information obtained from the board shows that they have long-term proposals for the provision of a health centre in Swords and are at present looking for a suitable site there.  Swords is not on the priority list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary make representations to the Eastern Health Board to have Swords included on the priority list because of the growth in population and because of the nature of the population which consists in the main of young married couples and young children?  A new health centre is very badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the matter and discuss it with the board.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state in detail the methods of calculation used at present to determine the eligibility of a farmer for a medical card; and the <Col N="482" /> changes, if any, that have taken place in such methods in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to a medical card depends on whether a person is able, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for himself and his dependants.</P>
      <P>A decision on any individual case rests with the chief executive officer of the relevant health board and, in arriving at this decision, account is taken of all known factors relevant to the applicant's financial situation.  To ensure uniformity of assessment, chief executive officers have adopted income guidelines which are uniform throughout the country and which are reviewed from time to time.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons, such as farmers, whose income does not arise from a regular wage or salary, an estimate is made of the income arising over a period and due allowance is made for expenses necessary to the maintenance of the farm or business. There are no standard methods of calculation for doing this.  I am not aware of any change in this situation over the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that a considerable number of small farmers in the west have had their medical cards cancelled recently?  I would also like to ask him if there are any proposals to revise the guidelines at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, I am not aware of any change in regard to assessment in the issue of medical cards and, with regard to the second part of the question, the guidelines were reviewed in January of this year and I presume they will be reviewed later this year as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say if the health boards or the CEOs could inform small farmers when their applications are refused exactly what their incomes were, as determined by the health boards, or could the boards say if the incomes were considered to be £1, £2 or £3 per week or £100 or £150 per <Col N="483" /> annum over and above the income limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking for some uniformity in the assessment of farmers' incomes.  That is not an easy thing but superintendents and assistance officers throughout the country have been holding meetings recently to try to achieve some greater uniformity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for four pilot schemes submitted by the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty under the Social Action Programme of the EEC have been approved as was also a request for financial assistance towards the cost of implementing three of these schemes.  The schemes comprise projects relating to community action research, welfare rights, supplementary welfare allowances and the evaluation of the effectiveness of social service councils as a means of meeting the needs of the poor.</P>
      <P>Fieldwork has already begun on one scheme and I understand that the committee are at present making operational arrangements, which include the recruitment of staff, in relation to the others.  Fieldwork on these is expected to commence very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The review of the role and functions of the Defence Forces and the organisation and structures of both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force to which I referred in reply to a question from the Deputy on 24th June, 1975, is at an advanced stage.  Until the review is completed I cannot say what changes may be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed by the Minister that a study was in progress in June, 1975, and it would appear to me now that the study has been in progress for a considerable period.  The promise of an early announcement given some 12 months ago has left the force discontented to a degree.  Would the Minister indicate now if he is prepared to expedite the study in order to ensure there will be no further period of uncertainty within this very excellent force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept there is any dissatisfaction within the force. My position is that I am awaiting recommendations and, when I get these, I will make my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the question.  Would he endeavour to expedite the study because there is a degree of discontent? The men were promised the study would be completed and an early announcement made at least 12 months ago.  Will the Minister expedite the study to remove the uncertainty in the minds of those awaiting this announcement?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in Defence Force Regulations for the promotion to the rank of commandant of officers of the Reserve of Officers (First Line) and no change in this position is being considered.  Establishments for An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil provide for a number of appointments in the rank of commandant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any case in which the personal insurance of a member of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil has been so invalidated.  There is an FCA compensation scheme, administered by my Department, which provides for payment in respect of injury or death in the course of duty. The provisions correspond to those of the Occupational Injuries Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the FCA have been told by insurance companies that, while they are on training, be it annual or nightly, their insurance is invalidated.  Would the Minister examine the situation to ensure those who are not covered by insurance will not be adversely affected should they sustain injuries, minor or major, during the course of their service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not like it if, as suggested by the Deputy, personnel on duty in the FCA should suffer loss in personal insurance as a result of their work in the FCA.  However, I have no knowledge of any such cases having occurred.  If the Deputy will bring any such cases to my knowledge I will be delighted to help as best I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he will amend the Local Government (Rates) Waiver Regulations, 1970 so as to allow special additional consideration to be given to applicants who are permanently invalided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to amend the regulations referred to in order to permit rating authorities to give special consideration to applicants who are permanently invalided. The initiative in the matter of the adoption of rates waiver schemes and in the determination of the categories of ratepayers to be catered for in such schemes rests with each rating authority and is not restricted by the regulations. I might mention that the rates waiver schemes of most local authorities contain specific provision for the consideration of applications for relief of rates from persons in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance and, in addition, include a &ldquo;special hardship&rdquo; clause under which cases falling outside the categories specified in the schemes may also be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the regulations may permit this, is the Minister aware that not all local authorities give this special consideration and, everything being equal, in the schemes published by some local authorities there is no mention of certain categories being entitled to this consideration and would the Minister bring it to the attention of such authorities that they may do this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy thinking of Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="487" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Donegal has a specific regulation in their scheme which says that the categories referred to in the preceding subparagraph, those who will qualify, are recipients of home assistance, non-contributory old age pension, non-contributory widow's pension, blind pension, disabled person's maintenance allowance, contributory old age pension with other means not exceeding 75p a week and persons whose sole income in the year ended 31st December, 1976, does not exceed the statutory allowance payable on any date in the year ending 31st December, 1976, to persons with similar family circumstances in the categories mentioned above.  In fact, Donegal is being very generous in this because, out of 2,729 applicants, 2,431 were allowed; out of 29 applicants in the special hardship clause I have referred to 28 were allowed, and the amount of rates waiver was £59,634 last year.  This year I notice it is on the motion of Councillor Coughlan, seconded by a Councillor Boggs, so it seems that both sides are in favour of dealing with it in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, perhaps due to the nature of my question, that I did not really bring to the Minister's notice what I am really after: it is not that the disabled are not so allowed a waiver of rates.  That has never been my suggestion.  But where there is a cash limit that applies to any applicant for a waiver of rates regardless of categories that limit should be extended specifically to take into account those who are disabled but who may be just over that limit. I am referring to invalided people who may have an income which exceeds the actual limit in the regulations and there is no special consideration given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are covered because there is a special category.  The people Deputy Blaney is referring to come under the special category.  In other words, they are over the limit and for that reason they are not covered in the normal way.  A total of 29 of them applied in Donegal and <Col N="488" /> 28 of them were allowed.  It is fairly wide and I believe it is being fairly well availed of now.  There are some counties still which are not operating it and I regret that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not mean that because practically everybody who applied for a waiver of rates in Donegal got it that that means a generous approach.  In fact it may mean a very prudent approach by the applicants.  Not all disabled people have been catered for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would be glad if Deputy Blaney could let me have details of the specific cases to which he is referring.

      <P>I am aware of this report which, however, does not identify all the waters in which evidence of pollution was found nor does it indicate the extent of pollution in these waters.  The position with regard to the water quality of rivers and lakes, as shown by comprehensive surveys by An Foras Forbartha, is that while the overall situation is reasonably satisfactory, localised pollution, serious in places, is occurring.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> I should add that the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1976, which was introduced in Seanad Éireann on 25th February last, is intended to provide the improved statutory framework which is necessary to ensure that the quality of our water resources is maintained to a standard consistent with their various beneficial uses.</P>

If the Deputy reads on further he will see that the trust anxiously await the new Anti-Pollution Bill which at the time of writing the report was to be introduced in the Seanad.  It has been introduced in the Seanad.  While it will not save the fish that were killed in this lake it will at least provide the framework to ensure that those who are polluting are punished.  Deputy Leonard is as well aware as I am that we have people polluting through <Col N="490" /> carelessness and people polluting because they find it more convenient to dump their refuse in the lakes rather than elsewhere.

      <P>Is the Minister aware of a practice I have known to exist for the last 25 years and which was widely availed of by people like myself coming and going from Donegal to Dublin and <i>vice versa</i>?  Under this, in relation to goods carried in one's car, rather than taking them around Sligo, one was facilitated when bringing them through by listing them for the Customs.  They examined the list, saw you had them, stamped the list and put a note on the bottom saying : &ldquo;To the point of exit from the Six Counties again, please facilitate&rdquo;.  I understand from Customs officers on the frontier posts that that facility ceased recently, that no notice was given of the intention to cease it and that it is causing great hardship to many members of the public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy I am not so aware.  The practice is that in the case of goods of a kind and value or quantity which in the ordinary course could be imported by owners duty free in accordance with existing duty free concessions the movement of such goods is allowed without formality, but other private effects which fall outside that category but which have not a high duty content and are not of a commercial character are entitled to the note or certificate to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>It is quite informal, but, for instance if a person had a significant quantity of spirits which would be more than the normal amount carried by persons in a car, in such cases the persons in whose custody the liquor was would be required to complete more formalities than would otherwise be the case.  There has been no change, in fact, except one of relaxation, which has arisen because of the larger quantities which can now be imported under EEC regulations but I shall certainly investigate what the Deputy alleges because it is certainly contrary to the information I have received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>Would the Minister specifically investigate this matter particularly at present when those who have to use these through routes are being checked and searched and intimidated in various ways for various reasons?  This added imposition comes ill at a time such as this.

These provisions are laid down in the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see that this quota increase will have any effect on our domestic sheep industry.  Our real difficulty on the French market is the restraints placed on our exports of carcase lamb through the system of threshold prices and import levies. These are now at such a high rate that our exports of carcase lamb to <Col N="496" /> France have almost ceased.  Rectification of this situation can most effectively be brought about by the adoption of a Community common organisation of the market for sheep and sheepmeat.  As the Deputies are aware, I have been pressing this issue continuously over the last two years the latest occasion being last month's meeting of the Council of Ministers.

      <P>Differentials exist in all telephone administrations. Our forms of distinction are somewhat different from those which apply in some other countries.  For example, the British have separate rates for calls dialled direct and connected by operator.  Calls dialled direct from non-coinbox phones cost 50 per cent more than similar calls from coinbox phones.  I understand that this anomaly arises from technical limitations in their coinbox mechanism which, I understand, is being modified to permit increases in the coinbox rate.</P>

This is an increase of 25 per cent on the committee's expenditure for 1975 and should be adequate to maintain the committee's activities.

I attended a meeting of the finance sub-committee of the Vocational Education Committee last week, and on the 8th of last month they were notified of a grant of £6,912,373, which is a considerable shortfall.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is quoting a figure of £6.9 million, his information is inaccurate.  The sanctioned expenditure for this year is £10.575 million.  This is an increase of 25 per cent and it should be adequate to cover the committee's activities. The committee has requested sanction for an expenditure of £12.1 million. This figure should be adjusted to £11.63 million because of amendments to the terms of the 16th wage round. The third part of the 16th wage round, as we know, was revised from 5 per cent to 1 per cent with effect from the 1st December, 1975.  The fourth part was revised from 5 to 2.8 per cent on 1st March, 1976.  The committee were notified on 31st March, 1976, that they were authorised to make payments amounting to £10.57 million in the current financial year.  The committee were also advised that the allocation did not contain provision for additional teaching posts for the school year 1976-77. The reference, therefore, to a cut back of £2.4 million is exaggerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice why his Department took over the funeral of the late Frank Stagg; and why his remains were not interred where he expressed his wish to be buried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>My Department did not take over the funeral.  If, as I assume to be the case, the Deputy is referring to certain actions taken by the Garda Síochána, with the support of the Army, these actions were taken for security reasons which the Government considered necessary in pursuance of their declared policy in relation to unlawful organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The persistent attempts by members of an unlawful organisation and their associates to exploit the situation that arose are well known and, indeed, notorious.  Because of this and <Col N="506" /> because also of certain obligations of confidentiality, I must decline to make any comment on the question of the choice of burial place.  In this connection I think I should make it quite clear that I do not recognise anybody other than the deceased man's wife, or somebody authorised by her to act on her behalf, as having any right to raise any issue in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the cost, the clear implication of the question, when taken in conjunction with the assertion that my Department took over the funeral, is that the action decided on by the Government involved the State in additional costs. There is, of course, no basis whatsoever for assuming that the costs incurred were more than would have been incurred had the original plans of an unlawful organisation to stage a funeral through Dublin and across the country been allowed to proceed. The contrary is the case.</P>
    <P>The costs incurred&mdash;which I emphasise were less than what would be likely to have been incurred if the Government had not intervened&mdash;are for various reasons very difficult to calculate, but it has been estimated that overtime costs incurred in connection with the arrangements amounted to about £114,000.  As regards costs since, it would be contrary to long-established practice to disclose information which could be used to quantify the deployment of Garda personnel in relation to a localised or other specific security operation where the information would be very useful to criminal elements.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Minister's prepared speech on this matter, might I ask him whether he is now satisfied that the action he and his Government took, in regard to the whole performance surrounding the funeral of the late Frank Stagg, was totally and absolutely unnecessary, was clearly intended as a provocation and the Minister must now see that this provocation did not come off and he must be a very disappointed man after spending all that time, effort and money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter last came before the House, I was, probably by some coincidence, away <Col N="520" /> in Greece, and there the people under the Karamanalis Government are attempting to adjust slowly but nonetheless with a certain amount of confidence and determination to democracy after a period of some considerable repression in their country, and I came back and found a Bill of this nature introduced in this House.  It is outrageous that the Minister should introduce this Bill in the fashion in which he did, when he said: &ldquo;The purpose of this Bill is purely technical. It involves no question of principle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister may convince himself that that is so, but I cannot understand, if the Minister has studied the effects of this Bill even in the most superficial way, how he could say that its purpose is purely technical and involves no question of principle.  I find that statement of the Minister introducing this legislation very disturbing, particularly from a Minister who has been known in his time in opposition to be concerned about fundamental rights, and who, unfortunately, since taking on the responsibility of Government, while he may still personally feel motivated in regard to fundamental rights, has been doing so much to ensure that the very rights about which he was so concerned are not now protected to the extent that they were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will indeed.  If, for instance, a person is being tried under the criminal law long established, and a question arises as to his fitness to plead such a plea always being determined with a jury of his peers, does the Minister not accept that that is a very definite principle? The Minister asked for examples.  I am giving them to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very firmly established principle of the law for good and sufficient reason, and any Bill that takes that principle out of the law involves a question of principle and is not merely technical.  If a <Col N="521" /> verdict that a person is guilty but insane&mdash;in other words, he committed the act but was not responsible at the time for the criminal consequences of it&mdash;can now only be given by a jury but under this Bill can be given by a special tribunal, is that not a question of principle, or is it, as the Minister says, purely technical?  If a special tribunal, which is being established under the Offences Against the State legislation to deal with scheduled offences, may not, as our spokesman pointed out so clearly on the last occasion, comprise any lawyers at all, perhaps special military tribunals for that matter, does the Minister accept that such a tribunal, be they three judges or three military officers or whoever, in certain circumstances should have the right to determine whether or not a man will be held indefinitely by virtue of insanity, when no other court in the land&mdash;and we are talking about the institutions of our State&mdash; has that right?  Is that a point of principle or not?  Are all these matters, to quote the Minister in his very bland opening, &ldquo;purely technical&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister some very practical examples of what is anything but purely technical.  I make a point which can always be made by an Opposition whenever a Government introduces legislation.  I have heard it made both when we were in Government and now the point is made by us in Opposition.  Nonetheless it is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not legislating for just the present conditions.  We are creating a framework under which the laws of our State can operate in the future. The present condition in itself is troubled and difficult enough, and it was our Government who introduced the Special Criminal Court under the Offences Against the State legislation despite the fierce opposition of the Minister in the House.  Our Government did that because they felt it required to be done.  This present Government have lately been converted, at least for the last two years, to recognising that what we did, though reluctantly, was right.  But even allowing for the disturbed state at the moment and the continuing <Col N="522" /> necessity, which we all acknowledge, for the Special Criminal Court, we are now importing into our law statutory provisions which in this short Bill make no reference, good, bad or indifferent, to the Offences Against the State legislation under which the Special Criminal Court is established.</P>
    <P>We are introducing this into our law now, for good and all, for as long as the provisions of this may be desired to apply by whoever may or may not be in Government.  In other words, we are giving powers which could give rise in Ireland to the fact that the person would be put through what appears to be the process of law, in the future or at any time, and be found unfit to plead by a court without a jury or a tribunal without a jury and be held for the rest of his natural life on that basis or he could be found guilty but insane by a court without a jury or a tribunal without a jury.  There is no point washing our hands and saying: &ldquo;We are holy, it could not happen here.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <P>If a court on a trial find a verdict of guilty the Court of Criminal Appeal can turn that verdict of guilty into guilty but insane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal will be concerned with the law as such as to whether or not, in accordance with law, the jury was entitled to come to the conclusion that it did if they find the verdict was perverse having regard to the facts.  Let us look at what the Minister is doing for the moment and take some cases, particularly in relation to the three stages of fitness to plead either at the commencement of the trial, during the trial, and then a verdict <Col N="523" /> of what is called guilty but insane. In the first instance if the question comes up in an ordinary court of an accused person's fitness to plead, we should know, though the Minister's approach is confusing, that it is not the court that determines whether or not he is fit to plead.  As soon as that question arises a jury of his peers must decide whether or not he is fit to plead.  That is a fundamental protection. If they decide that he is not fit to plead, then the court orders that he be detained until such time as he would be fit to plead.  It is a jury that decides nonetheless.</P>
      <P>If the Special Criminal Court&mdash;not just the one in existence but even a military tribunal under this legislation &mdash;can now do what no other court in this land can do and have never been able to do, I ask the Minister what is going to happen if, hopefully at some stage, that court is disbanded.  The person has been found by that court, not by a jury, to be unfit to plead and then he is held by order of the court. Could the Minister tell us in his reply what happens that person if the Special Criminal Court is disbanded within 12 months?  Who will have the authority then?  Under whose authority is he being held?  Up to this it will be a jury who have decided it.  They are not relating to his offence, they are relating to his capacity to plead to an offence.  I will go so far as to say that they should be the ones who will decide when he is fit to come back before the court again to plead or not to plead as the case may be.  The Minister might explain that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of a person in respect of whom in the course of his trial it may appear he may not be fit to plead, the issue is tried, as the Minister has mentioned, by a jury.  In this case if it were to happen before the Special Criminal Court or any Special Court it will be tried and determined by them.  What is to happen to that person again in the event of those courts being disbanded?  Who is going to deal with him?  If it is at the moment a court that determines on the jury's verdict that this person should <Col N="524" /> be detained until he is fit to plead and then the matter comes back before that court, who is going to deal with it in these circumstances if the court is being disbanded?  We all hope we will reach that day.  It is for us to determine&mdash;the common action against the kind of terrorism that made the Special Criminal Court necessary.  But if we do not some time soon reach that day, then these courts could continue for quite a while.  If they do not and are disbanded as we would hope, what is to happen to these people who have been so found unfit to plead by that Special Court?  I would like the Minister to explain that.</P>
    <P>I would also like him to explain the situation in the event of the normal decision of a person being found guilty but insane.  That person is at the moment held at the pleasure of the Government.  I suggest to the Minister in the first instance that it is leaving it open again to the special tribunals which were established for a limited, specific purpose, to find a person guilty but insane when up to this time only a jury could make such a verdict in respect of any accused person.  The reason for all of this is a long-established principle that, irrespective of the ingredients of an offence with which a person is charged or how heinous or otherwise the offence might be, the only people who could determine his sanity, either before trial, which relates to his capacity to plead at that moment, or who can determine whether or not when he did the deed he was sufficiently aware of the consequences of his act to have a criminal liability have always been and should always be a jury.  Under this &ldquo;purely technical&rdquo; Bill that is not going to be the case any more.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position that, in fact, a special criminal court, or a special tribunal will be put in a position superior to the ordinary courts. The High Court, in its normal jurisdiction, and the Central Criminal Court, do not have this authority.  The Special Criminal Court, if this Bill is passed, will have this authority and so also will a special tribunal.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Minister did not think that the Bill was not all that <Col N="525" /> technical because one can find some tell-tale admissions that the Bill was a little more than technical in the Minister's speech.  It is interesting to note that the provisions I have referred to are not being extended to the District Court as the other alternative verdicts are.  Dealing with this matter the Minister, as reported at column 997 of the Official Report, 6th April, 1976 said:</P>
    <P>But subsection (3) ensures that the powers under the Acts mentioned shall not be exercisable by the District Court.</P>
    <P>Every other power in the Bill is being given to the District Court but why not the one I have dealt with?</P>
    <P>In the District Court the issue of the sanity of the accused does not arise in practice&mdash;even in the higher courts it rarely arises except in cases of murder&mdash;and it would not, in the Government's opinion, be appropriate to include in the Bill a provision that would, in theory, give the District Court so great a power as that exercisable by the higher courts under the two Acts mentioned, involving as it does the possibility that the accused will be detained indefinitely in the State mental hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognises that this is a very significant power.  It gives to any tribunal significant authority over the freedom, because that is what is involved, of any person appearing before it.  The Minister has said that he does not think it would be appropriate to give that power to the District Court, being, I suppose, a court of summary jurisdiction, &ldquo;involving as it does the possibility that the accused will be detained indefinitely in a State mental hospital&rdquo;.  That is hardly just purely technical.</P>
    <P>The way this Bill has been presented is sad and is cause for some disquiet.  If the Minister can see that concern in respect of the District Court can he not see that a similar concern should exist in respect of special tribunals, not just the Special Criminal Court but any other special tribunal that might be established <Col N="526" /> under the Offences Against the State Act?  Such a tribunal may not have any people of judicial qualification at all.  It is fine if we are talking of Ireland of today but it should be remembered that the powers that were abused in any State where an authoritarian Government were in power were powers that had been established in more democratic times but which were used to their advantage.</P>
    <P>For some time over the last three years we have been listening to the high emotional appeals of the Government on law and order.  They would do better to talk about peace and order, not forgetting that our Garda force are known as the Garda Síochána, the guardians of peace, not of law and order.  This law and order thing which has been used by many other governments with terrible consequences, has been trotted out here very often and it is the justification, in the public mind, for the need to go further and further each time. Those who question can be presented as people who are against the fundamental democracy or security of our State.  We discharge our responsibilities here within the authority which the framework of the law is going to give to future generations and institutions. I have never seen a Bill that has the effrontery of this little Bill.  It has been described as a &ldquo;small technical little Bill&rdquo; although it could have terrible consequences in the future.</P>
    <P>The people who are languishing in criminal hospitals in many countries have been put through the due process of law in those states.  Most of them are there for nothing other than the fact that they are living under the type of administration that holds they are insane.  We read about such cases very often and we are pained by this. People who may have done nothing more than express their opposition to the regime, have questioned the regime, if they are to be found guilty cannot be found guilty for questioning the regime but they have been made to suffer long terms of imprisonment or detention, pending the pleasure of the state, for insanity.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion the Minister, <Col N="527" /> when this point was mentioned, replied that such states do not have <i>habeas corpus.  Habeas corpus</i> is on the basis that one questions the facts on which a person is being held, as to whether or not it is in accordance with the law. We enjoy the fresh air of freedom at present here but if we keep eating away little by little&mdash;this is no small bite; this Bill is a big chunk&mdash;we will do great damage.  Taking it in conjunction with a Bill that is at present before the Supreme Court we find that the pattern of legislation introduced by the Government is cause for concern.  It is ironic that the Minister who seemed to be such a fierce defender of these fundamental liberties has now introduced, under the guise of a purely technical Bill, a Bill which could have such far reaching consequences.</P>
    <P>So far Deputy Esmonde is the only Member from the Government side to speak on this Bill and that is significant. It is significant that when this type of Bill comes before this House, the Minister, plus one, speaks on the Bill.  On one occasion Deputy Dr. O'Connell opposed the Minister, except with his vote.  I do not think there will be a flood from the Government side to support the Bill.  Reading over Deputy Esmonde's vindication of this Bill one finds some interesting phrases. Deputy Esmonde, a lawyer of some considerable experience, must know that this is a very definite departure. To justify this power being given to the Special Criminal Court to determine a person's sanity he called the Special Criminal Court a &ldquo;mini-jury of judges&rdquo;.  Did anybody ever hear such a description of a special tribunal from a lawyer?  They are no such thing and were not intended to be.  They were appointed specifically as a special court because our ordinary courts could not function under the Offences Against the State legislation and because it was found that juries could be intimidated.  Judges, whether we liked it or not at the time, were the ones appointed under the legislation not as a &ldquo;mini-jury of judges&rdquo; but as a special tribunal of judges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde is trying to convey <Col N="528" /> the impression that if a jury normally have this function why should not this mini-jury of judges have it. A judge's function in these matters can never be that of a jury or mini-jury. Whatever about a mini-jury of judges it is rather frightening to think of a mini-jury of military officers discharging some of these functions.  I have nothing against military juries when required, but if they are ever established again their powers will have been greatly extended by what has been described as a purely technical Bill.</P>
    <P>I have given the Minister three examples that I regard as being points of major principle.  Can the Minister tell me if he regards those as being points of major principle?  Deputy Esmonde said also that if a court is to try the facts of a case it should have the same powers as a jury in deciding facts.  By extension one of the facts he is relating this power to is as to whether or not a person is sane. Previously, no judge has had these powers and at this stage a judge should not have them either.  There are scheduled offences under the Offences Against the State legislation to be referred to the Special Criminal Court under the procedure laid down in that Act.  Deputy de Valera described these offences as offences of organised violence.  It is fair that the Special Criminal Court should deal with those.</P>
    <P>But whether a man is or is not sane is not a scheduled offence.  It is for a jury to decide whether or not a man is sane at the time he commits an offence or at the time of his trial.  That has always been the rule. It has now been referred to the Special Criminal Court for decision, as if a man's sanity or insanity were on a par with whether or not he committed some of these terrible offences which are included in the Schedule. A man's sanity or insanity is a different matter altogether.  It has always been the case that the question of a man's sanity or insanity has been decided by a jury on evidence offered to them by competent medical experts. It does not demand any special <Col N="529" /> examination to understand that implication and that principle.  The jury comes to a decision on the basis of the evidence offered to them not the judge.  That is the law now, and I see no reason for it to be changed. The Minister has not given us a reason why it should be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no reference to the Offences Against the State legislation in introducing this Bill. The Minister knows that we know that the Special Criminal Court operates under that legislation.  The Minister knows that we know that the purpose of this Bill is almost exclusively to extend the powers of the Special Criminal Court.  The Minister is not fooling anybody when he introduces a Bill that has no reference to amending the Offences Against the State legislation.  His introductory speech on the explanatory memorandum makes no reference to the Offences Against the State legislation, which is at the centre of what is being discussed here.  Our spokesman for Justice asked was that because the Minister would find himself in a contradictory position by introducing considerable amendments to legislation which he fiercely opposed.  It would be better for the Minister to overcome his sensitivity than introduce a Bill that makes no reference to the fundamental purpose of what is being done by the Government. That is reprehensible because the Minister has acknowledged that the only other question involved, that of alternative verdicts in the District Court, has never been in issue.  This is the only other issue involved in this legislation.  Nobody that I can ascertain has ever suggested that District Courts should have this power. It has never been an obstruction in the District Court that an alternative verdict could not be brought in when a person was charged with one offence and was found guilty of a lesser offence.  It has never been suggested that this is a matter of urgency.  If the Minister has had any representations in this regard I would like to hear of them.  That proposal is, in my view, only a guise.</P>
    <P>What is really being done in this Bill is to extend the powers of the <Col N="530" /> Special Criminal Court beyond any power enjoyed by any existing tribunal.  The Minister should have the honesty to tell us when introducing the Bill that this is what is involved instead of saying it is a purely technical matter involving no point of principle.  If the Minister can give me one case of substantial persuasion from any source saying that the District Court should have had the power to bring in alternative verdicts that he is introducing in this Bill, I will hold my peace on it.  None of us has ever been made aware of such representations and I am quite sure that there were none.</P>
    <P>That is the only section of this Bill which does not deal with the Offences Against the State Act.  This Bill deals with the Offences Against the State Act and the tribunals that can be established under that Act.  It deals with the extension of the powers of those tribunals beyond what the courts at the moment enjoy.  It is a matter far from being technical.  It is a matter of the most fundamental principle.  The Minister unfortunately cannot withdraw the phrases contained in his first two sentences.  As long as they remain on the record they will take away a little of the credit and respect which many feel towards the Minister.  That kind of statement will not stand very much to his credit.</P>
    <P>The office that the Minister holds is a very serious and responsible one which will test the determination and character of any man.  There are problems in ensuring the security of the State.  The Minister has our full support in that.  I know the Minister is under heavy pressures but the pressure should never be such as to force the Minister to bring something in under the guise of something other than what it essentially is.</P>
    <P>In relation to insanity there is a view that it generally arises in relation to murder cases at the moment. There is a view that where a person is found guilty but insane, the verdict should not be &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; but should be more or less like what they have in Scotland&mdash;facts proved but not guilty because of insanity&mdash;<Col N="531" /> because of the contradiction in terms between being guilty and insane.  It is a contradiction in terms to say that a person is guilty but insane.  Therefore, it would appear to be more correct to have the verdict: facts proved but not guilty because of insanity.</P>
    <P>In introducing legislation which the Minister describes as being fairly technical I would have expected him to have taken the opportunity of this occasion to amend that position. There are many people who have been found &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; but who were not guilty in any sense of that word on the basis of the medical evidence before the court, people who committed a deed for which they had no criminal responsibility.  If the Minister had been interested in introducing progressive legislation one would have expected him to have made provision for the more proper verdict of &ldquo;facts proved but not guilty because of insanity&rdquo; a verdict which would exonerate the accused from the criminal responsibility of the act he committed.  A man can hardly be guilty of committing a crime if he does not understand the nature of what he is doing and does not have the criminal intent to carry out the act.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to review legislation in this whole area.</P>
    <P>When he was dealing so freely with this Bill the Minister might also have considered the consequences that result from the Lunatics (Ireland) Act and the Trial of Lunatics Act in order to clarify now the three stages involved in a person coming before the court but who is held by a jury to be unfit to plead.  If that person comes back to court in, say, two years' time, it is for the jury alone to decide whether he is unfit to plead.  Consequently it should be only for a jury to decide whether a person is fit to plead.  The Minister would be only consistent in introducing such a provision. However, if there is to be no jury to make the determination one way or another, it is obvious that there is no need to have determination by a jury in the second instance.</P>
    <P>In the type of case we are considering <Col N="532" /> there should always be a jury who would give their verdict on the basis of the medical evidence before them, remembering that they are not trying the nature and extent of the charge concerned but are trying merely the capacity of the accused to face the charge&mdash;an entirely different matter. Similarly, if the question arose during the course of a trial, the person's capacity to return for trial a year or two later should be determined by a jury.  That is another aspect of the matter that the Minister might have considered in preparing the legislation. There are some people who, because they were found guilty but insane are detained at the pleasure of the State.  In such cases, too, there should be determination at some stage following the trial as to whether the person was then fit to be readmitted to society.  It is not the intention of the law to punish such a person but he is committed because of being found unsuitable mentally to take his place in society.</P>
    <P>Far from wishing to cut down on the rights involved in such cases I have concentrated exclusively on the issues of insanity because the consequences of the legislation in this area can be very far reaching.  The Minister should be protecting the people concerned.  I do not think for a moment that the Minister would misrepresent what I am saying but lest there be misrepresentation from anywhere, let me make it clear that I am not making any imputation in so far as the Special Criminal Court is concerned, either as constituted presently or at any time in the past; but I am saying that if no other person has this right of determination in the cases we are discussing, this court should not have that determination either.  No judge has this power at present and I cannot see any reason for the Minister making provision for such power in this Bill.  I see a real danger in all this, perhaps not now&mdash;although I am not convinced that there is no immediate danger involved&mdash;but I fear for the future because I do not know what the future holds and daily I see an increasing rate of disturbing signs under the guise of our determination to defend law and order.  I accept <Col N="533" /> that that is a real determination but what is being done goes a little beyond what is necessary.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means when he talks of there being disturbing signs.  There is an implication in what he is saying that something unlawful is being done, but that is not so.  He talks of us going beyond what is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter goes a little further than the Minister being the only arbiter of what is right or otherwise.  Excluding the matter before the Supreme Court, there were some very serious aspects of that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>If the present pattern were to continue, there would be serious grounds for concern.  Do we think that we in Ireland are the only ones who could never go on a slope as happened elsewhere?  What I want to ensure is that nothing we do in times of relative peace and calm can create the framework whereby people acting within the law deprive individuals of their freedom for, perhaps, the rest of their lives on the basis of insanity. Within the terms of this Bill that prospect notionally could be open to a tribunal in the future.  Therefore I suggest that the Minister reconsider the Bill in this light and, perhaps introduce an appropriate amendment for Committee Stage.  I am not concerned greatly with the Rice case but the amendment in regard to lunacy is of the utmost concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief in my contribution.  The Minister seems to think that on this occasion the Dáil should be used in a cursory fashion to <Col N="534" /> introduce what we consider to be an extremely important and far reaching piece of legislation so far as our criminal law is concerned.  Our criminal law code enjoys the respect of the Legislature and the people who practice within the ambit of the criminal law code.  I also believe that, while they do not like going before the courts, people who are subjected to the criminal law code have a deep-rooted protection.  We see this piece of legislation as a direct departure from a code of law which we hold sacrosanct. It has not been found wanting in our history.  There may have been times when people may have questioned its operation and its operability, but it has not been found wanting to any great degree.  As we understand it, here we have a clear departure from this very important and fundamental principle.</P>
      <P>Special Criminal Courts have been set up in this country on three occasions, I think.  It was necessary, having regard to the times that were in it and that are in it, to reintroduce the paraphernalia and the trappings of the Special Criminal Court and having regard to the threat to the institutions of the State, the democratic tenets of the State, and the democratic principles to which this Dáil and this country subscribe.  If they are under attack, or appear to be under attack, the Special Criminal Court has to be reintroduced.  It is a special criminal court by virtue of the special circumstances which exist at the time.  In the recent past Fianna Fáil have been responsible for the reintroduction of this court.  They make no apology to anybody for that.  The then Minister for Justice and the then Government saw it as their duty to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill was introduced in 1972 there was an outpouring of crocodile tears from the then Opposition and not least from the present Minister for Justice.  Now he has introduced a Bill which gives him away particularly in the title, the Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Bill, 1976. It is difficult to understand why the Minister did not ask the House to <Col N="535" /> amend the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act in some fashion. We believe the reason is that the Minister has a clear memory of the stand he took on that legislation in 1972.  He did not want to give himself away.</P>
    <P>When I was spokesman on Justice in Opposition I recognised the grave and difficult task a Minister for Justice has to perform in discharging his duties.  I have always expressed the view that the most difficult posts in Government are those of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice in times like the present and the Government Chief Whip.  The Minister, who was a noted Liberal in Opposition, now recognises the demands which are made on any responsible Minister for Justice.  I do not necessarily agree with some of the statements made by the Minister over the past number of years but I will give the credit to any man who holds the position of Minister for Justice that it is an extremely difficult and onerous job, more particularly when the institutions of the State are under continual threat.</P>
    <P>This seems to be the modern trend in the extreme organisations in our midst, both green and orange.  This has to be taken into account.  People are entitled to protection against that type of threat.  When we were in Government we did our duty in this respect and when we are in Government again we will continue to do our duty against any extreme organisations which may attack the institutions of the State.  People are entitled to a democratically elected Government. There is no gainsaying that. Democratically elected politicians must support the Government of the day if they are threatened by any organisation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to underrate the task of the Minister for Justice, but he could have been a little more honest and given the Bill its proper title instead of shilly-shallying and hiding behind the title, Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Bill, 1976.  I am speaking about being legislatively honest.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> The purpose of this Bill is purely technical.  It involves no question of principle.</P>
    <P>As we understand it, the purpose of the Bill is anything but technical.  For the Minister and his former liberal colleagues in Government it involves a question of principle, an extremely deep-seated principle having regard to their attitude on a previous occasion to not dissimilar type of legislation.  It must be extremely galling for the Minister to come in here and pretend the Bill is purely technical.  It is not purely technical.  It must also be extremely galling and upsetting in a personal way for the Minister to come in here and say the Bill involves no question of principle.  Of course it involves a question of principle for him and for certain members of the Government.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Briefly, what it does is to secure that, where a criminal court is sitting without a jury, the court shall have the same power to make any determination as if the court were sitting with a jury.</P>
    <P>That is an extremely serious matter of principle, a very serious departure from the practice of the Special Criminal Court as we understand its operations today.  It will be different when the Government with their large majority walk this piece of legislation through the division lobbies.  The situation will be as the Minister intends it to be in the Bill now before us.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman on justice raised a number of extremely important points during his very well researched speech. Deputy Collins did not accept the Minister's assurance that the purpose of the Bill is purely technical.  Neither did he accept the suggestion that the Bill does not involve any question of principle.  In his speech Deputy Collins gave the lie to what the Minister had said.  The Bill departs very grievously from the present operation of the Special Criminal Courts which, as I understood it, were to be introduced only in times of emergency to take care of certain situations when the ordinary criminal law would not operate.  I understood that when that condition of emergency had passed <Col N="537" /> these courts would be put into a limbo in the criminal law and would not be taken out of that state of legislative sanctity until a situation demanded that they should be so taken out, when they would once more operate.</P>
    <P>What concerns us particularly in relation to this legislation&mdash;no doubt the Minister will deny this in his reply &mdash;is that the Minister would appear to give these courts the stamp of permanence. This is a very serious matter. We on this side do not deny that the Special Courts are somewhat of an anathema to those who believe in the rule of pure law and the proper administration of justice in the purest sense. Nevertheless, having regard to the possibility of the undermining of the functions of government and the institutions of the State, these courts should operate, then and only then.  Now, the Minister's speech, as we understand it, gives these courts the stamp of permanence. If this is not so, no doubt the Minister will deny it in his reply.</P>
    <P>Throughout his opening speech he was apologetic for some of the matters he was introducing, but one of the more serious aspects of the Bill is the question of insanity.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The issues as to insanity are more important.  At present an issue as to the sanity of the accused may arise at three stages. First, before the trial begins there may be a question whether the accused is so insane that he cannot be tried at all&mdash;that is to say, whether he is what is called &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo;.  Second, a similar question may arise during the trial. Third, the accused's defence may be that, although he may have committed the act in question, he was insane so as not to be responsible in law for his action&mdash;that is to say, that the verdict should be &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo;.  In all these cases the issue of insanity is determined by a jury&mdash;in the first two cases under section 17 of the Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1821, and in the third under section 2 of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> He went on to apologise for some slip in the drafting of the 1821 Lunacy Act and he continued:</P>
    <P>In a case where the issue of fitness to plead arises before the trial a jury is specially formed to determine the issue.  Under the Acts, if the jury finds the accused insane, the court orders him to be detained until he is found fit to plead, or to be detained in a place suitable for a person who has been found guilty but insane, as the case may be.  The place in which he is detained is determined by order of the Minister for Justice.  By subsection (1) of section 1 of the Bill the functions of a jury in deciding the issue of sanity will be exercisable by the Special Criminal Court in the case of a trial before that court.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether in a situation where military law is in existence the Special Criminal Court might be made up of people knowledgeable of the law.  It is improbable such a situation would arise but where there is even the possibility we must be on our guard against it.  This Bill is a very serious departure from the practice in relation to a person's sanity and to take this away from a jury is a serious departure from the criminal law.  The Minister went on in his speech:</P>
    <P>But subsection (3) ensures that the powers under the Acts mentioned shall not be exercisable by the District Court.</P>
    <P>We see this as an extremely dangerous precedent and we ask the Minister to take note of what Deputy O'Kennedy, in the last ten minutes of his speech, argued in this respect. The Minister should have been honourable and brought this Bill in with its proper title.  It is merely an extension of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act.  Had the Minister called the Bill by its proper title he would, as always, have been met in a responsible manner by the Opposition.  There is no doubt about what our attitude should be to legislative subterfuge which the Minister is practising in respect of the Title to the Bill.  Deputy Collins properly raised several questions in regard to <Col N="539" /> this matter, as did Deputy O'Kennedy. I quote:</P>
    <P>When pondering these questions one must cast one's mind back to 1972 when the present Minister for Justice, then on this side of the House and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, castigated his predecessor, Deputy O'Malley, then Minister for Justice, for trying to bring through this House an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act.  It is very likely that the present Minister for Justice will do everything to avoid bringing about changes in legislation, particularly if it is labelled an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act.  Perhaps the Minister knows that he could not count on the voting support of all the members of both parties that make up the Government.</P>
    <P>That raises another important question: could the Minister rely on the backing of the members of the Government had he introduced into this House a proper title to this Bill, had he said to the House in an honest and straightforward manner&mdash;and I am not in any way imputing a lack of integrity to the present Minister; quite the contrary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>The point I am making&mdash;and that made by Deputy Collins also&mdash;is: could the Minister rely on other Members of his party <Col N="540" /> had he been legislatively honest and introduced a proper Title to this Bill? My answer to that question would be an unequivocal &ldquo;yes&rdquo;' because we know time is running out for the Government.  We know what happened in the past few months in relation to the pensionable condition of Members of the Government.  We know it is the tradition of Coalitions that they hold on to power as long as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely answering a question raised in the course of the debate.  We know that the Coalition will cling to power regardless and will subsume their principles. The Minister is correct in that respect&mdash;as far as the Coalition is concerned the Bill does not involve any question of principle.  Therefore no matter what Title the Minister gave the Bill there is no question but that he would have received the support of his colleagues because, as far as he and his colleagues are concerned, principle has gone out the window. Therefore the Minister is correct when he says there is no question of principle involved in the Bill.  If there was we would have the Minister being attacked by those men of principle who in 1972 stood up forthrightly in favour of their principles until the tragic bombs went off on that awful night in this city of ours, when principles became like running sand in the fingers of men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask the Minister to consider seriously the points made by Deputy O'Kennedy, Deputy de Valera, Deputy Collins, our spokesman on justice, and others who contributed. This legislation is serious in that it represents a dangerous departure from the practice of the Special Criminal Court.  Many of us may feel we would be better off without the Special Criminal Court.  Nevertheless, it is required to take special notice of the circumstances of the time.  We say the Special Criminal Courts should be set up on a temporary basis in so far as a particular condition exists and no longer.  Of course, if <Col N="541" /> the circumstances of the time subside and the Special Criminal Court goes out of existence, if special circumstances demand that it be reintroduced, we on this side of the House would have no hesitation in so doing. Our legislative record is there to prove that.  We recognise the necessity for the Special Criminal Court in given circumstances.  What worries us about this extension of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Acts is that the Bill before us purports to give the Special Criminal Court the character of permanence.  We believe this is wrong.  We urge the Minister to take note of what we have said and ask him to re-consider the points made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the life of me, I cannot see how this Bill can contribute to the length of life of the Special Criminal Court. That is a matter specifically provided for in the statute that sets up the court, that is, the Offences Against the State Act of 1939.  That statute specifically provides for the establishment and disestablishment of that court.  I say that in reply to the last point made by Deputy Andrews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important, having regard to the way this debate has gone, to try and put this small Bill into perspective and get the matter back into proportion. I have heard very strained arguments and heavy-fisted attempts to make political capital out of what is a technical, legal measure.  The Bill arises because the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of <i>The People (D. P. P.) v. Rice</i> found&mdash;as I said when introducing the Bill&mdash;that the power to make alternative findings in the case of courts sitting without a jury has to be specifically conferred by statute.  That is the effect of the Rice decision.  This Bill is to cure the position as created by that decision.  Until that decision was announced, until that case was taken, it was assumed by people practising before that court, and by this Legislature, that the court had power to make alternative findings and indeed had exercised such power in the firm belief that it was proper to it.  But that power was challenged in the Rice case <Col N="542" /> and the Court of Criminal Appeal found that it did not have such a power that, as it was a creature of statute, it could only have powers given to it by a statute.  The court says &mdash;here I quote from the judgment:</P>
    <P>While the inclusion of alternative counts in an indictment is procedural, the power to return a verdict of guilty of an offence not charged is a matter of jurisdiction which must be shown to exist under either common law or statute.  The Special Criminal Court being a creature of statute, such jurisdiction could be bound only in the statutory provisions investing it with jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In that case the defendant was charged with robbery with aggravation contrary to section 23, subsection (1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, as amended by section 25 of the Firearms Act, 1964. There were two other charges against the defendant but he was acquitted on them, so they need not arise.  At the end of the hearing the court was not satisfied that there had been an actual robbery and he was acquitted on the charge of robbery.  Section 44 (1) of the Larceny Act was invoked to convict him of assault with intent to rob and he was so convicted.  But, as I say, that conviction was set aside on the grounds that there was no power in the Special Criminal Court to make the alternative finding notwithstanding the fact that it had been assumed that such power did reside with the court.</P>
    <P>The finding in the Rice case then exposed a position that had to be attended to, and it could be attended to in either of two ways, by doing nothing or by amending the law.  If nothing had been done, it would have been necessary for every prosecution taken before that court to plead specifically every possible count on which &ldquo;conviction might be obtained having regard to the evidence available.&rdquo; That would be simply a pleader's nightmare.  It would make the pleadings immensely long, immensely complicated, and if, by chance, a pleading were omitted justice might be thwarted and on the technicality of that omission a very guilty person <Col N="543" /> allowed to escape the consequences of his action.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear to me that it would be unfair to people charged with bringing prosecutions to place on them the burden of having to plead in every single case that went before that court every possible offence that might come within the ambit of the evidence being adduced in regard to it.  That would put the Director of Public Prosecutions and his staff in an impossible position in practical terms.  It would also have meant that proceedings before the court would be immensely clumsy.  There would be bundles of pleadings of immense complexity and the work of the court and, indeed, the business of the court and the burden of prosecuting counsel and, no less important, the burden on defending counsel would be that much greater.  I had to consider whether I would accept the position and do nothing or amend the law, and the arguments quite clearly indicated to me that the law required to be amended.  Hence this particular measure to give to the Special Criminal Court specifically by statute power to do what everybody always assumed they were entitled to do, namely, bring in alternative findings.</P>
    <P>But the Rice case had wider implications than the Special Criminal Court though the appeal in question was taken from a finding of that court because it was quite clear that the matter of legal principle which was established applied to all criminal courts sitting without a jury and the only other criminal court sitting without a jury is the District Court.  It would, therefore, be very remiss on my part if I were to introduce an amendment making the change only in regard to the Special Criminal Court when the need for a change in regard to all non-jury criminal courts had been so clearly signalled by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Rice case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy challenged me to instance some practical case where the need for this legislation in the District Court was shown.  There is, of course, no such instance save that which was so clearly signalled by the <Col N="544" /> Rice case.  It was assumed by legal practitioners and the public that what was assumed to be the case with regard to the Special Criminal Court was and is the position with regard to the District Court, namely, that a district justice has power to make alternative findings.  Quite clearly, that assumption is erroneous having regard to the findings in the Rice case and, consequently, it behoves me, when devising this legislation, to ensure that it applies not merely to the Special Criminal Court but also to the District Court.</P>
    <P>There are many offences tried in the District Court which are complicated technical offences in the whole area of larceny and theft.  If I give an example with regard to one it will highlight what I am saying about the need for this change in the District Court no less than in the Special Criminal Court.  Some burglary and housebreaking offences have several components in them.  They consist of breaking and entering and stealing. Both components must be present before the offence of burglary is committed. There may have to be another one with regard to the time of the offence.  Some of these cases are triable summarily in the District Court and, if that court thinks the accused did not break and enter, but did steal, then surely it is right that that person should be convicted of stealing.  If we did not change the law and if we were to allow the law now to stand as found in the Rice case and were not to change it in regard to the District Court, then the district justice would be precluded from making a finding of larceny in a case where the charge was housebreaking but the evidence did not go to sustain the breaking and the entering.  It would only be a matter of time, I submit, if the district justice were to make an alternative finding before that would be challenged in the higher court, and, having regard to the law as laid down in the Rice case, which would have to be followed, it would clearly be found that the district justice was wrong.  The obvious and sensible thing then at this stage is to give this statutory power also to the District Court to make alternative <Col N="545" /> findings.  That is the main purpose of the Bill.  I submit that the main purpose is technical because what has been found is a technical legal point &mdash;finding something not to be so that was generally assumed to be so by lawyers for very many years.  That is a technical situation and this is a small technical measure to cure that situation.</P>
    <P>I was amazed and, indeed, intrigued by the standpoint of the Opposition and the argument of the Opposition that we were trying to slide the Bill quietly through the House, that it was a subterfuge and that it was in some way shyness on my part that it was not proclaimed as an amendment of the Offences Against the State Act.  I thought this was rather hamfisted sarcasm, a straining at an argument to try to read into what is a small technical measure to cure a point found by the Court of Criminal Appeal some devious political machination.  I must say I was amused by it.  The Bill is to cure a legal matter with regard to the finding of alternative verdicts in non-jury courts.  As I have indicated, apart from the Special Criminal Court, the District Court, and it does an immense amount of criminal work, is a non-jury court and therefore, affected by the finding in the Rice case, so the law to cure the consequences in the Rice case must also apply to the District Court.  The matter is no more sinister than that and I submit that is not sinister at all.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I would have had no shyness whatsoever in introducing a Bill specifically to amend the 1939 Offences Against the State Act, no shyness whatever, and let me remind the House that the burden of my opposition to the amendment introduced in 1972 was to express regret that the then Executive had allowed the battle against the IRA to go so badly into arrears that they found themselves in the legal position of having to ask the House for those extreme powers.  That was the burden of my opposition to that particular measure.  Indeed, it is no wonder the battle did get into arrears when we had Deputy Blaney only some evenings <Col N="546" /> ago on television indicting himself and his colleagues in Government &mdash;that excludes the Members opposite who were not in Government at the time&mdash;for the most awful act of the foundation of the Provisionals.  It was no wonder then that the matter drifted to the stage where that piece of extreme legislation was necessary in 1972.  It was because of that reprehensible situation that I was compelled to express opposition.  It would have been the duty of anybody in Opposition to express regret and opposition inspired by such neglect.  I say that to clarify my stand in regard to that particular matter and to say that I have no motives for wanting to amend the Offences Against the State Act or try to conceal such an amendment under another title, as is alleged by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I say clearly to the House that the Bill before the House is quite clear in its purpose, which is to cure a legal position found in the judgment in the Rice case by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  That legal position applies not merely to the Special Criminal Court which is a creature of the Offences Against the State Act, but applies equally and more widely to the District Courts of the land set up under the various Courts of Justice Acts.  I reject the strange and contrived argument that this is somehow a backdoor amendment to the Offences Against the State Act as being rather ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins in his speech in Volume 289, No. 7, column 1001, on 6th April said that it was wrong that the Special Criminal Court should have jurisdiction to give an alternative verdict at all.  He thought that only an incompetent prosecutor would fail to include in an indictment specific charges of every possible offence of which on the facts the accused might be convicted.  I believe I have indicated that to expect a prosecutor to include in his pleading every possible offence&mdash;they could run to half a dozen or a dozen depending on the evidence&mdash;would put him in an impossible position.  An amount of paper would be generated <Col N="547" /> that would snow under the entire machinery of the court.  Deputy O'Malley, who had not concluded when the debate concluded the last day, and unfortunately was absent today when the debate resumed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to hear that.  I am going to answer a point and I want to preface my answer by saying that in fairness to Deputy O'Malley he might not have had time to develop it fully when the debate concluded the last day.  He was making the case that he thought it wrong to give the Special Criminal Court power to give an alternative verdict because this would be contrary to what he deduced to be the intention of the Legislature in 1939 when the Special Criminal Courts were created.  He made his case on the basis that the 1939 Act set out specifically the items of jurisdiction which that court were given and that, if it was intended to give them power to find alternative verdicts, then it would have been specifically added then.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is a good argument for two reasons.  The first is that I have searched the debates and certainly there is nothing in them to indicate that this problem was thought of and that the power was meant to be excluded.  That confirms me in the second leg of my argument, that it was not in fact alluded to.  As I have said, since 1939, since the Special Criminal Courts started to function, they have gone on on the clear assumption by all concerned with them that the law was that they were entitled to bring in alternative verdicts, that being such a normal part of the procedure of criminal courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins thought that it was unnecessary to provide the District Court with power to give alternative verdicts and thought it would be giving that court excessive power.  I would have to disagree with him there because these courts exercise a wide criminal jurisdiction all over the land and they must have the normal jurisdiction <Col N="548" /> of any court.  The only difference between them and other courts is that there is a limit imposed by the seriousness of the crimes to what they can try.  I gave an instance of a defendant being charged with housebreaking which has the two components of breaking and entering and stealing.  Such a charge could be tried in the District Court and it is quite possible that the evidence might fail to prove breaking and entering but would prove stealing. Unless we amend the law now with regard to the District Court also we would then have the situation where that person, shown to be guilty of stealing on the evidence, would have to be acquitted.  That would be an injustice to society, who had him charged, and an injustice to the public.  The public have rights in regard to criminal trials as much as the defendant.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Collins and with some emotion by Deputy O'Kennedy and somewhat less emotion by Deputy Andrews but on the same theme is that this Bill represents a serious invasion of civil liberties because we were giving the Special Criminal Court the power to find a person unfit to plead by reason of insanity and that it would be a serious erosion of civil liberties to take that power away from juries and give it to a non-jury court.  If that argument is valid in relation to that particular power, it is equally valid against all the operations of the Special Criminal Court.  I do not accept its validity, because we have to consider the Special Criminal Court in the contemporary context.  It was set up through fear of intimidation of juries.</P>
    <P>Can anyone in this House say that such a fear would be less relevant in regard to the trial of the issue of insanity than it would be in regard to the trial of a matter of substance? I do not think it would, because it could be very important for the type of person who comes before the Special Criminal Court to be able to escape on the grounds that he was unfit to plead.  It would be a nice ploy to manipulate a jury through terror <Col N="549" /> and intimidation into making such a finding.  That person would then be detained in a place which would not have the high security of the place to which he might normally expect to be sent.</P>
    <P>This is an argument that could be made against the establishment of the Special Criminal Courts at all.  Once there is a need for the Special Criminal Courts they are entitled to have all the jurisdiction, and should have all the jurisdiction, that jury courts have so that they can provide the full scope for the practice of the entire criminal law free from the awful risk of intimidation or terrorising of juries.  For Deputy Andrews&mdash; or Deputy O'Kennedy in particular&mdash; to say that it is an erosion of civil liberties is to close his eyes to reality. It is not an argument that lies with regard to this power unless it lies equally with regard to all the powers which the Special Criminal Court has. He conceded there was need for the Special Criminal Court.  He had to concede this because a Government of which he was a member set it up.  I do not criticise that decision.  I think it was the correct one, although regrettable, because of the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that there might be something specially dangerous with regard to this power in that, if a person were found unfit to plead and was sent away, he would be detained at the pleasure, in effect, of the Minister for Justice of the day and that the person could be put away permanently on the basis of this power.  He said that this could happen in the event of the Special Criminal Court being disestablished.  The implication in his raising this point was what would be the mechanism for bringing that person forward into the light of day again if his mental condition improved. If the Special Criminal Court should be disestablished, such a person would then, if his condition improved so that he was fit to stand trial, be brought before the ordinary courts.  At that stage he would probably have to be brought before the District Court for the preliminary hearing in the normal way.  That is <Col N="550" /> what clearly would happen.  There would be no question of that person languishing in some institution for the rest of his days.  That is not a danger because all the protections are there to ensure that it cannot happen. If it could happen by reason of a finding of unfit to plead by the Special Criminal Court, it is equally liable to happen by reason of a finding of unfit to plead by a court and jury, and that was not suggested at all.</P>
    <P>The fears which Deputy O'Kennedy expressed are, with respect to him, exaggerated.  They do not follow at all from what is proposed in the Bill. It is not proposed to extend these powers of making findings of insanity before pleading to the District Court because, as I said in my opening speech, this is not something which arises in the District Court.  It is a plea which normally falls to be made only in the more serious crimes which go before the higher courts.  It would be necessary to give the powers to a District Court.</P>
    <P>I have never heard of any case in the summary courts here or, indeed, in the other jurisdiction where such a plea fell to be made or where somebody wanted it to be made.  Inevitably, the case in which it might be liable to be made would be a case of the type that was on its way to a higher court before judge and jury or before the Special Criminal Court.  I think it is only proper and acknowledging reality, that the power of the jury to make a lunacy finding should be given to the Special Criminal Court in a case before it for precisely the same reasons that made it necessary to set up the Special Criminal Court in the first instance.  That is the answer to that objection.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made some points in regard to the general type of finding in insanity cases.  I would sympathise with him.  He took exception to the finding we have here of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; on the ground that it was a contradiction in terms&mdash; that if a person is insane, he could not be guilty of the offence.  He drew attention to the Scottish finding which I think is &ldquo;not proven&rdquo;.  I think in <Col N="551" /> England the law has been amended to give a finding of &ldquo;not guilty by reason of insanity&rdquo; which would probably meet the point the Deputy was making.  This would not be the occasion to introduce that reform; indeed, if I attempted to do it, I wonder what meaning would be read into it by the Opposition, having regard to the rather extreme meanings they have read into the Bill as it stands.  I take the Deputy's point and perhaps some time in the future I, or my successor, might be able to amend the law in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made much of the argument that to give this power to the Special Criminal Court to make a finding of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; or to find a person unfit to plead means that for the first and only time in our criminal code persons other than a jury would be making an assessment of sanity.  He is wrong in that because there is a very important power vested in the Court of Criminal Appeal under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, section 35, where it says that if it appears to the Court of Criminal Appeal that, although the appellant was guilty of the act or omission charged against him, he was insane at the time the act was done or the omission took place&mdash;I am paraphrasing &mdash;the court might quash the sentence and order the appellant to be kept in custody as a criminal lunatic in the same manner as if the verdict had been found by the jury to that effect.</P>
    <P>The Legislature as far back as 1924 acknowledged that a court sitting without a jury could make a finding of insanity, and so there is no new principle here nor is there new law here or any breach of a sacrosanct principle. The Special Criminal Court in the absence of a jury has to find on matters of fact in all cases coming before it, and I would have supreme confidence in their ability to make a correct finding of fact when the issue is one of sanity.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to deny very strongly that this Bill is somehow a backdoor amendment of the Offences Against the State Act.  That was a very strange and slightly ridiculous argument. <Col N="552" /> The Bill was made necessary because of the finding of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Rice case.  The consequences of that finding were that non-jury courts should be given the power to find alternative verdicts.  We have two non-jury courts in the country, the Special Criminal Court and the District Court, and the amendment deals with both.  It was also necessary to deal with the question of findings where insanity was pleaded either as a preliminary or as part of the defence and the opportunity was taken to amend the law in that regard also.  This is a desirable Bill to cure a legal position found by the Rice case, and I repeat what I said in my opening speech&mdash; and this was seized on with gusto by practically every Opposition speaker&mdash;that it is a technical Bill.  It is a technical Bill, to confirm something that was assumed by lawyers for a very long time and practically unanimously to be the legal position.  Like so many legal principles it arises as a result of a challenge.  A lawyer looks at something in a different way and decides that it should be challenged in the higher courts.  The challenge was made and the higher court held that he was right.  This is how our law evolves and how changes are brought about. We must respond here and this Bill is the Legislature's response to ensure that the gap opened, so to speak, by the Rice case is now closed.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Deputy Briscoe does not seem to be here.  This section was discussed at considerable length on the <Col N="553" /> last occasion.  It is probably one of the most important sections in the Bill and the one that is generally most controversial in the operation of the Broadcasting Authority.  I think it has caused more problems than any other section in getting the views of the Minister and reconciling them with those of the Authority.  The present section goes into more detail than what was in the original Bill, which was very brief.  Although I agree this probably spells out certain functions in a better manner, as I mentioned already, it may cause many complications.</P>
      <P>The important thing is that the Authority will know how to interpret what the Minister has in mind; we must have no confusion about this section.  The current affairs part of the Bill has caused many problems and various politicians on both sides of the House have been critical, irrespective of what Minister was in office, of the way certain programmes were treated. The question of impartiality with which we are dealing here is of major importance especially in the case of television which is such a powerful medium.  Television plays a more and more important part in elections and by-elections.  We can see how important an instrument it is in the case of the American election campaign.  The operation of this section will be of vital interest to political parties here to ensure that during an election campaign there is complete impartiality.  The Authority will have to put forward their proposals for covering a general election. Every political party should know from the Director General what his proposals are.  The Minister may contradict me if I am wrong, but I understand that certain proposals are at present being considered by the Authority as to how best to handle the next general election.  I do not think there is anything wrong with the Authority considering these proposals at this time.  Whether we like it or not, we are in the fourth year of the life of this House and therefore the Authority must be looking ahead to see what is the best way to give fair coverage to an election if it should arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> The majority on this side of the House get very little warning as regards general elections.  The Authority must surely be discussing at this time the type of programmes and the provisions they should make.  These provisions should be known in advance.  There is no point in criticising the Authority on the eve of an election.  In these types of programmes where the political parties are very much involved I would like to see the Authority spelling out well in advance the form that they intend to use.  Proper discussions should take place between the whips of the political parties and the RTE Authority. Whoever is in charge of this type of programme must be seen to be completely impartial, because it is at such an important point in time that advantages can be taken by the use of television coverage.  These are important factors as regards this section and I am sure the Minister will see my point of view.  I am sure the Minister would be as anxious as I would be to ensure that all political parties would have a fair idea of the Authority's plans.</P>
    <P>This is certainly one of the most important sections in the Bill.  It is a far more elaborate section than that contained in the 1960 Bill.  When we were last discussing this Bill, I mentioned certain aspects which the Minister said he would have a look at. We have already put forward amendments as regards the deletion of the word &ldquo;tending&rdquo;.  We thought it was ambiguous and would place the Authority in a difficult situation in regard to what the Minister had in mind.  The Minister seemed to be convinced that it was necessary to have it there.  We put forward the proposal that, even with the deletion of it, the section was strong enough and would give the Authority a more positive view of this section.</P>
    <P>In regard to impartiality, I looked at the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; some nights ago.  We must ensure that people are not given the opportunity to publicise materials or periodicals.  I make this remark in passing because it struck me that a certain group of people were capitalising on <Col N="555" /> the show that night for commercial reasons.  I have already dealt with the various amendments.  The Minister said he would look at some of them on Report Stage.  My proposals in regard to the Authority's handling of an election is important to political parties.</P>

      <P>I should like to be quite brief.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, we have already given considerable time to this section which, I agree, is a very important section.  I am not saying we have given too much time to it.  As regards the amendments, I have undertaken to make further comments on Report Stage on that matter.  I have made the Government's position on this section fairly clear already.  A couple of points have just been made by Deputy Fitzpatrick to which I would like to refer briefly.</P>
      <P>He says that he believes the Authority have been considering plans for coverage of the next general election. I have no information on that matter. That may be so.  As regards the coverage of general elections, the obligations that rest on the Authority are the same as for coverage of other things.  I think we would all be agreed that, down the years, successive Authorities have discharged these responsibilities fairly and well and that there is recognition of that on both sides of the House, though, of course, there may be feelings, particularly during a politically hot period like a general election, that this or that which has been done ought not to have been done.</P>
      <P>Deputies will agree that it would not be desirable for the Minister of the day to intervene in relation to this area; that the Authority are best left to discharge their responsibility, subject to the machinery which does exist for complaints registered.  I am sure the Authority will take note of the comments that have been made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I am quite sure that in any arrangements that are made by RTE for the coverage of the next general election&mdash;and I do not think any great urgency prevails in relation to that matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One specific matter was mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick about a particular show and he voiced an objection to it.  It would not be proper for me to comment here on individual programmes except in exceptional circumstances. I would again draw the attention of any Deputy, or of any citizen, who may feel that a particular programme erred in respect of balance, impartiality or in some other way, to the fact that he has the remedy of putting the case before the present complaints committee or what will be the statutory complaints commission once this legislation is through.  Advantage has already been taken of that in a number of cases&mdash;I think six&mdash;and the results of these deliberations have been published in the RTE house paper and sometimes rather more generally.</P>

      <P>As one who, at one stage as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, had responsibility for the operation of RTE under the former Broadcasting Authority Act, it would be improper if I were to allow section 3 to go through without comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it, subsections (1) (a) and (1) (b) are roughly the same as section 18 (1) of the 1960 Act; subsection (1) (c) applies to books, magazines, tapes and so on, published and distributed by the Authority.  The rider to paragraph (b) worries me because it can be used, in my opinion, and for all practical purposes, to make <Col N="557" /> the paragraph null and void, particularly if there is a code giving the Authority further latitude.  The last paragraph of section 3 (1) at the top of page 3 reads:</P>
    <P>Should it prove impracticable in a single programme to apply paragraph (b) of this subsection, two or more related broadcasts may be considered as a whole; provided that the broadcasts are transmitted within a reasonable period.</P>

In paragraph 7 (iv) of that circular, interpreting section 18 (1) of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, he said:</P>
    <P>In seeking balance in current/public affairs programming, it is accepted that all significant viewpoints should be represented.  It is recognised, however, that in the treatment of issues which are or are likely to be of continuing public interest, this may not always be practicable in every single programme; in that case the duty of impartiality will be regarded as discharged if a balance is maintained between different viewpoints, taking one programme with another, over a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>I felt that that circular was in contravention of section 18 of the 1960 Act, which says that:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news, or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>We have that phraseology again here. By writing in the paragraph on top of page 3, to which I referred earlier, the Minister accepts that the directive of the then Director General was not in compliance with the spirit of section 18 of the Broadcasting Act, <Col N="558" /> 1960.  That is why I am contributing to this debate.  As the broadcasting authority, the Director General and the programme presenters found it possible to go beyond the intention expressed in statutory form by the Oireachtas, as was shown in the directive issued in 1970, I am worried what powers the Authority or successive Directors General make take from this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of cross references in this Bill, which is amending the 1960 Act.  One has to study this Bill very assiduously in order to tie up loose ends.  I am fearful of the additional laxity given in this Bill. Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (1A) of this section, it shall be the duty of the Authority to ensure that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) all news broadcast by it is reported and presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>Subsection (b) goes on to deal with current affairs and matters of public controversy or subjects of current public debate.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted down the years that members of the Authority have always endeavoured to carry out their duties responsibly.  The Authority and the Director General have had difficulties trying to stop various operators and programme presenters from flouting authority and the wishes of the Oireachas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) says it shall be the duty of the Authority to ensure that:</P>
    <P>(b) the broadcast treatment of current affairs, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate, is fair to all interests concerned and that the broadcast matter is presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>I suppose one could be accused of trying to muzzle RTE, and I have no objection to being so accused.  I would like to see it being built into the Bill that current affairs programmes or items of public controversy should be <Col N="559" /> dealt with without the specific expression of the views of the producer or presenter of the programme.  One cannot put this into a Bill, but there is no doubt at all that we have programmes in which definite efforts are made to influence public opinion by the manner in which they are presented. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is on the record as saying when in opposition, say, between 1970 and 1972, that there are more than the average number of liberal minds in Montrose.  I do not suppose the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have been critical of that.  He was saying that the Government of the day were in trouble because of the activities of these people.  However, there was and still is undue influence or an effort to have undue influence on public opinion through the manner in which certain programmes are presented.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example, and maybe I am going back a bit far, but I am deliberately picking out this example because I have a feeling that operators within RTE at present are encouraged in their efforts to mould public opinion by the knowledge that they are working&mdash;I will not say with the full permission of, and it would be wrong for me to say with the blessing of, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;without the interference of the Minister in their efforts to justify the use of contraceptives and to advance the day when divorce will be freely available in this country.</P>
    <P>A copybook example of how propaganda can be facilitated can be found in three consecutive programmes of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; in January-February, 1975.  The first programme featured a panel of women in connection with the inauguration of Women's Year.  Each and every lay woman on that panel was vociferous in assailing the ban on contraceptives and was quite outspoken in depicting marriage and the life of women in the home as inadequate, frustrating and full of cruelty by the husband and so on.</P>
    <P>On that same programme a freelance <Col N="560" /> journalist, whom I shall leave nameless, who was frequently employed by RTE and who was a well-known letter writer to the papers demanding contraceptives, was called on to speak from the floor in order to open up the debate.  She was given full latitude to attack the anti-contraceptive organisations, and included in her remarks was an all-out attack on the Pope, whom she described as a rich old celibate with no right to be making rules for married people living ten to a room and so on.  No voice was allowed to be heard on this lengthy programme to put the Roman Catholic point of view or even the anti-contraceptive point of view.  One young woman on that programme who began to speak about Christian values was dismissed by the compere with the remark that &ldquo;Mrs. So-and-So has already made her case&rdquo;, before she had spoken more than a few words.  Apart from the imbalance of the programme, it is deplorable that the national network should be used to insult somebody that I will conveniently describe as the head of a State with which this country has diplomatic relations.  As far as I know no public apology was tendered either to the Holy Father or to the Nuncio for the insult on that night.</P>
    <P>I realise that the media will, in line with the current views of the halo-surrounded Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Foreign Affairs, draw the conclusion from my contribution today that, unless I express my views in the manner in which I am expressing them, I am subject to the possibility of a belt of a crozier.  This is the popular, derogatory was of attacking somebody who stands for his principles at present.</P>
    <P>That insult to the Pope, who is the head of my Church, was compounded and aggravated the following week when that same lady was again given a special slot on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; to explain that she had not called the Pope the son of a bitch, that she would never use such a description, even of her dog, that she had only said he had come of a rich family, which was a fact, and that he was a lifelong celibate.  This appeared to be <Col N="561" /> set up, this statement which was basically in contradiction of her statement of the previous week, because at that point a man on the panel intervened to say she could be going only on supposition in stating that the Pope was a celibate and that, perhaps, the rest of her views were also supposition.  The dear old lady, as the compere described her, conceded that she had accepted that the Pope was celibate and, of course, the encyclical was not infallible anymore than the document about hunting down witches.  Her problem was that she knew so many of these young married women living in one room with their children and that she could not keep from expressing herself. There was no effort in any way to balance that second programme.  The only major addition by way of remark to that from the compere for the night was that the good lady was a fine old lady.</P>
    <P>On the third week, when the seed had been well sown and the propaganda widely distributed, a few people were allowed in to speak from the floor against contraceptives.  They were effective for the small ration of time allowed to them.  One young mother of a large family who came from a still larger family objected strongly to the attempts that were made to denigrate large families.  She spoke from the floor.  Again the panel was reserved for the pro-contraceptives who on this third occasion projected themselves as being really normal married women with children and family life.  I wondered, if so, why they were endeavouring to put so many other women off the enjoyment of children and family life.</P>
    <P>I could say a lot more on this section because, as the Minister conceded a few moments ago when he was making that observation on Deputy Fitzpatrick's observation, I fully accept and know from experience that it is an impossible task certainly to achieve the type of impartiality that everybody would accept as being impartial.  Even if there was any political broadcast, depending on how the ball hops, someone from one or other side of the House is going to feel that the dice is <Col N="562" /> loaded against him.  Listening to the broadcasts and seeing the projections, particularly on television, there is no doubt that there are people regularly on the media who have not, from my conservative viewpoint, any great respect for moral values in this country.  The Minister replying, again in a few words to Deputy Fitzpatrick, said that if people had grievances they could take up those grievances with the present complaints committee and, when this Bill becomes law officially, with the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. I have copies of correspondence in front of me arising from complaints which were submitted to RTE in relation to some broadcast.  Of course, I do not want to bore the House with reading sizeable extracts from those letters.</P>

      <P>With RTE.  I am talking about complaints directly addressed to RTE.  In a letter dated 16th October, 1974, to RTE which objected to an aspect of &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; programme it was stated by the secretary of the organisation on whose behalf he was writing that they objected to the use of a so-called family viewing film such as &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; as a vehicle for the advertisement of contraceptives, giving, in addition, a false view of Catholic teaching.  It went on to say that they were also objecting to the fact that a dispensary doctor, using his own name, is allowed to use public broadcasting time for his views on this matter against the ethics of his profession.</P>
      <P>There was a reply from the Head of Information and Publications section of RTE on the 7th November and in part of that reply it said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the programme featuring a dispensary doctor, I can only say that the legitimate expression of views which may legitimately be held by any citizen are proper material for broadcasting on <Col N="563" /> a general service.  RTE would be failing in its duty to minority opinion in the country if it permitted only majority attitudes to be reflected in its programming.  This is one aspect of its obligation to be impartial.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with what the Head of Information and Publications said in that letter.  However, one of the major criticisms I have of RTE in this regard is that they are so desperately anxious to present minority views that they bent over backwards, as I outlined in the criticism I had of the three editions of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; in January-February, 1975, to squeeze out and to give no voice to majority opinion. That is all I am criticising. I am not suggesting that whoever writes &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; script is continuously trying to ride some hobbyhorse. There have been criticisms of it but from my point of view I find nothing wrong with the programme. The end product of the collection of correspondence I have&mdash;as far as I know none of it was given to the complaints committee&mdash;was that there was no satisfaction obtained by the complainants. There was a lot of correspondence by way of follow-up and the grouping took the matter up with the Broadcasting Complaints Advisory Committee and reported to me that they did not get any satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I am worried, as the Minister should be, in relation to impartiality. Deputy Fitzpatrick expressed concern in relation to a report to the effect that RTE are preparing at present for the next general election and that the former head of the GIS had been appointed to take charge of these preparations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it rather unlikely. Some years ago we had what could be described as an impartial political programme with a member of the former Government being confronted by a representative from the then Opposition parties.  This was operated by agreement between the parties.  However, it was a peculiar <Col N="565" /> sort of agreement when we were in Government.  My recollection is that a Minister was given an ultimatum that a programme was being broadcast on a certain date and that a Minister was needed to speak on a subject. For a while we had a balance with the Government Ministers facing spokesmen on behalf of Fine Gael and Labour.  At that time we were accused of hiding from opposition, of not facing up to demands, and we heard that it was difficult to get a Fianna Fáil Minister to take part in such programmes. However, with the change of Government, and in spite of the volume of talent that was available in the Government&mdash;we do not talk about the talents any more because the talents appear to have gone away &mdash;a decision was reached that Government Ministers would not take part in such political programmes.</P>
      <P>The type of balance that existed on such programmes has been flouted by the Government, obviously with the agreement of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Instead of the balanced political programmes we have news items concerning three or four Ministers and, as a sop, three or four words at the end about the observations of an Opposition spokesman on the matter.  I am not satisfied that the director general of RTE, or the Authority, are as adamant in their demands of the present Government for straightforward political programmes as they were when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  They gave up the battle early on and no effort was made to renew such programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick expressed the view that this section, wordwise, made a greater effort in its planning to ensure that there would be balance. The Minister must know that some programme presenters on radio and television are not impartial in their treatment of current affairs and subjects of public debate.  While the line they are taking may suit him at present I am sure the Minister fully accepts that that should not be the criterion.  Just because they are playing it his way, does the Minister think that what he has in section 3 of this Bill on impartiality, does not allow <Col N="566" /> an elasticity that can be used against him or against views he holds if the presenter of a specific programme held views that do not coincide with his?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lalor made a number of interesting remarks beginning with the final paragraph of subsection (1).  The objectives of subsection (1) are to give statutory backing to the existing practice in RTE in regard to interpretation of the provisions regarding objectivity and impartiality. It is not always possible to cover all significant views in a single programme and RTE regard these provisions as being complied with if all such views are covered in two or more related programmes broadcast over a reasonable period.  This is a sensible interpretation, and it has been incorporated in the Bill for the sake of clarity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor cited a direction of the former director general, Mr. Hardiman, of 8th May, 1970.  He pointed out that this might have been in contravention of the old section 18 (1).  I do not accept that it was in contravention, but it might have been considered to be in contravention.  I am introducing this so that the law shall be specific on this and also so that people who do not think that this is right will have an opportunity and have had an opportunity of contesting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They can say: &ldquo;This is not the right way, it would be better to maintain the strict reading of the existing legislation.&rdquo;  Deputy Lalor expressed himself as worried as to what powers director generals might take in relation to these matters, if we are now effectively ratifying in our legislation an interpretation of a former director general and also of the present director general and Authority.  It would be wrong simply automatically to rubber stamp any interpretation of any director general.  We ought to be vigilant as to whether we should ratify such interpretations as they occur.  We are right to question it and debate it.  I propose that it should be ratified by the House or incorporated in the legislation, not because it was a decision or a house rule, but because it was a house rule which is <Col N="567" /> reasonable and fair and that the law should give expression to it.  I accept that it is capable of abuse.  A programme can be put on which is highly slanted and on the following night there could be another programme which is supposed to set it off but which does not set it off.  There have been programmes in the past to which that objection would apply.  I will not go into a discussion on any particular programme but this abuse is not inconceivable.</P>
    <P>The Authority have a duty to see that the powers vested in them are not abused.  There is general agreement on both sides of this House that successive authorities have not abused their powers in this matter.  Deputy Lalor made the point not in regard to authorities abusing their powers but in regard to individual broadcasters who from time to time may have done so. They may have and I think some of them did from time to time.  It is perhaps inevitable that this should occur to some extent.  It is the duty of the Authority to keep these tendencies within bounds and to exercise vigilance here.  I think the authorities have discharged that duty.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of Deputy Lalor's remarks I will outline what I conceive to be the duty of the Minister in this area.  How can institutional expression be given to this requirement of impartiality? Can the Authority be left as the final arbiters as to whether they are discharging the duty imposed on them by law of being impartial?  I would not think so, on the ground that no one should be judge in his own case.  Should the Minister be the final judge as regards impartiality? Again I do not think so, because what could be involved when it is asserted that the Authority have failed to discharge their duty of impartiality, may be a conflict between the Government of the day and RTE, or between a Government Department and RTE, and RTE would sincerely think they were discharging their duty and the Government with equal sincerity would think that they were not. Should we say that the Government's view should prevail in this matter of <Col N="568" /> impartiality?  I would think not.  That is the reason why I set up as an interim measure, the complaints committee, and why I propose now, the statutory complaints commission. That is not to say that the Minister or the Government should abandon all say in what RTE do.</P>
    <P>What I have sought to do in this legislation is to confine ministerial intervention in this area of programming to the question of subversion or condoning or encouraging subversive activities tending to undermine the authority of the State.  I have sought to limit it there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor quoted me from memory as saying that there was more than an average number of liberal minds in Montrose.  I would not object too much to having said that but it was not what I said.  Liberal minds in Montrose would be no bad situation. No doubt there are a good many liberal minds there.  However, what I said was in the particular situation we had in 1971-72 in relation to subversion and sympathy with subversion. I expressed the view that there was more sympathy among the media with Sinn Féin ideas than there was in the population as a whole.  It was my belief that that was true at the time but I think there is less sympathy now with this kind of propaganda and activities than there was then both in so far as the media and the population generally are concerned.  The great majority of us here are glad that that is so.</P>
    <P>I come now to that part of Deputy Lalor's speech where he discussed the handling by RTE of such subjects as divorce and contraception.  In the early part of his remarks he seemed to suggest that I might have encouraged RTE to handle these matters in a certain manner but in the later part of his remarks I am grateful to say that he clarified that and indicated that he did not consider that I had sought to impose on RTE any particular point of view in this area.  Of course, that is the case.  In this area and in others RTE should endeavour to cover all significant views.  I accept entirely that the conservative point of view&mdash;I use Deputy Lalor's word&mdash;is a significant point of view and should find expression. <Col N="569" /> But I think also that my view and the views of my party are not insignificant and, consequently, should find expression also.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether RTE have handled these issues rightly or otherwise, we are dealing here with a very highly emotionally charged field in which anyone who holds strong and sincere views is likely to regard any discussion as giving too much weight to the other side.  Clearly, Deputy Lalor holds that opinion genuinely in regard to certain programmes broadcast by RTE.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints in this regard addressed to the complaints committee.  Ten complaints have come before the committee to date.  By international standards this is a rather high number and I should hesitate to say whether it is a tribute to the vigilance of our people in regard to impartiality. It may be of interest to the House to note the nature of these complaints and the outcome in regard to them.  Of the ten complaints, seven were decided in favour of RTE, one was decided against them and two of which I shall say nothing further are still under consideration by the committee. Of the decisions in favour of RTE one was a complaint by the LFM alleging unbalanced coverage arising out of a speech by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in Waterford. Another was a complaint by the same movement regarding unbalanced reporting on another subject; another was a complaint by Miss Máire Breathnach in this precise area alleging that on 17th July, 1974, an RTE broadcast in connection with the contraception Bill was one-sided.  Another complaint was from the Irish Family League relating to an episode of &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; which made reference to contraception.  The fifth complaint was from the Natural Family Planning people in relation to a &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; programme.  The next complaints was one by the IFA regarding a crisis in the cattle trade and the last was a complaint about biased reporting on Portugal during a &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme.  All of these were decided in favour of RTE and the reasons for the decisions were published. As the House knows, the complaints <Col N="570" /> committee is headed by a distinguished former judge, Mr. Kingsmill Moore.  The decision against RTE was in relation to a &ldquo;Last House&rdquo; programme which included an interview on homosexuality.  A report from the committee on that case was published in the RTE Guide.</P>
    <P>This machinery is about the best that one can provide.  Deputy Lalor talked about failure to get satisfaction in relation to complaints but I do not think that one can get satisfaction automatically through such channels because at most, a complaints committee may find against him.  In relation to two or three of these cases the point of view expressed by Deputy Lalor was genuinely the attitude of the complainants but the committee did not find in their favour.  In the other case&mdash;the interview on homosexuality&mdash;the balance tilted the other way.  At any rate, the existence of that machinery is the best safeguard one can provide in this area in that both the broadcasters and the Authority know that the committee and its procedures exist and that, therefore, there is a kind of vigilance in this area which would be sustained and accepted by public opinion generally as being impartial.</P>
    <P>In the last part of his remarks Deputy Lalor dealt with a matter which, strictly, does not come in here, that is, the question of party political broadcasts and what he regards as the unwillingness of Ministers to participate in these programmes.  The decision in so far as there is nonparticipation in that kind of programme is outside the hands of RTE who were quite interested in continuing to broadcast such programmes. On our side it was considered that party political confrontations of this kind were not the most interesting way of discussing current affairs.  Undoubtedly, Deputies will regard that as a wrong decision but regardless of what sort of decision it was, it was a decision of the Government rather than of RTE.  Certainly, RTE would be prepared to provide the required forum for that type of programme as they are prepared to provide a forum for all kinds of public affairs discussions. I would not accept that in the past or now RTE have been particularly <Col N="571" /> anxious to bring in one side in politics to the exclusion of the other.  They bring in people on considerations of what they regard as good broadcasting.  I do not think they are partial.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Lalor that some presenters may go wrong in their presentation, through enthusiasm or otherwise, and may go against the impartiality rule.  If they do, it is for the Authority to pull them up.  If the Authority are not doing that, the citizens who think that can address themselves to the complaints commission.  There is also, of course, this House where RTE can be and are legitimately open to discussion and criticism.  The new section which we have discussed at length is not intended as any radical departure from the existing practice which, indeed, in part it embodies more effectively than was previously done.  The new departure is essentially the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and we will have an opportunity of discussing that on the next section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the manner in which the Minister has taken my remarks.  He said he was not anxious to discuss individual programmes. He went on to say the complaints commission dealt with a number of complaints and a number of those covered the complaints about which I was speaking.  The paragraph which is an authorisation in retrospect for something RTE were already doing provides: &ldquo;Should it prove impracticable in a single programme to apply paragraph (b) of this sub-section....&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is reasonably familiar with the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;. We do not all see it every Saturday night, but we see it occasionally when there is no dispute on.  If a panel of four people deal with a controversial subject on two or three successive Saturdays, and if they all take the one side in that controversy, is it suggested an effort has been made to achieve balance?  The explanation can be given that Miss So-and-So and Mrs. <Col N="572" /> So-and-So did not turn up and two other people were invited.  I do not think that excuse was offered in the instance I have in mind.  As the Minister said, this matter came before the complaints commission and they ruled against it.</P>
    <P>Is it not possible to spell it out more clearly than &ldquo;Should it prove impracticable in a single programme ...&rdquo;? If four panellists are to appear on a programme, I do not accept that it could prove impracticable to achieve a certain amount of balance.  There could be two very vociferous people on a panel and two others who were not so well qualified to speak.  The presenter could claim he made an effort to get balance.  My idea of balance is not to put on two successive programmes with a panel of four and to have the panel of four for something the first week and the panel of four against it the next week.  People may not see the two programmes and they are influenced by the one they see.  An effort should be made to balance every proprogramme. I fully accept that it is not possible to balance every programme. As the Minister said, we can all interpret a programme in our own way.  If two people are involved in a programme of public interest on which there are different points of view, the two people should have different points of view.  If all the panellists take the same point of view on a key issue, that is not balance.</P>
    <P>I was not here for the full debate but I gather from Deputy Fitzpatrick the Minister has some amendments in mind.  &ldquo;Should it prove impracticable in a single programme ...&rdquo;&mdash;who decides?  I do not know why I always seem to get myself in trouble by picking on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  It is too easy for the producer or the presenter of a programme with that guideline to come up with an explanation. Some members of the Authority might look at the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and at a meeting the following week one or two of them might make a complaint. If all the members of the Authority have not seen the programme that is covered in section 7.  There is a playback of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and members of the Authority see it.  They <Col N="573" /> may find it was positively imbalanced and the Director General may be asked to account for this.  Being the good man he is, he has anticipated this and he has been on to the producer.  The producer tells him they did the best they could, they had four people coming in but, at the last moment, two did not turn up.  That is a fine explanation. If there is a full panel of four or five people, all on the one side, it is rather remarkable that it is the people whose views coincide with the presenter who turn up and those whose views do not coincide fail to turn up.  I wonder whether there is not a more positive way of tying in the necessity for balancing the single programme and not having to build in such a useful escape clause.</P>

      <P>I would like to think over what the Deputy has said. With respect, I do not want to be drawn into discussion of particular programmes, which I think Deputies can quite rightly discuss but which I do not think, for reasons I have indicated, the Minister should, except in relation to a certain very specific area, that of subversion, which I take it does not arise here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lalor, in the earlier part of his remarks suggested&mdash;and the suggestion is fair enough&mdash;that since the point of view, which was in his view over-represented, appears to have been something resembling my own point of view, I might have been reluctant to intervene negatively even though he agrees that I did not incite this myself. I would not merely be reluctant to intervene negatively but I would not intervene even if the balance was, to my mind, wrong the other way in relation to an area like this.  Concerning this whole matter all I would hope for from RTE would be that all significant views should be covered because it is an important area of public controversy. I believe in my own point of view, as I am sure Deputy Lalor does in his.  I think the public would benefit by a full representation of both or of all significant points of view on this.  I do not want to say much more about that.  Deputy Lalor asks who decides. I take it that the decisions are taken <Col N="574" /> at various levels in RTE with the bulk landing with the director general and perhaps ultimately with the Authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor speaks of spelling out more clearly what is required.  In general I am prepared to consider between now and Report Stage, in the light of comments made in this House, what improvements, if any, can be brought into the Bill, improvements that would be acceptable to us on this side.</P>

      <P>I was just about to come to that.  As a matter of fact it is a matter which the Deputy should take up with one of his colleagues in the other House because the wording in question is wording from an amendment in the Seanad by Senator Mark Killilea who submitted:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 35, to delete &ldquo;in applying&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Should it prove impracticable in a single programme to apply&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>So, if the wording is wrong, there must have been a case of error on the other side, which is virtually unthinkable.  I am not trying to make a cheap debating point there but it is an amendment which was accepted by me in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Many points of view have been expressed on this section which we all admit to be one of the most important in the Bill.  Certainly it is the most controversial section.  We know perfectly well that impartiality is of vital importance, especially in a television programme.  We know that the same rigid rules do not apply with regard to newspapers where people are <Col N="575" /> allowed express their views one way or the other.</P>
      <P>We all agree that various parts of the Bill are necessary, especially that part which prohibits the Authority from broadcasting anything which would incite crime.  Crime today occupies all of our minds, not merely the type of crime dealt with in this section.  Anything the authorities can do to discourage ordinary day-to-day crime in our cities is to be welcomed by all sections of the community.  I should like to see RTE channelling a public debate on, say, excessive alcoholism amongst teenagers.  If I saw RTE in the morning trying to channel a public debate on that subject I would not think that to be in any way partial.  It is a problem which is getting out of control in our society and is the type of question on which RTE could very usefully deploy their talents.  The Minister and Deputy Lalor spoke about liberalism along certain lines.  That could be counterbalanced in a programme of that type, when they could very usefully get that type of debate going and highlight the dangers inherent for teenagers.</P>
      <P>We know the important role television can play.  It is for that reason we believe this section should be debated at length.  I believe Deputy Lalor's remarks were very valid.  I am sure the Minister sees his point of view with regard to impartiality and the proper balancing of programmes as being very important.  I do not want to deal with any particular programmes at this stage.  The Minister has said he will take a look at certain proposals we put forward and I shall leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister&mdash; and here I do not want in any way to jeopardise any negotiations taking place&mdash;has he any news or information to hand on the resolution of the dispute disrupting many of the services in RTE at present?  Has he any late information with regard to this matter?  I do not want to pursue the question in any detail but I sincerely hope that that dispute will be brought to an early conclusion.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 26, to delete &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four, two of whom shall have professional experience in broadcasting,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lalor pointed out on a previous section how various complaints <Col N="577" /> will be made to the Authority and it is obvious they will be passed on to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. We propose in this amendment that &ldquo;two&rdquo; be deleted and substituted with &ldquo;four, two of whom shall have professional experience in broadcasting&rdquo;. It is our view that two are too few for an important body like this.  We consider such a small number would not represent a cross section of opinion.  In another amendment designed to enlarge membership of the Authority, the Minister put forward the opinion that if we enlarged the membership to 12, the Authority would be cumbersome and would not work properly.  Here he is going too far in that direction.</P>
    <P>The important nature of the complaints that will be submitted&mdash;the Minister has told us ten have already been submitted&mdash;make it important that the membership of the commission should be of a sufficient number to represent a cross section of opinion. We had the complaint about the Dublin Bay oil refinery.  The programme proved to have been unsatisfactory. Such complaints will in the future be transferred from the Authority to the new body.</P>
    <P>Our proposals are put forward first because we believe the number proposed would not represent a cross section of opinion.  We also propose that two of the members would have professional experience.  This is important because this body should have people with a knowledge of broadcasting, of the output of programmes.  Ordinary people would not have the technical knowledge of the composition of programmes. We believe that having people with professional knowledge would mean that the new body would be able to get their work done more efficiently.</P>
    <P>We know that on the present complaints body there is at least one person with a knowledge of broadcasting. We are asking that this number be increased to two.  We do not think we are unreasonable in asking that the membership be four.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this amendment.  The first <Col N="578" /> is that the size of the commission should be increased to at least five and that two of the members should have professional experience of broadcasting. I have some sympathy with the number five, it is what I should like to see, but statutory provision to this effect I would consider to be undesirable. The reason is that the number of suitable people in this field is fairly narrow, or otherwise that suitable people may not be able to spare the time to act on the commission.</P>
      <P>As far as the committee are concerned, service has been entirely voluntary and unremunerated.  Provision for the possibility of remuneration exists in the proposed legislative measures, but I cannot say at this stage whether remuneration will occur.  We are asking rather a lot of those concerned and I should like to put on record my gratitude to the members of the committee who have put in a great deal of work on this difficult quasi-judicial function.  At the time when I asked the two gentlemen concerned to serve I had not expected the volume of work would be quite as considerable as it has proved to be in the short period since appointment.  I know each case is given very careful attention, the case made by the complainant and by the Authority.  It is quite true that if we get more people, to some extent we will spread the workload.  I should like to have five but not to be obliged to find five in circumstances where I might find only three.  The work to be undertaken is quite considerable and I would ask to be excused from having to provide more than three, membership of three with the chairman, with the possibility of five or even more.  I should like to provide for three, bearing in mind that if I can get five I will.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern and object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second aspect, I do not think it desirable to have a statutory requirement that any number should have professional experience.  It might mean that a certain proportion of the commission would have to speak up for broadcasting and it might spoil the effect if the Minister were required <Col N="579" /> to have two people with experience of broadcasting.  I imagine the commission as having a detached quasi-judicial function but I do not want to have a statutory obligation compelling me to have a fixed proportion of the membership of the commission made up of professional broadcasters.  I am sorry, therefore, that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>While accepting the apology, and appreciating the presence of the Minister for Justice, it is disconcerting, to say the least of it, that we should have had this experience this evening of empty Government benches with a motion of such importance, as we believe this motion to be, before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main reason for tabling this motion is to highlight what we believe to be one of the greatest evils and one of the gravest dangers facing Irish society today.  I refer to the lack of opportunity for school leavers and the frustration they are facing.  We are within a month or six weeks of another 50,000 odd school leavers coming on the employment market. What have we spent our time doing since this time last year when for the first time we were faced with this problem, a problem of major proportions? To further highlight the lack of concern on the part of the Government one need only quote a remark by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach on, I think, the day we came back after the Easter Recess. <Col N="581" /> When pressed about the figures of school leavers on the live register his reply was that, while we have schools, we will have school leavers.  One could put many constructions on that. One could write a book on it, a statement from a responsible man holding a responsible position in the Government. We will have school leavers while we have schools.</P>
    <P>For the first time we have a huge number of school leavers with no prospective employment for them.  I hope the sentiment expressed in that somewhat contemptuous fashion by the Parliamentary Secretary is not an indication of the Government's attitude on this problem.  To no other problem has there been a more Micawber-like approach.  The Government seem to be waiting for something to happen.  They would like to sweep the problem under the carpet, and leave it there, but the problem will not just stay there.  It must be faced.  It must be tackled and positive encouragement must be given.  If that is not done, there may be alarming consequences.  It was said recently that we are a nation producing the most educated dole queues in the world. Possibly that was said in jest but when one looks deeply into it there is a good deal of truth in it because these school leavers set out in life with hopes, ambitions and aspirations. What is facing them?  One could say hopelessness and disillusionment and a feeling of being abandoned by the Establishment, the Establishment led by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to spell out the serious consequences that may ensue.  I am glad the Minister for Justice is here because he may well be concerned in the implications of this lack of employment for educated young people and their future role.  There may possibly be an urge to more drinking, if the money is available.  There may be more drug taking.  There may be a move towards subversive activities, if the money is available and, if the money is not available, there may be an urge towards procuring that money by devious means.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Member is aware <Col N="582" /> of the seriousness of the situation.  I am sure every Member has had the experience of young people and their parents calling on him seeking employment for their children.  No matter how one may try to convince parents about how bad the situation is, they are inevitably inclined to argue that their children must get an opportunity. One cannot blame them for that.  It is a perfectly natural reaction.</P>
    <P>I am sure the speakers on the Government benches will accuse me and possibly some others of scaremongering. That is not the role I am playing. My role is to demonstrate that the Government are not showing a proper awareness.  They are not even conscious of the problem, I believe, simply because it has not been examined in depth by them.  I appeal to them even at this late hour to take action and give leadership and encouragement to the 50,000 odd school leavers in six weeks' time.  We can only estimate the figure and work on last year's figures because no other figures are available to us.</P>
    <P>Recently in the House Deputy Moore asked the Minister the number of people who left school in 1975 who had come on the unemployment market and we were told that the figure was 52,000, between first, second and third level education.  We are also aware that at a conservative estimate 10,000 of those went back to school for a further year hoping that by returning to their studies at grave inconvenience to their parents and themselves at the end of that time they would be able to secure employment.  How frustrated they must be now within a month or a little more of coming on the unemployment market.</P>
    <P>We were told in the House last week by the Parliamentary Secretary that 147,000 people were on the unemployment register.  If we add to that the several thousand of last year's school leavers and also add on the conservative estimate of 50,000 for this year we can see that there will be in excess of 200,000 unemployed by June, which represents 20 per cent of our workers.  This is a very alarming situation.  There is no point in <Col N="583" /> Government speakers telling us in the House that by comparing like with like, the register now with that of 1965 or 1966, the same figures apply now as applied then.  The really important thing now is that there will be more than 200,000 people unemployed by June.  What do the Government intend doing about this?  A large proportion of this number will be drawn from the young people I am speaking about.  The Government appear to be reluctant to take steps to combat the situation.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister for Labour calling on Europe to do something positive about the unemployment situation.  Europe, as far away as last July, encouraged countries to take steps.  I have here the Council decision of 22nd July, 1975 on action by the European Social Fund for persons affected by employment difficulties.  It says:</P>
    <P>The Council of the European Communities having regard to certain things has decided as follows:</P>
    <P>Specific operations to facilitate the employment and the geographical and professional mobility of young people under 25 years of age who are unemployed or seeking employment shall be eligible to receive assistance from the Social Fund under Article 4, Decision No. 71/66 EEC.</P>
    <P>The majority of people under 25 years of age in this country have failed to get employment.  As well as that they have failed to get unemployment assistance.  I am sure every Deputy has seen young boys&mdash;young girls have no opportunity of getting unemployment assistance&mdash;who are living at home and because of this the assessment of their means precludes them from obtaining unemployment assistance.  The burden is then placed on their families.  I know of the case of a widow who continued in her employment as a nurse, She has a 20-year-old boy and when he applied for unemployment assistance he was refused because of the conditions attached.  Those instances are not confined to any particular area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> Those able-bodied young boys and girls have absolutely no income.  Today the Parliamentary Secretary told us that approximately 83,000 school leavers were on the unemployment register.  I believe the inability of the Government to take any positive steps has only been matched by their obvious lack of concern even to get accurate statistics to give us an exact picture of the problem.  We have no information yet on last year's school leavers.  We do not know how many obtained employment or in what areas they obtained employment.  We do not know how many returned to school for a further period.  We are just given a conservative estimate of 10,000 people.</P>
    <P>There was a report out last week on the employment of university graduates. Quite a number of them obtained employment as bulldozer drivers. There is nothing wrong with such work but when a university graduate gets a job as a bulldozer driver he takes the job from a trained person who could have that job.  I also want to refer to the European Community's news feature of 6th August, 1975 where we are given the proportion of young people among the unemployed in the European context.  The figures given are Belgium, 34.3 per cent, Denmark, 47.2 per cent, France, 45.8 per cent, Germany, 28.4 per cent, Italy, 32.7 per cent and Ireland 1 per cent.  There is a footnote which states that in Ireland the authorities believe that official statistics seriously underestimate the amount of youth unemployment for there is little incentive for young people without work to register as unemployed.  The Government tell Europe that the figure is 1 per cent in relation to this category. It must be a huge joke in Europe.</P>
    <P>In this report figures are also given for the growth in unemployment, 1973-74 with reference to young people.  In relation to Belgium the figure is 64 per cent, Denmark, 80 per cent, France, 75 per cent and down through the other countries to Ireland where we are told that the growth in this period was 121 per cent. What is the point, therefore, of giving a figure of 1 per cent to Europe?  No <Col N="585" /> effort is being made to give Europe the details of the problem that faces us.</P>
    <P>I also have an information memo from the spokesmen group of the European Communities which gives statistics but for a later date.  It is March, 1976.  Eight countries are mentioned.  The ninth, Ireland, is missing.  Obviously, they were so dissatisfied with these figures that they decided there was no point in including them or alternatively no further information had been given by Ireland.  That is a disgraceful situation because it proves that not only are the Government not able or prepared to take any steps to cure the situation but are also not prepared to investigate and let us know what our problem really is with the result that everybody is groping in the dark.</P>
    <P>On July 22nd last year the Council signified its approval for the extension, as a first step, of assistance from the social fund to cover young people under 25 years of age.  What have we heard about that?  How much money was put into that?  I think money has been spent in two areas.  A certain amount has gone into training in AnCO&mdash;which is fine; I congratulate AnCO on what they have achieved to date&mdash;but at a time like this, that is not enough.  The only other area in which I am aware money was expended is on community pilot programmes. I understand we have four of them.  We have heard so much about them that one would think that at this stage we would have achieved some reasonable amount of employment in them.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 5th April in an article by Maev Kennedy under the heading &ldquo;People and Work&rdquo; it is stated:</P>
    <P>That the figures for the numbers who would be employed if the scheme were approved of by the Minister to be extended throughout the country varied even more. One source said 2,500 was the target, the Minister himself said that he would like to see up to 1,000 employed, and AnCO itself says that a target of 700 was agreed on, and that this will be reached.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> Further down the article states:</P>
    <P>Short-term it may be, and small the numbers, but the Community Training Programme remains the only practical step being taken to provide some work immediately for the unemployed.  To the critics who worry that it may end up with a famine relief attitude of building bridges across bogs the only answer is to wait and see.</P>
    <P>The real number at this stage I believe is 28.  That figure was quoted in this article and on checking it with the Department we are told that it is in the region of 20-30.  That is not satisfactory.  Something effective must be done urgently.  The youth are crying out for the type of leadership that will at least give them some temporary employment or involvement in our community.  I appreciate the difficulties that can arise for trade unions and so on but I think the trade unions will co-operate if that leadership is given in getting these young people into areas where they will not interfere with jobs for the unemployed which are of paramount importance. I believe we have certain areas of activity that are suitable.  While we have bureaucracy such as we have and while we are getting people to work only to the number of 28 in these pilot employment programmes I say that the Government have abandoned the young people and should get out of the way and let somebody do what is needed, somebody who is prepared and has the courage to do it.</P>
    <P>The psychological damage that will be done to these young people if employment is not provided will be irreparable. They are for the most part aged between 16 and 21.  The frustration of not being able to find employment and continuing to be unemployed has alarming consequences because of disillusionment and disappointment unless the problem is tackled.</P>
    <P>The silence from the benches opposite about this problem amazes me.  I shall take a few examples at random but you could repeat them from any area of the country.  For vacancies for two clerical officers in the North Western Health Board there <Col N="587" /> were over 3,000 applicants.  That speaks for itself.  For one vacancy for a clerk typist in Leitrim County Council there were almost 500 applicants which again speaks for itself.  I can cite the case of a girl who attended interviews with 27 different organisations without success.  One can imagine her frustration, disillusionment and disappointment and one can imagine the temptations confronting her in that situation.  The same story can be told by my colleagues and by Deputies opposite if they were honest enough to speak up.</P>
    <P>Let us look at steps that can be taken to help employment.  Tonight we are dealing with young persons and stop-gap measures, but employment and occupation specifically for this group of people who have immense goodwill only waiting to be tapped provided our leaders have the courage to tap it.  The resources must be found; they need not be great.  A little effort can produce great effect. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary here could tell more than I can of a community project in Athboy where a group of young people with the right motivations are renovating an old courthouse and converting it into a community centre.  This is a wonderful effort.  They are using local initiative to finance the project.  This type of project could be developed.  It will not provide full-time employment but I would put very high in the order of priority the development of community projects with the co-operation of local bodies.</P>
    <P>This is something that can be done in cities, towns and in the country. We have many organisations.  In our cities we have community associations and residents' organisations.  Many of these organisations would be only too delighted to help in doing something positive for our young people.  In the rural areas there are many organisations such as Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, and so on, which should be encouraged to find local projects in which to involve young people.  I am not saying that this is a solution to our unemployment problem, but it would give them the confidence <Col N="588" /> to do something worthwhile for their communities.  It does not stop there.  Before I go any further on these ideas, I should like to refer to the transitional year in school.  At least 10,000 young people have returned to school with little or no aim or target at the end of the school year.  Could the Department of Education consider the possibility of using that transitional year to the far greater benefit of the young person?  Young people are at a serious disadvantage in seeking employment because there are already so many unemployed who are experienced.  Consequently, the Department should consider the training of these young people in the seeking of employment and in the development of skills, rather than having them return to school for another year for the sake of killing time, probably at great financial cost to their parents.</P>
    <P>I have always had a personal hobby horse regarding the development of horticulture and forestry plantations. We have tracts of waste land to which the community project could be devoted. I know of young people who have made great use of small plots of land to grow vegetables and flowers from the sale of which they have realised an income.  These ideas must be developed.  We have not had one idea from the Minister for Labour who should, in fact, be considering these ideas.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates the seriousness of the situation.  We are trying to prod the Government into action to give young people confidence in themselves. They can, of course, make a major contribution towards a cleaner Ireland through our Tidy Towns competition. The face-lift which our Tidy Towns competition has given to many towns and villages has been tremendous. Efforts could be made to rid towns and villages of eyesores and to clean our beach resorts if amenity grants were given towards these schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not want to encourage the exploitation of young people as a cheap source of labour.  What I am talking about is not so much employment but occupation in the hopefully brief period during which they are <Col N="589" /> seeking employment.  Earlier I referred to the pilot community programmes. Again, I appreciate that we cannot overstep on the unemployed people who need jobs at present. After all that was said about them, it is ridiculous to think that we now have only 20 or 30 young people in employment, and I want to push the Minister into expanding that as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Last year, 7,400 people were trained by AnCO.  Again, we have no figures to show how many of those were in the young person's category.  If we assume that half of them were, then we are talking about 3,500 people. We have been told that the number will be expanded to 9,000 this year but this is not enough.  That conditions of the premium employment programme specifically excluded the young school leavers we are talking about.  It did not cater for them because they were not on the live register.  Again, we go back to the question of how few have succeeded in getting on the live register.  As well as that, the £12 premium employment programme of a year ago has lost its real value.  Twelve pounds now is worth far less than it was then, particularly in view of the cost of employing young people.  The most important point of all is the one for starting a campaign to give school leavers jobs.  Again, I do not want to advocate their exploitation but if the major companies throughout the country gave a start to a number of boys and girls this would help to employ quite a number of them.  I know a magic wand cannot be waved to solve the problem, but we must be seen to be taking steps to achieve something in the short term.  I have made no effort to go into the solving of our overall employment problem. The reality of the situation is that the Government need the facts.  No programmes can be produced unless you have the facts.  Even at this stage it is quite obvious to the EEC that the facts being supplied by us were inaccurate.  Even at this late stage we should get leadership from this ailing Government to allay the disappointments and fears of the school leavers and their parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The content of the motion tabled by the Opposition relates to a very serious aspect of a very serious problem, that is, the current high rate of unemployment.  The consequences of the current high rate of unemployment cannot be exaggerated in terms of hardship and loss of morale for those who do not have gainful employment at present.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there is little consolation for the unemployed in stating that they are not alone in their plight and in the hardships which flow from unemployment.  This is the unhappy experience of more people in every country in Europe than in any period since the second World War.  It is an affliction common to many thousands of people all over Europe but, as I said, this is little consolation to those suffering from the adverse effects of unemployment at present.  If we are to appreciate the full extent of the unemployment situation in Ireland it is necessary to put it in a European perspective.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of Government policy in relation to unemployment has been our emphasis on capital investment, notably in the most recent budget.  Government spokesmen on numerous occasions placed their main reliance on that investment for an early recovery in our economy.  This Government, in common with every Government since the foundation of the State, face certain problems posed by the Irish economy.  They face the central weaknesses in the Irish economy which other Administrations faced in the past, weaknesses which are, on occasion, masked by the general buoyancy of trade around us but, in this period of recession we see the central weaknesses of our economy unmasked. We have an open economy and we see early repercussions on that economy from any trade depressions in the countries with whom we do business, Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution relied on for selling the problem of unemployment among our youth, on which many past administrations relied, was the easily available employment in the neighbouring economy, namely, through <Col N="591" /> taking the emigrant boat to Britain. That solution will not be available to future Administrations because, hopefully, the habit of early emigration has died.  Even if the desire were present, the possibility of employment in Britain will not exist in the foreseeable future.  Whatever encouraging signs there may be for a recovery in the British economy, it is clear that it will be quite some time before the unemployment problem is brought under control.  This is accepted by Chancellor Healey and other spokesmen for the British Government.</P>
    <P>There is a recognised lag between recovery in industrial production, in business outlook, in investment and improvement in the employment situation. If many of the firms which ceased production during the recession or curtailed their operations were to resume production, they would do so with a lower work force.  Even with an improved trade situation, it will be some time before fresh jobs are offered and an appreciable dent made in the numbers of unemployed.  That can be observed even at this time in those economies which are recording a very marked increase in their gross national product.</P>
    <P>The improving economic situation in the United States has not seen such automatic correlation between the improving position in industry and the improving position in terms of the unemployed, because the numbers out of work continue at an all time high figure.  Most commentators on the United States economic situation accept that it will take some time before that economy begins to take into gainful employment once more those who seek jobs.  In the system in which we operate, the United States and German economies are the chief barometers which point to the possibility of renewed help to the economies which depend on their performance.</P>
    <P>That would be the general perspective within which we must view our unemployment problems.  The solution availed of in the past, the emigrant ship, is no longer available. This must be welcomed for many reasons, which I will not go into now, <Col N="592" /> because it means we are facing a problem now which did not confront other administrations in the past, namely, the problem posed by the large number of unemployed, the efficacy of existing institutions and economic policies followed now and in the past.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Minister for Finance will shortly issue what he hopes will be the beginning of a review of all procedures, of our entire approach as it operated in the past, towards the workings of our economy. It is clear that the Irish economy has never succeeded in giving sufficient people a chance of a job.  We used the British connection to export our problems.  In the so-called prosperous sixties when most of the countries in the Community were doing extremely well, we had the highest unemployment rate coupled with the highest emigration rate for our young people. Throughout those years it was the young who emigrated, and I was a Member of this House when, through motions and questions, many Deputies expressed their concern at the youthful age of many of those leaving the city and country to seek work in Britain.  Many suggestions were put forward here on how this traffic in human misery should be ended, how controls could be instituted.  There was the scandal of very young people arriving at railway stations up and down Britain in search of work.  There was the question of what guidance was to be given to them, whether the State should assist them in finding such jobs in Britain.</P>
    <P>With the present rate of British unemployment, that situation no longer obtains.  Jobs are not easily available in Britain and therefore we at home are driven once more back to the question that should have been dealt with some time ago: what re-organisation of our resources is required to ensure that our economy in good times and bad is geared to our needs, and remember that we were not able even in good times to given people a sufficient number of jobs, to provide the number seeking work with jobs.  Once more we must reorganise our resources, face that <Col N="593" /> question for the first time, in very unpropitious conditions indeed, in a period of high unemployment in every country in Europe, in a period of recession.</P>
    <P>Even if there are grounds for optimism in terms of the long-awaited recovery, the facts are that it will be some time before the extra jobs will be there to bring down appreciably our rate of unemployment.  However, every effort must be made to bring about recovery as rapidly as possible, and any short-term schemes adopted by us must be such that the recovery will be served by properly trained personnel.  Within my own Department that is the main area in which I have been attempting to fulfil objectives.  The main responsibility of the Department of Labour in relation to industry is the provision of a sufficient number of trained people.</P>
    <P>Deputies may make the point that people who come out of AnCO courses trained are not guaranteed an immediate job in the context of the present recession.  That is a fair point to make.  Yet I would hold that it does not devalue our efforts, and that coming from this recession we must ensure that our early recovery in industrial production, in relation to new enterprises, is not held up as it was held up in periods of recession before now&mdash;although perhaps those periods of recession were not as serious as the present one&mdash;because of lack of skilled manpower.</P>
    <P>This year under the national training authority 11,000 will be trained, and it must be understood that the majority of the 7,000 trained under that programme in 1975 were in the 18 to 25 age group.  This year it will be the very same age group that will be covered.  We will be spending over £13,500,000 in our training centres up and down the country.  I do not underestimate the extent of the problem before us, but I think it is a concrete instance of the State through its agencies expanding its efforts to meet the demand there is, to ensure that with the aid of the European Social Fund and home resources there will be training facilities for our young people during the period of involuntary <Col N="594" /> unemployment suffered by them. There is a close connection between the level of their earnings and their job security in the future and the kind of skills they have.  This is the greatest expansion ever in our training programme.  The magnitude of the increase can be gauged from the figures for 1972-73, when we spent £2,500,000 on the entire national training programme, as against over £13,500,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Another measure we have introduced, and Deputy Fitzgerald referred to it, is the premium employment programme&mdash;the programme which the Minister for Finance announced in his June budget would be under the aegis of the Department of Labour and would involve an input from the Department of Labour to the task of getting people back from the live register into gainful employment. Under that programme we undertook to give certain sums of money, graded over the period, to employers if they brought people back from the live register.  As Deputy Fitzgerald knows, the target we set in that programme was 10,000 people. We did not reach that figure.  The extra money was there for this purpose but we only reached half way to that target for a variety of reasons &mdash;lack of confidence in the market over the period of the programme, the opinion among employers that the prospects for expansion of their investments did not exist then, and the reason Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned, that perhaps the sum of money to be given to each employer was not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that we shall be revising that programme shortly.  We should soon be in a position to announce our intentions in that regard, because I am convinced that this is the time for employers to expand their workforce, that this is the time for us in this economy to take the risks that are involved in expansion in anticipation of the recovery that is taking place all round us.  The worst thing that could happen to us is that we should become victims of pessimism.  Of course, there are risks involved at any time in this, but <Col N="595" /> the State will revise the details of the premium employment programme, and I would hope that employers will take up the offer implicit in that programme for the remainder of the year. Thus to assure and to assist those forces in our economy that are now thinking of expansion and reinvestment. I hope I will be in a position shortly to announce those changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to confine my remarks to the areas of responsibility of the Department of Labour.  The main reliance this Government puts into the recovery effort is that involved in the capital side of the recent budget.  Other short-term programmes and schemes we are following are all supplementary and dependent on the success of that budget input.  Also I make the point that all our proposals and programmes, whatever the State does here, are limited in their success by the general rate of recovery in all the economies with whom we trade.  I think most Deputies accept that that is a limitation on all home efforts since so much of our <Col N="596" /> business activity is dependent on the buoyancy of exports.  There are matters relating to the success of our export efforts which lie outside the scope of the debate.</P>
      <P>Another item which should be of assistance to Deputies in learning about the extent of this problem of unemployment amongst the young people is that I shall shortly have available, I hope within the next month, the results of the survey conducted in the early months of this year of the level of unemployment amongst school leavers going out of our educational system.</P>

      <P>One disadvantage we have suffered in understanding the extent of the problem of unemployment among the young people is referred to in one of the EEC publications mentioned by Deputy Fitzgerald.  It is that there is not any specific division in our unemployment figures which gives us an accurate idea of the extent of unemployment among our young people.  The reason for that I suggest is that really all administrations in the State's history, certainly since the second World War, have not been over-concerned with the problem of unemployment among the young since the problem was in the main looked after by the young leaving in the emigrant ship for jobs in Britain.  That must be one of the principal reasons that there is no exact subdivision in the unemployment statistics which give us the facts in this area.</P>

      <P>This survey will provide us with pretty safe indications of the extent of the problem among young school leavers.  It is an area in which there is quite a lot of conjecture. These surveys have given us a more firm basis than was available in the past on which to assess the extent of the problem.  No one, therefore, can be complacent about the present situation which gives us so high a figure of unemployment.  It is true that as an Administration we have done our utmost to see that the hardship of those who are unemployed is to the greatest extent possible mitigated by the benefits we give them when unemployed, but this in no way compensates the individual concerned for the loss of gainful employment and of respect and morale.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the community youth project programme.  We <Col N="598" /> can take some pride in the fact that, although we do not exaggerate its impact on the present employment situation, it was on our initiative at the council of social affairs in Europe at which the regulations of the social fund were made that young people out of work in the various countries could be assisted from the social fund which would supplement the national effort to get such young people back to work.  In that programme, which is under the aegis of the national training authority, about 50 projects have been proposed at present.  Under that programme boys and girls up to the age of 25 are recruited from the National Manpower Service and are engaged, after an induction period in a national training authority centre, in projects such as renovating the houses of old people, painting and decorating, hotel work and similar activities.  In other words, we have attempted to bring a training element into work which the State would finance and see to it that young people out of work could be given employment which could not complete with or diminish the employment prospects of other categories of workers who found themselves out of work at this time and who might find themselves having family responsibilities of one kind or another.</P>

      <P>About 50 projects have been proposed and it is our objective to get 1,000 young people into employment as a result of the community youth training programme. The projects are of about three months' duration and it has been our objective in consultations between our Department officials and the training authority, to ensure that each project team would consist of seven persons. The tasks carried out are jobs that would not otherwise be done and the trainees are paid the normal training allowance during the period of their involvement.  The programme has been <Col N="599" /> confined so far to the four pilot projects in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Dundalk and Drogheda.  It is planned to continue with the programme and to extend it to all areas during the coming year.  In consultation with the local authorities, with trade unions because there is a lot of consultation needed with trade unions, because we must have their agreement before each project can be got off the ground, I hope to see something like 1,000 young people employed by means of this programme during the year.</P>
      <P>In stating that it may be of some assistance I do not make the point that this programme is in any sense a solution.  Obviously it is not.  Nothing less than complete recovery would be a solution, recovery at a faster pace providing more jobs than ever before. Nothing less than that would be a satisfactory response to the present unemployment situation.  However, I say it is evidence of our efforts as an Administration to see that no stone is left unturned, to see that even in the short-term programmes and schemes are brought forward, to see that as many of our young people as possible are brought back into employment. Therefore, if you take in combination with what we are doing under the national training authority&mdash;more young people being trained than ever before&mdash;what we are doing in the general short-term scheme of the community youth training programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Next month I hope that over the entire country, and with the extra money we have devoted to the council for the education. recruitment and training, that 600 young people will be brought into training for the tourist and catering industries.  Those interviews will be held next month.  All this is an indication that we are trying to ensure that as many schemes and aids as possible, consistent with the resources available to us, are provided for our young people who are out of work.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. I should like to mention that it is my <Col N="600" /> belief that if this discussion was held in any hall in any part of the country there would be an overflow audience because the parents are so worried and depressed about the situation.  They expect that something will be done for our youth and for that reason they will listen to all speakers on the subject.  For that reason I should like to record my condemnation of the fact that when this motion was called there were three Fianna Fáil Members present but no Government Ministers or representative.  It is easy to understand, therefore, the cynicism of our people when they hear the Government talking about cherishing all the children equally.  They did not deem it their duty to send somebody in to the House for this important debate.  The lesson will not be lost on the general public and if they are cynical and say that it is their view that the Government could not care less, the absence of a spokesman on behalf of the Government tonight is ample proof that they could not care less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish parents never stop rearing their children because they have a deep concern for their children's future and that is carried on for many years after their children have married. For that reason one can express sympathy and understanding with parents who, having reared their children to intermediate or leaving certificate standard and seen them pass those examinations with distinction, find that there is no employment for them.  Last year 52,500 left school to seek employment and I wonder how many of them were successful in their search for employment. The Minister for Labour spoke of other economies and how they are affected by unemployment and we know about this.  He mentioned two countries, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, and I should like to remind him that those countries are improving in their economic outlook and performance. That is easy to understand because those Government took action to bring about a revival of their economy while our Government did very little.  Our Government failed to accept the challenge of youth with the <Col N="601" /> result that our youth, and their parents, are despondent.  The Government stand condemned.</P>
    <P>We will be accused of making political capital out of this issue but we do not have to do so.  The people have lost faith in the Government.  One great failure was that the Government, despite the calls from many people, have not yet produced any kind of policy on youth.  We heard various explanations by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton, at youth conferences but the people are convinced that the Government have no idea of what a youth policy should be.  The Minister spoke about what happened before, about emigration, and told us that that was how a previous Government solved their problem.  I should like to remind the Minister that we still suffer from emigration.  A short time ago Deputy Wyse and myself raised on the Adjournment the question of the report of the Irish Centre in Camden Town, London.  That report contained disturbing facts about the emigration of young Irish boys and girls to London.  The Minister cannot glibly say that we do not have emigration and that is the reason the youth employment problem is so pressing.  I accept that emigration has reduced considerably but the problem is still with us.  However, that is no answer.</P>
    <P>The Government should try to see the present crisis as it exists because it calls for radical action.  There is no evidence of a desire to combat this problem.  Last Saturday a meeting was held in an hotel in this city of concerned citizens to discuss this.  The Minister cannot suggest that the organisations involved in that meeting were anti-Government, pro-Government or political.  Represented at the meeting were the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Lions International, Rotary International, the Knights of Columbanus and members of religious orders.  They wanted to bring forward suggestions as to how our youth could be gainfully employed.  The primary responsibility for this problem rests on the Government.  I accept that the Opposition have a duty but we are fulfilling that duty by bringing the <Col N="602" /> problem to the attention of the House. We have also made suggestions as to how this crisis might be solved or, at least, eased.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, and the Secretary of the Labour Party, Senator Halligan, called for radical action in order to solve our economic problems. It sounds laughable that we should have two Government representatives calling for action when they are in a position to take action.  We can do very little but the Government have the resources at their disposal if they wish to deal with the problem. There is little point in telling us that we should do something.  The Government have shown no initiative.  The Minister promised us tonight the 15th point in the National Coalition programme, a new economic plan.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the 14-point plan since 1973 I hope that the 15 points will be a lot better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The youth are growing tired of Government inactivity and of seeing the inept performance of the Government.  I have not forgotten that there is certain economic depression throughout the world at present.  I condemn the Government because there is no constructive action or thought by the Government in relation to the problems. All we get are foolish statements telling us what will happen tomorrow. Life concerns what is happening today, so the Government should try to improve their thinking on it.  The Government's <i>laissez faire</i> policies are totally unsuited to the country.  They do not give hope to the youth or to the aged for future development.  I believe that the people would respond to good leadership from the Government in seeking a solution to our present problems.  We never have Government leadership in this regard. We only have Government spokesmen saying that the law should be amended or that the Constitution should be amended so that we have divorce and contraception and so on. They say nothing about the 120,000 <Col N="603" /> unemployed who are on social welfare benefit.  Nothing is said about the numbers of school leavers who cannot get jobs.</P>
      <P>The people are not fooled by these statements.  They see them as an attempt to deceive and to take their minds off the economic situation, in the hope that tomorrow something will turn up.  This is not good enough for the people.  There is a lack of opportunity at the moment for young boys and girls to serve apprenticeships. In about four years' time there will be an enormous number of unemployed unskilled people seeking jobs throughout the country.  There will be a scarcity of skilled labour because the Government have never tried to grapple with the unemployment situation.  The time has come when the Government must tackle this problem, or leave office.  We on this side of the House are willing and prepared to grapple with problems. We have the dedication, the enthusiasm and the commitment to try to pull the economy of this country round, and offer some hope to the youth.  I agree that there are difficulties in creating full-time employment overnight.  The activities of AnCO should be enlarged to make them a real training organisation.  I would like to pay tribute to AnCO for what they are doing with the slender means they have.  I have confidence in the great job they could do if given the facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should do something to ensure that we can rejuvenate our economy.  The Government should assess our needs for tradesmen, teachers and so on and formulate a plan to fulfil the need.  The Minister's premium employment scheme did not even reach half the target set for it of 10,000 jobs.  There were only 4,500 jobs and school leavers were not included in that.  The Minister should look at this scheme again and expand it to include the youth.  I believe the people will be prepared to finance a scheme which would create gainful employment for youth.  We do not get that type of leadership and each day the youth becomes more <Col N="604" /> despondent.  The youth want to be trained and want to work.  They are being denied this opportunity by the Government's lack of policy and action.  Because the youth of today are the leaders and Government of tomorrow our generation has a responsibility to ensure that there will be a future for them.  If the Government do not do something about the employment situation there will be very little future for them.  Perhaps the Government have grown tired and are not trying to solve the problem; they have grown prisoners of their promises in the last election and having promised so much and achieved so little they have become despondent and cynical.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is a comparison that has been made in regard to some of the Members&mdash;brilliant but useless.  The situation is much too serious merely to allow the Government to continue with their daily enunciations on matters that are irrelevant and in which the people are not interested.  What the people want to know is what the Government propose to do to bring about the opportunities to which our young people are entitled and which will have to be provided if we are to have any future as a nation.  Sixty years have passed since the 1916 Rising but the dreams of the men and women of that time have not been fulfilled.  Moreover, I shall not blame the Government for this situation but during their term in office our people have lost the will and enthusiasm that are necessary to help them advance in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I understand the restrictions which you and your Office have imposed on the scope of the debate.  I understand the reason for the restrictions and I intend to abide <Col N="605" /> by them because already we have had a discussion on the question out of which this whole matter has arisen.  I am confined merely to the matter of students and their examinations.  It is as well to inform the House that a large number of students are involved in this situation&mdash;students of the technological colleges and those of the regional technical colleges.  The dispute involves examinations at first, second, third and fourth year levels. My intention here is to help and I do not intend indulging in any form of acrimony or criticism of the Minister. Rather, my contribution will be in the nature of an appeal to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The position in which the students find themselves is not of their making. They have followed their courses and are anxious to gain recognition by way of certificate or diploma for their efforts.  Due to the doubt about the whole matter the students have been upset considerably.  I have detected this from my experience in meeting with them.  It is my opinion&mdash;and the Minister is on record as having expressed the same sentiments&mdash;that, perhaps, we pay too much attention to examinations with a resulting serious effect on students.  But when examinations are necessary to enable students to advance either into employment or into further education we must take into account above all their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, for example, that in Kevin Street alone, in the whole-time applied science department, there are examinations for each year of three years while the electrical engineering diploma course students take examinations in each of four years.  In the light of activities regarding degrees and so on, the House will be aware that this is controversial territory. There is a diploma in optics in respect of which students must complete six months practical work but they must be successful in an examination before embarking on that practical work. Obviously, this is not take place.  Today I spoke with a student who is studying for the examination for medical laboratory technicians.  In his case, <Col N="606" /> too, the practical side of his work in a hospital cannot be undertaken without first sitting for and being successful in the examination.  Consequently, his whole career could be in jeopardy because of the present situation.  He must have his first year examination before a hospital will be satisfied to take him.</P>
    <P>I could go through the list: there are courses in radio telecommunications, wholetime radio communications and electrical engineering.  There are courses for radio officers and also some groups are seeking certificates to enable them to take some of the London University degree courses.  What I am appealing for is a large measure of compassion from the Minister.  I know his difficulty.  I am aware of the stresses experienced by all Ministers and the Minister for Education is not at the bottom of the list in so far as stresses and strains are concerned. However, it used to be said of Julius Caesar that he regarded <i>ingenium</i> or the application of intelligence as the most important factor in any career even in such a crude career as general of an army.  I believe that the Department of Education have the <i>ingenium,</i> that they have the resources to attack this problem and settle it.  There is an old Irish proverb which says: &ldquo;Is cuma nó muc duine gan beart&rdquo;.  I am looking for a beart.  It is not outside the bounds of possibility that the Department can produce one.  It will be tantamount to a serious failure on the part of the Department if they do not do so, if they cannot do so.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying: &ldquo;Thanks be to God I am not responsible.  Thanks be to God the buck can be passed, or the blame can be laid elsewhere&rdquo;. There is a strong obligation on the Minister and his Department to use all their resources&mdash;and the resources of a Minister and Department of State are great&mdash;to try to facilitate the students at this time.  There is a great old friend of negotiators called &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo;. He could be brought in here to get over the difficulty of having the examinations now.  The examinations could be held.  The Minister and his officials should bend themselves to this task and utilise, as great dramatists <Col N="607" /> used to utilise, the <i>deus ex machina,</i> utilise &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; and let the examinations go ahead without prejudice to the Minister, without prejudice to the teachers and, above all, without prejudice to the students' position.</P>
    <P>The House is aware from the numbers of copies of the letter from the principal in Kevin Street which were distributed today of what is really at issue, what has really excited the students.  The principal of Kevin Street has said that even at this eleventh hour it would be possible to salvage the final year examinations.  It is too late for the other ones.  He said he is aware of the widespread and justified concern of the students of the college regarding their examinations this year and the possibility that they will not be held.  He fully appreciates &mdash;and I am sure the House appreciates also&mdash;the seriousness of the situation particularly for final year students whose opportunity of seeking jobs with the qualifications for which they have worked so hard or for several years is now put in great jeopardy.  It was our hope that eleventh hour efforts could be made to retrieve the situation.  This is what I am doing, and I am doing it without acrimony, without looking for scapegoats. I am asking the Minister if he will utilise the resources at his disposal without prejudice to what happens later on to see that the students are satisfied.</P>
    <P>The students themselves have stated they are in a very difficult position as between the Department and the TUI.  They are asking for some kind of conversation, some kind of dialogue, some way to get around the table and to try to use intelligence, to use all the resources of human intelligence. We are dealing with education and we want to solve this problem. The Minister may be advised: &ldquo;Do not do this.  You will go to your defeat if you do this.  Precedents, regulations, rules, and so on, are there&rdquo;.  I am not asking the Minister to come to Canossa.  I am simply asking him to do his best with his officials to get the students out of this <Col N="608" /> serious dilemma.  Mercy and compassion can season justice.</P>
    <P>I realise how people working in a Department of State will attach great importance to the dangers of establishing a precedent, the dangers of making new regulations, but humanity, compassion and consideration are important also as elements in our community.  It is for those I am appealing. I have had letters from students all over the country.  I will quote from one letter from a student in the RTC in Cork.  He said there are thousands of careers at stake and the whole regional college system is in danger if no examinations are set this year. In other words, he fears what may happen in the next academic year.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that the examinations could take place in September. That is not a very good solution. It has serious weaknesses.  First of all, except in a particular economic situation, a particular type family situation, it is not easy&mdash;and anybody who did examinations in the autumn will understand and appreciate this&mdash;to keep up and organise studies over the summer holidays.  It is easy to lose momentum.  There is the second problem that the autumn period could be used for supplemental examinations for those who failed in the summer.  The whole examination complex is postponed and transferred to the autumn. No form of repeat examination could take place before Chirstmas, thus disrupting another academic year.</P>
    <P>There is no weakness in settling this examination problem without prejudice. There is no danger that the defences of Marlborough Street will be breached by such a settlement and that the whole complex of rules and regulations will be disrupted.  The Minister knows and understands this himself. This is an appeal without acrimony to the Minister to use his good graces and his power and the not inconsiderable strength of the officers in his Department to make available for the students in the colleges of technology, in the third level colleges throughout the country, their examinations.  By doing so he will be earning the gratitude of all who have the interests of <Col N="609" /> education in general and students in particular at heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to clear away one specific.  The medical laboratory technicians' examinations stoppage is not related to the question we are now discusing.  It does not relate at all to the non-payment of teachers. It is an external matter arising from an industrial action by the technicians and craft assistants.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that the examinations of which we are speaking are not on a national basis but relate to each individual college. These college examinations are monitored by extern examiners appointed and paid by the National Council for Educational Awards.  The National Council accept the examination results for the validation of the qualifications awarded to the students.</P>
      <P>It is my considered view and that of my Department that the setting and marking of these examinations is an integral part of the duties and responsibilities of the teachers in the third-level institutions in question and I am confident that the great majority of professional educationists would concur in this view.  An <i>ex gratia</i> payment was made in 1974 and again in 1975&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;simply because it was recognised that there was a time-consuming element in this work and that consideration was then being given to the question of a reduction in class contract teaching hours for the teachers involved.  This latter aspect was worked out in 1975 and has now become fully operational. The result is that the teachers concerned are now conditioned to teaching hours of the order of 16 to 19 hours per week while being required <Col N="610" /> to be in attendance at the college for 30 hours per week.</P>
      <P>In relation to 1974 and 1975, the Department, while adhering to the principle which I have stated but at the same time recognising that the other negotiations were in progress, and not wishing to adopt a position which might have had an adverse bearing on the outcome on the broad general issues in relation to the teaching hours, agreed as an interim measure to the <i>ex gratia</i> payment to teachers engaged in examination work.  This gesture of goodwill&mdash;that is what it was&mdash;was continued in 1975 to enable the agreement on teaching hours to which I have referred to become fully operational throughout the third-level technological colleges.  Now that this situation has been realised, now that the revised teaching hours apply generally, there is no reason why any payment should be made.</P>
      <P>The Teachers Union of Ireland appear to have taken the view that payment for examination work is a matter of right, even though they admit now and again that this work is an integral part of their duties.  It is also an attitude which in my opinion, does no credit to professional people, showing as it does such scant regard for the welfare of their students. When one makes a gesture of goodwill to facilitate larger negotiations, one expects some semblance of reciprocity on the part of the recipients.  One does not expect such a gesture to be seized on and turned into a blunt instrument to upset a principle and extract concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the education and welfare of the students are at stake, one expects attitudes of professional concern on the part of the teachers.  Regrettably no such attitude appears to be forthcoming from the TUI on this issue. For my part, let me say where I stand on this issue.  I hold that the setting and marking of these examinations is an integral part of the duties and responsibilities of the teachers in these institutions.  I say further that the class content hours from 16 to 19 per week of 30 hours attendance affords them ample time to fulfil their duties in <Col N="611" /> this respect.  I call on them, even at this late stage, to resume a professional approach to the students in their charge.</P>
    <P>To me, it is not a matter of the cost involved but the professional principle at stake.  No teaching organisation has the right to use students as hostages for such an unworthy cause.  I understand that in some programme today reference was made by Deputy Wilson to the suggestion that in every dispute there must be hostages.  It is indeed true that hostages have been taken in this case: their own students have been taken hostages by the TUI in the interests of what Deputy Wilson described as a small some of money.  I have not taken any hostages either in this instance or in the instance of Limerick.  I do not see why the students should suffer, and I must insist that it is their own teachers who are making them suffer.</P>
    <P>If this continues I may have to consider what further steps are open to me, for example, to consider whether payment of their salaries can continue to be authorised to <Col N="612" /> teachers who are not prepared to carry out their normal duties.  This is my position, which I think I have stated clearly on all occasions, and I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>The person mentioned by the Deputy claimed benefit under my Department's optical benefit scheme and the ophthalmic surgeon who examined him prescribed two pairs of spectacles&mdash;distance and reading&mdash; with tinted lenses.  The ophthalmic surgeon's eye examination fee and the full cost of two pairs of standard spectacles&mdash;frames and lenses&mdash;was paid under the Department's scheme. The supply of tinted lenses involved an additional charge payable to the optician by the insured person in accordance with the scale of charges fixed by my Department.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed disability benefit in respect of incapacity from 10th February, 1976 to 24th February, 1976 but was not entitled to benefit as he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited during the relevant governing contribution year.  The claimant stated that he had been employed in the United Kingdom during that contribution year <Col N="510" /> and inquiries regarding his insurance record there were made to the British Department of Health and Social Security who stated in reply that no insurance card for the employment in question had been received.  The claimant has now informed my Department that the insurance card is held by his former employer and the British Department have been requested to contact the employer in the matter. Immediately the outstanding contributions are collected and advised to my Department the claimant's entitlement to benefit will be reviewed.</P>
