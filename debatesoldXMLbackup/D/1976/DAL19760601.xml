      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree it was not at all necessary that the manufacture of condensed milk at Limerick should have ceased?  Will he take steps to encourage Golden Vale to restart it, as plant and space are available for it, and there is a large trained work force, many of whom have been made redundant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Golden Vale took this decision on the basis of commercial considerations which seemed appropriate to them.  It would not be for me to comment on their wisdom or unwisdom in this matter.  I will draw the specific case of the Lansdowne plant to the attention of the IDA for consideration in the course of the assessment I have indicated they are carrying out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree it is extremely unsatisfactory that, in a milk producing country such as this, in which there is a vast surplus of milk, we are importing condensed milk quite unnecessarily?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unsatisfactory that we should be failing to make use of our resources to the full. To this extent it would be most desirable if we could get industrial development <Col N="455" /> on the lines suggested in the Deputy's question.  For that reason the IDA are carrying out the study to which I referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not acknowledge that the current situation in which we have to import this product arises directly from the decision of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to dispose of the Lansdowne plant to Golden Vale and to change the plans made by the previous Administration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of reasons for the delay.  There was some problem in relation to a loan application to the European Investment Bank.  There was some concern about the overall capacity of European industry in this area.  There was a question as to whether the Fieldcrest product would create or aggravate over-capacity.  There was a problem also in relation to a joint effluent disposal plant with Smithwicks Brewery.  I understand these problems have now been resolved to the satisfaction of Fieldcrest and they are now proceeding.  I gather full production will not be reached significantly <Col N="456" /> later than it would otherwise have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some proposals but I think there was a question of getting some promoter who was actually prepared to put money into this development.  It is one thing to float an idea and it is another to actually follow it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the matter I have in mind the only persons required to put up money were the Government through the normal grant agency, the IDA.  Did the Department refuse to put up money for such a project which <Col N="457" /> involved a Scandinavian combination with work guaranteed for ten years and an employment potential of 1,500? Was it knocked because they did not have the money for it or for some other reason best known to the Minister and the Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no industrial project of that sort in which the Government are the only party required to put up money.

It could have been sited on the shores of either Lough Swilly or Lough Foyle, both of which are eminently suitable.  It did not go ahead, not through any lack of money on the part of the sponsors but on the basis of the Government's refusal to come up with money for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the name of the owner of the precious woods factory at Milford, County Donegal; the efforts that have been or are being made to revive the industry there or to find an alternative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the factory is owned by Precious Woods Ltd., now in receivership.  The IDA, in conjunction <Col N="458" /> with the receiver, have been seeking, and will continue to seek, a suitable alternative industry to take over these premises.  In 1975 three industrialists were brought to see the factory.  In addition, the factory has been brought to the notice of a number of other firms both in Ireland and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that since the closure of this factory a short while ago, the home market for the product which heretofore was made there is being supplied from very far afield with a very inferior product?  A revival of this industry would be useful not only to Milford but to the national effort as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Deputy has said is the case it should be profitable for an industrialist to take up the plant which is on offer from the receiver.  I am sure the receiver is making use of information of the type given by the Deputy in seeking to promote this plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope our fears about this factory will not be realised.  We fear it may be sold for other than an industrial purpose.  Will the Government and the IDA ensure that it does not go out of use as a potential industrial site?  It is a very good building and a very good location.  The rumours are that it may go to some other use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the fact that three industrialists were brought to look at the plant in 1975, a detailed profile of the company has been circulated to all IDA overseas offices and a number of firms have considered this profile at these offices.  In addition, Irish firms in the industry have been contacted by the IDA and I trust that since the matter has been brought to public notice the plan will be promoted further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one vital matter which I trust will be brought to the attention of the Minister, that is, that since the factory is in receivership and has been offered for sale the Minister should ensure that it <Col N="459" /> is not allowed pass into the hands of people who would use it for purposes other than an employment-giving endeavour.  In other words, the State should not allow it to be sold at a bargain price for some other use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that no receiver would sell a plant at a bargain price.  His concern would be to get the best price possible.  In view of what the Deputy has said industrial use would be the most profitable purpose for which the plant could be used. Consequently, I expect it would be sold by the receiver to an industrial concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While no specific consideration has been given to the question of making Lough Swilly a duty-free port, the general question of duty-free zones has been considered in the context of industrial development policy.  However, our membership of the EEC has reduced substantially the validity of the duty-free zone concept and I am satisfied that from the industrial development point of view we would have nothing to gain from the establishment of a duty-free port at Lough Swilly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Parliamentary Secretary has said it would appear that no consideration has been given to this matter.  I ask him to bring to the notice of the Minister the fact that this is one of the finest natural harbours in Europe, if not in the world, a harbour not requiring any dredging or other work of an on-going cost nature and that in the context not only of the EEC but of international shipping, the duty-free element be considered rather than having merely an agreement between the countries of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in regard to materials from third countries for export to member states and to EFTA, the common customs duties must be levied irrespective of whether the industries concerned are located in a duty-free zone.  Materials imported from third countries for processing and re-export to third countries may be imported free of duty under bond but there is a detailed Community procedure&mdash;directive 69/73&mdash; which involves custom supervision at all stages irrespective of whether the industry is located in a duty-free zone. Therefore, it seems that the concept of a duty-free zone has not the validity it had prior to our membership of the EEC.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is to ensure that as great a proportion as possible of the hides produced in this country is processed at home.  Because of the very high levels of cattle slaughterings in 1974 and 1975 there were substantial exports of Irish hides. While slaughterings in the next few years will not continue at the 1975 level, the projected numbers of hides likely to be produced exceed the present capacity of the Irish tanning industry. This industry has, however, embarked on a programme of expansion and I am satisfied that, when this programme is completed, the capacity of the industry will match the numbers of hides likely to be available from home sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the supplementary, I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the number of hides exported in a raw state would vary from year to year depending on fluctuations in cattle slaughterings which can be considerable.  For example, as the Deputy must be aware, in 1974-75 there was a higher level of cattle slaughterings than was the capacity of the Irish tanning industry.  In that year there were more rawhides exported than would be the case in normal years.</P>

      <P>In relation to the second part of the question, there are expansion plans in at least two of the tanneries operating in the country. The figures for increased production contained in these proposals indicate that by 1978 the hide requirements of the existing tanneries will be between 1.4 and 1.5 million against a projected availability from domestic slaughterings of cattle of about the same figure. Therefore, by 1978 we should be reaching full utilisation of Irish cattle hides.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is satisfied that the campaign to encourage people to give preference to Irish manufactured goods is having the desired effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the guaranteed Irish programme.  The principal aims of the present programme are, first, to secure the commitment of Irish manufacturers to high product standards and, second, to inform consumers and retailers as to the range and quality of the Irish goods which are available.  I believe that the programme has had a good deal of success in achieving these aims. The number of companies participating in the scheme is now approaching 400. These companies are using the new symbol on their products and are operating the &ldquo;satisfaction or money back&rdquo; arrangement.  I would hope that <Col N="464" /> up to 1,000 companies will eventually take part.</P>
      <P>Last December independent research revealed an 86 per cent public awareness of the guaranteed Irish symbol. Seventy per cent of consumers interviewed indicated that their choice of goods would be positively influenced by the guaranteed Irish symbol.  In a questionnaire issued to manufacturing participants in January over 100 major manufacturers responded that the scheme had been of immediate benefit to their sales while 76 per cent of all respondents were satisfied that the scheme would increase their sales during 1976.  Participating firms are contributing to the costs of the publicity campaign being carried out as part of the programme.  In the pre-Christmas period almost half of the total expenditure was raised in this way.  I would hope to see industry becoming even more involved, leading eventually to a situation in which the campaign would be entirely funded by industry.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure the success of the guaranteed Irish programme, it is essential to secure the support of the retail and distributive trades.  In this connection I am happy to report that the IIRS in association with the council has just recently published a directory that will be of considerable practical help to the retail trade buyer.  This directory, entitled &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo;, provides a comprehensive list of consumer products made in Ireland together with the names of their manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Plans are well advanced for the establishment this autumn of consumer information centres in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. These centres will provide consumers with information about Irish manufactured goods from local retail outlets.</P>

The establishment of the consumer information centres, including one in the city of Dublin, will enable other consumers to bring to the notice of the appropriate authorities complaints similar to those raised today by Deputy Moore.  These centres will lead to a feedback of information which will ensure that, to the maximum extent, consumer demand is met by Irish products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on the control of prices in respect of two hotels (names supplied) in County Clare where for equal drinks (details supplied) ordered on the same day the price in one hotel was £1.33 and in the other £2.45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Maximum prices orders for drink are in operation in seventeen areas throughout the country, including Ennis, County Clare. The orders do not, however, apply to premises registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts.  Both premises referred to are registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts.  All licensed premises, including hotels, are required to display price lists and such lists are on display in the hotels in question.</P>
      <P>A prices inspector from my Department has visited the two hotels named by the Deputy and has found that the price of £1.33 represented an excess of 5p for the drinks in question over the prices shown on the price list displayed. This excess will be refunded to the complainant, on request.  The inspector has also established that the price of £2.45 charged for the drinks in question was in accordance with the prices listed up to 20th April, 1976.  After that date, the price of each of the drinks named was reduced by 5p.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the existing prices orders are being questioned in the courts and this is something which hangs over the whole area.  The question of new powers in regard to price controls on the licensed trade is being considered in the context of price legislation which is being considered.  The best way of getting the lowest possible prices for drink is by more active competition in the trade rather than by a measure of price control, and for that reason public emphasis is being <Col N="469" /> placed on the desirability of a fuller display of prices and on the enforcement of existing prices orders under the restrictive practices legislation against collusion among publicans in the matter of prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the position disclosed by this question, that a round of drinks was lawfully charged for at £2.45 and that exactly the same round which cost £1.33 involved an overcharge of 5 pence which is now to be refunded, displays a ridiculous situation and that surely the answer is price control rather than the Parliamentary Secretary's efforts to have competition?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Gallagher</b> asked the Minister for Justice the number of persons recruited into the Garda Síochána during 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975; and the proposed number for 1976.</P>

    <Col N="476" />

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers of persons recruited to the Garda Síochána in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975 were 851, 538, 510 and 366 respectively.</P>
      <P>With regard to recruitment for 1976, I stated in reply to a question on the 10th February last that the rate of intake of recruits depends on a number of factors and that it was not possible to say precisely how many persons would be recruited this year.  The present estimate is that approximately 160 vacancies will require to be filled in this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that the maximum establishment will fall below the total by a figure of 160.  As the Deputy is aware, the maximum establishment is now 8,500, the highest figure in the history of the State, and the extra rate of recruitment in the years mentioned in the early part of the question was to bring the numbers up to that establishment figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the urban areas there is a grave shortage of gardaí at the moment, a shortage compounded by the non-availability of overtime to the great bulk of the force and, in those circumstances, would the Minister consider increasing the maximum establishment because of the concern felt by so many citizens in regard to violence which has become almost endemic in most of the larger cities and urban areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to say there is a grave shortage of gardaí in large urban areas.  That does not represent the position.  Neither does the picture of large urban areas as places of endemic violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion that no overtime is the cause of any rise in the crime rate is not an accurate interpretation of the situation and I again take issue with his repetition of the alleged state of affairs in our larger cities.  They are not lawless areas and he is wrong to represent them as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from what the Minister has said that persons who complain about violence and vandalism in urban areas are, in his view, not telling the truth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said in reply to Deputy O'Malley was that it is wrong to represent our cities and urban areas as places suffering from endemic lawlessness and a high degree of crime.  It is wrong to present the situation as that.  Citizens are worried about the level of crime and the level here, as in every country in Western Europe, is on the increase, but very often the crime figures are not representative of serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vandalism and malicious damage are on the increase and there are outbreaks from time to time in various parts of the country and these have the effect of swelling the total crime figures.  What I want to prevent is any suggestion that law and order has broken down in our cities.  That is not the case.  It is far from the case.  As I said on numerous occasions, and recently in an adjournment debate here, the question of the overall strength of the Garda Síochána is kept under continuous review and, as I also indicated on numerous occasions here, the Garda at the moment are the subject of a survey by a team of management <Col N="478" /> consultants.  I expect to have their report in July or August and possibly a decision on the question of the overall strength will be taken at that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the views expressed, not only by civilians who live in the urban areas but also by the Garda, do not coincide with those just expressed by the Minister, can we take it that the Minister will at least when he gets the result of the survey, make an effort to restore the recruitment to the level at which it was in 1972?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any such instruction.  It might be useful information to Deputy Blaney to know that one of the reasons there are not as many gardaí as he would like in some areas is because of the necessity of having to send them along to the Border to deal with people for whom he assumed responsibility in the past.</P>

      <P>The sum of £11,000 mentioned in the question was not voted by the Dáil as a bloc grant to be paid as a matter of course to any organisation.  It is the sum which it was thought reasonable to provide in the Estimates for the current year to cover payments related to approved expenditure incurred or about to be incurred in the near future.</P>
      <P>A sum of £4,000 has already this year been paid to FLAC in Dublin, of which £2,000 was paid last week in response to an application supported by an estimate of requirements received earlier in the week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider such a review to be necessary even if it were practicable. As the Deputy will be aware, the <Col N="480" /> report comments favourably on the terms of a direction embodied in a decision of our Supreme Court in 1962 in regard to a warning to be given by the court of trial where the correctness of an identification is challenged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware from what I have read in the newspapers recently that there have been two cases where reviews were carried out because of subsequent evidence of dissatisfaction with the evidence of identification. The Deputy's question is in relation to this jurisdiction, and I would draw his attention to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <i>The People v. Casey</i> which lays down the procedures to be observed here and the procedures to be observed by a court with a jury in a case where identification is an issue.  That case was commented upon favourably in the Devlin Report to which the Deputy refers in his question.  As I indicated to the Deputy here last week, the two jurisdictions are broadly similar; they are not exactly similar and the problems of one are not necessarily the problems of the other.  The report in question will be studied in my Department, but it is a large and detailed report, and it would be too early at this stage to say whether any changes in law or procedure will follow as a result of that study.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Leader of the Opposition is aware that the practice in Private Members' Business is to nominate a motion which gets priority.  The Opposition have not done that within the prescribed time. Therefore, there is no motion with priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to challenge the veracity of what the Taoiseach says, but we did not nominate a motion for priority because a Government Deputy had already nominated motion No. 47 for priority; that being so, the Opposition did not do so.  Subsequently, on an <Col N="490" /> amendment being submitted by Opposition Deputies, the motion for priority was withdrawn.  In the circumstances, it was not possible for the Opposition to nominate in time a motion with the necessary priority.  At this stage I am looking for an indication from the Taoiseach as to what motion will be taken.  I understand that, in accordance with Standing Orders, some of the motions that are already standing in their respective places of priority would not be in order because, for example, in the health motions, they would be anticipating the debate on the Estimate.  My purpose in raising the question now is that various Members of the House have their names to different motions and it would be helpful if some indication were given of what motion is likely to be taken.</P>

      <P>I think the Leader of the Opposition may have been misinformed by someone on his own side in regard to the motion from a Government Deputy that he refers to.  It is true that there was a motion from a Government Deputy for which I requested priority, and I subsequently withdrew that request.  However, at that point the motion which the Opposition wished to have discussed today could not have been given priority because the motion itself was not in within ten days let alone the priority notice.  The plain fact is, if we can get away from the tap dancing on this subject, that the motion put in by the Government Deputy for which I requested priority was one which, but for the Opposition amendment, would not necessarily have resulted in a vote confrontation.</P>
      <P>The amendment was put in for the sole reason of forcing us to have a full team of Deputies here tomorrow night.  In those circumstances, I withdrew the priority nomination, but I still do not know what motion the Opposition propose to move.

However, agreement is not forthcoming in the circumstances of this week, as I have explained.  In the absence of agreement, the only way the Opposition can reach that motion is by making up their minds what they are going to do with the motions in front of it, and I have not been told what their intention is in that regard.

      <P>May I crave your indulgence, Sir, to raise a matter which is of vital and urgent importance to me and on which I can get no guidance other than what you may be able to offer.  The party political broadcasts start today and will continue for the rest of the week.  May I ask you how the discrimination, which is purely accidental, that is taking place in regard to this matter can be avoided, in that the party of which I am a member has a political broadcast tonight at 9.55 and tomorrow on the radio at 1.20, and we cannot use the caption of our party which is &ldquo;the Independent Fianna Fáil Republican Party&rdquo;.  That caption is refused because of some misinterpretation. This affects me and my constitutents; I think it is wrongly interpreted, and I do not know where to go to get anything done about it. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs does not seem to have anything to say; the Minister for Local Government has no control in this matter.  Let me say in fairness to the people at Montrose that what I am complaining of is not being done by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that the Minister for Health would be present but unfortunately he is not, once again.  Last Thursday I made a personal appeal to the Minister about a matter relating to County Cork and on that occasion I expressed my regret that neither he nor his Parliamentary Secretary were present.  The matter about which I am concerned is a complicated one and I shall address myself to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who is present in the hope that he will convey my sentiments to his colleague.</P>
      <P>When the Health Act, 1970, came into force the Health Advisory Committee to the Southern Committee of Cork County Council was abolished despite many requests, appeals and demands by myself and all of my colleagues irrespective of their political persuasion.  All of us appealed to the then Minister for Health, the late Mr. Childers, and to the present Minister, on very many occasions to have this body reconstituted but our efforts were to no avail.  The appeals were made by way of deputation, by resolution to the Cork County Council and by way of resolution from the Southern Committee.  I also raised the matter in the House in parliamentary questions and I took up the matter with the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary, whom I am glad to see is now present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was party to what was probably the first appeal to the Minister's predecessor requesting him to have the advisory health committee reconstituted and reinstated but all the appeals fell on deaf ears.  I am now repeating my appeal once again and I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will convey my sentiments, which I am sure are shared by him, to the Minister and that he will at last accede to this request on the part of public representatives from that part of County <Col N="495" /> Cork.  I might add that the Minister's predecessor was adamant in his refusal. One of the reasons he gave for not reinstating this body was that, in conjunction with members of the Cork Corporation, the committee would be too large and unwieldy. I would point out to the House, and particularly to the Parliamentary Secretary, that I and my colleagues in the southern health area feel very strongly about this matter.  If the Minister fully examines the position he will appreciate the enormity of the injustice being done not only to the public representatives in question but also to the people whom they represent.</P>
    <P>The effect of the decision is that both the public representatives and the people are completely disenfranchised and have no say, good, bad or indifferent in health matters.  The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary in former years were public representatives at a lower level and they know that health matters constitute the greater and most important part of the work and responsibilities of a public representatives, whether he is a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or is a member of a county council.  Public representatives have to deal with matters such as admissions to hospitals, medical cards and hospital bills.  Unlike matters such as housing, water and sewerage schemes health problems keep recurring.  When a housing or sewerage scheme is completed that is usually the end of the matter but health problems multiply over the years.  Such problems will always be with us and for that reason it is inequitable&mdash;in fact, iniquitous&mdash; that the representatives on the southern committee of the Cork County Council should be cut off and have no say whatever.</P>
    <P>I should like to state that the area served by that committee is the most populous and progressive area outside Dublin.  It covers six large towns&mdash; Cobh, Youghal and Midleton, on the east side, and Bandon, Kinsale and Macroom on the west side.  There is a hospital in each of those towns.  It is wrong that the representatives of that <Col N="496" /> area should have as much say in the running of those hospitals as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We have no access to the officials who administer those hospitals.  In addition, bordering on this area there is the mental hospital on the Lee Road and the auxiliary mental hospital in Youghal.  Just outside the southern area there is one of the biggest hospitals in the south at Sarsfield Court.  It is a complete denial and a travesty of democracy that representatives for that area have no say in the running of those hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is a sizeable industry in all the towns I have mentioned and it is expected that this area will become more important in the future.  If there is to be any major development in any part of the country in the next few years it will be in that area.  I should also like to mention that there is no public representatives from the Midleton electoral area on the Southern Health Board.  We are completely cut off.  I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of the people of that area, to reconstitute an advisory health committee for that area.  At present we do not know the officials who deal with health matters for the area.  Those officials ignore us when we make requests to them because they know we have no comeback.  They can afford to ignore us.  I am sure that when the Minister realises the grave injustice that is being done to the people of that area he will reconstitute that health board.</P>
    <P>On Thursday last I appealed for the provision of an ambulance for Cobh and I wish to repeat that today.  I have made repeated demands for such an ambulance to the Minister and the Southern Health Board, but those demands have fallen on deaf ears.  The excellent case made by a deputation who met the Minister was also ignored. Cobh is an isolated town and is cut off.  It is not easy of access and it is easy for a strange driver to get lost in the district.  That occurred recently when the ambulance driver from Midleton spent half an hour looking for directions.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when dealing with the question of excessive drinking, dismissed it with a couple of words saying <Col N="497" /> that the campaign against excessive drinking was being continued.  I am sure the Minister knows that excessive drinking and alcoholism represents probably the greatest single evil we have.  It is primarily a matter for the Minister and his advisers to face this problem, but they have not done so. It is not so much the excessive drinking as the attendant evils which flow from it: the spin-off evils are very numerous, assaults, robberies, sexual crimes of all kinds.  You can attribute practically 90 per cent of all crime, I submit, directly or indirectly to excessive drinking.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to face up to this problem in a serious and realistic manner.  I also appeal to him to consider seriously my requests regarding the advisory health committees and to rectify a situation which is inequitable and completely wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been going on for some time and many aspects of health have already been dealt with.  The Minister's brief was very comprehensive and his statistics informative.  Whatever shortage of money there may be in the Department nobody can deny that the Minister has a compassionate mind.  Those with the best interests of the health service at heart, regardless of the side of the House to which they belong would not deny the compliment to the Minister that he has high motives.  There are aspects of the Department's work which I could criticise, I suppose any other Deputy could, but I hope in doing that also to express some constructive ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other night I looked through the report of the Irish Hospitals Trust and also, in a very cursory manner through Dr. Hensey's very informative book on the health system.  I was very edified in glancing through the Irish Hospitals Trust booklet to see the progress we had made by means of funds provided by Irish Hospitals Trust since its foundation.  When it comes to discussing health there is not sufficient reference to this side of the subject because, without doubt, a large number of our voluntary hospitals would already be closed if they were solely <Col N="498" /> dependent on patients' fees and on the State.  Funds provided by the Irish Hospitals Trust have been the means of keeping hospitalisation to the fore. We are always highly critical of our hospitals, sometimes of the staff and sometimes of the manpower in health, but we are not always so ready to extend to those who work in hospitals the praise I believe is rightly due to them.</P>
    <P>The total Vote for Health is roughly £250 million which is an enormous amount of money when one considers that even at the present time a person who controls £1 million is known as a millionaire.  This should bring home to people the colossal expenditure on health.  I suppose this is the case because health is a very large employer of manpower.  It is a labour intensive organisation and when labour costs increase even slightly this is reflected in increased health expenditure. As politicians we differ in our approach on the methods of providing those moneys.  The first time the Minister said that he hoped to be able, at some stage, to provide a free health service I said that he would never be able to do it, that we would not be able to raise the necessary finance.  I shall return to this subject when I refer later to a scheme recently proposed by the medical profession for a health insurance scheme.  We have a voluntary health insurance scheme but they have come up with the idea of a compulsory scheme to which I shall return later.</P>
    <P>Reviewing the health system in general from the Famine onwards, one can see the terrible problems encountered and, bad as the poor law system which brought us up to the beginning of this century was, it had certain good features.  Like the curate's egg, it had good and bad spots.  I want to make the point that the Irish Hospitals Trust have provided £109 million towards hospital improvement since its foundation in the thirties towards the betterment of hospitals.  That is an enormous investment and an enormous amount of money, and I think it made us hospital-minded and brought us up to the stage when led by the Department of <Col N="499" /> Health, we could consider the betterment of our hospital system in general.</P>
    <P>I do not want to name the institutions in Dublin which improved standards by means of funds from the Irish Hospitals Trust, but there is hardly a hospital in Dublin or outside that did not share the allocation of those funds.  Some of our hospitals, the very oldest of them which we have preserved, shall we say, today present a very pleasing picture, not merely from the medical end but also from the architectural point of view. Admittedly some of them could be vastly improved by the investment of more funds, more medical appliances and so on.  However, is it not grand to be able to say that we have hospitals which were built in the 17th century and which are going strong today?  I pose the question to this House that, but for this constant income down the years, where would some of our leading hospitals be today?</P>
    <P>Regarding this total of £109 million, this was raised not merely in relation to hospitals but in relation to foreign earnings by the Irish Hospitals Trust and by the activities of the Irish Hospitals Trust from an employer's point of view.  I want to refer to this very pointedly in relation to foreign earnings.  The Irish Hospitals Trust is a large employer of labour and to this extent provides a very useful service to the community.  Those are a few points which, even at this late stage, should be made in recognition of the work done down the years by the Irish Hospitals Trust.</P>
    <P>I come to other matters related to health and I want to deal very briefly with an argument which is going on in my own constituency in regard to hospitalisation.  As I said, long before we were able as an organisation, either local or central, to provide sufficient funds for capital development in hospitals we had this aid by moneys raised by the Irish Hospitals Trust which led us on to the stage about 1968 when the book known as the brown book on hospitalisation was published.  As those of us who acted on the Select Committee on Health in the early <Col N="500" /> 1960s are aware&mdash;and I think the Minister for Health was one of the personnel of that committee then&mdash; most of the recommendations made by the FitzGerald Council, or Committee as it was called at that time, sprang from the ramifications of that Select Committee on Health which was assembled away back in the early 1960s.  Regrettably the report of that committee was never published or laid before the House, nor were the public ever made aware fully of the content of the report of that committee.  I would say in all there were over 60 meetings of it held and I attended nearly all of the 60.  I improved considerably my education regarding medical matters, and I was hopeful at that time that something very special would emerge from that all-party committee.  Nothing emerged at that stage, but in 1968 the FitzGerald Committee presented this report, a report by 18 doctors, some of them surgeons, more of them physicians, some of them on a county basis, more on a regional basis and from voluntary hospitals.  The committee was chaired by Doctor Patrick FitzGerald, at that time head surgeon at St. Vincent's Hospital.  The report proposed, and I think rightly so in view of the fact that county boundaries were no longer able to contain units which would serve the higher interest of medicine, especially from a surgical point of view, that the hospitals of the future should be constructed on a regional basis, and I think at that stage it set out the concentration of 12 areas for hospitalisation.  That was all very well. The report was accepted by the Government. Regrettably, in the interval the moneys necessary for investment in large-scale hospitalisation were not readily available.</P>
    <P>At any rate I come to the point where the present Tánaiste and Minister for Health asked Comhairle na n-Ospidéal to consider some amendment of the FitzGerald Report on the grounds that some parts of it, while logical, might not be easily accomplished from a practical point of view. He therefore asked the Comhairle to set out guidelines for the regions, which were disagreed, mainly on the locations or the proposed locations of <Col N="501" /> some of those hospitals.  At any rate, in regard to the Midland Health Board the Minister published his report on 21st October, 1975, and he called it the general hospital development plan.  In that he set out very briefly certain ideas which would suit the Midland Health Board when it came to hospitalisation.  The House will be aware that we have had various arguments, even on the floor of this House, regarding the provision of hospitalisation for the county of Longford and we had what developed into an argument here between a former Minister for Health and myself on this issue.  Longford County could not afford a modern scale hospital. The county boundaries are too small and the money necessary to build such a unit would not be easily forthcoming.  Therefore, we have always looked to our neighbouring county, Westmeath and the hospital located in Mullingar as a means of providing a surgical service for the County of Longford.  Towards that end the Midland Health Board set up a working party to consider the Minister's proposal.  The Minister's proposal was that instead of one large scale hospital we have at least two. The large scale hospital thought of at the time was one in Tullamore which was mentioned only in passing in the FitzGerald Report.  In the nature of things, Mullingar entered the picture as a large county hospital and the only surgical one on the road between Sligo and Dublin.  At the other end of the scale Portlaoise came into the picture as being the largest hospital providing surgery facilities between Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Midlands Health Board held a series of meetings on the matter, studied the Minister's plan and the plan put forward by their own representatives. In that context the health board came up with the idea of upgrading the hospitals in Mullingar and Portlaoise.  The conditions laid down then were that there would be two minimum scale surgical hospitals in each of those areas.  It was visualised that Mullingar Hospital, if upgraded and extended, should be able to provide the necessary beds for Longford.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> That was a scheme of which our county health committee approved as did also the committees for Westmeath and Laois.  At a meeting of the Midland Health Board previous plans were rescinded and the new plan adopted by a three-to-one vote.  That was done on the grounds of it being in the best interests of the patients. The old plan provided that no patient should be more than sixty miles from a fairly large hospital.  The new plan provided that no patient be further than 30 miles from a reasonably good hospital and the board, on the advice of its committees, so decided.</P>
    <P>It is now being contended by certain people who write to local newspapers that there is some rethinking taking place in respect of this matter, not at ministerial level, but that certain politicians are alleged to have said that there should be one hospital only in the area and that that should be located in Tullamore.  I want to say straightaway on the floor of this House, that I do not see any Minister rescinding a decision arrived at by a health board, representing approximately 100,000 people spread over the midlands, on the advice of its representatives from every corner of that region. I do not see any Minister for Health putting any pressure on any health board to rescind a motion of that kind, be he past, present or future.  That is a decision arrived at in a purely democratic fashion, based on the best possible demographic and medical opinion and designed to cater for the highest interests in medicine, which is what we are after.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would say to those people engaged in trying to promote a controversy between the various interests in the Midlands to stop writing to newspapers but rather to inform themselves fully of the facts and progress from there.  Health cannot always be made a political football.  It should not be a political football.  We, as representatives in this House, should be careful, whether at local or central level, not to make a political football of health.  Health is too precious to the community to be brought down to that level&mdash;that it be kicked around and that people, by abusing one another, hope to gain something from <Col N="503" /> it.  I am sure that everybody in the Midlands who has the best interests not merely of surgery but all other medical matters at heart would agree with the decision of the health board. That does not mean that there should be downgrading of any hospital but rather an upgrading.  Were the hospitals mentioned in a position to cater for the requisite number of patients, we would be progressing fairly well.</P>
    <P>I was reading the <i>Medical Times</i> some time ago.  My reading is somewhat sketchy, but, at any rate, I noticed a tendency on behalf of general practitioners to send nearly all of their maternity patients to hospitals rather than nursing homes.  I wondered about this matter and I asked one or two doctors who came up with the old chestnut that the patient is much safer in a hospital.  I do not contend that point but I am contending that hospital beds are scarce and dear.  Perhaps I might ask the Minister why this sudden change in the system because I think it is a sudden change.  Early on we were asked to subscribe to the view that the service should provide first-class maternity homes and, to that end, various communities of nuns and others invested heavily in nursing homes to find now that their capacity is not being taken up.  At the same time, in the course of the last six or seven months, I have come across patients awaiting elective surgery for anything up to eleven months because they could not get beds.  The administration seems to be somewhat out of joint or, perhaps, there is abuse at some level.</P>
    <P>I read in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in 1970 about a doctor aged 85 years who got the blue ribband of the year in England.  He was interviewed on the BBC and was asked to explain why he qualified for the blue ribband. He was a very humble man and was very learned.  He said he lived in one of the shires and that he knew all his patients.  He also said: &ldquo;I knew their fathers and mothers and in a good deal of cases their grandfathers and grandmothers.&rdquo;  He also told his interviewer: &ldquo;I may not, in that case, have needed as much pathology as other medical practitioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> Are some of the doctors inclined to get away from their patients instead of getting near them?  We believe that a doctor should follow his patient through the nursing home and if consultation is required it is available. Why have we now the switch to hospitalisation when beds are scarce?  I will not delay long on this because I am not as well informed as I would like to be.  That is the reason I ask: why have we under-utilisation of capacity in nursing homes?  The people in charge of those homes have invested heavily to provide a very necessary service not merely to one section of the community but to humanity as well.  It is a pity, when we have overloading in hospitals, that we have under-utilisation of nursing homes.</P>
    <P>We have much less money this year for medical research.  Everybody knows that, no matter how much money is provided, we will never be able to provide enough.  However, when we have inflation it is a pity that we should have to have less money available for research.  We are not like other countries because we have not any great share of private wealth to endow the various institutions engaging in research.  It is a pity that we should have to trim our sails in relation to research.  Medical research is a fact finding service in the interest of humanity and deserves the very highest praise and encouragement.</P>
    <P>Eligibility for general medical services is a great bone of contention to many people.  It is all very fine to say: &ldquo;We will raise the level of eligibility from £2,250 to £3,000&rdquo;, but if we have not the organisation provided to meet a change like that there is no point in doing it.  Several statements about the raising of eligibility were made in recent years.  They are not getting us anywhere because there is not enough money available to provide the service we have in mind.</P>
    <P>A great step in health in recent years is the reduction of the mortality rate especially in infant care and also the elimination of some of the more serious and more deadly killer diseases. It is regrettable, in relation to cancer, that we are not making greater in-roads towards cutting down this <Col N="505" /> deadly disease.  Every unfortunate patient who enters a hospital dreads this disease.  I should like to pay a tribute to the agencies dealing with cancer, especially the Cancer Society and hospitals like St. Luke's and Hume Street who are doing such wonderful work which deserves very high praise from everybody.</P>
    <P>We are heavily committed to geriatric care in all counties at the moment.  There are various units in every county for the treatment of geriatrics, which can be very costly. However, when one looks at the aged and the fact that we are living longer one must also realise that people become geriatrics at an earlier age than 15 or 20 years ago due to the higher standards of living, less activity and so forth.  The rate of progress in caring for the aged at home and in institutions is good.  I want to pay a special tribute to religious organisations, whether they be Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of Charity, French Sisters of Charity, or from whatever order they come.  Were it not for the investment which those religious organisations put into health we would not be able to do half the work we do in regard to care of the aged.  Many of those Sisters who entered the nursing profession put back into the service a great deal more than their salaries in looking after the older people in the community.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we have made good progress in preventive medicine. The levels of social welfare are losing the race with inflation.  The aim of social welfare was to provide care for those who needed it.  That is being done now.  It is admitted at local level that there is no one in the country in need of either food or shelter.  It is also admitted that in some cases some of these services are abused.  In the nature of things that is bound to happen.</P>
    <P>The more we do for preventive medicine the better.  This will save money in other directions, for example if we can keep people who are mobile in their own homes.  It is easier for them to be comfortable at home than in an institution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> Regrettably there are too many such people in institutions but that springs from another problem which I will not go into here.  Due to the previous movement of people through emigration, we are left with the residue of an aging population, with more geriatrics and with more people to cater for.  If the health bill is heavy in that regard, let us not complain but try to shoulder it.  In good or bad times, we should try to help those people in a practical way.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred very briefly to the cost of providing and servicing medicine.  This brings us back to the old chestnut, whether we will ever be able to provide a completely free health service for all people.  I do not think we will ever reach that stage, which is a pity.  It is bad enough to be sick, but it is twice as bad to have to start worrying about what you will be charged for the service and what you will have to pay to get well. This brings us to the burning question of what would be the best plan. Will it be an insurance plan, part State and part insurance, or a voluntary plan, and so on?</P>
    <P>The voluntary health scheme works very well here.  Anybody who knows anything about health knows this to be true.  The voluntary health organisation have been run at a very low cost. All the contributions have gone to the betterment of the patient who needs treatment.  In this way, we have come to recognise that there is something very genuine in a voluntary effort.  You do not have to drive people there; they go themselves.  They go in whatever direction suits them.  They will invest in voluntary health if they think they will be adequately covered. The numbers in voluntary health, although, regrettably, not high in relation to our total population, indicate that that organisation is providing a good service.</P>
    <P>I did not have time to study the plan the doctors put to the Minister for health coverage.  They had in mind something along the voluntary health scheme coupled with the State spear-heading such a campaign.  I wonder if that would succeed.  If one looks at the British scheme one will see <Col N="507" /> that, while it was a humane aim, it could very quickly wind up draining the Exchequer.  It would be a praiseworthy move if the opinion of the experts in the Department of Health was sought&mdash;I have no doubt they have all the statistical information they require so that they could evaluate the doctors' plan and have it distributed to the Members of this House, members of health boards and so on.  We would then see the proposals and have dialogue on them.</P>
    <P>I have tried to convince young people starting out of the desirability of joining the vountary health scheme in case their children get sick.  I am speaking now of people who are outside the scope of the general medical services scheme.  I am not speaking of hospitalisation, but of the general medical services scheme.  It is often said that there should be preventive medicine as well as in- or out-patient medicine.  It is a boon to a family to know that if a member falls sick he will be fully covered and immunised against financial hardship.</P>
    <P>I should like to have had more time to study the Minister's statistical information. Regrettably I did not and, therefore, must confine myself to the few matters I mentioned.  The Health Vote of £250 million is enormous and 75 to 80 per cent of that amount goes on hospitalisation.  This makes it more important than ever that the question of hospitalisation be restudied.  If we come up with a plan we should try to put money behind the plan to make it operative.  The Midland Health Board have come up with a plan for hospitalisation and I request the Minister to put the money behind the plan to make it a reality.</P>

      <P>In times of a recession the areas which are inclined to suffer from scarcity of finance are those which we are dealing with in this Estimate, that is, the extension of the health services.  When it comes to paying for these services we are all inclined to the view that they can be done without for a few months or a few years.  The Minister is to be complimented in that he has resisted this tendency in his Department since he <Col N="508" /> has taken over.  It is accepted that the recession which hit the western world, the United States and the whole of the EEC after the war in the Middle East in 1973 which resulted in the huge increase in the cost of fuel brought a great deal of problems to the extension of the budgets of all the countries in the western world, and into the continuance of the standards of living which they have become accustomed to in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister's achievements in his Department during this difficult period have been very worth while.  If one were to look only at the newspapers it would appear that the health services in this country were going in reverse rather than progressing very satisfactorily through that period of recession.  If one were to look at it in terms of money alone, the increased expenditure during the past three years on the health services speaks for itself.  The Minister has given every possible fact and figure available which anyone would require to make an assessment of the activities of his Department.  In 1972 a total of £107.4 million was spent on the non-capital expenditure on health and since then this Estimate has risen to £262 million, an increase of 144 per cent in money terms.  Taking into account inflation, which has dogged the western democracies in the last few years, there is still a 16 per cent increase in real terms, made possible by the Minister.  This is the only real answer that one could give to critics of the Department.  Extensions have taken place in many areas of the health services over the last two years. Employment in the health service in 1972-73 has increased by 4,000.  This is very worth while at a time when unemployment figures have expanded. People who are sick obviously are getting a better service now because of the extra number of people working in the health service.  Medical card holders have also increased substantially in the last few years.  Twenty-eight per cent of the population were covered by medical cards three years ago and this figure has now increased to 36 per cent.  That indicates the marked improvement that has taken place since the Minister took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> The list of illnesses for which drugs and medicines free of charge are provided for patients has also increased. It has been extended to include Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and acute leukemia in children.  These may not cover very many people but, nevertheless, for families which have a member suffering from any of these diseases this extension is of great benefit. Another important improvement is in the constant care allowance for handicapped children which was introduced at £25 a month regardless of the income of the family.  A person who has a handicapped child in the family may find it a very heavy drain on his financial resources irrespective of the size of the income and, therefore this improvement is very worth while.  There has also been an improvement in the disabled persons maintenance allowance and the fact that eligibility for this money has changed whereby only the income of the parents of a disabled person is taken into account is a welcome improvement and has led to an increase in the number of people getting this benefit.  The number some years ago stood at about 25,000 and this has improved by about 2,000 to 3,000 in the meantime.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas in which the Department have improved the situation and which the Minister considered suitable for improvement. Financial support has been provided for the establishment of a network of community advice centres.  They are essential.  The amount of legislation introduced in recent years makes it necessary that not only public representatives should be available to the public to tell them what their entitlements are.  It is only fair that this should be done also by officers from the Department and trained personnel. Many people are not near enough to a TD or on principle will not go to a member of a political party who may not be of their own political persuasion, and they may be missing out on some necessary advice on health matters.  That goes for other areas too. such as local government and social welfare.  These community advice centres are a great step forward.  I <Col N="510" /> hope they will be extended as quickly as possible into areas where they are not available at present.</P>
    <P>Training facilities for the handicapped have also been improved.  The EEC Social Fund has been made use of by the Department.  Claims on that fund are made continuously.  Those of us who hold a dual mandate and are representatives in the European Parliament have made our demands that the Social Fund should be vastly improved so that facilities for training the handicapped can be stepped up and grants improved.  In a report on the social situation in the Community for 1974 which I submitted last year, I stressed the need for a considerable extension of the Social Fund so that worth-while activities could be undertaken in Community countries.  I believe a considerable improvement will be seen this year in the amount of money available in the Social Fund to finance schemes sent in not only from the Department of Health but also the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I thought it only fair that I should list some of the improvements in the Minister's Department.  Too often we read about the things people think should be happening and which are not happening.  It is useful to be positive on occasion and to remind the public what has happened over the past few years.  Everybody will agree the extensions in the activities of the Department which I have mentioned and many which I have not mentioned, have been useful and worth while.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister invited Members of the House to discuss the operations of the health boards.  The first Bill I took any part in when I came into this House was the Bill setting up the health boards, now the 1970 Health Act.  On that occasion I was critical of the areas covered by the various health boards.  I considered that they were ill-devised and I maintain that opinion today.  I am in the Eastern Health Board area. County Wicklow and County Kildare are an adjunct to the Dublin area and form the biggest health board area, by population if not by size.  This year almost £40 million will be spent by <Col N="511" /> that health board which is almost the equivalent of the Estimates introduced for certain Departments under ministerial direction.</P>
    <P>At the time I was not satisfied that the proper balance was given on the boards to elected representatives. I am dissatisfied now with the number of elected representatives on these boards.  To have only three public representatives from County Wicklow on a board of almost 40 is not enough to represent that county and its health needs.  At the selection of those three representatives in Wicklow, with the connivance of the Fianna Fáil members of the council and the Sinn Féin member, Seamus Costello, the health board was deprived of representation from the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party. Well over 50 per cent of the votes cast in the county council elections were cast for those two parties.  Because of the system of selection under the Health Act, 1970, the people who voted for those parties and who wished their representatives to represent them on the Eastern Health Board were denied their representatives.  Wicklow County traditionally has had one representative from the Labour Party and one from the Fine Gael Party returned at successive general elections. County council membership has been at least 50 per cent and in some cases in excess of 50 per cent.  Now those parties have no member on the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister takes a look at the operations of the health boards he will look particularly at the method of selection of members and change it so that the spirit of the Act, which was intended to give representation of the major political persuasions, will be upheld, and the method of selection tightened up to ensure the connivance which took place in Wicklow will not take place again. Joining a relative agricultural county like Wicklow to an urban and city county like Dublin has not helped the operation of the health services in Wicklow.  Anybody who had anything to do with the health board in Wicklow <Col N="512" /> will find the service has deteriorated over the past few years.  The health board offices in Wicklow town are contained in one small, dingy room in the county council office.  The section dealing with medical cards, and so on, is located some half a mile away in another office in a street which is almost inaccessible to pedestrian or vehicle traffic.  This type of setup which has existed for several years will continue for an indeterminate period, it would appear.  I hope the proposed offices which have been talked about by the health board for the Wicklow area will soon be provided.</P>
    <P>This whole debate has gone on for the past year and when one raises the issue at advisory meetings he is told that the problem is lack of money.  Included in a proposal from the Eastern Health Board to the Department was a condition regarding the provision of offices for the health board in Wicklow town together with the provision of extra space at St. Colman's Hospital in Rathdrum and the closure of almost all the Wicklow hospitals.  It was conditional on the closing of Wicklow hospital that patients be removed from Wicklow to the new extension in Rathdrum and that the vacated areas in Wicklow hospital be used as offices for the health board. However, this proposal from the health board did not comply with the wishes of the people of Wicklow, who had not been consulted about the proposal at any stage.  Recently I made representations to the Minister in this regard and he accepted the need for a continuance of the Wicklow hospital and agreed that the provision of offices should not be made conditional on the closing of the hospital.  I trust that within the next year this ridiculous position of the health board will not be persisted in for the purpose of providing the administration of the health services in Wicklow town and county.</P>
    <P>The operation of the advisory health board is of little benefit in this whole area because by the time we meet every two months reports are out of date and decisions have been taken already at the Eastern Health Board offices in Dublin.  This situation <Col N="513" /> can be illustrated by the appointment recently of a doctor in a Wicklow town, although nobody in that area was consulted in regard to the appointment.  There was no consultation either with the advisory health boards or with public representatives in the area.  The person appointed is an excellent doctor but there were several people interested in the appointment all of whom were well qualified for it.  I am merely illustrating the method by which these decisions are taken, a method which allows for the bypassing of public representatives and others concerned.  When the Minister is again considering the operation of the health boards, I trust he will realise the need for a return to the system of advice and discussion with local representatives in regard to appointments rather than to have the method by which people are nominated because they have a particular interest in a certain area.  The concept of local democracy in this field of the health board's activities should be returned to and expanded.</P>
    <P>Recently a deputation from Wicklow visited the Minister on the question of the provision of a hospital for the Arklow area.  A very good case can be made in this regard because, as the deputation pointed out to the Minister, very many of the industries located in that area involve a high risk element.  For example, there is the importation of such highly inflammable material as sulphur to the NET factory, the high octane fuels to the Jet Oil station and the domestic gases which are bottled and distributed in the area.  In this situation there is always the possibility of an accident which could have serious effects for the whole area and which would require extensive medical facilities.  However, the guidelines set out in the FitzGerald Report did not leave it possible to agree to our suggestion but we are happy that the Department have agreed to the provision at Arklow of a health centre which will provide a proper ambulance service for the area and also an accident service which, hopefully, will be sufficient to meet requirements in the event of any calamity in the area. <Col N="514" /> It is hoped that the centre will be completed early next year.  On a recent visit I noticed that the work is progressing.  The centre should meet most of the demands made by the deputation.</P>
    <P>While on that deputation I raised the question of the necessity of an expansion of the ambulance service in a county such as Wicklow in which there are many areas that are practically inaccessible.  In order to be able to move patients at short notice it is necessary to have an adequate ambulance service.  A survey in this regard was carried out recently in Wicklow and we hope that the results will be made known soon and that the necessary radio equipment will be provided in order to render the ambulance service fully operational even in the most remote parts of the county.  At this time of year all parts of Wicklow are beautiful but the story is different during the long days of winter in so far as travel is concerned.  That is why there is a need for this extended ambulance service and for the provision of highly-trained personnel to man the ambulances because in many instances patients have to be treated on the spot before being removed.  I trust that the extension of this service will not be delayed.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the disabled persons maintenance allowance is of particular benefit to those families who have mentally-handicapped adults. These persons are likely to have parents who are elderly and who are endeavouring to cope with the difficult situation of having a mentally-retarded person in the family.  Very often they may require assistance from neighbours and friends and in this regard the provision of extra finance will be very helpful.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister would be inclined to agree that the facilities provided for the adult mentally handicapped are inadequate.  In many instances such persons are placed in establishments which were never intended to cater for them and which can do little for their improvement. Special centres should be provided for these people.  However, at a time when there is a shortage of <Col N="515" /> money, it may be thinking in the long term to seek such centres but it is wise to demand that these people are not forgotten and that the improvements which have been made in the last few years will extend to the provision of centres for their specific needs.</P>
    <P>One part of the Minister's speech dealt with the activity of the Dublin Itinerant Settlement Committee.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Through the initiative of the Dublin Itinerant Settlement Committee, and the support of the Department of Local Government and the Eastern Health Board, arrangements have been made for the provision of accommodation at Newtownmountkennedy for 17 travelling children in need of residential care.  This is an admirable undertaking and deserves our full support.  The Eastern Health Board have recently had discussions with representatives of the committee regarding the future arrangements for the management of the accommodation and the continued support of the children during this year.  I have every reason to believe that mutually satisfactory arrangements will emerge from these discussions.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with the gentleman who runs the home in Newtownmountkennedy and I am satisfied that the Minister's statement is in accordance with the facts. There are 17 children in the home but I am not satisfied that all 17 are getting assistance.  I have been told that only six of the children are getting assistance.  My information is not as recent as I would like it to be &mdash;it is two months' old&mdash;but I have been told that the other children are being kept there through voluntary subscriptions.  I hope the Minister will inquire into this matter and ensure that assistance will be extended to all the children.  The setting up of this type of home has met with difficulty in certain areas in Dublin.  I should like to pay tribute to the schools in the Newtownmountkennedy area for accepting these children.  There is <Col N="516" /> room in the area for the setting up of another home but unfortunately there is a shortage of money.  Many of the children being cared for in this home have spent a long time on the streets of Dublin.  Some of them have had so many convictions in the courts that as soon as they appear before the judges they are dismissed.</P>
    <P>On 16th June the EEC directive on doctors was adopted.  It provides for the recognition of degrees and diplomas throughout the community. It also lays down regulations for the free movement of doctors throughout the community and deals with the maintenance of minimum standards of medical training.  I heard of a lady doctor who applied for a post in a hospital in Luxembourg and was refused because she did not know the local language.  Although she was qualified for the job her application was refused because she did not know French or Luxembourgese, which is a German dialect.  She appealed to the commission but they had difficulty in making the hospital accept her application.  However, representations were made to the Luxembourg Minister for Health and she was eventually given the job.  I hope this excuse will not be used to prevent qualified persons from getting jobs in EEC countries because of the surplus in the medical profession in some countries.  I am glad to note that the recognition of nursing diplomas is being considered and that the Minister has set up a working party. Since this working party was set up in the early part of 1975 they have reported to the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is high time some action was taken by the Commission in regard to the adoption of a directive on nurses' diplomas.  I have tabled an oral question for the European Parliament meeting next week asking what progress the Commission have made in regard to a decision on the working party's recommendations.  I hope this question will get us some answer as to when nursing diplomas will be recognised throughout the Community. I hope also to discover if there is any prospect of retropsective recognition for people who have been <Col N="517" /> working in England and elsewhere throughout the Community and who come back home and whether their years spent abroad will be recognised for pension purposes.  I hope the Department will bring pressure to bear on the Commission and that the Council of Ministers will demand that the Commission produce a resolution for adoption.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned a particular area and I should like to join with them.  It is in regard to the number of deaths from motor accidents.  This matter also involves the Department of Local Government from the point of view of regulations, into which a very strong health element enters.  Statistics given by the Department are alarming.  They show that in 1963 the number of deaths from road accidents was 286 and the latest figures available, for 1974, shows that in that year 562 people were killed on the roads, an increase of almost 100 per cent in 13 years.  The motoring population have not expanded by anything like that percentage. This is an area of great concern and the figures show that in the coming year at least 500 more people will die on the roads, or perhaps as many as 600.</P>
    <P>In the last few days I attended funerals of two such victims.  Without attempting to lay blame in any specific area, this is a matter which must be looked at urgently by both the Ministers for Local Government and Health.  Road deaths are taken for granted until they affect a person's own family and then we begin to look at them more closely.  Up to a few years ago newspapers, particularly local journals, gave banner headlines to highlight road deaths.  Now they are pushed into the back page of even the local newspapers.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the driving test should be looked into, that people's general health should be checked before they are given a driving licence&mdash;that the whole driving population should be asked to undergo medical examination. Eyesight tests are particularly necessary.  It may seem frivolous to say that certain motorists cannot see at all, but this seems to be the case. Many motorists either do not see or <Col N="518" /> do not bother to see road markings. It is for those reasons that I suggest there should be an eyesight test.  I repeat that I think all licensed drivers should be made to undergo a medical test.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a reasoned case for the raising of limited eligibility qualifications for the health service for non-manual workers.  Everybody in the House should be in agreement with the Minister's argument.  The figure of £3,000 is not exhorbitant and, as the Minister said, it will bring back into the health services about 85,000 people who had lost eligibility. It would be unfair to exclude such a large number of people, particularly when we consider the toll inflation has taken of money values.  There is a need to update considerably the 1972 figure which was £2,250.  It is only logical that those earning £3,000 should be included and I hope there will be agreement on it fairly soon.</P>
    <P>There is a small paragraph in the Minister's speech, at page 37, in regard to parents' attitudes to vaccination, particularly the three-in-one vaccination. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I can understand that parents may have misgivings about this vaccination when they read of cases of brain-damage to children alleged to have been caused by the pertussis element in the vaccine but these parents should also consider that there is no substantiated medical evidence to prove these allegations. The medical profession are well aware of the known contra-indications to vaccination and where no such contra-indications exist vaccination is still recommended as an extremely effective tool against whooping cough and the other diseases I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am glad he said that because certain parents have doubts that brain damage can result from vaccination. There have been radio programmes on the subject here and on the BBC. The parents in Britain have formed an association.  They claim evidence to support that brain damage has resulted from vaccination and they have been demanding assistance from the Ministry of Health and Social Services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> I would hope that the Minister would ensure that if, as he says, there is no danger, this will be clearly indicated to all parents of small children because there are widespread misgivings as a result of the publicity given to certain people who honestly believe brain damage has resulted from vaccination. I hope the Minister will make an all-out effort to get the message across because parents of small children are very worried indeed.  Radio was used to put across this particular idea and it should be used again now by an expert on the subject to reassure parents that there is no danger.</P>
    <P>We have, as I said, the very extensive brief of the Minister and all the statistical information supplied with it. I believe we are all very appreciative of the Minister's work in these difficult times.  Members are well aware of the need to extend our health services and they are also well aware of the limitations because of the scarcity of money due to inflation.  Each year more money is required to keep the services going.  The Minister, his officials and all engaged in administering the health services deserve our congratulations for maintaining the high standards they have maintained.  The people in the area I represent are reasonably satisfied with the operation of the health services.  Naturally everybody wants to see an extension of these services and everybody wants to see improvements and I trust the Minister will find some way to make the few improvements I have suggested in the health services in my area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, as the last speaker said, a very extensive brief from the Minister, so extensive it would be impossible to comment on all aspects covered by it.  I will deal with those areas of vital importance. Forward planning is important and forward planning is not possible without fairly full information as to what moneys will be available for developments. The health boards have no really concrete information with regard to the amount of money that will be available over the years immediately ahead.  They can assume money will be available but they cannot <Col N="520" /> assume all the necessary finance will be available for desirable developments and so they cannot plan.  They are disadvantaged and forward planning is just not on.</P>
      <P>A proper health service is of vital importance and no one objects to spending money on such a service provided the expenditure will benefit the community as a whole.  The cost of the health services continues to rise and will obviously go on rising.  There are two questions we must ask ourselves. Are the people benefiting from the services?  To what extent have the services raised the standards of health of our people?  There is need for more research and more investigation into the health services so that, when we are reviewing the structure of our health services, we will have available to us all the essential documentation and statistical data and then, and only then, can we have a realistic assessment of our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the on-going cost of our health services and the benefits to the community.  One must start at the base and the base here is the child.  I recommend strongly that the Minister should review the service for the care of children&mdash;that is, the supervision of the development of the child.  We are told that certain deficiencies appear at birth and disappear shortly afterwards but reappear later in the life of the child.  It is important then that a special examination of the child should be made every six months over a period of two years.  This should be a statutory obligation on the medical profession.  The Minister may say the child is medically examined again in school life, but it could then be too late.  I have in mind private nursing homes over which health boards have no control.  It is important that we should have a more comprehensive child health service to ensure the prevention of subsequent ill-health. This would result in less cost on our health services in future.  The Minister will have to give consideration to the position where private nursing homes are concerned.  Are these homes complying with all the regulations demanded by the Minister? I have no doubt the Minister is <Col N="521" /> well aware of what I am trying to convey to him.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be desired where the general hospital programme is concerned.  All hospitals should be equipped with essentials especially at consultant level.  It is sad to see unfortunate people being transferred from one hospital to another for specialist treatment.  I have seen unfortunate people transported from Cork or Kerry to Dublin.  This is deplorable. When we are re-examining the existing structure of our hospitals this is one aspect to which we will have to give careful consideration. Costly though this might be it would nevertheless be of great importance to our people.</P>
    <P>More could be done in the field of health education at all levels, in schools, universities, youth clubs, community associations and so forth.  An approach must be made by the Minister to the Minister for Education to make health education part of the school curriculum.  There is little point in talking about our health services if we are not prepared to start at base and introduce different aspects of health policy to all institutions.</P>
    <P>Pre-school nurseries are becoming an essential service and must be developed under direct supervision, as there are many dangers involved. Those in charge must have the necessary qualifications.  The premises in which these pre-school nurseries are held must satisfy the regulations in respect of fire and accident hazards.  I understand there is an organisation here in Dublin set up specifically for directing such places.  This service is very important, but it would be a terrible thing if tomorrow morning there were tragedies in these places that are now being set up as pre-school nurseries.  If the people in charge of these nursery schools have the proper qualifications and if they are properly supervised by the medical profession, many defects that may have gone unnoticed as far as parents and other people involved are concerned can be detected in the medical clinics.  Nobody should be allowed to set up a pre-school nursery without being issued with a licence from the <Col N="522" /> Department of Health.  This will ensure that the best service possible will be available to the children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that a White Paper on mental illness is being prepared by his Department. This is long overdue.  An assessment of these services should be made at regular intervals.  As the approach to the care of the mentally ill changes, those employed in this field must keep abreast of the different methods used in dealing with mental illness.  There is need for more out-patient clinics. These clinics need not necessarily be in a mental hospital.  Voluntary hospitals must be encouraged to establish out-clinics for mental illness. Voluntary efforts can also play a tremendous part where mental illness is concerned.  They can help to rehabilitate people into normal life.  I shall be dealing later with some aspects of voluntary involvement in community service councils.</P>
    <P>The Minister and a number of other Deputies dealt with the rehabilitation of the physically handicapped.  I do not intend to repeat the points they mentioned, but one aspect I would like to mention is that physically handicapped people undergo a lot of hospitalisation and many are deprived of educational opportunities.  Some hospitals provide such a service, but unfortunately when the patient is discharged there is little or no follow-up and the young person is deprived of a vital service.  One could imagine a physically handicapped person sitting in a wheelchair from early morning to late evening who cannot read or communicate with a friend.  How frustrating this must be.  Hospitals, the Department of Education and the Department of Health have a serious obligation towards these people.  Community associations could make a valuable contribution in this respect by seeking out such people who are discharged from hospital and taking them to the community association at night to try to meet their educational needs.  The Minister must have received many representations from the various bodies who are catering for the physically handicapped, and I would ask him to give this matter very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> I welcome the interim report by the task force on child care services and I hope that the final report will be available shortly.  It will be one of the most important documents to come before the Government because the development of the whole person is involved in the recommendations of the task force.  The Minister is responsible for the setting up of the task force and he and the Government should be preparing for the implementation of their recommendations, including the provision of the moneys necessary.  In common with many others, I am looking forward to the final report.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism is becoming a dreadful disease.  It is resulting in broken homes and in battered wives and children and it is also becoming a hazard in industrial life.  More should be done to combat the disease.  There is need for more education where drinking habits are concerned and the media, especially television, have a major part to play in highlighting the symptoms of the disease.  Naturally prevention is better than cure.</P>
    <P>Hospitals should be geared to cater for the problem.  I should like to pay a special tribute to Alcoholics Anonymous and many other people for their work in this area.  It is true that many hospitals are not catering for alcoholics.  I have heard from doctors that there is a reluctance on the part of hospitals to admit a person who is suffering from this disease.  Every hospital should have some beds allocated for alcoholics. Many of these people are not prepared to go into psychiatric hospitals but they are willing to enter a general hospital.  Knowing the dreadful effects the disease of alcoholism has on the entire community, it is essential that special consideration and attention be given to the matter.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately many of our young people are the victims of excessive drinking.  It is a shame that so many young people spend all their leisure hours in lounge bars with little or no notice being taken by the people who serve drink to them.  Part of the problem is that young boys and girls <Col N="524" /> join private clubs where they indulge in excessive drinking.  There is a need also to educate the parents to help their children with this problem.  If they are to drink they should be taught how to drink and how to enjoy themselves rather than indulge in excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>It is sad that so many homes suffer because of excessive drinking by both parents.  One can imagine the example they are giving to their children.  I would ask the Minister to help all organisations who are trying to combat this dreadful disease.  RTE could play a major part if they arranged that once a month someone who is involved in this area gave a talk to the people.  It is essential that a person should be able to diagnose his drinking habits.  Unfortunately many people become alcoholics without knowing it.  The media have an important part to play and they have a definite obligation to the community. They are well paid for their advertising of drink.  All of us could do a little more to help the victims of this dreadful disease.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty as set up by the Government.  The sum of £120,000 was passed by this House for the work involved.  I believe there is overlapping of the work of the National Social Services Council as the terms of reference of both committees are somewhat identical.  I do not know if the Minister has seen a pamphlet issued by the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty. A very interesting circular was issued with it under the reference B-PRO 5/76.  I have discussed this with a number of people and I think that something in the document needs clarification.  That report states:</P>
    <P>The Committee has been concerned since its establishment to develop a working philosophy consistent with its terms of reference. It has decided that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is fundamental to the philosophy of the programme that poverty in Irish society should be recognised as largely a result of inequality and that <Col N="525" /> its eventual elimination... will require a redistribution of resources and power in society...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the many occasions we have been discussing community involvement we were asked to give some explanation of &ldquo;will require a redistribution of resources and power in society&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister will comment on that when replying.</P>
    <P>Where two bodies are set up by a Government there is a danger that they will be in conflict with each other. I am not objecting to the setting up of this committee but I believe there is a certain amount of waste of energy in this respect.  It is a pity that the Minister did not avail of the National Social Services Council to take on this work.  The structures were there and they have established themselves in organised groups of community associations throughout the country.  The terms of reference of the committee set up to combat poverty is practically identical and the suggestions they are making involve the National Social Services Council and the various community associations.  I cannot see why the Minister did not avail of the opportunity of using a structure which was already established by the Government and their predecessor.  I do not wish to comment on a conflict that may arise between the community associations and the national committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty and I hope there will not be any conflict but nevertheless there is a definite repetition of work.  The extraordinary thing about it is that some of the personnel on the committee to combat poverty, excellent people, also serve on the same committee of the National Social Services Council.  We must be cautious in this regard.  Community associations avoid repetition of services.</P>
    <P>The whole spirit of community associations is to co-ordinate all the bodies working in some field or another where social services are concerned so as to avoid repetition in their work.  More emphasis must be placed on voluntary community involvement. In this regard I should like to pay tribute to the many <Col N="526" /> voluntary community services councils for the wonderful work they are doing for the less fortunate.  Unfortunately, the allocation of money for these services has been cut and for this reason I believe the Government are not fully aware of the value those services are to the community. One need only look at the economics of the service.  Health boards save a substantial amount of money because these community councils provide a service whereby old persons need not be permanently hospitalised.</P>
    <P>I believe mistakes were made over the years.  Millions of pounds were spent erecting or renovating institutions for our old people but such money should have been spent on services to keep those old people out of institutions.  More must be done in the field of geriatric services.  In this regard I should like to know how many geriatricians have been appointed. There is no point in talking about helping the old and the lonely unless we have a proper service within the hospitals and community.  We all know that elderly people at some stage need to be hospitalised and for this reason it is important that we have specialised facilities available for them. Specialised treatment can only be given by a geriatrician.  We are fortunate in having a geriatrician in Cork and he is doing wonderful work.  It is important that we have more people of that calibre available to help our old people.</P>
    <P>We all realise the value of the voluntary community services councils.  They erect buildings and provide necessary services for the community from such buildings yet they have to pay substantial rates.  In raising this matter I am conscious of the fact that the Minister for Local Government is present in the House.  I am also aware that the Minister for Health, when questioned about this, has stated that health boards can come to the assistance of community associations in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not know whether the Minister has come in to interrupt or help with my speech but what I say is true.  In talking of community service the greatest tribute must be paid to the late Minister for Health and former President, Erskine Childers. He was the architect of the community service system.  He set up the National Council for Community Service in Dublin.  Since then the service has developed, more people have become involved and it represents a saving to the State but it is a pity that people are burdened with rates.  I ask the Minister and, perhaps, also the Minister for Local Government to give some recognition to the value of the great work done by community associations.</P>
      <P>Many old people especially have the telephone service because of necessity. They may suffer from some serious ailment, such as heart trouble, requiring a telephone to summon a nurse, doctor or other person.  This imposes a financial burden on them.  Many such people were given what are called emergency lines.  The State should consider assisting such people either by providing the service at a reduced charge or by paying the total cost of the service.  It is easy to say one should do this or that without looking at the cost but if many such people were to be admitted to an institution or hospital, what would the cost be?  A telephone to a person in that category is a friend, something to which they can turn in an emergency.  I should like the Minister to get the views of health boards generally on this matter.  The cost would not be great if one compares the cost of institutional care and the cost of a telephone and I think the telephone service would be worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have many times put down questions here regarding appointment of social workers.  It is a pity that many young people leaving university with social science degrees must emigrate <Col N="528" /> with tremendous loss to the nation. There is urgent need for more social workers to co-operate with the various community associations.  To an extent they are leaders and they are of vital importance to community associations as guides and helpers of the voluntary workers on a full-time basis.  We can go a little overboard on voluntary involvement. It is important but there is also great need for full-time, back-up services of the social worker and the public health nurse.  These two form the nucleus of any worthwhile community service council.  Yet, I have known many graduates in many parts of the country who have had to go abroad.  One would not mind if there was no demand but there is a tremendous demand for them.  I ask again that we give very serious consideration to recruiting more and more social workers.</P>
    <P>In discussing the Health Estimate one infringes on other Departments.  I hope the time will come when some Government will consider this aspect of the matter.  In talking of something worthwhile regarding health services, one infringes on social welfare as in discussing youth, Education, Justice and Health are involved.  It is hard to make a case without touching, perhaps, on the work of another Department. I think the time has come when the Taoiseach should seriously consider the structure of a number of Government Departments and see if they should be co-ordinated or their scope extended so that Deputies would have some opportunity to comment. I am discussing a service that is needed at present, a very important service, preparation for earlier retirement&mdash;not social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that ruling and I am sorry to be unable to talk on those lines: perhaps I shall have an opportunity on the Estimate for another Department.  I want to refer to home help, another very important aspect of the health services.  When we talk about keeping people out of institutions we must talk about somebody to look after such people.  People helping in this field make themselves available to help and to call in and ensure that an old person is properly looked after in his or her own home but, unfortunately, the amount of money&mdash;I would not call it a salary&mdash; given to such people is certainly not attracting many to help in this field. We must give very serious consideration to this all-important service of home help.</P>
      <P>I have touched on a number of points but in trying to establish a case on different aspects of health one infringes on other Departments.  It is important for any Government to ensure that we get the best contribution in a debate on a matter such as health by bringing in other aspects of Departments where there is a linking-up with health.  This would give me and many others a greater opportunity of stressing some of the points and urgent needs of our people where health is concerned.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Health will give serious consideration to having a look now at the whole structure of our health services and that the necessary documentation and statistical information will be made available not alone to Members of the House but to members associated with health boards and so on so that we will all have an opportunity of producing a worth while health policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a colossal sum, practically £250 million for the health of this nation.  Even on that we have an increase on last year of 13 per cent. This covers the ever-widening field and it is of interest to note the Opposition crying out for extra services.  When the great provider, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan was subject to <Col N="530" /> barracking to provide the moneys for the different ministries, what help did he get from the Opposition?  That is the name of the game, I suppose.</P>
      <P>This is a colossal sum for the health of the nation and it is not the first time a National Coalition have put health before wealth.  I recall a time when the great white scourge hit this country and had been hitting it for generations, the white scourge of TB. It was a Coalition that tackled the problem when the Government before that had left people to die in old homes merely providing beds for them.  I recall in my town many fine boys and girls being wiped out.  Thanks be to God there was a change of Government which stopped that.  We have seen the health of the nation improve with the great decline in TB.</P>
      <P>Wealth meant health in those days. One who had enough money could go to Switzerland for a cure.  People who had not could go to the different old county homes, as they were at that time fit for nothing else.  But now I refer to health, meaning that it has a lot to do with wealth.  There are a number of people today who have the name of wealth, who have the signs and, we might say, the symptoms of having wealth by having nice homes, but who are put to the pin of their collar to provide the wherewithal to keep these homes and meet their commitments.  The result is that there is a tightening of the belt behind that facade of a wonderful home at times to provide the staff of life and there is a certain amount of deprivation and worry.  Naturally, the table suffers. When the table suffers the health suffers.  Further to that is the depression caused by these people not holding a medical card, borderline cases at times.  Maybe they try to keep up with the Jones's and are paying the price but then their health suffers and they are caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, in order to keep families small there is a demand for contraception. That is the last straw.  As far as married people are concerned, I will not comment further but there are other elements abroad who are crying out for contraception, for its free availability and if they get that <Col N="531" /> they will demand abortion.  Man has the God-given right under certain conditions to create life but under no condition has he the right to kill the unfortunate unborn.  As far as this country is concerned perish the thought of abortion or free contraception. I was never more disgusted to hear a lot of the demands from people.  I think in the background of all this are the merchants who are out for the quick buck, using this propaganda for their own ends against the youth of the country.  If we give way in this field, we will be blamed by generations to come as having failed and the finger of scorn will be pointed at us.  I was never more disgusted than one day recently coming through this gate to see a parade of young women, unashamed, without rings on their fingers, demanding free contraception. What is the world coming to at all?  I am no paragon of virtue; I could strike my breast and blame myself for a good many things in life. But certain standards were handed down by our forefathers which should not be given away to these quick buck merchants out to use our youth for one purpose only, that is, that they get in on the floor and make something out of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to drugs it is my humble opinion that they are being overprescribed at present.  I say that with due respect to the medical profession. I have seen homes where dressingtable drawers have been overflowing with pills of various types. An unnecessary amount of drugs seems to be given out to people at present.  Perhaps it is regarded as a handy way out, with doctors saying: &ldquo;Here, take this, go home and try it out; see how it works and, if it does not, I will give you more.&rdquo; However, it is not for me to go into too much detail in the medical field. But there is something wrong when one sees their effects in certain homes. The question arises: are people becoming too dependent on drugs? There seems to be a case for a tightening up on their prescriptions and I am not referring to medical card holders only.  I know the Department of Health utilise television programmes <Col N="532" /> in respect of certain health matters.  I should like to see greater use of television in this respect because, like the Press and the written word, television has a great impact.  It would be money well spent on advising people generally on health matters.</P>
    <P>The importance of first-aid&mdash;a branch of surgery in itself&mdash;cannot be over-emphasised.  The important factor to be borne in mind here is to keep the person alive and, if possible, prevent further injury.  Again this could not be better demonstrated than through television programmes. The Department of Health should do something in this regard, with so many of our people being crippled and injured on the roads, with bad handling by the public generally, which merely adds to the injury and, at times, may even be the cause of death.  Simple first aid may prevent an unfortunate person from dying, be it through artificial resuscitation or the prevention of haemorrhage. The Department of Health could play a large part in informing our people in this respect.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism has been touched on. Now and again the Department have given us an insight on how an unfortunate person should draw the line in this respect.  They should continue in that vein because it is something we tend to sweep under the carpet in this country, the attitude that so many are &ldquo;with-it&rdquo;&mdash;if that is the term to be used&mdash;it could not be wrong; we have to accept it, and we accept more than we can take.  I heard one man say recently if the pint went up to £1 he would follow it.</P>
    <P>I should like to see psychiatric treatment for adults being extended. The mental hospitals catering for people are not suitable.  Unfortunately there seems to be a certain stigma attached to mental illness in this country similar to that attached to TB heretofore when people avoided families with it.  Thank God that day has long since gone.  I hope the stigma of mental homes will disappear also. There seems to be a certain reluctance on the part of an alcholic <Col N="533" /> needing treatment to enter such hospitals.  There is a special case to be made for such treatment when one measures the amount of man-hours lost in industry, the inroads made into the health not alone of the unfortunate himself but that of his family also.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the public free chest X-rays are easing off.  If they are it is a retrograde step.  I hope I am wrong but I have not noticed the van around recently.  Perhaps it would be a good thing were we to have some system of free blood pressure tests throughout the country.  That would be preventive medicine in itself because we know that blood pressure problems lead to strokes, coronaries and so on.  Prevention is better than cure and such tests would show up early signs of problems. I do not think it would cost a lot.  A nurse could take a person's blood pressure and, if she found somebody suffering from blood pressure, she could recommend him to a doctor. That is the time to receive treatment, not when one has suffered a stroke, coronary or something else.  Such a scheme would indeed be worthy of implementation.</P>
    <P>I sometimes have to attend dances to support some cause or other.  As a public representative one has to attend many such functions.  However, I am most reluctant to enter dancehalls at present except in an endeavour to support some worthy cause. I would like the Department to investigate the effect loud amplification in dancehalls has on the ears, if not the nerves, of children.  If I was in one of those dancehalls for long my ears would be affected.  The Department should have some way of measuring the decibels of those amplifications.  I would also like to see proper ventilation in dancehalls.  We have often heard talk of foam baths but one would get a foam bath in many of those dancehalls.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to our Air Corps for providing helicopters for ambulance services.  They have helped to save many lives.  It is only right and proper that we should pay tribute to those men and also to our lifeboat service.  I have seen lifeboats <Col N="534" /> come to the rescue of ships in distress in very bad weather off the west coast. Those men endangered their own lives to save the lives of others.  When I visited the great fishing area of Brittany in northern France I was asked by the leading skippers of the fishing trawlers of very large tonnage to convey their appreciation to the nurses and medical staff in the hospitals in the west for the way they have treated sick and injured fishermen who have been brought in on many occasions.  I would like to pay tribute to the nursing staff in Galway hospital for their dedication to their patients.  The nursing staff are often subjected to bickering by patients who, because of their illness, may not treat them in a proper fashion.</P>
    <P>We should all think about the Third World.  One often sees on television a human skeleton from the Third World and then we hear about the mountains of beef and powdered milk.  The World Health Organisation should play a bigger part in relief for the Third World.  Those people are our brothers, irrespective of what colour their skin is.  Something should be done to use the milk mountains to help those unfortunate people.  When one compares conditions in Ireland with what we have seen in countries in the Third World we know how well off we are.  There may be a repercussion if we close our eyes to the Third World.  What happened in 1918, when we had the great 'flu epidemic, is within the living memory of many. It was said that this came as a result of the millions who died on the battlefields of France.  We do not know the effect famine in the Third World may have on us.  We have a lot to account for if we fight about the green £ but do nothing about our brethren dying on the other side of the mountain.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for providing a home for the aged in my town.  It was very hard on people who had to go to the county home in Loughrea.  This is a very excellent home but hardship was caused to aged people there because their relatives could not afford the cost of transport to visit them.  This <Col N="535" /> has been a very sore point with the unfortunate people who have to stay there and had no friends to visit them. Those people were poor.  The song known as &ldquo;The Irish Emigrant&rdquo; tells us that the poor have no real friends. I am not saying those people emigrated when they went to Galway county home but many of them were unable to have visitors because their friends could not afford the cost of transport to visit them.  I hope to see more homes provided like this new one in Galway.</P>
    <P>Many people said that after the home was provided no staff were provided.  It is a good thing to see that voluntary staff came forward to open that home.  I wish to thank those people publicly for coming forward. Many things in the past were got by voluntary effort.  That was how we got our freedom although we may have paid a fair price for it.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look into the few points I have mentioned, particularly into the loud sound in dancehalls and the effect it is bound to have on young people.  When I was young and we went to dancehalls we had to serve our time before we shook the floor.  Nowadays young people can go into dancehalls and shake themselves as they like.  In my young days we had orchestras which had not a deafening effect. Some of the Opposition Deputies derided the great provider, the Minister for Finance, because of extra taxation but they are calling out for more money for our health services.  They cannot have their loaf and eat it.  Sin an méid atá le rá agam.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in the light of similar decisions in the past year by other semi-State bodies, notes with deep concern the recent decision by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, with the apparent approval of the Government, to allow a major contract to go outside this country when the work could have been carried out by Irish firms with consequential benefit to the Irish economy.</P>

I am not to be taken as suggesting that it is wrong for a contract to go to a foreign firm, <Col N="538" /> but going under circumstances which give rise to considerable apprehension as to the handling of this affair by NET, a handling which appears to have the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I will be dealing with that aspect of the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>The worrying aspect of this&mdash;one might almost say the sinister aspect of it&mdash;is the fact that this part of the overall contract is being carried out by Kellog International Limited, design consultants, without the mechanical sub-contract having been put out to tender, as was done in the case of the various other aspects of the construction of this plant.  No Irish firm, or any other firm of any nationality, was allowed that opportunity.  This matter gives rise not just to considerable misgivings and apprehension in this party, in the construction industry and their unions, but right throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The first thing I want to establish is the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken a close personal interest in the various contracts and sub-contracts that have been awarded by NET.  It is only right that he should do so, because this whole complex, which is being erected by NET at Marino Point in Cork Harbour, is one of primary importance to this country.  This is the first major construction of plant arising directly out of the very fortunate finding of natural gas off our shores.  For the first time, we have the opportunity to construct major plant directly arising out of the finding of natural gas which is such a boon to this country.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 11th December, 1975, I raised in this House in the debate on the Industrial Development (No. 2) Bill, 1975, a question which at the time I considered important, as it was and is, and that was the decision by NET to award the structural steel sub-contract to a British firm called Farmers, even though it was conceded that an Irish firm, Joseph Murphy Structural Engineering, Limited, Dublin, submitted the lowest tender.  I spoke at some length on the Second Reading <Col N="539" /> of that Bill about what I regarded as the unfortunate decision of NET to award this contract to Farmers, even though they appeared to have been a higher contract and it was demonstrated pretty conclusively that the Irish firm were capable of carrying out the work.  Up to that time I had no direct proof&mdash;even though I suspected it&mdash;that the Minister himself approved in advance of the giving out of these contracts and sub-contracts in relation to this very important project.</P>
    <P>The Minister at column 1474, Volume 286 of the Official Report for 11th December last said:</P>
    <P>The decision in regard to NET was a difficult one.  I went into the matter thoroughly and I should like to state emphatically that I take full responsibility for the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister could not have been more specific, that he took full responsibility for the awarding of the structural steel sub-contract which was worth approximately £500,000. We are talking here about the mechanical part of the contract.  It is not quite clear what its value is. It is conceded that it is worth not less than £10 million.  It may be worth a good bit more.  That being so, this contract is 20 times more important than the structural steel contract.  In view of the fact that the Minister went into the matter thoroughly in relation to the structural steel contract and stated emphatically that he took full responsibility for the matter, I have not the slightest doubt that the Minister went equally thoroughly into this whole question and takes equal responsibility in spite of his prefacing his reply to a number of questions from Deputy Fitzgerald and myself to the effect that this was a matter for NET and not for the Minister. This was at a time when the heat had come on somewhat in relation to the Minister's intemperate outburst in relation to this matter in Cork some weeks ago.  We have, therefore, established to the satisfaction of any reasonable person that the Minister <Col N="540" /> personally vetted and gave his approval to what was done in relation to the mechanical contract part of this whole project done by NET.</P>
    <P>To get the matter in perspective it is now necessary to look at what NET did.  NET gave a contract for the design and overall construction of this plant about 12 months ago to Kellog International after there had been tenders from three international firms of which they were one.  This is a pattern which is repeated fairly frequently throughout the world in the construction of plants of this nature.  There is no question that Messrs Kellog International Ltd are an experienced and reputable firm and are among the best in their field of designing plant of this kind and they are so recognised throughout the world. What I question is the fact that as well as being given the contract for the design, which is a normal thing, they were also given the overall contract for the construction.</P>
    <P>This is not normal and from my inquiries I can refer to one or two other plants that are currently under construction.  It is not normal to give Kellogs the contract for the full construction work.  Nonetheless they got it, possibly on the basis that they would sub-contract out each part of it and put each sub-contract up for tender.  This has been done up to now.  Irish firms have tendered very competitively for and have got most of the sub-contracts that have been put up for tender up to have tendered very competitively for and have got most of the sub-contracts that have been put up for tender up to now with the exception of the structural steel one and I think one other which was a great deal smaller than this.  To the surprise of everyone it was decided by NET in consultation with Kellogs, and undoubtedly with the approval of the Minister, that in this case the mechanical aspect of the contract would not be put out for tender but would be retained by Kellogs themselves who would hire direct labour in order to carry out the job and would be paid apparently on the basis of whatever it cost.  It is quite conceivable, and in the absence of tenders one cannot say for certain, that if this job which I will show was within the competence of Irish mechanical contractors had been put out for tender the possibility is that the cost to NET and accordingly to the <Col N="541" /> Irish taxpayer would have been, perhaps, several million pounds less than what it will, in fact, turn out to be.</P>
    <P>I will summarise the reasons for this given by the Minister in the House on the 18th May last.  The Minister said that no Irish mechanical contracting firm had done precisely this work before and that the job was complex and very important and that the Minister wished to avoid delay or possibility of error and, accordingly, Kellogs got the go-ahead to do the job themselves by direct labour.  The situation is that this job, I would suggest, and it has been suggested by people who are in a better position than I to evaluate the complexity of it, and so on, is no more complex than a whole series of jobs which were carried out very successfully by Irish mechanical contracting firms in recent years.  The Mechanical Contractors' Association refer in one of their statements to a very extensive list of jobs done by Irish firms.</P>
    <P>I will mention a few as an indication of the considerable difficulty of those jobs, which I would suggest, are no more difficult or complex than this NET plant at Marino Point, which were very successfully done by Irish firms within time.  Perhaps the best example is Merck, Sharp and Dohme which is a pharmaceutical complex at Clonmel where the difficulties were enormous.  The job was successfully carried out within time by a prominent Irish firm, H. A. O'Neill Ltd. which is a subsidiary of the Jones Group which is an Irish public company. There are a large number of others such as the Asahi project at Ballina, Courtalls huge factory at Letterkenny, the Turlough Hill pump storage scheme for the ESB.  I would also like to refer to the Ferenka factory at Limerick which is the largest factory ever built in this country. There was never a factory of its kind in this country before.  The technology or the processes involved had never been seen in this country before but Irish firms successfully carried out within time the building of this factory in Limerick, although it is enormous and it was particularly complicated at the mechanical end of it. There was never a pump storage electricity <Col N="542" /> station in this country before. Turlough Hill is a major and elaborate one.  No Irish firm had done that kind of work before but Irish mechanical firms carried it out very successfully. The same would go for the other firms mentioned, Merck, Sharp and Dohme, Asahi, Syntex in Clarecastle, Tarbert and Poolbeg generation stations for the ESB and a long list of others.  They were all new in the sense that no Irish firm individually had done that sort of work before.  Irish firms tendered for those jobs in competition with foreign firms and tendered successfully and, having obtained the contracts, carried them out successfully to the satisfaction of everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>You will notice, Sir, that of the various firms and projects I have been referring to, a great many of them such as Ferenka and Asahi, for example, and Merck, Sharp and Dohme, are not semi-State companies.  They are privately owned firms and, in most cases, foreign privately owned firms. They had not in any sense the same sort of obligation to the Irish economy or to Irish firms as I would suggest NET as a wholly owned by the taxpayers semi-State body, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance, have to the Irish economy to see that Irish firms, if they do not get the contracts, at least get the opportunity to tender for them, an opportunity they have been deprived of quite cavalierly on this occasion.</P>
    <P>These are foreign private firms who were very happy to put out to tender work of great complexity involving great expense and considerable difficulties. They were happy to award the contracts to Irish firms as a result of competitive tenders by Irish firms against one another and against foreign firms.  Here we have the situation that a semi-State body are not alone not prepared to give the work to an Irish firm but are not even prepared to allow an Irish firm to tender for the work.  They have no way at all of estimating&mdash;and we as public representatives have no way of estimating-what the cost of that work would have been, how much less it would have <Col N="543" /> been.  It could be many millions of pounds less if it were put out to competitive tender at a time when Irish contracting firms of this kind are literally screaming for work and when, unfortunately, they are letting men go virtually every week.</P>
    <P>Because I believe efforts have been made to try to confuse the issue on the whole question of design and construction, I want to make it clear that I have no objection whatever to Kellog International Limited competitively obtaining the contract for the design of this plant.  It is acknowledged that they are one of the best in the world at that, and there is no firm in Ireland so far as I am aware which could have designed the plant in question.  Kellogs have got contracts to design similar plants in other parts of the world.  I understand at least two are going on at the moment, one at Huelva in southern Spain and the other in China.  I have less information about what is happening in China because that is not so easily come by.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries from people who have visited an ammonia and urea plant which is under construction at the moment in Huelva in southern Spain.  I am basing my information on what has been given to me by somebody who has actually been there to look at what is happening.  This plant at Huelva was designed by Kellogs but the Spaniards only bought the design from Kellogs.  They employed Kellogs as planning consultants for the design, but they did not employ them as contractors or project managers.  A Spanish firm called Union Explosivos Rio Tinto were appointed by the Spanish Government to act as consultants and project managers.  At the moment in Huelva in Spain there is just one man from Kellogs who is seconded there as a liaison officer and an interpreter of detail in the drawings.</P>
    <P>Another Spanish firm called Tecnicas Reunidas, are carrying out all the general construction work and are sub-contracting to various firms the technical sub-contracts such as the one we are talking about here, the structural steel and the various other <Col N="544" /> ones which arise.  As a result, numerous Spanish firms have got experience which would not otherwise have been possible.  Unfortunately we have passed this over.  We have failed to avail of a very valuable opportunity for us to increase our knowledge of a technology which we hope will be of great importance to us in the years ahead as, we hope, more and more gas fields of this kind are found around our coasts.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of being annoyed, although one is entitled to be annoyed, at an Irish firm not even being given the opportunity to tender for this work.  From the long-term point of view, the real loss to our economy is the fact that here we are dealing with natural gas, a God-given gift to us.  It is our first opportunity to gain experience in a major construction plant arising out of the discovery of natural gas.  We are passing up that opportunity simply because some large foreign firm did precisely this type of work before and Irish firms did not.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the House and to the Minister, although he does not seem to accept this point, that the long list of major mechanical projects and contracts which I gave already were all new.  No Irish firm has done precisely that work.  There is no major innovation by any manner or means in the mechanical contract so far as Marino Point is concerned. It is not easy but it is no more difficult than Merck, Sharp and Dohme, or Asahi, or any of the others I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Kellog International Limited are down in Cork trying to recruit staff to carry out this work.  They are recruiting the staff from existing Irish firms who trained them and built up a skilled manpower force on their pay rolls.  Presumably this job will be finished in two years' time, or so. Kellog International Limited will then depart from the Irish scene and, unless they come back at some future date in relation to some of our gas finds, we will probably never see them again. The Irish firms who spent thousands of pounds in training personnel for mechanical projects and who, over a <Col N="545" /> long number of years, have also paid out an annual training levy for the training of staff and operatives, will be left high and dry.  We hope they may still be with us but it is quite conceivable that they will not be with us, because the kind of work for which they have trained their staff is being given to a firm who have no obligation to the staff, no obligation to take on apprentices and train them as these Irish firms have been doing down the years, and who are interested in this once off job which will probably not arise again for them.</P>
    <P>If there are further gas finds off our coast, as we all very fervently hope there will be, surely it is only right that Irish firms should now get the opportunity to prepare for further work and further contracts which will become available if and when these further finds are made.  One of the most disturbing aspects of this rather disturbing affair is the fact that when there was criticism by the various bodies of NET's decision to allow this very important contract to go without being put out for tender and to allow the design consultants to carry it out by direct labour on a cost or time and material basis, there was no response from the Minister or NET. There was some from NET but none from the Minister for a week or so, but suddenly, while in Cork for the opening of a different plant&mdash;the the Japanese plant, Mitsui&mdash;he availed of the opportunity to call a Press conference to talk about the NET decision and the criticisms that were made of that decision which, clearly, he approved of.</P>
    <P>At the Press conference he used the most extraordinary and intemperate language in relation to his critics.  There was no question of his being provoked.  There was nobody from the Construction Industry Federation heckling him.  He was not in Dáil Éireann where sometimes he uses intemperate language when, perhaps, I or somebody else might provoke him.  He was speaking at a Press conference which had been called by himself.  During the course of the conference he described those who criticised the decision as speaking wild <Col N="546" /> nonsense and monstrous trash and he continued to use various other phrases to that effect.  He said that those who criticised the decision to allow Kellog to take over the mechanical sub-contract were talking nonsense, that their argument was irresponsible and a silly non-argument. For the most part his criticism was directed personally at Mr. Thomas Reynolds, director of the Construction Industry Federation.  The Press conference was reported in each of the national dailies of May 11th, 1976. In response the federation issued what, in all the circumstances, was a remarkably moderate statement because if ever there was a slur on Irish firms and, in particular, on Irish workers, the Minister had cast such a slur.  He had stated that the Irish construction industry was good at building houses, the implication being, therefore, that the industry was not any good in the field of work of a sophisticated nature in relation to plant of this kind.  This slur and denigration of Irish firms and workers would be very serious in itself but it is particularly serious at this time when those firms, because of lack of work in this country&mdash;a situation which is due to the constant running down of the construction industry generally by the Government&mdash;in order to endeavour to survive and keep workers in employment, are turning increasingly abroad for contracts and are competing against foreign firms in this very type of field of which we are talking.</P>
    <P>One can well imagine the position these firms are placed in when the Minister for Industry and Commerce in their own country engages in denigrating them, sneering at them and running them down generally in the fashion he employed in Cork on 10th May.  The firms and the workers concerned are entitled to be extremely annoyed at what was said about them by the Minister, the man, more than anyone else, who should be pushing them and lauding their abilities and their virtues in order that they might get more work abroad at a time when it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find work at home.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at this situation <Col N="547" /> in the context of the unemployment position generally and, particularly, in the construction industry in respect of which the number of people unemployed is way above the national average, showing an increase of 13,000 unemployed since 1974.  If this figure were reflected in the national average rate of unemployment there would be 200,000 people registered as unemployed instead of 114,800 who are registered currently.  The rate of acceleration of unemployment in the construction industry has been huge and, perhaps, has run at more than twice the rate in other sectors.  Therefore, if there was any one sector which the Government should be going out of their way to assist, I suggest it should be the construction industry.  That industry, above all others, is the one which the Government should not be denigrating in the eyes of the world.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that towards the end of last year another semi-State body, the Irish Life Assurance Company, awarded a contract to a British firm in respect of the manufacture of furniture valued at £200,000 for their new offices in Dublin.  They acted in this way on the grounds that the type of furniture involved had not up to then been made in Ireland.  Their action aroused an outcry and there followed a sort of semi-public argument between the Minister for Finance and the board of Irish Life in which the Minister said he had been misled by the board, an allegation which the board denied.  In any event, after much public criticism in this House and elsewhere the board of Irish Life relented and made some changes in the contract, although this entailed a loss to them, whereby the furniture would be manufactured in Ireland.  The contract we are talking of here is not a contract of £200,000 but is in excess of £10 million. I do not know how much in excess of that figure it is but let us assume the lowest possible figure of £10 million. This leaves it at least 50 times greater than the Irish Life contract which caused so much of a furore.  I am expressing the value of the contract in terms of money but this plant which is to be used for the utilisation of <Col N="548" /> natural gases is worth more to the country than was the £200,000 contract for furniture for Irish Life.  It is not only in terms of money or of comparative money values that one reaches this decision but in terms of the opportunity to come to grips with a new technology, the first chance that Irish firms have had in this regard.  It is not that it is that much more difficult or more different from the sort of work they have been doing up to now but it involves a type of technology which we hope will be repeated many times in the future.  We have lost the opportunity to teach this new technology to many of our people, to enable them to become more familiar with it.  There is no point in saying that 90 per cent of the workers which Kellog will employ will be Irish.  They will not be a team but will be workers recruited from Irish mechanical, engineering and contracting firms, brought together for one job which, when completed, will mean the dissipation of the workers and a huge proportion of the knowledge they would have acquired is lost.  The real value of acquiring knowledge in that technology lies in firms acquiring that knowledge and maintaining it as a team so that they can apply it in future, not only in their own work but in the instruction of other Irish people.  The real tragedy lies in the fact that, with the discovery of this great natural resource we now have a great opportunity to train our own people from the outset but we are not doing it.  It is incredible that we are refusing to do it with the clear approval and support of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am not suggesting that he should give Irish firms jobs which they are not entitled to, but he approves of a situation in which they are not even allowed to tender for one of our most important, if not the most important, sub-contracts. I have been accused of being chauvinistic in endeavouring to get as much work as possible done by Irish firms in relation to offshore gas and oil.</P>
    <P>We are told that we are living in a free trade ear.  For goodness' sake, this contract was not thrown open to anybody.  NET agree that the consultants should themselves do the <Col N="549" /> work by direct labour.  No Irish firm was even asked to tender in spite of the fact that millions of pounds of the Irish taxpayers' money is being pumped into this project by the IDA. The IDA have strict rules about construction contracts having to go to tender in order that the taxpayers' money would not be abused in any way.  What guarantee have we that millions of pounds more than is necessary is not being utilised in this particular job?</P>
    <P>I do not hear the British or the Norwegians being accused of chauvinism or ultra-nationalism although virtually every platform in respect of oil and gas that has been erected, or is in the course of erection, in the North Sea was manufactured either in Britain or in Norway because their Governments insisted on that.  At present we have two platforms under construction for the Kinsale Head gas field and neither of them is being constructed here.  Even if we had to build more platforms in the next year or two, it seems unlikely that they would be built in this country.  It is perfectly all right for the British and Norwegians to insist that the spin-off benefits of their good fortune in the North Sea should go to their own people but one is accused of chauvinism if one suggests that the Irish people are entitled to some benefit from the God-given gift of natural gas.  I make no apology, Sir, for saying that Irish firms and workers are at least entitled to a fair crack of the whip.  I am not asking that they be given preference.  Their very abilities, which are undoubted and which are recognised all over the world, are denigrated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a way that will make it more difficult for them to get the work they need so badly abroad.  A second very disturbing aspect of this matter is that we have no way of knowing what the mechanical sub-contract for the NET project at Marino Point will be because it was not put out to contract and no firm, either Irish or foreign, got the opportunity of tendering for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes and approves the efforts of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to ensure that the plant for the production of ammonia and urea being established at Cork will be constructed to the highest standards of safety and efficiency so as to safeguard the State's investment in it, the employment in that plant and in the fertiliser industry in Ireland, and the security of supply of such a vital material for the farming community.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is important in assessing this matter to realise what we are talking about.  We are talking about a plant to produce nitrogenous fertilisers for use on Irish farms.  In view of the fact that this fertiliser is being produced with natural gas which is now available to us from offshore, it is very important that, first, the plant goes into production at the earliest possible date and, secondly, that it produce at the lowest possible cost. If any extra cost is added to the cost of setting up the plant it will ultimately be borne by the farmers who will have to pay a higher price for fertiliser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a unique project.  It is the second largest plant of its type in the world.  The new plant will be ten times larger than the existing NET ammonia plant at Arklow and cannot be compared with the projects referred to by Deputy O'Malley.  In the case of the Merck, Sharp and Dohme project, the main contractors did some of the work by direct labour.  In the case of the Mitsui project, some of the work on that was also done by direct labour. The Ferenka project involved a relatively simple chemical process and cannot be compared with the plant which is being installed in this place. The Kellog-NET arrangement is normal to a project of this sort anywhere in the world.  It is important to reiterate <Col N="551" /> that 90 per cent of the money being spent on this project will be spent in Ireland.  This was a management decision taken by NET to approve the procedure being adopted by the people to whom they had given the contract, namely, Kellog.  It was not a decision which required the approval of the Minister and his approval was not sought.  It was a decision taken by a semi-State body on the basis of commercial considerations. Obviously, any semi-State body is liable to be criticised for any decision they may make, even decisions based on valid commercial considerations. We have to walk a very narrow line between legitimate criticism and harrassment of semi-State companies. It is very important that any semi-State company should feel free to take what they regard to be the best commercial decisions without undue political pressure and if we arrive at a situation where political pressure is to be exercised in regard to every decision they take, our entire semi-State set-up, which in many ways is unique, will be to a certain degree undermined.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether the Minister approved this decision, Deputy O'Malley quoted from the Official Report in favour of his contention that the Minister approved this decision. The Minister did not do so and I think the Deputy's quotation could not lead to the conclusion to which the Deputy wanted it to lead.  The Minister was referring to a thorough and careful investigation by him of the question of whether he should overturn a decision already undertaken by NET, not a thorough investigation by the Minister of whether NET should take a decision in advance of the Minister's decision being taken.  The Minister said that after a thorough and careful investigation he was satisfied that that was the correct advice and that he would not be behaving in the best interests of NET or the country if he intervened to overturn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract was given to Kellog not just for the design of the plant but for the design, construction and commissioning of the plant.  The terms were negotiated very tightly.  It is clear that any delay involved was in the production costs which might arise if NET were to insist on sub-contracting which would have added to the cost of the contract, which extra cost would, of course, have been borne by Kellog, and perhaps this would have led to their wishing to come back to renegotiate the original contract, which included the construction element.  The machinery of the whole plant being installed, we are all agreed, was designed by Kellog, and it seems to me, as it would to any sensible Member of the Dáil, that somebody who has designed a particular machine is best fitted to instal that machine because the designer would then forsee all the various problems, and if another party is interposed between the designer and the installer extra costs would be added in terms of explanation and administration, and there would be a diminishing of efficiency in the installation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out, and this is very important, that the fact that this part of the contract is being carried out by direct labour does not in any respect lessen the Irish labour content.  There will be 584 Irishmen involved in the project and they would have been involved whether it was done by sub-contract or by direct labour.  Some people might think that Kellog, being a foreign concern, would be presumed to derive extra profit because they were doing it by direct labour rather than by sub-contracting, and that this <Col N="553" /> extra profit would be going abroad. The fact is that they will receive no extra profit because the work is being done by direct labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a likelihood that there would be more cost in having the work done by subcontract than by direct hire because there would be extra supervision involved, there would be an extra layer of supervision.  First of all, there would be supervision of NET by Kellog and by Kellog of the subcontractors.  If the work is carried out by direct hire the only supervision involved is by NET of Kellog and this eliminates an extra layer of supervision and obviously extra costs.  I have said no extra profit is accruing to Kellog by virtue of the fact that they are carrying out this work by direct labour rather than by subcontract.  However, if it were to be carried out by subcontract, Kellog would still get the same profit but the sub-contractors would have to get some profit for themselves out of the process and this extra profit would be an extra cost not incurred in the normal way.  It would be an extra cost ultimately passed on to the consumer of the fertiliser, the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection by NET to the idea of subcontracting was not so much on the basis that Irish firms did not have the technical confidence but rather that the job was of such a size that no individual Irish concern would have the administrative confidence to undertake it, given that they would also be engaged on other work of their own independently of this. It is a well-known maxim of commercial practice that it is unwise for any one firm to put all its resources into any one contract at any one time because it dislocates its general market position by doing so and leaves itself in a situation where, once the contract is finished, it has lost its business contracts essential to keep it going on a continuous basis.  Even if an Irish firm had the capacity individually to carry out the contract it would not be likely to undertake it because, if it did so, it would involve committing its whole resources to this one contract, an unwise commercial practice, and the result would be presumably that a consortium would have had to be set up involving three or four <Col N="555" /> different firms.  This consortium, in turn, would involve extra supervisory expense in the co-ordination of the consortium as distinct from the co-ordination in the subcontracting layer in the general situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the loss of training opportunity.  The workers involved in this plant will receive specialised training and, once the contract is over, these workers will be available, not just to individual building firms which have been involved in the subcontract, but by virtue of the fact that they were employed on a direct hire basis, they will be available to all firms which might wish to avail of their services and the skills they acquired in carrying out this project.  This is just as likely to be as efficient a means of getting skilled manpower available in this particular type of work as would be any other method.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the engineers in NET will be acquiring very considerable experience as a result of their role in supervising this operation.  The Deputy mentioned the Huelva plant in Spain and said it was being done on a subcontract basis. My information is that this project is six months behind schedule and it is considered that it is behind schedule precisely because what Deputy O'Malley urged in this case was done in that case.  I think we are all agreed that any delay in a project involving such a heavy capital commitment is to be avoided.  I can tell the House that the question was considered by NET as to whether it would be wise to go for a subcontracting arrangement or a direct hire arrangement and it was made very clear, and with a great deal of force, that there were considerable risks involved, that extra delays would be involved in a sub-contracting arrangement which would not be involved in a direct hire arrangement and the Spanish experience, about which we have information, tends to confirm very emphatically this advice.</P>
    <P>The position is, therefore, that no less Irish labour is being employed as a result of the decision to go for a <Col N="556" /> direct hire rather than a subcontract arrangement, that significantly less costs are involved, certainly in the matters of layers of supervision and probably in the matter of delays in construction which would have been incurred had we gone for a subcontracting arrangement.  In view of the fact that these extra costs would ultimately be borne by the consumers and would have a significant effect on the competitiveness of this plant, which will still have to compete with imported fertilisers, it was a wise decision on the part of NET to try to get this plant constructed at minimum cost and it was on the basis of that consideration they made their independent decision, a decision the House can confidently endorse.</P>

He did not say what the &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; figure would be.  Perhaps we may ask the Parliamentary Secretary now and, through him, either the Minister or NET&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy I have a figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was there a net figure for the contract?  Was there a penalty clause?  How big was it?  Was it a substantial penalty clause because of the size of the contract?  I have heard two figures, one of £60 million and one of £70 million, but I have not got precise information.  One has a certain sympathy for the Parliamentary Secretary who is &ldquo;carrying the can&rdquo; for the Minister.  I certainly <Col N="557" /> felt he did not have his heart in what he was saying, that his brief was to stonewall, and he did that quite successfully.  He said over and over again that the net result of giving this contract to a subcontracting firm would be increased costs.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stands blameless here apparently as did the Minister for Finance in regard to the Irish Life office furniture.  At least the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not say he was misled. The Parliamentary Secretary argued it would be better for the firm which had designed the plant to construct it.  One might take the Parliamentary Secretary's argument a little further and ask would it not be better for the architect who designed the house to construct it?</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy O'Malley on one point.  Speaking as an engineer, I believe the engineering profession in this country have the expertise to fulfil this contract, and that it might have been the way the brief was put that discouraged some of them from trying.  Taking the <i>IDA News</i>, volume 2, No. 9, May, 1976, one finds almost the whole of page 6 devoted to exalting, and rightly so, the expertise of Irish companies. Is it not a contradiction when, on the one hand, a State-sponsored body give the design and commissioning of a plan to an outside firm of consulting engineers, and, on the other hand, the IDA, who are under the same Minister, give grants to consultancy firms who set up here in Ireland?  That page contains very interesting news.  It says that Irconsult, a consortium of 16 Irish firms of consulting engineers, have obtained an assignment in the Middle East which, along with other contracts that are likely to be tied up within the next few months, could generate a total fee income of £2 million. Surely that would compare more than favourably with the £60 or £70 million of the NET plant.  That is the only point on which I differ with Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all my years as an engineer I have never come across a local authority or a private individual who would give out a contract of any size, <Col N="558" /> not to mention one in the region of £10 million, without having it put out to competitive contract.  If the Parliamentary Secretary was anxious to save money, surely that is where it could have been saved.  There is an old maxim: competition is the life of trade.  Will I do something at the same price if I know it is my job or if I know I will have to compete with somebody else?  There would be a public outcry, and rightly so, if any public or local authority did what NET did.  As Deputy O'Malley said, our worry is not that an outside firm had got the contract but that this contract was awarded to an outside firm without competition.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us tonight about the extra cost, which would, as he said, fall eventually on the Irish farmers.  Was it not the duty of NET, if they are worried about extra cost, to insist that the tender would be competitive?</P>
    <P>I have personal knowledge of the expertise of Irish firms, and whether the Parliamentary Secretary feels that Asahi, which is just a few miles down the road from me, is not a very complex job&mdash;that is his opinion and he is entitled to it&mdash;the fact is that this work is being carried out by an Irish firm, the same firm as carried out the work that Deputy O'Malley mentioned. They are not in the position of having to put all their eggs in the one basket.  They have succeeded this year in making what appears to be a dirty word in Ireland at the moment, a good profit.  They do that only on good workmanship, on expertise, on technique and on doing the job within the time for which they have contracted.</P>
    <P>We have been accused here of using this situation as a means of embarrassing the Government.  Goodness knows they have enough embarrassment without our trying to embarrass them any more.  However, this is something that most of the engineering associations, including the unions, are seriously worried about.  In a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, May 19th, 1976, the Mechanical Contracting Association, <Col N="559" /> expressing concern about the question of training operatives, said:</P>
    <P>What about the continuing employment and training of apprentices in the mechanical trade?  Irish contractors carry out the training of apprentices in the trade on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>That is what Deputy O'Malley was stressing, &ldquo;on a continuous basis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>No such service is provided by Kellog International.  It is Irish Mechanical Contractors who, through their training of apprentices and operatives, guarantee the future of mechanical work in this country.</P>
    <P>One could say that Irish firms and workers are employed not alone in this country but elsewhere because, as they say themselves, due to the severe shortage of work here they are tendering and being awarded mechanical contracts abroad, particularly in Africa and in the Middle East&mdash;but not in Cork.</P>
    <P>We are now on the threshold of new technologies.  We have missed a glorious opportunity to add to our expertise which can be used at a later date.  The Parliamentary Secretary has, as I said before, spoken at length on the advantages of direct labour. All he showed us was that he knows very little about the engineering and contracting business.  Kellog will have to set up from scratch what is already in the country and what many engineering firms have already.  They will have to advertise for personnel, appoint agents and site managers and they will have to go through the whole spectrum of engineering workers until they build up a team. How long will that take and who will pay for it?  Those questions can legitimately be asked at a time when we are so worried about costs.  The sensible thing to have done would have been to employ a firm, to put the job out for tender.  In that way it would not be necessary to set up a team.</P>
    <P>There is bound to be delay before the new team can be assembled.  There are bound to be differences and misconceptions. <Col N="560" /> We are starting what the Parliamentary Secretary rightly described as one of the largest plants in the world with a team made up from scratch, without the advantage of the administrative teamwork that would have been available had the job gone to tender.  When the job is over the expertise will still be available but the people will be scattered throughout the country and many of them may have to leave it.  Therefore, a fair amount of that expertise will be lost.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the amendment because in my opinion it is one of the most unfortunate amendments ever put before the House.  To me its wording implies that the expertise, labour and construction management in this country is only second-class.  It may be worthwhile to examine the amendment.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes and approves the efforts of Nitrigín Éireann Teoranta to ensure that the plant for the production of ammonia and urea being established at Cork will be constructed to the highest standards of safety and efficiency...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To me that implies directly that if this plant were designed by Irish consulting engineers and constructed by Irish workers it would not be to the highest standards of safety and efficiency.  It is also implied in the amendment that if it were designed by Irish consulting engineers and constructed by Irish sub-contractors it would not safeguard the State's investment, that it would not safeguard employment in the plant and that there would be a danger if it were directed by Irish contractors.  One could not expect a motion like Deputy O'Malley's to get through without an amendment, but I put it to the House that the wording of the amendment is most unfortunate so far as Irish expertise, labour and contractors are concerned.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, there have been arguments and counter-arguments about this matter. Perhaps we should consider the statement made by NET in response to the CIF criticism.  I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 18th May, 1976:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> Because of the scope, complexity and advanced technology involved in the project and in consideration of the capabilities available in Ireland, it was decided that the bulk of the mechanical construction work would be carried out on a direct hire basis which is considered to be the best route by which the construction can be carried out within the time scheduled.</P>
    <P>In my opinion that statement was made by someone with tongue in cheek because, as I have pointed out, to set up the team necessary to do the job will take months.  To correlate that team and to get it working together will take a long time and I think it will be at least halfway through the contract before the team is working efficiently.</P>
    <P>One can only deplore the utterances of the Minister when he talked about the CIF knowing how to build houses, when he said their experience was not in the construction of difficult and sophisticated plant and when he stated that they really should not be too <Col N="562" /> aggressive about it unless they had experience.  One can see that the Minister's experience before he became Minister was not in the construction business; otherwise he would not have made what was for a very intelligent man a foolish and intemperate remark.</P>
    <P>I submit that what NET have done is to ensure, to use their own words, that the best route has not been taken. Instead of advancing the date by which the plant will be commissioned, they have put back that date.  Perhaps the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary will answer the questions I asked before, namely, what is the penalty clause, what is the time clause?  Will it be rigidly adhered to?  The Parliamentary Secretary's statement that 90 per cent of the money will be spent in Ireland must be taken with a grain of salt.  The fees alone will take up almost all of the 10 per cent and they will be going out of the country.</P>
